9385,an undeveloped root system generally leads to low water utilization efficiency and decreases the yield in spring maize zea mays l little is known about whether changing the fertilization depth can optimize the root distribution to improve the water productivity and maize yield during 2019 and 2020 we conducted a field experiment with spring maize and applied the fertilizer at different soil depths of 0 05 m d5 0 15 m d15 0 25 m d25 and 0 35 m d35 to clarify the regulatory effects of the fertilization depth on the root distribution water productivity at the biomass level wpb and maize yield formation compared with d5 d25 significantly increased the root length density of the vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots in the 0 1 0 m soil depth by 18 14 and 24 respectively and the root surface area density increased by 39 17 and 22 compared with d5 d25 significantly increased the soil water consumption by 28 mm during the maize jointing to silking stage and reduced the soil water content in the 0 4 1 4 m soil depth at the maize silking stage d25 and d15 also significantly increased the root sap production rate and no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap compared with d5 and d35 after the maize silking stage the n uptake and nitrogen use efficiency under d25 were 17 and 39 higher respectively compared with d5 the water productivity at the grain yield and biomass level biomass and maize yield values under d25 were 23 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 45 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 24320 kg ha 1 and 12477 kg ha 1 respectively which were 10 12 13 and 14 higher compared with d5 the different fertilization depths explained 91 86 and 66 of the variations in the maize yield n uptake and total evapotranspiration respectively therefore deep fertilization at a suitable soil depth regulated the distribution of the root system which improved the capability of soil water and nitrogen utilization and eventually increased the water productivity and maize yield the most effective fertilizer depth was 0 25 m and it can be used as an effective water and fertilizer management strategy for the sustainable development of maize graphical abstract ga1 keywords deep fertilization rainfed area root sap water and fertilizer water consumption 1 introduction maize zea mays l is a major crop and the effective utilization of agricultural water and fertilizer is essential for stabilizing and improving yields and achieving sustainable agricultural development however in the dryland farming region of northern china a lack of water resources low precipitation and low soil water use efficiency wue have limited improvements in the maize yield to some extent moreover soil nutrients can readily flow from farmland by leaching into the soil in the form of nitrate nitrogen or entering the atmosphere by nh3 volatilization and as n2o emissions thereby resulting in environmental pollution li et al 2021a wu et al 2021 soil nutrient deficiencies caused by these losses further prevent increases in the maize yield thus there is an urgent need to improve water productivity and maize yields by regulating the soil nitrogen distribution in the soil while maintaining a safe ecological environment the morphological characteristics and temporal and spatial distributions of roots are critical for efficient soil water and nutrient use by crops thereby regulating plant development and influencing crop yields hodge 2004 liu et al 2017 however the roots in maize are mainly distributed in the 0 0 6 m soil depth under the traditional shallow fertilization strategy in northern china but soil nutrients are mainly located in the topsoil horizons thereby resulting in a mismatch between the available soil nutrients and root distribution guan et al 2015 furthermore the soil water in the deeper soil may not be used effectively due to the low density of maize roots in the 0 6 1 m soil depth wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 it is unclear whether optimizing the fertilization strategy can enhance the water productivity and maize yield by improving the spatial match between the roots and soil water distribution changes in the frequency and rate of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application can reportedly improve the density and architecture of the roots in maize feng et al 2016 niu et al 2020 ma et al 2013 jia et al 2020 in addition phosphate fertilizer can promote root development and increase the root numbers ma et al 2013 some studies have also shown that the fertilizer application rate significantly affects root growth in maize jia et al 2020 thereby suggesting that maize root growth and development can be regulated by fertilization various fertilization methods can also have different effects on the use of water and fertilizer by crops applying fertilizer by broadcasting leads to an imbalance between the crop fertilizer demand and soil fertilizer supply adviento borbe and linquist 2016 thereby resulting in a low nitrogen use efficiency nue 19 33 nishimura et al 2012 by contrast shallow or deep band fertilization can improve the crop yield compared with broadcasting mclaughlin et al 2011 farmaha et al 2012 nkebiwe et al 2016 chaudhary and prihar 1974 many studies have shown that deep fertilizer placement increases the crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency trapeznikov et al 2003 cheng et al 202 su et al 2015 but some found no significant difference compared with broadcasting followed by incorporation szulc et al 2020 other studies have shown that deep fertilizer placement can increase the grain yield roger et al 1980 shiga et al 1977 but the effects may vary due to differences in the soil texture climate and management practices throughout the world therefore a single application of fertilizer is the usual practice of farmers but the fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield can be improved by using different fertilization depths under the band fertilization method at present many farmers in china apply fertilizer directly on the surface soil and incorporate it with a rotary cultivator to a depth of about 0 05 m the location where fertilizer is applied can effectively regulate the spatial distribution of the root system in the soil layer alternately applying nitrogen to one of the neighboring two furrows or to all furrows increases the root weight density more than applying nitrogen to one of every two furrows under the ridge furrow mulching system qi et al 2019 the fertilizer band method can also improve root growth compared with broadcasting especially the lateral root distribution li et al 2021b farmaha et al 2012 it is well known that rainfall and fertilizer move vertically over time in farmland dong et al 2019 thus the vertical distribution of maize roots might be regulated by changing the fertilization depth to effectively utilize water and fertilizer resources in the soil and improve the crop yield in addition the relationships between the fertilization location and root distribution as well as those among the root architecture and water and fertilizer utilization in maize require further elucidation we hypothesized that changing the fertilization depth could regulate the soil nutrient distribution to induce root growth and improve the spatial match between roots and soil water thereby enhancing the absorption of soil water and maize physiological function and eventually improving the utilization of resources to increase the maize yield therefore we conducted a field experiment to test the effects of fertilization at different soil depths in north china the aims of this study were as follows 1 to clarify the effects of deep fertilization at different soil depths on the root distribution root growth and soil water content swc 2 to explore the responses in terms of the soil water productivity fertilizer utilization efficiency and maize yield to different fertilization depths 3 to determine the suitable fertilization depth for the north of china and 4 to elucidate the mechanisms that allow different fertilization depths to regulate maize yield formation and the water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency thus we aimed to promote the efficient utilization of water and nitrogen resources to obtain sustainable yield increases in maize by optimizing the fertilizer application depth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site spring maize field experiments were conducted to test the effects of different fertilizer application depths in two continuous growing seasons during 2019 and 2020 at cao xin zhuang experimental farm northwest agricultural and forest university shaanxi province china at an altitude of 521 m the experimental site is located at a longitude of 34 17 59 n and latitude of 108 4 12 e the study area has a warm temperature and monsoon climate and the climate is defined as semi humid but drought prone the soil type in this area is classified as alfisols with one or more horizons within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface and aquic conditions for some time during normal years anon 2014 the soil texture is silty clay loam 1 sand 72 silt 27 clay usda soil taxonomy in the 0 40 cm soil depth fig 1 shows the daily temperature and precipitation in the maize growing and fallow seasons during 2019 and 2020 over the last 20 years the mean annual air temperature precipitation sunshine and duration of the frost free period were 13 c 630 mm 2463 8 h and 210 days respectively at the experimental site the groundwater level was around 80 m below the soil surface table 1 shows the basic soil properties before the experiment 2 2 experimental design and field practices three replicates of each treatment were prepared according to a randomized block design the experimental site comprised 15 plots 3 replicates 5 treatments each with an area of 42 m2 the length of each plot was 7 m and the width was 6 6 m eleven rows were prepared in each plot the experimental field was flat and each plot was surrounded by border ridges all of the urea and superphosphate were placed below the surface at the following soil depths 0 05 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m which were denoted as d5 d15 d25 and d35 respectively we also prepared a plot without any fertilizer to measure the nue n n 46 urea was applied at a rate of 225 kg n ha 1 and p2o5 p2o5 12 superphosphate at 120 kg p ha 1 the local soil has a high potassium content so it was not necessary to apply potassium fertilizer before commencing the experiment the soil at the site was loosened with a deep loosening machine to a depth of 0 4 m and all of the n p fertilizer was applied by hand at the required depth in the manually ditched band the deep loosening machine was manufactured by nonghaha type specification 1s 220 hebei china the soil was manually excavated to a specific depth with a spade and the soil depth was measured and controlled with a ruler before the fertilized was applied in the soil band the soil was then back filled in situ the maize variety zhengdan 958 was planted on the flat plot maize seeds were sown on april 15 2019 and may 4 2020 and the harvests were conducted on september 8 2019 and september 24 2020 the sowing rate corresponding to 75 000 maize plant per hectare in the experimental field and two maize seeds were placed in one hole at sowing before thinning to one plant at the three leaf stage the fertilization band was placed below the area where rows of maize were planted and the maize seeds were sown at a depth of about 3 4 cm the distance between two plants in the same row and the distance between two rows were 0 222 m and 0 6 m respectively the fields were managed in the same manner as other local fields in terms of weeding disease control pest control and other practices no irrigation was applied and straw was removed after harvesting spring maize was planted at the study site before our experiment commenced but the soil nutrient levels were balanced and the previous crop did not influence our experiment irrigation was not applied during the whole maize growing season in 2019 2020 and all of the water used came from natural precipitation the precipitation amounts during the maize growing seasons were 485 8 and 585 1 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil sampling and calculations before sowing during the maize silking stage and after the harvest soil samples were collected n 3 from the 0 2 m soil layer between two plants using a stainless steel auger 0 05 m diameter the five point sampling method was adopted and the sampling cores were inserted manually yu et al 2020 one soil sample was collected every 0 1 m at depths from 0 to 0 4 m and one soil sample was collected every 0 2 m at depths from 0 4 to 2 0 m the three soil samples collected at each depth from a plot were mixed to obtain a single sample the soil samples were tested to determine the gravimetric soil water content swc and soil water storage sws using the drying method jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 yu et al 2020 the soil samples were placed into a dry aluminum box and heated in a constant temperature oven at 105 c until the weight of the soil sample did not change the gravimetric water content of the soil sample was then calculated swc and sws were calculated as follows yu et al 2020 1 swc soil wet weight soil dry weight soil dry weight 100 2 sws i n swc i bd i h i 10 where swc is the gravimetric soil water content sws mm is the soil water storage and bd i g cm 3 is the soil bulk density in eq 2 h i cm is the soil profile and n refers to the number of the soil profile i 1 2 12 no runoff or drainage occurred at the study site during the experimental period the crop total evapotranspiration loss et mm was estimated using the soil water balance equation as follows wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 3 et w 1 w 2 p d r where et indicates the evapotranspiration mm w 1 mm and w 2 represent the soil water storage 0 2 0 m before maize sowing and after the harvest respectively p mm is the precipitation during the growth period d mm is the drainage below the measured root zone and r mm is the surface runoff however the groundwater level was approximately 80 m below the soil surface and thus the flow of groundwater to the roots could be neglected zhang et al 2020 moreover d was assumed to be zero because of the depth at which the soil was measured 2 0 m and the soil had a high water holding capacity we assumed that no runoff occurred during the experimental period because the field was flat and each plot was surrounded by border ridges wp g was calculated as follows 4 wp g y et where wp g kg ha 1 mm 1 is the water productivity at the grain yield level and y kg ha 1 is the crop grain yield zhang et al 2020 the crop water evapotranspiration et and crop water productivity at the biomass level wp b were determined during different maize growing stages using eqs 5 and 6 5 et p i s w i 6 wp b biomass et where et p i and s w i are the crop evapotranspiration precipitation and soil water storage changes during stage i respectively wpb kg ha 1 mm 1 is the crop water productivity at the biomass level biomass kg ha 1 is the difference in the crop dry biomass between two growing stages and et mm is the difference in the water evapotranspiration between two growing stages 2 3 2 root sampling root length and surface area measurements we collected samples comprising the soil and roots using a stainless tube diameter of 0 09 m from each plot at the maize silking stage the soil root columns were collected from three separate locations hu et al 2020 vertical roots a inter row roots b and within row roots c as shown in fig 2 each soil sample was collected from undisturbed soil at intervals of 0 1 m over the soil depth from 0 to 1 0 m jia et al 2018 each soil root sample was soaked in a bucket filled with water for 12 h to separate the roots from the soil the soil root sample was then placed in a sieve with a mesh size of 0 15 mm rinsed slowly with clean water until the soil was completely removed and the clean roots were collected without soil staining was conducted to separate the live roots from dead organic matter the fresh roots were immersed in triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc working solution and incubated in the dark the live roots were dyed red but the dead roots did not change color gregory 1994 guan et al 2015 the live roots were scanned using the win rhizo root analysis system epson v700 win rhizo was then used to analyze the data guan et al 2014 we determined the total root length and surface area at different soil depths according to the root length and root surface area results produced by win rhizo we calculated the total root length m plant 1 and surface area cm plant 1 for vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots the root length density rld and root surface area density rsd were then calculated using the following equations jia et al 2018 7 rld root length soil volume 8 rsd root surface area soil volume 2 3 3 root sap collection root sap was collected at the maize jointing stage silking stage filling stage and maturity stage using degreasing cotton which can absorb water rapidly wang et al 2019 the maize stem was cut at 0 1 m above the soil surface on the first day at 18 00 we placed degreasing cotton on the stem to absorb the root sap and tied it tightly to prevent the flow of root sap into the soil we collected the degreasing cotton on the next day at 6 00 the root sap production rate per unit time was determined according to yang et al 2002 the degreasing cotton was placed in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min before collecting the supernatant next 1 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and 9 ml of distilled water was added to dilute the root sap by 10 times after filtering and diluting the root sap 10 times the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in the root sap were measured using an auto analyzer autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal germany 2 3 4 determination of biomass and nitrogen uptake we collected three maize plants from each plot at the seeding jointing silking and filling stages and at maturity we separated the plants into stems leaves sheaths and grains before drying to a constant weight at 80 c to calculate the accumulated biomass after drying the samples were crushed and passed through a 100 mesh sieve to determine the nitrogen concentration in different parts of the plant wu et al 2021 and to calculate the total nitrogen uptake by each plant papakosta and gagianas 1991 kyuma et al 2006 2 3 5 maize yield measurement we harvested four rows of maize 5 m length from every harvested row in the experimental plot with three replicates for every treatment the maize yield was measured at a grain moisture content of 14 and the grain yield at maturity was calculated 2 4 statistical analysis residual tests were performed for all data before analysis all data satisfied the homogeneity of variance hypothesis and followed a normal distribution we used spss 19 0 to analyze the data multiple comparisons between different treatments were performed using the least significant difference test p 0 05 n 3 all figures were drawn with originlab 2020 northampton ma usa we conducted structural equation modeling with amos 24 0 to examine the relationships between the roots soil water and nutrients we selected the best model with statistical significance for path construction amos is a structural equation modeling sem program based on standard multivariate analysis methods including regression factor analysis correlation and analysis of variance before establishing the structural equation model it was necessary to set the initial model establish the causal relationship between variables in a path graph according to existing theoretical knowledge or practical experience the observed variables were then entered into the initial model and the model parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method finally direct causality and or indirect causality between variables was determined based on the initial model or revised model that fitted well with the sample data the path coefficient represents the direction and intensity of the linear relationship between latent variables and r2 represents the percentage of the variation explained by other variables 3 results 3 1 effect of deep fertilization on maize root distribution 3 1 1 root length and rld compared with d5 the vertical root length inter row root

et 4 discussion 4 1 effects of deep fertilization on maize root growth and distribution we measured the maize root distribution and found that the root depth reached up to 1 0 m which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2019 similar to a previous study zhang et al 2021 we showed that the maize roots could obtain nutrients and water down to a soil depth of 1 0 m lateral root proliferation is the main feature of root growth in nitrogen rich and phosphorus rich soils robinson 2002 in our study growth of the vertical roots was significantly promoted in the 0 1 0 m soil depth by applying mixed strips of nitrogen and phosphorus at different depths the root system is fertilizer oriented and when nitrogen is deficient in a field the root system will search for nitrogen to meet the required demand by increasing its length and surface area liu et al 2017 rld and rsd are essential parameters for characterizing root development guan et al 2015 the lower soil nitrogen concentrations between the rows induced the roots to explore to find nitrogen to facilitate lateral root development which explains why rld and rsd were significantly higher for the roots between rows under d25 than d5 fenn et al 2013 we found that rld and rsd in the 0 3 0 9 m soil depth were significantly higher under d15 d25 and d35 than d5 due to the higher no3 n concentration in the soil layer below 0 4 m under d15 d25 and d35 therefore the higher soil no3 n concentration could have promoted root growth thus deep fertilization at a suitable depth can promote the strong growth of roots near the nitrogen supply trapeznikov et al 2003 however a lack of available nitrogen leads to the root length increasing in the non fertilizer strip to search for nutrients for absorption and utilization su et al 2015 these processes govern root development and shape the ideal root architecture arkoun et al 2012 the temporal and spatial distributions of roots determine the temporal and spatial differences in the absorption of soil nutrients and water by crops to a certain extent ali et al 2019 in our study a fertilization depth of 0 15 0 25 m significantly promoted the proliferation of lateral roots in maize the roots developed in the vertical location under d15 and d25 and they absorbed more soil water and nutrients in addition the greater amounts of water and nutrients absorbed by the vertical root were stored in the plants to enhance lateral root growth ma et al 2013 4 2 responses of root sap and nitrogen use to deep fertilization the ability of roots to absorb water and nutrients can be reflected by the root sap production rate which is positively correlated with root growth ansari et al 2004 the root sap production rate results indicate that the maize roots treated by shallow fertilizer application had higher water and nutrient transport capacities at the early growth stage after the silking stage the nutrient and water transport capacities were greater under d25 and the root sap production rate at the early stage was significantly lower under d35 than d5 no significant differences were found in the later stage between d35 and d5 probably because the root system was shallow at the early stage shallow nutrients were mainly absorbed under d5 but lower amounts of water and nutrients were absorbed under d35 due to the distance between the root system and the location of the fertilizer however more soil water and nutrients were absorbed at the later stage under d35 which enhanced the root sap production due to the compensating effect of root growth under d35 finally there was no significant difference in the root sap production rate at the later stage under d5 and d35 the root sap production rate was significantly positively correlated with the root length root surface area and root quality for vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots table 8 thereby indicating that the root sap production rate could reflect the growth of the root system these results are consistent with a previous demonstration that the root sap production rate can reflect the physiological activity of root systems liang et al 2020 ansari et al 2004 the nutrient concentrations in the root sap indicate the nutrients absorbed by plants liang et al 2020 noguchi et al 2005 we found that the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap were significantly higher under d15 and d5 than the other treatments at the jointing stage growth occurred more rapidly under d5 and d15 than d25 at the early stage because more soil nutrients and water could be obtained under d5 and d15 than d25 cheng et al 2020 however the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap were significantly higher under d25 and d15 than d5 and d35 at the silking filling and maturity stages the maize roots were well developed under d25 and the greater root length and root surface area allowed the absorption of more soil nutrients and water to support growth however we did not measure the nitrogen concentration in the root sap at the v12 stage but we consider that the nitrogen concentration may have been higher at the v12 stage than the other growth stages because maize growth was most vigorous at the v12 stage according to the root sap production rate and no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap the root system developed slowly during the early stage as the fertilizer placement depth increased however there was a compensation effect when the root system reached the fertilization soil layer lu et al 2018 thereby promoting the rapid growth of the root system at the later stage the root sap production rate nitrogen concentration in the root sap dry matter accumulation plant height and other agronomic characters responded strongly possibly due to the difficulty absorbing nitrogen from the soil at the early stage under d35 and the root development was weaker compared with the other treatments the compensation effect promoted growth when the roots came into contact with the fertilizer at the later stage but root development was still greater under the other treatments this growth regulation strategy is based on the metabolic cost of root formation cabal et al 2020 therefore the root sap production rate and nitrogen concentration were lower throughout the growth process than those under d5 deep fertilization at different soil depths can affect the maize yield by adjusting the root sap production rate and nutrient concentrations the growth of roots underground is closely related to the growth of stems above ground tian et al 2006 the developed root architecture plays a vital role in absorbing nutrients wang et al 2004 in this study the rld and rsd values for the vertical inter row and within row roots were greater under d25 and d15 thereby allowing the root system to absorb nutrients and water from the soil clearly roots are crucial for connecting water and nutrients in the soil and in plants and their development directly affects the absorption of water and nutrients chen et al 2014 better developed roots have a positive effect on crop growth the significant correlations between the nitrogen concentration in the root sap nitrogen accumulation and yield also demonstrated the importance of the root system for controlling maize growth table 8 xie et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the established root system is most vigorous at the maize silking stage at this stage indexes such as the root length and root surface area are positively correlated with indexes including the yield and plant nitrogen accumulation at the harvest stage liedgens and richner 2001 we obtained similar results table 8 the nue values during 2019 and 2020 were 44 and 43 respectively but only 33 and 31 under d5 table 7 thereby indicating that changing the fertilization depth was effective at controlling the accumulation of nitrogen and nue in plants previous studies also showed that deep fertilization improved the fertilizer utilization efficiency su et al 2015 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2018 nash et al 2013 the nue values were higher under d15 and d25 because the losses of gaseous nitrogen as nh3 and n2o under d5 were significantly reduced when the fertilization depth was 0 15 0 25 m wu et al 2021 4 3 effect of deep fertilization on soil water use the growth and development of crop roots are closely related to soil moisture which directly influences the absorption of water and nutrients to indirectly affect crop productivity wang et al 2019 gong et al 2020 a higher swc contributes to the growth of roots to promote the absorption of soil water we found that the swc values under d25 and d15 in the 0 4 1 4 m soil depth were significantly lower than those under the other treatments during 2019 and 2020 mainly because the root system was established at the maize silking stage and it absorbed large amounts of soil moisture and nutrients from maize jointing to silking stage therefore the soil moisture content decreased at the silking stage the structural equation model showed that the growth and distribution of the roots increased the crop water consumption previous studies have shown that an appropriate soil water deficit allows the roots to search for water in the soil to meet plant developmental needs shi et al 2020 elhani et al 2019 however excessive soil water will cause oxygen deprivation reduce the root growth rate and lead to root aging or death eapen et al 2005 in the present study the rainfall mainly occurred in july and august at the study site and thus a large amount of rainfall after the silking stage increased the water consumed for root growth to meet the water and nutrient demands of the mature roots after the silking stage jia et al 2020 the death of roots is affected by many factors such as natural death nutrient and water deficiencies and oxygen deprivation jia et al 2018 therefore we found that the swc in the 0 4 0 8 m soil depth was slightly lower under d25 than the other treatments at maturity thereby indicating that the root system could still absorb a large amount of water after the silking stage under d25 maize plants enter the reproductive growth stage after the silking stage where they consume large amounts of water thereby leading to the low soil water content at the maturity stage jia et al 2018 the amounts of rainfall in july and august were lower during 2019 than 2020 thus the swc values in different soil layers at maturity were lower during 2019 than 2020 the swc in the 1 0 1 2 m soil layer appeared to have an inflection point at crop maturity during 2019 the root system may have mainly absorbed and utilized the water in the 0 1 0 m soil layer at the later stage and the root system absorbed little of the water in the soil layer below 1 0 m zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 a well developed root system significantly improves the soil wpg wang et al 2019 a previous study showed that water is no longer the limiting factor for crop growth and senescence when the precipitation exceeds 440 mm during the maize growth stage ren et al 2008 in the present study the precipitation amounts during the maize growth periods in 2019 and 2020 were 485 8 mm and 585 1 mm respectively and thus water was not the limiting factor for maize growth previous studies showed that changes in the crop field water consumption patterns during growth stages can affect the crop biomass accumulation zhang et al 2020 the increase in the biomass under d25 during the jointing to silking stage was accompanied by an increase in water evapotranspiration table 6 a previous study showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the crop biomass and grain yield qi and pan 2021 which is consistent with our results some studies also showed that the water productivity changed according to the changes in evapotranspiration and biomass accumulation during different crop growth stages wang et al 2021 and our results are consistent with this pattern d25 obtained the highest biomass and grain yield thus the wpg and wpb increased significantly when the fertilization depth was 0 25 or 0 15 m and the wpg was highest under d25 4 4 maize yield determination of appropriate fertilizer placement depth and potential adaptation many factors can influence the grain yield such as various nutrients diseases insect damage sunlight availability soil erosion tillage planting density drought and flooding the crop yield is closely related to the degree of root development casper and jackson 1997 the spatial distribution of the roots has important effects on the maize yield barber and mackay 1986 increasing the number of plant roots helps to enhance the absorption of nitrate and water morris et al 2017 we found that a fertilization depth of 0 25 m was most suitable because it promoted the growth and distribution of vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots and significantly increased the root sap production rate and no3 n and nh4 n concentrations to promote the accumulation of nitrogen in the aboveground plant parts as well as improving the wpg and maize yield thus adjusting the root distribution and growth by changing the fertilization depth is effective for promoting the efficient use of water and fertilizer to increase the maize yield according to our analyses of root growth nutrient absorption and the grain yield 0 25 m was determined as the most suitable depth for deep fertilizer application we also found that d25 obtained the highest economic benefits among all of the treatments followed by d15 and thus farmers will obtain higher economic benefits if they apply all of the fertilizer at a soil depth of 0 25 m before sowing the deep fertilization method requires a high mechanical power input therefore we must carefully consider whether deep fertilizer application will be accepted and used by farmers before promoting this technique when agricultural machinery is undeveloped deep fertilizer application will be difficult to accept because the accessible machinery cannot meet the needs of the correct fertilization strategy nevertheless agricultural machinery is developing and it can the meet fertilization needs throughout the world patuk et al 2020 so farmers may accept this strategy to some extent however as the fertilization depth increases more diesel must be used in the mechanical operation process liu et al 2020 which will increase the cost of fertilization and this is a major concern for farmers therefore we suggest that the government should consider increasing planting subsidies for farmers and promoting this technique to increase enthusiasm among farmers therefore deep fertilization at a soil depth of 0 15 m is more feasible in actual operation we consider that the further development of fertilization machinery will facilitate the placement of a fertilizer band at a depth of 0 25 m with broad application prospects in the future cheng et al 2020 5 conclusions changing the fertilization location to suitable soil depths can regulate growth and development of the root system thereby enhancing the root distribution and growth especially lateral roots and increase rld and rsd in this study deep fertilization improved the balance between the water and nutrients available to the root system in the soil layer to enhance their uptake thereby enhancing the root sap production rate and nitrogen concentration in the root sap and the transport of water and nutrients to the aboveground plant parts which increased the biomass maize yield wpg wpb and nue d25 had more evident effects on the water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and maize yield than other treatments the results obtained in our study can further clarify the relationships between soil water nutrients root growth and nutrient uptake and provide a reference to improve the efficient utilization of water and fertilizer therefore changing the fertilization depth to 0 25 m is an effective fertilizer and water management strategy for the sustainable development of maize in the loess plateau region of china and it may contribute to ensuring future food security the mechanism associated with the regulation of root development and growth according to the fertilizer placement position requires further study

9385,an undeveloped root system generally leads to low water utilization efficiency and decreases the yield in spring maize zea mays l little is known about whether changing the fertilization depth can optimize the root distribution to improve the water productivity and maize yield during 2019 and 2020 we conducted a field experiment with spring maize and applied the fertilizer at different soil depths of 0 05 m d5 0 15 m d15 0 25 m d25 and 0 35 m d35 to clarify the regulatory effects of the fertilization depth on the root distribution water productivity at the biomass level wpb and maize yield formation compared with d5 d25 significantly increased the root length density of the vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots in the 0 1 0 m soil depth by 18 14 and 24 respectively and the root surface area density increased by 39 17 and 22 compared with d5 d25 significantly increased the soil water consumption by 28 mm during the maize jointing to silking stage and reduced the soil water content in the 0 4 1 4 m soil depth at the maize silking stage d25 and d15 also significantly increased the root sap production rate and no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap compared with d5 and d35 after the maize silking stage the n uptake and nitrogen use efficiency under d25 were 17 and 39 higher respectively compared with d5 the water productivity at the grain yield and biomass level biomass and maize yield values under d25 were 23 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 45 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 24320 kg ha 1 and 12477 kg ha 1 respectively which were 10 12 13 and 14 higher compared with d5 the different fertilization depths explained 91 86 and 66 of the variations in the maize yield n uptake and total evapotranspiration respectively therefore deep fertilization at a suitable soil depth regulated the distribution of the root system which improved the capability of soil water and nitrogen utilization and eventually increased the water productivity and maize yield the most effective fertilizer depth was 0 25 m and it can be used as an effective water and fertilizer management strategy for the sustainable development of maize graphical abstract ga1 keywords deep fertilization rainfed area root sap water and fertilizer water consumption 1 introduction maize zea mays l is a major crop and the effective utilization of agricultural water and fertilizer is essential for stabilizing and improving yields and achieving sustainable agricultural development however in the dryland farming region of northern china a lack of water resources low precipitation and low soil water use efficiency wue have limited improvements in the maize yield to some extent moreover soil nutrients can readily flow from farmland by leaching into the soil in the form of nitrate nitrogen or entering the atmosphere by nh3 volatilization and as n2o emissions thereby resulting in environmental pollution li et al 2021a wu et al 2021 soil nutrient deficiencies caused by these losses further prevent increases in the maize yield thus there is an urgent need to improve water productivity and maize yields by regulating the soil nitrogen distribution in the soil while maintaining a safe ecological environment the morphological characteristics and temporal and spatial distributions of roots are critical for efficient soil water and nutrient use by crops thereby regulating plant development and influencing crop yields hodge 2004 liu et al 2017 however the roots in maize are mainly distributed in the 0 0 6 m soil depth under the traditional shallow fertilization strategy in northern china but soil nutrients are mainly located in the topsoil horizons thereby resulting in a mismatch between the available soil nutrients and root distribution guan et al 2015 furthermore the soil water in the deeper soil may not be used effectively due to the low density of maize roots in the 0 6 1 m soil depth wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 it is unclear whether optimizing the fertilization strategy can enhance the water productivity and maize yield by improving the spatial match between the roots and soil water distribution changes in the frequency and rate of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application can reportedly improve the density and architecture of the roots in maize feng et al 2016 niu et al 2020 ma et al 2013 jia et al 2020 in addition phosphate fertilizer can promote root development and increase the root numbers ma et al 2013 some studies have also shown that the fertilizer application rate significantly affects root growth in maize jia et al 2020 thereby suggesting that maize root growth and development can be regulated by fertilization various fertilization methods can also have different effects on the use of water and fertilizer by crops applying fertilizer by broadcasting leads to an imbalance between the crop fertilizer demand and soil fertilizer supply adviento borbe and linquist 2016 thereby resulting in a low nitrogen use efficiency nue 19 33 nishimura et al 2012 by contrast shallow or deep band fertilization can improve the crop yield compared with broadcasting mclaughlin et al 2011 farmaha et al 2012 nkebiwe et al 2016 chaudhary and prihar 1974 many studies have shown that deep fertilizer placement increases the crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency trapeznikov et al 2003 cheng et al 202 su et al 2015 but some found no significant difference compared with broadcasting followed by incorporation szulc et al 2020 other studies have shown that deep fertilizer placement can increase the grain yield roger et al 1980 shiga et al 1977 but the effects may vary due to differences in the soil texture climate and management practices throughout the world therefore a single application of fertilizer is the usual practice of farmers but the fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield can be improved by using different fertilization depths under the band fertilization method at present many farmers in china apply fertilizer directly on the surface soil and incorporate it with a rotary cultivator to a depth of about 0 05 m the location where fertilizer is applied can effectively regulate the spatial distribution of the root system in the soil layer alternately applying nitrogen to one of the neighboring two furrows or to all furrows increases the root weight density more than applying nitrogen to one of every two furrows under the ridge furrow mulching system qi et al 2019 the fertilizer band method can also improve root growth compared with broadcasting especially the lateral root distribution li et al 2021b farmaha et al 2012 it is well known that rainfall and fertilizer move vertically over time in farmland dong et al 2019 thus the vertical distribution of maize roots might be regulated by changing the fertilization depth to effectively utilize water and fertilizer resources in the soil and improve the crop yield in addition the relationships between the fertilization location and root distribution as well as those among the root architecture and water and fertilizer utilization in maize require further elucidation we hypothesized that changing the fertilization depth could regulate the soil nutrient distribution to induce root growth and improve the spatial match between roots and soil water thereby enhancing the absorption of soil water and maize physiological function and eventually improving the utilization of resources to increase the maize yield therefore we conducted a field experiment to test the effects of fertilization at different soil depths in north china the aims of this study were as follows 1 to clarify the effects of deep fertilization at different soil depths on the root distribution root growth and soil water content swc 2 to explore the responses in terms of the soil water productivity fertilizer utilization efficiency and maize yield to different fertilization depths 3 to determine the suitable fertilization depth for the north of china and 4 to elucidate the mechanisms that allow different fertilization depths to regulate maize yield formation and the water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency thus we aimed to promote the efficient utilization of water and nitrogen resources to obtain sustainable yield increases in maize by optimizing the fertilizer application depth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site spring maize field experiments were conducted to test the effects of different fertilizer application depths in two continuous growing seasons during 2019 and 2020 at cao xin zhuang experimental farm northwest agricultural and forest university shaanxi province china at an altitude of 521 m the experimental site is located at a longitude of 34 17 59 n and latitude of 108 4 12 e the study area has a warm temperature and monsoon climate and the climate is defined as semi humid but drought prone the soil type in this area is classified as alfisols with one or more horizons within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface and aquic conditions for some time during normal years anon 2014 the soil texture is silty clay loam 1 sand 72 silt 27 clay usda soil taxonomy in the 0 40 cm soil depth fig 1 shows the daily temperature and precipitation in the maize growing and fallow seasons during 2019 and 2020 over the last 20 years the mean annual air temperature precipitation sunshine and duration of the frost free period were 13 c 630 mm 2463 8 h and 210 days respectively at the experimental site the groundwater level was around 80 m below the soil surface table 1 shows the basic soil properties before the experiment 2 2 experimental design and field practices three replicates of each treatment were prepared according to a randomized block design the experimental site comprised 15 plots 3 replicates 5 treatments each with an area of 42 m2 the length of each plot was 7 m and the width was 6 6 m eleven rows were prepared in each plot the experimental field was flat and each plot was surrounded by border ridges all of the urea and superphosphate were placed below the surface at the following soil depths 0 05 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m which were denoted as d5 d15 d25 and d35 respectively we also prepared a plot without any fertilizer to measure the nue n n 46 urea was applied at a rate of 225 kg n ha 1 and p2o5 p2o5 12 superphosphate at 120 kg p ha 1 the local soil has a high potassium content so it was not necessary to apply potassium fertilizer before commencing the experiment the soil at the site was loosened with a deep loosening machine to a depth of 0 4 m and all of the n p fertilizer was applied by hand at the required depth in the manually ditched band the deep loosening machine was manufactured by nonghaha type specification 1s 220 hebei china the soil was manually excavated to a specific depth with a spade and the soil depth was measured and controlled with a ruler before the fertilized was applied in the soil band the soil was then back filled in situ the maize variety zhengdan 958 was planted on the flat plot maize seeds were sown on april 15 2019 and may 4 2020 and the harvests were conducted on september 8 2019 and september 24 2020 the sowing rate corresponding to 75 000 maize plant per hectare in the experimental field and two maize seeds were placed in one hole at sowing before thinning to one plant at the three leaf stage the fertilization band was placed below the area where rows of maize were planted and the maize seeds were sown at a depth of about 3 4 cm the distance between two plants in the same row and the distance between two rows were 0 222 m and 0 6 m respectively the fields were managed in the same manner as other local fields in terms of weeding disease control pest control and other practices no irrigation was applied and straw was removed after harvesting spring maize was planted at the study site before our experiment commenced but the soil nutrient levels were balanced and the previous crop did not influence our experiment irrigation was not applied during the whole maize growing season in 2019 2020 and all of the water used came from natural precipitation the precipitation amounts during the maize growing seasons were 485 8 and 585 1 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil sampling and calculations before sowing during the maize silking stage and after the harvest soil samples were collected n 3 from the 0 2 m soil layer between two plants using a stainless steel auger 0 05 m diameter the five point sampling method was adopted and the sampling cores were inserted manually yu et al 2020 one soil sample was collected every 0 1 m at depths from 0 to 0 4 m and one soil sample was collected every 0 2 m at depths from 0 4 to 2 0 m the three soil samples collected at each depth from a plot were mixed to obtain a single sample the soil samples were tested to determine the gravimetric soil water content swc and soil water storage sws using the drying method jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 yu et al 2020 the soil samples were placed into a dry aluminum box and heated in a constant temperature oven at 105 c until the weight of the soil sample did not change the gravimetric water content of the soil sample was then calculated swc and sws were calculated as follows yu et al 2020 1 swc soil wet weight soil dry weight soil dry weight 100 2 sws i n swc i bd i h i 10 where swc is the gravimetric soil water content sws mm is the soil water storage and bd i g cm 3 is the soil bulk density in eq 2 h i cm is the soil profile and n refers to the number of the soil profile i 1 2 12 no runoff or drainage occurred at the study site during the experimental period the crop total evapotranspiration loss et mm was estimated using the soil water balance equation as follows wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 3 et w 1 w 2 p d r where et indicates the evapotranspiration mm w 1 mm and w 2 represent the soil water storage 0 2 0 m before maize sowing and after the harvest respectively p mm is the precipitation during the growth period d mm is the drainage below the measured root zone and r mm is the surface runoff however the groundwater level was approximately 80 m below the soil surface and thus the flow of groundwater to the roots could be neglected zhang et al 2020 moreover d was assumed to be zero because of the depth at which the soil was measured 2 0 m and the soil had a high water holding capacity we assumed that no runoff occurred during the experimental period because the field was flat and each plot was surrounded by border ridges wp g was calculated as follows 4 wp g y et where wp g kg ha 1 mm 1 is the water productivity at the grain yield level and y kg ha 1 is the crop grain yield zhang et al 2020 the crop water evapotranspiration et and crop water productivity at the biomass level wp b were determined during different maize growing stages using eqs 5 and 6 5 et p i s w i 6 wp b biomass et where et p i and s w i are the crop evapotranspiration precipitation and soil water storage changes during stage i respectively wpb kg ha 1 mm 1 is the crop water productivity at the biomass level biomass kg ha 1 is the difference in the crop dry biomass between two growing stages and et mm is the difference in the water evapotranspiration between two growing stages 2 3 2 root sampling root length and surface area measurements we collected samples comprising the soil and roots using a stainless tube diameter of 0 09 m from each plot at the maize silking stage the soil root columns were collected from three separate locations hu et al 2020 vertical roots a inter row roots b and within row roots c as shown in fig 2 each soil sample was collected from undisturbed soil at intervals of 0 1 m over the soil depth from 0 to 1 0 m jia et al 2018 each soil root sample was soaked in a bucket filled with water for 12 h to separate the roots from the soil the soil root sample was then placed in a sieve with a mesh size of 0 15 mm rinsed slowly with clean water until the soil was completely removed and the clean roots were collected without soil staining was conducted to separate the live roots from dead organic matter the fresh roots were immersed in triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc working solution and incubated in the dark the live roots were dyed red but the dead roots did not change color gregory 1994 guan et al 2015 the live roots were scanned using the win rhizo root analysis system epson v700 win rhizo was then used to analyze the data guan et al 2014 we determined the total root length and surface area at different soil depths according to the root length and root surface area results produced by win rhizo we calculated the total root length m plant 1 and surface area cm plant 1 for vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots the root length density rld and root surface area density rsd were then calculated using the following equations jia et al 2018 7 rld root length soil volume 8 rsd root surface area soil volume 2 3 3 root sap collection root sap was collected at the maize jointing stage silking stage filling stage and maturity stage using degreasing cotton which can absorb water rapidly wang et al 2019 the maize stem was cut at 0 1 m above the soil surface on the first day at 18 00 we placed degreasing cotton on the stem to absorb the root sap and tied it tightly to prevent the flow of root sap into the soil we collected the degreasing cotton on the next day at 6 00 the root sap production rate per unit time was determined according to yang et al 2002 the degreasing cotton was placed in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min before collecting the supernatant next 1 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and 9 ml of distilled water was added to dilute the root sap by 10 times after filtering and diluting the root sap 10 times the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in the root sap were measured using an auto analyzer autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal germany 2 3 4 determination of biomass and nitrogen uptake we collected three maize plants from each plot at the seeding jointing silking and filling stages and at maturity we separated the plants into stems leaves sheaths and grains before drying to a constant weight at 80 c to calculate the accumulated biomass after drying the samples were crushed and passed through a 100 mesh sieve to determine the nitrogen concentration in different parts of the plant wu et al 2021 and to calculate the total nitrogen uptake by each plant papakosta and gagianas 1991 kyuma et al 2006 2 3 5 maize yield measurement we harvested four rows of maize 5 m length from every harvested row in the experimental plot with three replicates for every treatment the maize yield was measured at a grain moisture content of 14 and the grain yield at maturity was calculated 2 4 statistical analysis residual tests were performed for all data before analysis all data satisfied the homogeneity of variance hypothesis and followed a normal distribution we used spss 19 0 to analyze the data multiple comparisons between different treatments were performed using the least significant difference test p 0 05 n 3 all figures were drawn with originlab 2020 northampton ma usa we conducted structural equation modeling with amos 24 0 to examine the relationships between the roots soil water and nutrients we selected the best model with statistical significance for path construction amos is a structural equation modeling sem program based on standard multivariate analysis methods including regression factor analysis correlation and analysis of variance before establishing the structural equation model it was necessary to set the initial model establish the causal relationship between variables in a path graph according to existing theoretical knowledge or practical experience the observed variables were then entered into the initial model and the model parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method finally direct causality and or indirect causality between variables was determined based on the initial model or revised model that fitted well with the sample data the path coefficient represents the direction and intensity of the linear relationship between latent variables and r2 represents the percentage of the variation explained by other variables 3 results 3 1 effect of deep fertilization on maize root distribution 3 1 1 root length and rld compared with d5 the vertical root length inter row root length within row root length and total root length increased by 9 3 15 m plant 1 6 1 05 m plant 1 11 2 59 m plant 1 and 9 6 80 m plant 1 under d15 respectively and by 20 7 11 m plant 1 15 2 47 m plant 1 25 6 06 m plant 1 and 21 15 64 m plant 1 under d25 table 2 optimizing the fertilization depth to 15 cm or 25 cm significantly increased the root length and d25 obtained the greatest increase for the vertical roots the rld was significantly higher under d15 than d5 in the 0 0 4 m soil layer during 2019 and in the 0 1 0 9 m layer during 2020 but there was no significant difference in the 0 4 1 0 m soil layer during 2019 fig 3 the rld was significantly higher under d25 than d5 in the 0 1 0 m soil layer during 2019 and 2020 i e 14 10 10 2 cm cm 3 and 22 13 10 2 cm cm 3 higher respectively for the inter row roots the rld values were higher under d15 and d25 in the 0 1 0 m soil layer than d5 during 2019 and 2020 i e 6 4 10 2 cm cm 3 and 13 4 10 2 cm cm 3 higher on average respectively

higher on average respectively p 0 05 d25 obtained the highest average rld during 2019 and 2020 3 1 2 root surface area and rsd compared with d5 the root surface areas of the vertical roots inter row

water contents at the maize seeding stage in the 0 2 0 m soil depth under different treatments fig 5 at the maize jointing stage the soil water content under d15 was significantly lower than other treatments in the 0 0 6 m soil depth in 2019 and the 0 0 8 m soil depth in 2020 at the silking stage the swc values were significantly lower in the 0 4 1 4 m soil depth under d25 and d15 than the other treatments and there were no significant differences between the 0 0 4 and 1 4 2 0 m soil depths the vertical distribution of the soil water content at the maize filling stage was similar to that at the silking stage at the maturity stage during 2019 the swc changed according to an inverted w shape as the soil layer depth increased whereas the swc increased during 2020 during 2019 and 2020 swc was significantly lower in the 0 3 0 8 m soil depth under d25 than d5 and d35 and swc was significantly lower in the 0 2 0 4 m soil depth under d15 than d5 and d35 during 2019 but there was no significant difference in 2020 there were no significant differences in the soil water storage amounts under different treatments in the 0 0 6 0 6 1 2 m 1 2 2 0 m and 0 2 0 m soil depths at the maize seeding and maturity stages fig 6 however the soil water storage under d15 was significantly lower than those under d25 and d35 at the maize jointing stage in the 0 0 6 m soil depth no significant differences were observed under different treatments in the 1 2 2 0 m soil depth during 2019 and 2020 3 3 effect of deep fertilization on root sap production 3 3 1 root sap production rate

higher than those under d5 during 2019 and 2020 respectively the root sap production rates under all treatments during the silking filling and maturity stages followed the order of d25 d15 d5 d35 compared with d5 the average root sap production rates during the two years increased significantly by 8 0 23 ml h 1 root 1 13 0 21 ml h 1 root 1 and 22 0 15 ml h 1 root 1 during the maize silking

concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n followed the order of d15 d5 d25 d35 and thus they were significantly higher under d15 than the other treatments fig 7 the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap during the jointing stage increased by 9 32 2 mg kg 1 and 13 18 6 mg kg 1 under d15 respectively compared with d5 average values in 2019 and 2020 compared with d5 the mean no3 n and nh4 n concentrations during the two years increased by 22 59 1 mg kg 1 and 31 30 0 mg kg 1 under d15 from the silking to maturity stages respectively and by 42 106 5 mg kg 1 and 60 48 9 mg kg 1 under d25 3 4 effects of deep fertilization on crop water evapotranspiration δet d15 obtained the highest δet in the maize seeding to jointing stage during 2019 99 17 mm and 2020 124 79 mm and it was significantly higher than those under other treatments p 0 05 table 4 however d25 obtained the highest δet during the jointing to silking stage where δet increased significantly by 32 32 2 mm and 31 24 1 mm under d25 compared with d5 in 2019 and 2020 respectively δet was lower under d25 than d5 and d35 during the filling stage to maturity in 2019 but there were no significant differences in 2020 3 5 effects of deep fertilization on crop water productivity at biomass level wpb d25 obtained the lowest wpb at the maize jointing to silking stage which were lower by 17 95 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 20 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 than d5 in 2019 and 2020 respectively table 5 compared with d5 d25 increased the wpb during the maize silking to filling stage and the filling stage to maturity by 13 93 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 13 69 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 respectively wpb under d25 was 10 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 higher than that under d5 during the maize silking to filling stage in 2020 but there was no significant difference under different treatments during the filling stage to maturity 3 6 effects of deep fertilization on biomass maize yield water productivity and nue 3 6 1 biomass the biomasses were significantly higher under d5 and d15 than the other treatments at the maize seeding and jointing stages table 6 compared with d5 the mean biomasses under d25 during 2019 and 2020 increased significantly by 6 810 8 kg ha

et 4 discussion 4 1 effects of deep fertilization on maize root growth and distribution we measured the maize root distribution and found that the root depth reached up to 1 0 m which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2019 similar to a previous study zhang et al 2021 we showed that the maize roots could obtain nutrients and water down to a soil depth of 1 0 m lateral root proliferation is the main feature of root growth in nitrogen rich and phosphorus rich soils robinson 2002 in our study growth of the vertical roots was significantly promoted in the 0 1 0 m soil depth by applying mixed strips of nitrogen and phosphorus at different depths the root system is fertilizer oriented and when nitrogen is deficient in a field the root system will search for nitrogen to meet the required demand by increasing its length and surface area liu et al 2017 rld and rsd are essential parameters for characterizing root development guan et al 2015 the lower soil nitrogen concentrations between the rows induced the roots to explore to find nitrogen to facilitate lateral root development which explains why rld and rsd were significantly higher for the roots between rows under d25 than d5 fenn et al 2013 we found that rld and rsd in the 0 3 0 9 m soil depth were significantly higher under d15 d25 and d35 than d5 due to the higher no3 n concentration in the soil layer below 0 4 m under d15 d25 and d35 therefore the higher soil no3 n concentration could have promoted root growth thus deep fertilization at a suitable depth can promote the strong growth of roots near the nitrogen supply trapeznikov et al 2003 however a lack of available nitrogen leads to the root length increasing in the non fertilizer strip to search for nutrients for absorption and utilization su et al 2015 these processes govern root development and shape the ideal root architecture arkoun et al 2012 the temporal and spatial distributions of roots determine the temporal and spatial differences in the absorption of soil nutrients and water by crops to a certain extent ali et al 2019 in our study a fertilization depth of 0 15 0 25 m significantly promoted the proliferation of lateral roots in maize the roots developed in the vertical location under d15 and d25 and they absorbed more soil water and nutrients in addition the greater amounts of water and nutrients absorbed by the vertical root were stored in the plants to enhance lateral root growth ma et al 2013 4 2 responses of root sap and nitrogen use to deep fertilization the ability of roots to absorb water and nutrients can be reflected by the root sap production rate which is positively correlated with root growth ansari et al 2004 the root sap production rate results indicate that the maize roots treated by shallow fertilizer application had higher water and nutrient transport capacities at the early growth stage after the silking stage the nutrient and water transport capacities were greater under d25 and the root sap production rate at the early stage was significantly lower under d35 than d5 no significant differences were found in the later stage between d35 and d5 probably because the root system was shallow at the early stage shallow nutrients were mainly absorbed under d5 but lower amounts of water and nutrients were absorbed under d35 due to the distance between the root system and the location of the fertilizer however more soil water and nutrients were absorbed at the later stage under d35 which enhanced the root sap production due to the compensating effect of root growth under d35 finally there was no significant difference in the root sap production rate at the later stage under d5 and d35 the root sap production rate was significantly positively correlated with the root length root surface area and root quality for vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots table 8 thereby indicating that the root sap production rate could reflect the growth of the root system these results are consistent with a previous demonstration that the root sap production rate can reflect the physiological activity of root systems liang et al 2020 ansari et al 2004 the nutrient concentrations in the root sap indicate the nutrients absorbed by plants liang et al 2020 noguchi et al 2005 we found that the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap were significantly higher under d15 and d5 than the other treatments at the jointing stage growth occurred more rapidly under d5 and d15 than d25 at the early stage because more soil nutrients and water could be obtained under d5 and d15 than d25 cheng et al 2020 however the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap were significantly higher under d25 and d15 than d5 and d35 at the silking filling and maturity stages the maize roots were well developed under d25 and the greater root length and root surface area allowed the absorption of more soil nutrients and water to support growth however we did not measure the nitrogen concentration in the root sap at the v12 stage but we consider that the nitrogen concentration may have been higher at the v12 stage than the other growth stages because maize growth was most vigorous at the v12 stage according to the root sap production rate and no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the root sap the root system developed slowly during the early stage as the fertilizer placement depth increased however there was a compensation effect when the root system reached the fertilization soil layer lu et al 2018 thereby promoting the rapid growth of the root system at the later stage the root sap production rate nitrogen concentration in the root sap dry matter accumulation plant height and other agronomic characters responded strongly possibly due to the difficulty absorbing nitrogen from the soil at the early stage under d35 and the root development was weaker compared with the other treatments the compensation effect promoted growth when the roots came into contact with the fertilizer at the later stage but root development was still greater under the other treatments this growth regulation strategy is based on the metabolic cost of root formation cabal et al 2020 therefore the root sap production rate and nitrogen concentration were lower throughout the growth process than those under d5 deep fertilization at different soil depths can affect the maize yield by adjusting the root sap production rate and nutrient concentrations the growth of roots underground is closely related to the growth of stems above ground tian et al 2006 the developed root architecture plays a vital role in absorbing nutrients wang et al 2004 in this study the rld and rsd values for the vertical inter row and within row roots were greater under d25 and d15 thereby allowing the root system to absorb nutrients and water from the soil clearly roots are crucial for connecting water and nutrients in the soil and in plants and their development directly affects the absorption of water and nutrients chen et al 2014 better developed roots have a positive effect on crop growth the significant correlations between the nitrogen concentration in the root sap nitrogen accumulation and yield also demonstrated the importance of the root system for controlling maize growth table 8 xie et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the established root system is most vigorous at the maize silking stage at this stage indexes such as the root length and root surface area are positively correlated with indexes including the yield and plant nitrogen accumulation at the harvest stage liedgens and richner 2001 we obtained similar results table 8 the nue values during 2019 and 2020 were 44 and 43 respectively but only 33 and 31 under d5 table 7 thereby indicating that changing the fertilization depth was effective at controlling the accumulation of nitrogen and nue in plants previous studies also showed that deep fertilization improved the fertilizer utilization efficiency su et al 2015 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2018 nash et al 2013 the nue values were higher under d15 and d25 because the losses of gaseous nitrogen as nh3 and n2o under d5 were significantly reduced when the fertilization depth was 0 15 0 25 m wu et al 2021 4 3 effect of deep fertilization on soil water use the growth and development of crop roots are closely related to soil moisture which directly influences the absorption of water and nutrients to indirectly affect crop productivity wang et al 2019 gong et al 2020 a higher swc contributes to the growth of roots to promote the absorption of soil water we found that the swc values under d25 and d15 in the 0 4 1 4 m soil depth were significantly lower than those under the other treatments during 2019 and 2020 mainly because the root system was established at the maize silking stage and it absorbed large amounts of soil moisture and nutrients from maize jointing to silking stage therefore the soil moisture content decreased at the silking stage the structural equation model showed that the growth and distribution of the roots increased the crop water consumption previous studies have shown that an appropriate soil water deficit allows the roots to search for water in the soil to meet plant developmental needs shi et al 2020 elhani et al 2019 however excessive soil water will cause oxygen deprivation reduce the root growth rate and lead to root aging or death eapen et al 2005 in the present study the rainfall mainly occurred in july and august at the study site and thus a large amount of rainfall after the silking stage increased the water consumed for root growth to meet the water and nutrient demands of the mature roots after the silking stage jia et al 2020 the death of roots is affected by many factors such as natural death nutrient and water deficiencies and oxygen deprivation jia et al 2018 therefore we found that the swc in the 0 4 0 8 m soil depth was slightly lower under d25 than the other treatments at maturity thereby indicating that the root system could still absorb a large amount of water after the silking stage under d25 maize plants enter the reproductive growth stage after the silking stage where they consume large amounts of water thereby leading to the low soil water content at the maturity stage jia et al 2018 the amounts of rainfall in july and august were lower during 2019 than 2020 thus the swc values in different soil layers at maturity were lower during 2019 than 2020 the swc in the 1 0 1 2 m soil layer appeared to have an inflection point at crop maturity during 2019 the root system may have mainly absorbed and utilized the water in the 0 1 0 m soil layer at the later stage and the root system absorbed little of the water in the soil layer below 1 0 m zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 a well developed root system significantly improves the soil wpg wang et al 2019 a previous study showed that water is no longer the limiting factor for crop growth and senescence when the precipitation exceeds 440 mm during the maize growth stage ren et al 2008 in the present study the precipitation amounts during the maize growth periods in 2019 and 2020 were 485 8 mm and 585 1 mm respectively and thus water was not the limiting factor for maize growth previous studies showed that changes in the crop field water consumption patterns during growth stages can affect the crop biomass accumulation zhang et al 2020 the increase in the biomass under d25 during the jointing to silking stage was accompanied by an increase in water evapotranspiration table 6 a previous study showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the crop biomass and grain yield qi and pan 2021 which is consistent with our results some studies also showed that the water productivity changed according to the changes in evapotranspiration and biomass accumulation during different crop growth stages wang et al 2021 and our results are consistent with this pattern d25 obtained the highest biomass and grain yield thus the wpg and wpb increased significantly when the fertilization depth was 0 25 or 0 15 m and the wpg was highest under d25 4 4 maize yield determination of appropriate fertilizer placement depth and potential adaptation many factors can influence the grain yield such as various nutrients diseases insect damage sunlight availability soil erosion tillage planting density drought and flooding the crop yield is closely related to the degree of root development casper and jackson 1997 the spatial distribution of the roots has important effects on the maize yield barber and mackay 1986 increasing the number of plant roots helps to enhance the absorption of nitrate and water morris et al 2017 we found that a fertilization depth of 0 25 m was most suitable because it promoted the growth and distribution of vertical roots inter row roots and within row roots and significantly increased the root sap production rate and no3 n and nh4 n concentrations to promote the accumulation of nitrogen in the aboveground plant parts as well as improving the wpg and maize yield thus adjusting the root distribution and growth by changing the fertilization depth is effective for promoting the efficient use of water and fertilizer to increase the maize yield according to our analyses of root growth nutrient absorption and the grain yield 0 25 m was determined as the most suitable depth for deep fertilizer application we also found that d25 obtained the highest economic benefits among all of the treatments followed by d15 and thus farmers will obtain higher economic benefits if they apply all of the fertilizer at a soil depth of 0 25 m before sowing the deep fertilization method requires a high mechanical power input therefore we must carefully consider whether deep fertilizer application will be accepted and used by farmers before promoting this technique when agricultural machinery is undeveloped deep fertilizer application will be difficult to accept because the accessible machinery cannot meet the needs of the correct fertilization strategy nevertheless agricultural machinery is developing and it can the meet fertilization needs throughout the world patuk et al 2020 so farmers may accept this strategy to some extent however as the fertilization depth increases more diesel must be used in the mechanical operation process liu et al 2020 which will increase the cost of fertilization and this is a major concern for farmers therefore we suggest that the government should consider increasing planting subsidies for farmers and promoting this technique to increase enthusiasm among farmers therefore deep fertilization at a soil depth of 0 15 m is more feasible in actual operation we consider that the further development of fertilization machinery will facilitate the placement of a fertilizer band at a depth of 0 25 m with broad application prospects in the future cheng et al 2020 5 conclusions changing the fertilization location to suitable soil depths can regulate growth and development of the root system thereby enhancing the root distribution and growth especially lateral roots and increase rld and rsd in this study deep fertilization improved the balance between the water and nutrients available to the root system in the soil layer to enhance their uptake thereby enhancing the root sap production rate and nitrogen concentration in the root sap and the transport of water and nutrients to the aboveground plant parts which increased the biomass maize yield wpg wpb and nue d25 had more evident effects on the water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and maize yield than other treatments the results obtained in our study can further clarify the relationships between soil water nutrients root growth and nutrient uptake and provide a reference to improve the efficient utilization of water and fertilizer therefore changing the fertilization depth to 0 25 m is an effective fertilizer and water management strategy for the sustainable development of maize in the loess plateau region of china and it may contribute to ensuring future food security the mechanism associated with the regulation of root development and growth according to the fertilizer placement position requires further study

9386,the limitations of water resources in supplying the demands of consumer sectors including drinking hygiene and healthcare agriculture industry as well as environment well reflect the importance of proper use of water thus it is essential to choose an optimal and superior strategy to use water under water deficit conditions this experiment was implemented as split plot in a fully randomized block design in a research farm in the southeast of iran on roselle plant the experimental treatments included three levels of potassium fertilizer 75 t ha 1 k1 112 5 t ha 1 k2 and 150 t ha k3 equivalent to 50 75 and 100 of potassium fertilizer requierment and four levels of irrigation water including 40 60 80 and 100 of the plant water requierment l1 l2 l3 and l4 the main aim of the research was to estimate the production function as well as to calculate the index and optimal depths of consumed water regression analyses were done by linear cobb douglas quadratic and transcendental functional forms of roselle production the final production indicators in relation to the water depth and potassium fertilizer the final rate of technical substitution for potassium fertilizer and water depth and the final production value in relation to water depth and potassium fertilizer were calculated the results indicated that the quadratic function was chosen as the superior function the final production index in relation to the minimum water depth was 1 4 and for maximum water depth was 0 86 kg cm 1 of water depth the final production index in relation to the minimum and maximum potassium fertilizer was calculated as 3 92 and 1 77 kg respectively the results also showed that by applying deficit irrigation under water constraint conditions the optimal depths of consumed water in relation to the maximum depth at 75 112 5 and 150 kg levels of potassium fertilizer per hectare had 13 29 14 34 and 13 1 cm reduction of water consumption respectively as can be seen elevation of potassium fertilizer up to 75 resulted in more saving of water consumption use of potassium fertilizer can modify the damages resulting from drought stress in roselle keywords final value of production final production index deficit irrigation rate of technical substitution 1 introduction in recent years the effect of agricultural systems on the environment has sparked concerns among scientists and policymakers of different countries in iran because of the inexpensiveness of fertilizers as well as their easy preparation by farmers they are used indiscriminately which in response to leaching causes contamination of groundwater and surface water and eventually the environment ten berge et al 2000 the importance of environmental view to consuming chemical fertilizer and water inputs has sparked extensive research on optimization of consumption pattern of these two inputs bailey et al 1999 optimal use of water and fertilizers is one of the most important agricultural purposes especially in dry regions because of deficit of water resources and contamination of such resources playan and faci 1997 the aim of optimizing water and fertilizer consumption is achieving the maximum performance or income with minimum amount of water and fertilizer consumed the optimal depth of irrigation water varies across different conditions and will be obtained when the maximum net income could be achieved in response to irrigation water depth in order to determine the optimal depth various tools are required including the crop production function in relation to irrigation water or its derivatives fixed and variable costs the crop price and information related to the land and water constraints in the literature two methods have been mentioned for estimating the water yield production functions the first method offers the water yield relationship quantitatively based on theoretical and experimental models in the second method the production functions are estimated in response to different amounts of water on the yield of plants resulting from farm observations or through statistical analysis datta 1998 by estimating the production function the relative effect of each of the mentioned variables can be calculated and determined quantitatively on the variations of production and crop income evidently presence of each of the water and fertilizer inputs is essential for the development and enhancement of yield where the deficit of any of them can affect the efficiency of the other when the water used through irrigation is lower than the plant s water demand use of fertilizer based on complete irrigation causes higher potential of groundwater pollution in the future although with increasing the amount of water and fertilizer the dry substance yield increases pandey et al 2000 overuse of these two inputs would cause loss of resources and creation of environmental pollution pang and letey 1998 fertilizers should be consumed based on a nutritional management program which considers all available nutritional elements in the farm the time of consumption of fertilizers is also important as the plants needs differ across various developmental stages the most effective and efficient fertilizer dispersion management is achieved when adequate amounts of nutrients soluble in humid soil could be provided tp the plant with proper ventilation during the plant s development stage and during th days when the plant demands more nutrients irrigation water is the fastest most effective and least expensive means of achieving these objectives this fertilizer management technique in which fertilizer is used alongside irrigation water is called fertigation fertigation causes enhanced yield and efficient of both water as well as fertilizer consumption traore et al 2000 although fertigation is more common in pressurized irrigation systems because of higher irrigation efficiency recent research has paved the way for use of this efficient method of fertilizer dispersion in surface irrigation hou et al 2007 it is predicted that in the future surface irrigation would be one of the most common water supply systems in agricultural lands and fertigation would be recognized as one of the solutions to enhance the yields of agricultural crops this is because conventional methods surface dispersion are first expensive and secondly they can be dispersed only in a short period of the growth season this highlights the necessity of conducting research on fertigation with surface irrigation systems various studies have shown that use of potassium fertilizer under water stress conditions can compensate for part of the water stress incurred to the plant faroqoi and bssreeramu 2004 mohamed and ashok 2014 when optimal amount of water and fertilizer is given to a plant acceptable economic performance can be achieved hassan 2001 fertilizers must be transported via water it is not possible to consider fertilizer and irrigation water applications separately therefore the effects of fertilizer together with the water on the crop yield can be determined by crop water production functions it is important to determine the amount of water for optimum fertilizer uptake by plants for each application water and fertilizer are the most important inputs in crop production therefore they must be used effectively for optimum crop production ertek 2014 the statistical functions as a proper mean used to determine the optimum amount of water and potassium for different cropping systems in these functions data driven from water or other agriculture inputs can be fitted to determine the optimum rates of the mentioned input be langer et al 2000 even though selection of the best function is not simple and depends on the local farming situation so the choice of the best function is considered a basic step in utilizing the statistical functions obviously based on the literature the functions had different inputs but the main output of these is crop yield despite of its simplicity the linear has less accuracy than the other functions although some studies confirm that the linear function is the best function for estimating biomass by water bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 datta et al 1998 assessed responses of wheat to the amount and quality of water and salinity of the soil they stated that the quadratic functions estimate more accurately wheat s yield than linear and c d functions the quadratic function was considered in the estimation of crop yield in different researches amon armah et al 2015 bullock and bullock 1994 boyer et al 2012 as this function can show the decline of crop yield when n or water applied beyond an optimum amount lyons et al 2019 although by utilization of the quadratic function the yield and optimum amount of inputs such as n are estimated too high tumusiime et al 2011 lyons et al 2019 had assessed various functions by using the results of conducted experiments on winter cereals they concluded that the quadratic plateau is best for determining the most economic rate of n of forage winter cereal lu et al 2004 in their study also stated that the quadratic function is ppropriate to determine the optimal irrigation depth of the plant moosavi fazl et al with the aim of determining the production function and optimal depth of water as well as fertilizer the effect of potassium fertilizer was examined under water stress conditions on forage sorghum plant they found that the best yield was achieved from fertigation treatment with 100 level which had no significant difference with the 75 irrigation level they also concluded that from among four studied functions the second order function would better estimate the sorghum yield under concurrent water stress and potassium fertilizer conditions out of four functions of linear production logarithmic exponential and quadratic functions piri 2017 chose the quadratic function as the superior function for water fertilizer and yield application of proper irrigation management and cultivation of drought resistant plants to maintain the soil humidity reserves as well as enhance the water retention capacity in soil are among the effective measures to boost the efficiency of irrigation and thus improve the exploitation of limited water resources roselle is a drought resistant plant roselle with the scientific name of hibiscus sabdariffa belongs to the malvaceae family native to africa it is cultivated in all tropical and warm regions and is notable as an medicinal herb aziz et al 2007 in iran roselle is mainly cultivated in sistan and balouchestan province approximately 300 ha with a mean dry yield of 700 900 kg ha 1 sistan region in the north of sistan and baluchistan province is one of the important regions of the province in producing roselle water deficit in sistan plane is very serious the only water source of the region is hirmand river which originates from baba yaghma mountains in afghanistan the water crisis of the region results from more deficit in this river such that failure of hirmand water supply has led to devastation of agriculture in the region thus considering the water deficit in the region cultivating plants that are resistant to water stress as well as managing its irrigation such that it would have no effect on the quantitative and qualitative yield of the plant are very important agricultural water management strategies are focused especially on fertilizer application and soil water conservation in dry areas yield decline caused by water shortage in dry areas can be compensated for to some extent through fertilization however the effects of fertilizers are limited due to available water li et al 2016 if enough water is absent in the root zone to dissolve the fertilizer and carry it to the upper parts of plant a large amount of fertilizer will remain in the soil and will not be useful to the plants the remaining portion of the fertilizer in the soil will cause environmental pollution therefore the suitable amount of water needed for the plants to receive the fertilizer should be known the yield response factor equation can be rewritten as the et fertilizer response factor to determine the most appropriate water and fertilizer rate this study was conducted to determine the best production function at different levels of irrigation and consumption of potassium fertilizer in sistan region to determine the optimal depth of irrigation and fertilizer consumption while saving water and fertilizer consumption minimize crop yields thus in this research has done first to derive equations for determination of water and potassium levels leading to maximum yield or profit whith limited water and land conditions then these derived equations are applied to roselle experimental field data and the optimal levels of water and potassium are determined 2 material and methods 2 1 site of experimentation this research was performed in 2019 and 2020 in chahnimeh research complex located in sistan and baluchistan province 61 67 e 30 89 n and 480 m above the sea southeast of iran the studied region has a dry and warm climate in which the precipitation level is less than 60 mm per year due to the high evaporation and perspiration potential in the region about 3500 mm interest in cultivating drought resistant plants has increased among the farmers 2 2 the soil of the experimental site in order to determine the physical and chemical properties of soil some samples were taken from depths 0 30 and 30 60 cm whereby these properties were determined in the laboratory table 1 phosphorus was measured by olsen method olsen and sommers 1982 potassium by normal ammonium acetate olsen and sommers 1982 and total nitrogen through kjeldahl method further walkley black method was employed to determine the organic content of soil hydraulic conduction and soil ph were measured by ec meter and ph meter respectively finally the quality of the utilized water was also tested before the cultivation whose results are provided in table 2 2 3 experimental design the present research was implemented as split plot based on a fully randomized design with three replications the treatments included four levels of irrigation water depth i1 i2 i3 and i4 representing 40 60 80 and 100 and three potassium fertilizer levels k1 k2 and k3 equivalent to 50 75 and 100 of the potassium fertilizer requierment as the secondary court the dimensions of plot were considered 3 4 m and the distance between plots was regarded 1 m in every plot five furrows and ridges were made and the seeds were cultivated at 3 cm deep in the soil with 25 cm intervals from each other on the rows the distance between the plant rows was considered 75 cm the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer requierment during the cultivation season was determined according to the soil analysis results the nitrogen fertilizer was added to the soil from a urea source by 200 kg ha 1 in three stages one third concurrent with cultivation one third of the growth stage branching and one third at flowering time 50 of the plant flowering the potassium fertilizer was added as potassium sulfate concurrent with cultivation at three levels 75 112 5 and 150 kg ha 1 equivalent to 50 75 and 100 of the potassium fertilizer requierment finally phosphorus fertilizer was added to the soil as triple superphosphate by 100 kg ha 1 concurrent with cultivation 2 4 irrigation calculations the level of irrigation water before every irrigation was determined using relation 1 liu et al 2006 1 d i 1 n θ fci θ i z in this equation d represents irrigation depth m θ fci and θ i denotes the volumetric moisture of the soil in field capacity and before irrigation in layer i 1 z represents the layer thickness m and n is the number of soil layer by obtaining the irrigation water depth at every time using relation 1 the volume required for every plot was calculated through multiplying the obtained depth by the plot area it was measured using the counters installed on each of the water delivery pipes and provided to the plant the water volume of other treatments was determined and applied according to this volume 2 5 production functions a production function is a relation between input and output in a system in this study the yield of roselle was considered as the output and different amounts of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer were regarded as the input parameters also the other effective factors on yield are assumed to be constant so the other factors that can affect crop yield are assumed to be unchanged as a result the general form of the production function is expressed using the following equation 2 y f i k where y which is the function of the roselle t ha 1 f is a function of the amount of irrigation water i cm and the amount of potassium fertilizer k kg ha 1 samples of product were taken in the first year on 27 november and in the second year on 5 december three rows of plants were taken from the middle of every plot while removing the marginal effect whereby the parameters were measured on these samples in order to measure the yield plant capsules were removed from the shrubs and dried in ambient air to express the effects of applied irrigation water and potassium amount on the crop yield four statistical functions linear cobb douglas quadratic and transcendental were fitted to the data were recorded for each of the irrigation methods the equations were as follows linear function 3 y α β 1 i β 2 k cobb douglas function 4 y α i β 1 k β 2 quadratic function 5 y α β 1 i β 2 k β 3 i 2 β 4 k 2 β 5 i k transcendental function 6 y α i β 1 k β 2 exp β 3 i β 4 k in these equations i is the amount of irrigation water cm k is the amount of potassium fertilizer kg ha 1 α and β are function coefficients to be calculated and y is the amount of roselle yield the ordinary least square ols technique was utilized for the estimation of the coefficients of the mentioned functions then to compare and evaluate the functions five statistical indexes including root mean square error rmse the efficiency of the function ef maximum error me coefficient of residual mass crm and coefficient of 214 explanation r2 were derived from the following equations 7 r 2 i 1 n y mi y y pi y

are the measured and predicted yield amounts respectively is the average of observed yield and n is the number of observation as a result the mean values of rmse ef me crm and r2 have been calculated to compare the functions performances of three irrigation methods lower values of mean me rmse and crm and higher values of the mean of ef and r2 are expected for the better functions of the onion production in this research homaee et al 2002 2 6 determining the yield sensitivity factor ky based on doorenbos and kassam model doorenbos and kassam 1979 proposed the following linear relationship between the relative losses of crop yield and crop evapotranspiration this model measures the variations in relative yield reduction in relation to the relative changes of perspiration and evaporation and associates them to each other through a coefficient called ky piri et al 2017 12 1 y a y max k y 1 et a et max in this relation ymax represents the maximum amount of crop produced with no water constraint kg ya is the real value of the produced crop kg et denotes real evaporation and perspiration mm etmax shows the maximum amount of evaporation and perspiration mm and ky represents the sensitivity coefficient 2 7 evaluation of performance evaluation indicators after the determining of the best production function to investigate the effects of separate and combined applications of fertilizers and irrigation water levels on the yield of roselle the marginal production of irrigation water mp i and pottassium fertilizer mp k the marginal rate of technical of substitution of k and irrigation water depth mrtsi k the marginal value product of the irrigation water vmp i and the potassium fertilizer vmp k were used these indices were determined by the selected production function

best predictor production function 2 8 determining the optimal depths using the superior function chosen quadratic function the optimal irrigation depths were calculated for this purpose in the production function obtained the amount of potassium fertilizer consumption was considered constant and the above equation was changed into a second order equation of the irrigation water level eq 18

cost function in relation to the irrigation water depth rials ha 1 a1 b1 c1 a2 and b2 are constant coefficients that are determined based on the type of crop irrigation water depth as well as income and costs 2 9 calculating the index of irrigation depths the depth of water consumed under land constraint conditions was obtained from eq 20 piri et al 2017 20 w l b 2 p c b 1 2 p c c 1 to calculate the consumed water depth of the plant under water constraint conditions eq 21 was used piri et al 2017 21 w w p c a 1 a 2 p c c 1 0 5 to obtain the maximum irrigation equivalent depth initially the

mentioned relations a1 a2 b1 b2 and c1 are constant coefficients determined based on irrigation water depth as well as income and costs pc is the crop price in terms of rials per every kilogram 500000 rials 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield analysis analysis of variance of the studied characteristics is presented in table 3 further comparison of the mean properties using duncan test is reported in table 4 in these tables the results have been presented in yield generally the crop yield had been significantly affected by the level of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer further due to the equality of environmental conditions the year of cultivation did not have any significant effect on yeild table 3 the yield was increased with reduction the irrigation water depth up to l3 treatment but there was no significant difference between l4 and l3 in this regard with further reduction of the water depth l2 and l1 treatments the dry yield decreased the maximum dry yield 583 69 kg ha 1 was observed in l3 and the minimum 379 01 kg ha 1 in l1 table 4 with decrease in the amount of potassium used the yeild decreased the largest values of yeild were obtained in k3 and the minimum in k1 the highest dry yield 519 94 kg ha 1 was achieved in k3 table 4 the interaction effect of k and irrigation had a significant effect on the yield table 3 specifically the maximum yield was obtained from l3k3 treatment by as much as 600 95 kg ha 1 and the minimum yield was achieved in l1k1 treatment with 342 42kg ha 1 there was no significant difference between i3k3 and i3k2 treatments in this regard fig 1 liu et al 2021 in the their research stated again the maximum yield was obtained in the treatment with the maximum water and fertilizer while the minimum yield was found in the treatment without fertilizer and etc60 under mild and severe water stress increase in potassium fertilizer use would to some extent cause plant tolerance against the negative effect of water deficit on the plant yield in other words use of proper amounts of potassium fertilizer can promote the plants coping with water stress these results are in line with megyest et al potassium increases the plant tolerance to environmental stress production of starch and carbohydrate as well as plant strength and its desired value is required for optimal growth pahlavan et al 2006 thus use of potassium fertilizer could mitigate the adverse effects of water stress to some extent on the other hand in case the water stress is severe the role of potassium fertilizer diminishes with increasing of the level of water stress yield compensation by potassium fertilizer decreased these results concur with the findings of mohammad and ashok 2014 as well as farooqi and bssreeramu 2004 who believe that use of fertilizers especially potassium can compensate part of water stress it seems that the combination of the use of nutritional sources and irrigation has caused the plant not to face a shortage of food resources during the growing season and on the other hand has used the existing conditions in favor of the production of yield components and yield 3 2 production functions the results of estimating the production function coefficients are given in table 5 and the relationships between estimated and measured yield for the 2 years of the experiment are reported in fig 2 also the statistical parameters required for evaluating the validity of the obtained functions regarding the buffer function are given in table 6 the f value was also used to determine the significance f value indicates the general significance of the function if the f statistic of the coefficient was significant this indicates that the general fit of the regression function and the number of the function s residuals are acceptable table 6 also the function performance indices include rmse ef me crm and r2 are presented in table 7 as shown in table 6 based on the final ranking the quadratic function was considered as more appropriate concerning other functions used transcendental cobb douglas and linear functions were ranked second to fourth respectively given the fact that the larger me values the weaker the performance of the model in estimating the crop yield table 6 suggests that the quadratic function with the minimum me 26 2 has offered the best estimation for the crop yield the minimum numerical value rmse 2 7 is also related to the quadratic function suggesting that this function has estimated the yield with the minimum difference in relation to its real value further the high values of the determination coefficient r2 0 97 and the efficiency of the ef model 0 64 also reflect the robustness and high efficiency of the quadratic function in estimating the values of interest piri et al who researched determination of the superior function for yield water fertilizer for sorghum plant also reached similar findings and chose the quadratic function as the superior function zand parsa and sepaskhah 2001 utilized the quadratic function to describe the relationship between water nitrogen and corn yield therefore considering the above results and taking into account the final rating the quadratic function performed best in estimating in the mixed conditions of applying different levels of potassium and irrigation water in the sistan region datta et al 1998 and russo and bakker 1986 resulted in the quadratic production function provide a better fit to the data for wheat sweet corn and cotton also tageldin 2005 showed that the quadratic function is appropriate in maize yield estimation however boyer et al 2012 confirmed that the quadratic function is a proper switchgrass yield estimator in some landscapes in tennessee besides kiani and abbasi 2009 introduced this function as the supreme function of wheat production based on soil moisture and salinity but tumusiime et al 2011 stated that the quadratic function was not suitable for determining the yield nitrogen fertilizer function for the forage and used the linear function to determine the optimal irrigation depth on the other hand neghassi et al 1975 and singh et al 1987 reported that linear form of production for wheat is more useful our data suggests that quadratic to have a better fit than linear form 3 3 sensitivity coefficient in order to determine the yield sensitivity coefficient the doorenbos and kassam sensitivity model was used fig 3 indicates this model the sensitivity coefficient for the dry yield of hibiscus tea was obtained 1 18 the value of sensitivity of the crop yield differs depending on climatic local soil crop conditions as well as farming management and irrigation program in this regard fao stated its value 0 2 1 15 while the international agency of nuclear energy as 0 08 1 75 moutonnet et al 2002 roselle yield response to water stress was obtained from the relationship between yield reduction and the corresponding et deficit fig 3 a poor relation between these two variables was obtained from the pooled data r2 0 0 36 the slope ky the yield response factor obtained for roselle in the study location was 1 18 this value is comparatively lower than the values reported by çakir 2004 1 25 doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 29 and payero et al 2009 1 50 for maize but is similar to that reported in some studies karam et al 2003 kuscu et al 2013 as ky represents a measure of the relative sensitivity of a crop to drought in a particular environment ferreira and gonçalves 2007 k y 1 18 accounts for a yield reduction of 1 18 g per mm of et deficit ky 1 indicates that deficit irrigation can be employed as an effective and practical water management strategy araya et al 2011 stated that ky 1 indicate that the crop is sensitive to moisture stress also the hibiscus tea is known as a drought resistant plant aziz et al 2007 this research obtained ky 1 suggesting that in the studied region the plant can tolerate drought to some extent beyond which the yield diminishes this can be attributed to the climatic conditions of the region as well as the length of the plant development cultivation of this plant occurs in mid to late may and it is harvested in december five months of the development period of this plant fall in spring and summer during which sistan region is very warm and 120 day winds blow causing higher evaporation and perspiration these causes increased amount of water consumed by the plant and in turn severity of the stresses resulting from water deficit greavesa et al 2017 showed that maize yield response to water stress ky was as 0 92 suggesting the environmental conditions are conducive for implementing deficit irrigation strategies 3 4 indicators of marginal production of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer the marginal production of irrigation mpi and potassium fertilizer mpk of two factors of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer quantities are given in table 8 according to table 8 while assuming irrigation water depth constant mpx index was obtained as 3 92 and 3 77 kg per 75 and 150 kg hectare 1 of potassium fertilizer respectively the results also showed that consumption of potassium fertilizer at complete level k3 treatment under water stress conditions caused diminished yield thus use of potassium fertilizer could reduce the detrimental effects of water stress to some extent in case water stress is severe the role of potassium fertilizer decreases these results concur with the findings of mohammad and ashuk 2014 as well as faroqoi and bssreeramu 2004 who believe that use of fertilizers especially potassium can compensate part of water stress the final yield the production index of hibiscus tea in relation to irrigation water depth mpi assuming constancy of potassium fertilizer for the minimum irrigation water depth 72 8 cm was obtained 1 4 kg per 1 cm of the water depth this means that per every 1 cm of increase in the irrigation water depth the yield will grow by 1 4 kg the value of this index for the maximum irrigation water depth 182 0 cm was equivalent to 0 86 kg per every 1 cm of water depth table 8 the negativity of this index for the maximum irrigation water depth in relation to the minimum water depth suggests diminished yield per increase in the irrigation water depth at high levels of radiation it also suggests that the slope of yield elevation is greater during low irrigation compared to high irrigation and excessive irrigation results in diminished yield when the soil air exchange becomes limited in response to heavy irrigation with water and nutrient absorption slowing down the root respiration becomes vulnerable whereby the roots development becomes limited causing stimulation of toxins and degradation of hormone metabolism all these result in decreased plant growth and hence reduced flowering in the shrub also under these conditions the leaves and flowers fall hassanzadeh and giasi 2008 for this reason the yield was lower in i4 treatment compared to i3 piri et al 2017 who researched sorghhum production function at values beyond the plant water demand also reached similar findings nadler 2006 as well as neilsen and vigili 2005 also reported similar results and stated that excessive irrigation causes diminished yield ghodke et al 2018 stated a part of yield decreasing may result from temporary waterlogging in the soil in fact applying water more than the plant requirement can be caused to nitrogen leaching especially by fi similar results were obtained by sharma et al 2012 from furrow irrigated onion besides in their research piri et al 2017 found similar results about the production function of sorghum over the plant s water requirement fig 4 displays the changes in hibiscus tea yield in relation to different levels of irrigation water y i and potassium fertilizer y k as seen in the figure with reduction in the amount of potassium fertilizer and irrigation water depth the yield has diminished however by increasing the potassium fertilizer under low irradiation water depths part of this reduction can be compensated thus it can be said that under low irrigation conditions by increasing the amount of potassium fertilizer less yield reduction is possible nevertheless as observed in table 7 consumption of potassium fertilizer should not be complete under these conditions rather an increase in potassium fertilizer under water stress conditions up to a certain level can cause reduction of the losses resulting from water stress also fig 4 shows that the yield reacts more dramatically under water stress conditions and with increase in the amount of irrigation water the ascending trend of the yield slows down thus if in regions where irrigation is complete part of the water is saved the yield would not change considerably and if this saved water reaches a plant subject to drought conditions increase of yield will be greater mousavifazl et al in their research on the effect of potassium fertilizer in low irrigations concluded that reduction of yield in response to diminished irrigation water depth can be compensated through increasing the amount of potassium fertilizer in table 9 the yield final production index in relation to the mean irrigation water depth mpi indicated that with 1 cm increase in the depth of irrigation water compared to the mean depth while assuming constant level of potassium fertilizer 112 5 kg hectare 1 the dry yield of roselle increased by 0 9 kg further considering the dry yield final production index of roselle in relation to potassium fertilizer mpk with one unit increase in potassium fertilizer from the mean value and while assuming the irrigation water depth as constant 124 7 cm the yield grows by 3 1 kg on average the final rate of technical substitution of potassium fertilizer instead of irrigation water mrts in relation to the yield indicated that in order for the yield to remain constant with one unit reduction of irrigation water the amount of potassium fertilizer should increase by 3 4 kg per every centimeter of irrigation water considering the price of 1 kg of roselle in 2019 as 500000 rials the production value of both irrigation water depth and potassium fertilizer can be obtained the final production value in relation to the irrigation water depth for hibiscus tea is 450000 rials indicating the income resulting from enhanced production in response to increasing every centimeter of the irrigation water depth in relation to the mean irrigation water depth further the final production value in relation to potassium fertilizer for roselle iwas obtained 1550000 rials indicating the income obtained from higher production in response to increasing every unit of potassium fertilizer in relation to the mean potassium fertilizer value consumed the results indicated that the income obtained from raising the content of potassium fertilizer was higher that the income gained from deepening the irrigation water depth 3 5 index of irrigation depths by having water function the cost of index depths optimal irrigation depth under land constraint conditions wl optimal irrigation depth under water constraint conditions ww the maximum irrigation equivalent depth wcl and maximum water depth consumed wm were calculated while assuming the amount of consumed fertilizer constant table 10 with increase in the amount of potassium fertilizer across various low irrigation treatments the optimal irrigation depth increased also with elevating the content of potassium fertilizer the difference of optimal irrigation depth diminished between water constraint ww and land constraint wl conditions this is due to reduced crops at high levels of potassium fertilizer at large levels of potassium consumption because of water deficit the severity of stressors incurred to the plant increases thus at high levels of fertilizer consumption low irrigation loses its efficiency and will not be economical it is also observed that by applying low irrigation under land constraint conditions the optimal depth of consumed water wm in relation to the maximum equivalent depth of consumption wcl shows lower water consumption by 2 5 4 5 and 3 5 cm in k1 k2 and k3 treatments respectively and under water constraint conditions it presented diminished water consumption by 13 29 14 34 and 13 1 cm respectively as can be seen increase in potassium fertilizer up to 75 has resulted in greater saving of water consumption naderian far 2016 in their research on determining the water yield basil function under water stress and nano fertilizer also reached similar findings they stated that with low irrigation under water constraint conditions for maximum use of the water volume unit the optimal depth of consumed water compared to the maximum irrigation would diminish by 20 himmatrao malve et al 2016 used the quadratic function to determine the optimal water depth the results of their research showed that the economic optima of level of irrigation that will maximize the net return under prevailing prices worked out to be 382 8 mmha 1 with grain yields of 4693 kg ha 1 accordingly it was observed that in response to low irrigation of roselle compared to the maximum irrigation some water is saved based on the depth of water saved a new level can be cultivated and the total yield could be enhanced thereby raising the income also since the main problem in the sistan region is water deficit determining the optimal depth in these conditions can resolve this problem to some extent 3 6 the impact of applying optimal irrigation depth on saving the consumption of water resources to explore the impact of applying optimal depth on saving consumption of water resources so that the volume of the saved water for helping sustainable reservation of water resources would not be withdrawn for irrigation of more lands the volumes of saved water resulting from applying the optimal irrigation depth under water resource constraints in relation to the complete irrigation depth the volume percentage of saved water in relation to complete irrigation and the percentage of decreased net income compared to complete irrigation per unit of area hectare were calculated for all three values of potassium fertilizer table 11 the results showed that with the rise in the amount of potassium fertilizer because of the increase in the optimal irrigation depth the volume of saved water has shrunken the percentage of reduction in the net income in relation to the maximum irrigation was obtained negative in k3 and k2 treatments this suggests that use of irrigation water as much as complete irrigation depth has caused reduction of net income and usage of optimal depth for irrigation has offered greater profit the percentage of income reduction in relation to complete irrigation was positive in k1 treatment in this treatment the amount of fertilizer used was low causing diminished yield and income the percentage of reduction of the net income in relation to complete irrigation was lower in k2 treatment as compared to the other two treatments suggesting that this treatment has been more economical than the two others as observed in table 4 k2 treatment did not differ significantly with k3 regarding yield meanwhile consumption of this amount of fertilizer k2 treatment led to decreased irrigation water depth compared to k3 treatment thus the production cost dropped in k2 treatment compared to k3 causing enhanced income in this treatment compared to the others overall the results indicated that use of optimal depth instead of complete irrigation depth and nonuse of saved values for helping more sustainable reservation of water resources are economical 3 7 iso yield curve this curve indicates the geometric position of various combinations of irrigation water depth and potassium fertilizer which have the same yield in the roselle production process fig 5 displays the iso yield curve resulting from the output of a second order function in this curve at a specific water depth value as the amount of potassium fertilizer used increases so does the yield further in order for the yield to grow at a constant value of fertilizer consumption the irrigation water depth should be incremented for example if 110 kgha 1 potassium fertilizer is consumed to produce 530 kg ha 1 roselle 113 cm water should be consumed now if you want to produce 540 kg ha 1 hibiscus tea with this same amount of potassium fertilizer 125 cm water should be consumed based on the obtained results it can be stated that the crop yield is a function of two variables fertilizer and amount of irrigation water where one dimensional view to the effect of each of these variables does not match reality in this regard wang et al nadler et al 2006 and kiani et al reached similar results 4 conclusion considering water crisis and for optimal use of water in the agricultural sector the index of irrigation depths should be calculated for all farming and gardening crops along with application of deficit irrigation under water resource constraints reduction of water consumption in deficit irrigation treatments compared to full irrigation contributed to saving water through the saved water in case there is no land constraint more lands can be introduced for production under water constraint conditions through less withdrawal of water consumption of water resources can also be reduced determining the optimal depth of irrigation and observing application of this depth in relation to the full irrigation can significantly contribute to saving irrigation water consumption meanwhile because of the possibility of increasing the area under cultivation the total net income of farmers can also be enhanced considerably in the present study optimum amounts of water and potassium fertilizer for roselle production were investigated in sistan plain southeast of iran according to the results of this study the quadratic function is the most appropriate function for the prediction of the roselle function in the sistan plain then the estimated responses of this function used for economic analysis generally the optimum amounts of water were various in different irrigation levels however the yield was increased by increasing the potassium fertilizer amount the final production index in relation to the minimum and maximum water depths was 1 4 and 0 86 kg per every centimeter of the water depth respectively the final production index in relation to the minimum and maximum potassium fertilizer use was calculated 3 92 and 3 77 kg respectively the results also showed that by applying low irrigation under water constraint conditions the optimal depth of consumed water in relation to the maximum depth at 75 112 5 and 150 kg of potassium fertilizer per hectare offered 13 29 14 34 and 13 1 cm reduction of water consumption as can be seen increase in potassium fertilizer up to 75 resulted in greater saving of water consumption considering water deficit in sistan region determination of the optimal irrigation depth can significantly help in saving water in this region and increasing the areas under cultivation credit authorship contribution statement this work was carried out in collaboration between all

9386,the limitations of water resources in supplying the demands of consumer sectors including drinking hygiene and healthcare agriculture industry as well as environment well reflect the importance of proper use of water thus it is essential to choose an optimal and superior strategy to use water under water deficit conditions this experiment was implemented as split plot in a fully randomized block design in a research farm in the southeast of iran on roselle plant the experimental treatments included three levels of potassium fertilizer 75 t ha 1 k1 112 5 t ha 1 k2 and 150 t ha k3 equivalent to 50 75 and 100 of potassium fertilizer requierment and four levels of irrigation water including 40 60 80 and 100 of the plant water requierment l1 l2 l3 and l4 the main aim of the research was to estimate the production function as well as to calculate the index and optimal depths of consumed water regression analyses were done by linear cobb douglas quadratic and transcendental functional forms of roselle production the final production indicators in relation to the water depth and potassium fertilizer the final rate of technical substitution for potassium fertilizer and water depth and the final production value in relation to water depth and potassium fertilizer were calculated the results indicated that the quadratic function was chosen as the superior function the final production index in relation to the minimum water depth was 1 4 and for maximum water depth was 0 86 kg cm 1 of water depth the final production index in relation to the minimum and maximum potassium fertilizer was calculated as 3 92 and 1 77 kg respectively the results also showed that by applying deficit irrigation under water constraint conditions the optimal depths of consumed water in relation to the maximum depth at 75 112 5 and 150 kg levels of potassium fertilizer per hectare had 13 29 14 34 and 13 1 cm reduction of water consumption respectively as can be seen elevation of potassium fertilizer up to 75 resulted in more saving of water consumption use of potassium fertilizer can modify the damages resulting from drought stress in roselle keywords final value of production final production index deficit irrigation rate of technical substitution 1 introduction in recent years the effect of agricultural systems on the environment has sparked concerns among scientists and policymakers of different countries in iran because of the inexpensiveness of fertilizers as well as their easy preparation by farmers they are used indiscriminately which in response to leaching causes contamination of groundwater and surface water and eventually the environment ten berge et al 2000 the importance of environmental view to consuming chemical fertilizer and water inputs has sparked extensive research on optimization of consumption pattern of these two inputs bailey et al 1999 optimal use of water and fertilizers is one of the most important agricultural purposes especially in dry regions because of deficit of water resources and contamination of such resources playan and faci 1997 the aim of optimizing water and fertilizer consumption is achieving the maximum performance or income with minimum amount of water and fertilizer consumed the optimal depth of irrigation water varies across different conditions and will be obtained when the maximum net income could be achieved in response to irrigation water depth in order to determine the optimal depth various tools are required including the crop production function in relation to irrigation water or its derivatives fixed and variable costs the crop price and information related to the land and water constraints in the literature two methods have been mentioned for estimating the water yield production functions the first method offers the water yield relationship quantitatively based on theoretical and experimental models in the second method the production functions are estimated in response to different amounts of water on the yield of plants resulting from farm observations or through statistical analysis datta 1998 by estimating the production function the relative effect of each of the mentioned variables can be calculated and determined quantitatively on the variations of production and crop income evidently presence of each of the water and fertilizer inputs is essential for the development and enhancement of yield where the deficit of any of them can affect the efficiency of the other when the water used through irrigation is lower than the plant s water demand use of fertilizer based on complete irrigation causes higher potential of groundwater pollution in the future although with increasing the amount of water and fertilizer the dry substance yield increases pandey et al 2000 overuse of these two inputs would cause loss of resources and creation of environmental pollution pang and letey 1998 fertilizers should be consumed based on a nutritional management program which considers all available nutritional elements in the farm the time of consumption of fertilizers is also important as the plants needs differ across various developmental stages the most effective and efficient fertilizer dispersion management is achieved when adequate amounts of nutrients soluble in humid soil could be provided tp the plant with proper ventilation during the plant s development stage and during th days when the plant demands more nutrients irrigation water is the fastest most effective and least expensive means of achieving these objectives this fertilizer management technique in which fertilizer is used alongside irrigation water is called fertigation fertigation causes enhanced yield and efficient of both water as well as fertilizer consumption traore et al 2000 although fertigation is more common in pressurized irrigation systems because of higher irrigation efficiency recent research has paved the way for use of this efficient method of fertilizer dispersion in surface irrigation hou et al 2007 it is predicted that in the future surface irrigation would be one of the most common water supply systems in agricultural lands and fertigation would be recognized as one of the solutions to enhance the yields of agricultural crops this is because conventional methods surface dispersion are first expensive and secondly they can be dispersed only in a short period of the growth season this highlights the necessity of conducting research on fertigation with surface irrigation systems various studies have shown that use of potassium fertilizer under water stress conditions can compensate for part of the water stress incurred to the plant faroqoi and bssreeramu 2004 mohamed and ashok 2014 when optimal amount of water and fertilizer is given to a plant acceptable economic performance can be achieved hassan 2001 fertilizers must be transported via water it is not possible to consider fertilizer and irrigation water applications separately therefore the effects of fertilizer together with the water on the crop yield can be determined by crop water production functions it is important to determine the amount of water for optimum fertilizer uptake by plants for each application water and fertilizer are the most important inputs in crop production therefore they must be used effectively for optimum crop production ertek 2014 the statistical functions as a proper mean used to determine the optimum amount of water and potassium for different cropping systems in these functions data driven from water or other agriculture inputs can be fitted to determine the optimum rates of the mentioned input be langer et al 2000 even though selection of the best function is not simple and depends on the local farming situation so the choice of the best function is considered a basic step in utilizing the statistical functions obviously based on the literature the functions had different inputs but the main output of these is crop yield despite of its simplicity the linear has less accuracy than the other functions although some studies confirm that the linear function is the best function for estimating biomass by water bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 datta et al 1998 assessed responses of wheat to the amount and quality of water and salinity of the soil they stated that the quadratic functions estimate more accurately wheat s yield than linear and c d functions the quadratic function was considered in the estimation of crop yield in different researches amon armah et al 2015 bullock and bullock 1994 boyer et al 2012 as this function can show the decline of crop yield when n or water applied beyond an optimum amount lyons et al 2019 although by utilization of the quadratic function the yield and optimum amount of inputs such as n are estimated too high tumusiime et al 2011 lyons et al 2019 had assessed various functions by using the results of conducted experiments on winter cereals they concluded that the quadratic plateau is best for determining the most economic rate of n of forage winter cereal lu et al 2004 in their study also stated that the quadratic function is ppropriate to determine the optimal irrigation depth of the plant moosavi fazl et al with the aim of determining the production function and optimal depth of water as well as fertilizer the effect of potassium fertilizer was examined under water stress conditions on forage sorghum plant they found that the best yield was achieved from fertigation treatment with 100 level which had no significant difference with the 75 irrigation level they also concluded that from among four studied functions the second order function would better estimate the sorghum yield under concurrent water stress and potassium fertilizer conditions out of four functions of linear production logarithmic exponential and quadratic functions piri 2017 chose the quadratic function as the superior function for water fertilizer and yield application of proper irrigation management and cultivation of drought resistant plants to maintain the soil humidity reserves as well as enhance the water retention capacity in soil are among the effective measures to boost the efficiency of irrigation and thus improve the exploitation of limited water resources roselle is a drought resistant plant roselle with the scientific name of hibiscus sabdariffa belongs to the malvaceae family native to africa it is cultivated in all tropical and warm regions and is notable as an medicinal herb aziz et al 2007 in iran roselle is mainly cultivated in sistan and balouchestan province approximately 300 ha with a mean dry yield of 700 900 kg ha 1 sistan region in the north of sistan and baluchistan province is one of the important regions of the province in producing roselle water deficit in sistan plane is very serious the only water source of the region is hirmand river which originates from baba yaghma mountains in afghanistan the water crisis of the region results from more deficit in this river such that failure of hirmand water supply has led to devastation of agriculture in the region thus considering the water deficit in the region cultivating plants that are resistant to water stress as well as managing its irrigation such that it would have no effect on the quantitative and qualitative yield of the plant are very important agricultural water management strategies are focused especially on fertilizer application and soil water conservation in dry areas yield decline caused by water shortage in dry areas can be compensated for to some extent through fertilization however the effects of fertilizers are limited due to available water li et al 2016 if enough water is absent in the root zone to dissolve the fertilizer and carry it to the upper parts of plant a large amount of fertilizer will remain in the soil and will not be useful to the plants the remaining portion of the fertilizer in the soil will cause environmental pollution therefore the suitable amount of water needed for the plants to receive the fertilizer should be known the yield response factor equation can be rewritten as the et fertilizer response factor to determine the most appropriate water and fertilizer rate this study was conducted to determine the best production function at different levels of irrigation and consumption of potassium fertilizer in sistan region to determine the optimal depth of irrigation and fertilizer consumption while saving water and fertilizer consumption minimize crop yields thus in this research has done first to derive equations for determination of water and potassium levels leading to maximum yield or profit whith limited water and land conditions then these derived equations are applied to roselle experimental field data and the optimal levels of water and potassium are determined 2 material and methods 2 1 site of experimentation this research was performed in 2019 and 2020 in chahnimeh research complex located in sistan and baluchistan province 61 67 e 30 89 n and 480 m above the sea southeast of iran the studied region has a dry and warm climate in which the precipitation level is less than 60 mm per year due to the high evaporation and perspiration potential in the region about 3500 mm interest in cultivating drought resistant plants has increased among the farmers 2 2 the soil of the experimental site in order to determine the physical and chemical properties of soil some samples were taken from depths 0 30 and 30 60 cm whereby these properties were determined in the laboratory table 1 phosphorus was measured by olsen method olsen and sommers 1982 potassium by normal ammonium acetate olsen and sommers 1982 and total nitrogen through kjeldahl method further walkley black method was employed to determine the organic content of soil hydraulic conduction and soil ph were measured by ec meter and ph meter respectively finally the quality of the utilized water was also tested before the cultivation whose results are provided in table 2 2 3 experimental design the present research was implemented as split plot based on a fully randomized design with three replications the treatments included four levels of irrigation water depth i1 i2 i3 and i4 representing 40 60 80 and 100 and three potassium fertilizer levels k1 k2 and k3 equivalent to 50 75 and 100 of the potassium fertilizer requierment as the secondary court the dimensions of plot were considered 3 4 m and the distance between plots was regarded 1 m in every plot five furrows and ridges were made and the seeds were cultivated at 3 cm deep in the soil with 25 cm intervals from each other on the rows the distance between the plant rows was considered 75 cm the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer requierment during the cultivation season was determined according to the soil analysis results the nitrogen fertilizer was added to the soil from a urea source by 200 kg ha 1 in three stages one third concurrent with cultivation one third of the growth stage branching and one third at flowering time 50 of the plant flowering the potassium fertilizer was added as potassium sulfate concurrent with cultivation at three levels 75 112 5 and 150 kg ha 1 equivalent to 50 75 and 100 of the potassium fertilizer requierment finally phosphorus fertilizer was added to the soil as triple superphosphate by 100 kg ha 1 concurrent with cultivation 2 4 irrigation calculations the level of irrigation water before every irrigation was determined using relation 1 liu et al 2006 1 d i 1 n θ fci θ i z in this equation d represents irrigation depth m θ fci and θ i denotes the volumetric moisture of the soil in field capacity and before irrigation in layer i 1 z represents the layer thickness m and n is the number of soil layer by obtaining the irrigation water depth at every time using relation 1 the volume required for every plot was calculated through multiplying the obtained depth by the plot area it was measured using the counters installed on each of the water delivery pipes and provided to the plant the water volume of other treatments was determined and applied according to this volume 2 5 production functions a production function is a relation between input and output in a system in this study the yield of roselle was considered as the output and different amounts of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer were regarded as the input parameters also the other effective factors on yield are assumed to be constant so the other factors that can affect crop yield are assumed to be unchanged as a result the general form of the production function is expressed using the following equation 2 y f i k where y which is the function of the roselle t ha 1 f is a function of the amount of irrigation water i cm and the amount of potassium fertilizer k kg ha 1 samples of product were taken in the first year on 27 november and in the second year on 5 december three rows of plants were taken from the middle of every plot while removing the marginal effect whereby the parameters were measured on these samples in order to measure the yield plant capsules were removed from the shrubs and dried in ambient air to express the effects of applied irrigation water and potassium amount on the crop yield four statistical functions linear cobb douglas quadratic and transcendental were fitted to the data were recorded for each of the irrigation methods the equations were as follows linear function 3 y α β 1 i β 2 k cobb douglas function 4 y α i β 1 k β 2 quadratic function 5 y α β 1 i β 2 k β 3 i 2 β 4 k 2 β 5 i k transcendental function 6 y α i β 1 k β 2 exp β 3 i β 4 k in these equations i is the amount of irrigation water cm k is the amount of potassium fertilizer kg ha 1 α and β are function coefficients to be calculated and y is the amount of roselle yield the ordinary least square ols technique was utilized for the estimation of the coefficients of the mentioned functions then to compare and evaluate the functions five statistical indexes including root mean square error rmse the efficiency of the function ef maximum error me coefficient of residual mass crm and coefficient of 214 explanation r2 were derived from the following equations 7 r 2 i 1 n y mi y y pi y

are the measured and predicted yield amounts respectively is the average of observed yield and n is the number of observation as a result the mean values of rmse ef me crm and r2 have been calculated to compare the functions performances of three irrigation methods lower values of mean me rmse and crm and higher values of the mean of ef and r2 are expected for the better functions of the onion production in this research homaee et al 2002 2 6 determining the yield sensitivity factor ky based on doorenbos and kassam model doorenbos and kassam 1979 proposed the following linear relationship between the relative losses of crop yield and crop evapotranspiration this model measures the variations in relative yield reduction in relation to the relative changes of perspiration and evaporation and associates them to each other through a coefficient called ky piri et al 2017 12 1 y a y max k y 1 et a et max in this relation ymax represents the maximum amount of crop produced with no water constraint kg ya is the real value of the produced crop kg et denotes real evaporation and perspiration mm etmax shows the maximum amount of evaporation and perspiration mm and ky represents the sensitivity coefficient 2 7 evaluation of performance evaluation indicators after the determining of the best production function to investigate the effects of separate and combined applications of fertilizers and irrigation water levels on the yield of roselle the marginal production of irrigation water mp i and pottassium fertilizer mp k the marginal rate of technical of substitution of k and irrigation water depth mrtsi k the marginal value product of the irrigation water vmp i and the potassium fertilizer vmp k were used these indices were determined by the selected production function

best predictor production function 2 8 determining the optimal depths using the superior function chosen quadratic function the optimal irrigation depths were calculated for this purpose in the production function obtained the amount of potassium fertilizer consumption was considered constant and the above equation was changed into a second order equation of the irrigation water level eq 18

cost function in relation to the irrigation water depth rials ha 1 a1 b1 c1 a2 and b2 are constant coefficients that are determined based on the type of crop irrigation water depth as well as income and costs 2 9 calculating the index of irrigation depths the depth of water consumed under land constraint conditions was obtained from eq 20 piri et al 2017 20 w l b 2 p c b 1 2 p c c 1 to calculate the consumed water depth of the plant under water constraint conditions eq 21 was used piri et al 2017 21 w w p c a 1 a 2 p c c 1 0 5 to obtain the maximum irrigation equivalent depth initially the

mentioned relations a1 a2 b1 b2 and c1 are constant coefficients determined based on irrigation water depth as well as income and costs pc is the crop price in terms of rials per every kilogram 500000 rials 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield analysis analysis of variance of the studied characteristics is presented in table 3 further comparison of the mean properties using duncan test is reported in table 4 in these tables the results have been presented in yield generally the crop yield had been significantly affected by the level of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer further due to the equality of environmental conditions the year of cultivation did not have any significant effect on yeild table 3 the yield was increased with reduction the irrigation water depth up to l3 treatment but there was no significant difference between l4 and l3 in this regard with further reduction of the water depth l2 and l1 treatments the dry yield decreased the maximum dry yield 583 69 kg ha 1 was observed in l3 and the minimum 379 01 kg ha 1 in l1 table 4 with decrease in the amount of potassium used the yeild decreased the largest values of yeild were obtained in k3 and the minimum in k1 the highest dry yield 519 94 kg ha 1 was achieved in k3 table 4 the interaction effect of k and irrigation had a significant effect on the yield table 3 specifically the maximum yield was obtained from l3k3 treatment by as much as 600 95 kg ha 1 and the minimum yield was achieved in l1k1 treatment with 342 42kg ha 1 there was no significant difference between i3k3 and i3k2 treatments in this regard fig 1 liu et al 2021 in the their research stated again the maximum yield was obtained in the treatment with the maximum water and fertilizer while the minimum yield was found in the treatment without fertilizer and etc60 under mild and severe water stress increase in potassium fertilizer use would to some extent cause plant tolerance against the negative effect of water deficit on the plant yield in other words use of proper amounts of potassium fertilizer can promote the plants coping with water stress these results are in line with megyest et al potassium increases the plant tolerance to environmental stress production of starch and carbohydrate as well as plant strength and its desired value is required for optimal growth pahlavan et al 2006 thus use of potassium fertilizer could mitigate the adverse effects of water stress to some extent on the other hand in case the water stress is severe the role of potassium fertilizer diminishes with increasing of the level of water stress yield compensation by potassium fertilizer decreased these results concur with the findings of mohammad and ashok 2014 as well as farooqi and bssreeramu 2004 who believe that use of fertilizers especially potassium can compensate part of water stress it seems that the combination of the use of nutritional sources and irrigation has caused the plant not to face a shortage of food resources during the growing season and on the other hand has used the existing conditions in favor of the production of yield components and yield 3 2 production functions the results of estimating the production function coefficients are given in table 5 and the relationships between estimated and measured yield for the 2 years of the experiment are reported in fig 2 also the statistical parameters required for evaluating the validity of the obtained functions regarding the buffer function are given in table 6 the f value was also used to determine the significance f value indicates the general significance of the function if the f statistic of the coefficient was significant this indicates that the general fit of the regression function and the number of the function s residuals are acceptable table 6 also the function performance indices include rmse ef me crm and r2 are presented in table 7 as shown in table 6 based on the final ranking the quadratic function was considered as more appropriate concerning other functions used transcendental cobb douglas and linear functions were ranked second to fourth respectively given the fact that the larger me values the weaker the performance of the model in estimating the crop yield table 6 suggests that the quadratic function with the minimum me 26 2 has offered the best estimation for the crop yield the minimum numerical value rmse 2 7 is also related to the quadratic function suggesting that this function has estimated the yield with the minimum difference in relation to its real value further the high values of the determination coefficient r2 0 97 and the efficiency of the ef model 0 64 also reflect the robustness and high efficiency of the quadratic function in estimating the values of interest piri et al who researched determination of the superior function for yield water fertilizer for sorghum plant also reached similar findings and chose the quadratic function as the superior function zand parsa and sepaskhah 2001 utilized the quadratic function to describe the relationship between water nitrogen and corn yield therefore considering the above results and taking into account the final rating the quadratic function performed best in estimating in the mixed conditions of applying different levels of potassium and irrigation water in the sistan region datta et al 1998 and russo and bakker 1986 resulted in the quadratic production function provide a better fit to the data for wheat sweet corn and cotton also tageldin 2005 showed that the quadratic function is appropriate in maize yield estimation however boyer et al 2012 confirmed that the quadratic function is a proper switchgrass yield estimator in some landscapes in tennessee besides kiani and abbasi 2009 introduced this function as the supreme function of wheat production based on soil moisture and salinity but tumusiime et al 2011 stated that the quadratic function was not suitable for determining the yield nitrogen fertilizer function for the forage and used the linear function to determine the optimal irrigation depth on the other hand neghassi et al 1975 and singh et al 1987 reported that linear form of production for wheat is more useful our data suggests that quadratic to have a better fit than linear form 3 3 sensitivity coefficient in order to determine the yield sensitivity coefficient the doorenbos and kassam sensitivity model was used fig 3 indicates this model the sensitivity coefficient for the dry yield of hibiscus tea was obtained 1 18 the value of sensitivity of the crop yield differs depending on climatic local soil crop conditions as well as farming management and irrigation program in this regard fao stated its value 0 2 1 15 while the international agency of nuclear energy as 0 08 1 75 moutonnet et al 2002 roselle yield response to water stress was obtained from the relationship between yield reduction and the corresponding et deficit fig 3 a poor relation between these two variables was obtained from the pooled data r2 0 0 36 the slope ky the yield response factor obtained for roselle in the study location was 1 18 this value is comparatively lower than the values reported by çakir 2004 1 25 doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 29 and payero et al 2009 1 50 for maize but is similar to that reported in some studies karam et al 2003 kuscu et al 2013 as ky represents a measure of the relative sensitivity of a crop to drought in a particular environment ferreira and gonçalves 2007 k y 1 18 accounts for a yield reduction of 1 18 g per mm of et deficit ky 1 indicates that deficit irrigation can be employed as an effective and practical water management strategy araya et al 2011 stated that ky 1 indicate that the crop is sensitive to moisture stress also the hibiscus tea is known as a drought resistant plant aziz et al 2007 this research obtained ky 1 suggesting that in the studied region the plant can tolerate drought to some extent beyond which the yield diminishes this can be attributed to the climatic conditions of the region as well as the length of the plant development cultivation of this plant occurs in mid to late may and it is harvested in december five months of the development period of this plant fall in spring and summer during which sistan region is very warm and 120 day winds blow causing higher evaporation and perspiration these causes increased amount of water consumed by the plant and in turn severity of the stresses resulting from water deficit greavesa et al 2017 showed that maize yield response to water stress ky was as 0 92 suggesting the environmental conditions are conducive for implementing deficit irrigation strategies 3 4 indicators of marginal production of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer the marginal production of irrigation mpi and potassium fertilizer mpk of two factors of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer quantities are given in table 8 according to table 8 while assuming irrigation water depth constant mpx index was obtained as 3 92 and 3 77 kg per 75 and 150 kg hectare 1 of potassium fertilizer respectively the results also showed that consumption of potassium fertilizer at complete level k3 treatment under water stress conditions caused diminished yield thus use of potassium fertilizer could reduce the detrimental effects of water stress to some extent in case water stress is severe the role of potassium fertilizer decreases these results concur with the findings of mohammad and ashuk 2014 as well as faroqoi and bssreeramu 2004 who believe that use of fertilizers especially potassium can compensate part of water stress the final yield the production index of hibiscus tea in relation to irrigation water depth mpi assuming constancy of potassium fertilizer for the minimum irrigation water depth 72 8 cm was obtained 1 4 kg per 1 cm of the water depth this means that per every 1 cm of increase in the irrigation water depth the yield will grow by 1 4 kg the value of this index for the maximum irrigation water depth 182 0 cm was equivalent to 0 86 kg per every 1 cm of water depth table 8 the negativity of this index for the maximum irrigation water depth in relation to the minimum water depth suggests diminished yield per increase in the irrigation water depth at high levels of radiation it also suggests that the slope of yield elevation is greater during low irrigation compared to high irrigation and excessive irrigation results in diminished yield when the soil air exchange becomes limited in response to heavy irrigation with water and nutrient absorption slowing down the root respiration becomes vulnerable whereby the roots development becomes limited causing stimulation of toxins and degradation of hormone metabolism all these result in decreased plant growth and hence reduced flowering in the shrub also under these conditions the leaves and flowers fall hassanzadeh and giasi 2008 for this reason the yield was lower in i4 treatment compared to i3 piri et al 2017 who researched sorghhum production function at values beyond the plant water demand also reached similar findings nadler 2006 as well as neilsen and vigili 2005 also reported similar results and stated that excessive irrigation causes diminished yield ghodke et al 2018 stated a part of yield decreasing may result from temporary waterlogging in the soil in fact applying water more than the plant requirement can be caused to nitrogen leaching especially by fi similar results were obtained by sharma et al 2012 from furrow irrigated onion besides in their research piri et al 2017 found similar results about the production function of sorghum over the plant s water requirement fig 4 displays the changes in hibiscus tea yield in relation to different levels of irrigation water y i and potassium fertilizer y k as seen in the figure with reduction in the amount of potassium fertilizer and irrigation water depth the yield has diminished however by increasing the potassium fertilizer under low irradiation water depths part of this reduction can be compensated thus it can be said that under low irrigation conditions by increasing the amount of potassium fertilizer less yield reduction is possible nevertheless as observed in table 7 consumption of potassium fertilizer should not be complete under these conditions rather an increase in potassium fertilizer under water stress conditions up to a certain level can cause reduction of the losses resulting from water stress also fig 4 shows that the yield reacts more dramatically under water stress conditions and with increase in the amount of irrigation water the ascending trend of the yield slows down thus if in regions where irrigation is complete part of the water is saved the yield would not change considerably and if this saved water reaches a plant subject to drought conditions increase of yield will be greater mousavifazl et al in their research on the effect of potassium fertilizer in low irrigations concluded that reduction of yield in response to diminished irrigation water depth can be compensated through increasing the amount of potassium fertilizer in table 9 the yield final production index in relation to the mean irrigation water depth mpi indicated that with 1 cm increase in the depth of irrigation water compared to the mean depth while assuming constant level of potassium fertilizer 112 5 kg hectare 1 the dry yield of roselle increased by 0 9 kg further considering the dry yield final production index of roselle in relation to potassium fertilizer mpk with one unit increase in potassium fertilizer from the mean value and while assuming the irrigation water depth as constant 124 7 cm the yield grows by 3 1 kg on average the final rate of technical substitution of potassium fertilizer instead of irrigation water mrts in relation to the yield indicated that in order for the yield to remain constant with one unit reduction of irrigation water the amount of potassium fertilizer should increase by 3 4 kg per every centimeter of irrigation water considering the price of 1 kg of roselle in 2019 as 500000 rials the production value of both irrigation water depth and potassium fertilizer can be obtained the final production value in relation to the irrigation water depth for hibiscus tea is 450000 rials indicating the income resulting from enhanced production in response to increasing every centimeter of the irrigation water depth in relation to the mean irrigation water depth further the final production value in relation to potassium fertilizer for roselle iwas obtained 1550000 rials indicating the income obtained from higher production in response to increasing every unit of potassium fertilizer in relation to the mean potassium fertilizer value consumed the results indicated that the income obtained from raising the content of potassium fertilizer was higher that the income gained from deepening the irrigation water depth 3 5 index of irrigation depths by having water function the cost of index depths optimal irrigation depth under land constraint conditions wl optimal irrigation depth under water constraint conditions ww the maximum irrigation equivalent depth wcl and maximum water depth consumed wm were calculated while assuming the amount of consumed fertilizer constant table 10 with increase in the amount of potassium fertilizer across various low irrigation treatments the optimal irrigation depth increased also with elevating the content of potassium fertilizer the difference of optimal irrigation depth diminished between water constraint ww and land constraint wl conditions this is due to reduced crops at high levels of potassium fertilizer at large levels of potassium consumption because of water deficit the severity of stressors incurred to the plant increases thus at high levels of fertilizer consumption low irrigation loses its efficiency and will not be economical it is also observed that by applying low irrigation under land constraint conditions the optimal depth of consumed water wm in relation to the maximum equivalent depth of consumption wcl shows lower water consumption by 2 5 4 5 and 3 5 cm in k1 k2 and k3 treatments respectively and under water constraint conditions it presented diminished water consumption by 13 29 14 34 and 13 1 cm respectively as can be seen increase in potassium fertilizer up to 75 has resulted in greater saving of water consumption naderian far 2016 in their research on determining the water yield basil function under water stress and nano fertilizer also reached similar findings they stated that with low irrigation under water constraint conditions for maximum use of the water volume unit the optimal depth of consumed water compared to the maximum irrigation would diminish by 20 himmatrao malve et al 2016 used the quadratic function to determine the optimal water depth the results of their research showed that the economic optima of level of irrigation that will maximize the net return under prevailing prices worked out to be 382 8 mmha 1 with grain yields of 4693 kg ha 1 accordingly it was observed that in response to low irrigation of roselle compared to the maximum irrigation some water is saved based on the depth of water saved a new level can be cultivated and the total yield could be enhanced thereby raising the income also since the main problem in the sistan region is water deficit determining the optimal depth in these conditions can resolve this problem to some extent 3 6 the impact of applying optimal irrigation depth on saving the consumption of water resources to explore the impact of applying optimal depth on saving consumption of water resources so that the volume of the saved water for helping sustainable reservation of water resources would not be withdrawn for irrigation of more lands the volumes of saved water resulting from applying the optimal irrigation depth under water resource constraints in relation to the complete irrigation depth the volume percentage of saved water in relation to complete irrigation and the percentage of decreased net income compared to complete irrigation per unit of area hectare were calculated for all three values of potassium fertilizer table 11 the results showed that with the rise in the amount of potassium fertilizer because of the increase in the optimal irrigation depth the volume of saved water has shrunken the percentage of reduction in the net income in relation to the maximum irrigation was obtained negative in k3 and k2 treatments this suggests that use of irrigation water as much as complete irrigation depth has caused reduction of net income and usage of optimal depth for irrigation has offered greater profit the percentage of income reduction in relation to complete irrigation was positive in k1 treatment in this treatment the amount of fertilizer used was low causing diminished yield and income the percentage of reduction of the net income in relation to complete irrigation was lower in k2 treatment as compared to the other two treatments suggesting that this treatment has been more economical than the two others as observed in table 4 k2 treatment did not differ significantly with k3 regarding yield meanwhile consumption of this amount of fertilizer k2 treatment led to decreased irrigation water depth compared to k3 treatment thus the production cost dropped in k2 treatment compared to k3 causing enhanced income in this treatment compared to the others overall the results indicated that use of optimal depth instead of complete irrigation depth and nonuse of saved values for helping more sustainable reservation of water resources are economical 3 7 iso yield curve this curve indicates the geometric position of various combinations of irrigation water depth and potassium fertilizer which have the same yield in the roselle production process fig 5 displays the iso yield curve resulting from the output of a second order function in this curve at a specific water depth value as the amount of potassium fertilizer used increases so does the yield further in order for the yield to grow at a constant value of fertilizer consumption the irrigation water depth should be incremented for example if 110 kgha 1 potassium fertilizer is consumed to produce 530 kg ha 1 roselle 113 cm water should be consumed now if you want to produce 540 kg ha 1 hibiscus tea with this same amount of potassium fertilizer 125 cm water should be consumed based on the obtained results it can be stated that the crop yield is a function of two variables fertilizer and amount of irrigation water where one dimensional view to the effect of each of these variables does not match reality in this regard wang et al nadler et al 2006 and kiani et al reached similar results 4 conclusion considering water crisis and for optimal use of water in the agricultural sector the index of irrigation depths should be calculated for all farming and gardening crops along with application of deficit irrigation under water resource constraints reduction of water consumption in deficit irrigation treatments compared to full irrigation contributed to saving water through the saved water in case there is no land constraint more lands can be introduced for production under water constraint conditions through less withdrawal of water consumption of water resources can also be reduced determining the optimal depth of irrigation and observing application of this depth in relation to the full irrigation can significantly contribute to saving irrigation water consumption meanwhile because of the possibility of increasing the area under cultivation the total net income of farmers can also be enhanced considerably in the present study optimum amounts of water and potassium fertilizer for roselle production were investigated in sistan plain southeast of iran according to the results of this study the quadratic function is the most appropriate function for the prediction of the roselle function in the sistan plain then the estimated responses of this function used for economic analysis generally the optimum amounts of water were various in different irrigation levels however the yield was increased by increasing the potassium fertilizer amount the final production index in relation to the minimum and maximum water depths was 1 4 and 0 86 kg per every centimeter of the water depth respectively the final production index in relation to the minimum and maximum potassium fertilizer use was calculated 3 92 and 3 77 kg respectively the results also showed that by applying low irrigation under water constraint conditions the optimal depth of consumed water in relation to the maximum depth at 75 112 5 and 150 kg of potassium fertilizer per hectare offered 13 29 14 34 and 13 1 cm reduction of water consumption as can be seen increase in potassium fertilizer up to 75 resulted in greater saving of water consumption considering water deficit in sistan region determination of the optimal irrigation depth can significantly help in saving water in this region and increasing the areas under cultivation credit authorship contribution statement this work was carried out in collaboration between all

9387,soil desiccation occurs widely across china s loess plateau due to long term water demand in excess of water supply hydraulic redistribution hr the movement of water from wet to dry soil via roots and canopy dew cd are crucial to water replenishment in dryland ecosystems however much is still not known about the response of cd and hr to soil water deficits including no deficit slight deficit moderate deficit and severe deficit water conditions in dryland jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations in china s hilly loess region to this end the duration and intensity of dew were monitored using dielectric leaf wetness sensors to better understand the effects of soil water status on dew also soil water content sap ﬂow and meteorological variables were measured during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the results showed that the time of occurrence of cd under the no deficit condition came earlier than the time of occurrence of cd under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions peak cd appeared at 5 00 6 30 am and ended at 6 30 9 00 am local time under the four soil water conditions the amount duration and frequency of cd decreased with increasing soil water deficit the amount and duration of cd under the no deficit condition were significantly higher than under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 the amount and frequency of hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer increased with increasing soil water deficit under the no deficit condition hr was significantly lower than under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 while hr was influenced by cd cd enhanced hr under the no deficit condition but inhibited hr under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions for the growing season the contribution of cd to total actual evapotranspiration etc act cd etc act ratio was highest under the no deficit condition maximum cd etc act ratio of 0 21 the contribution of hr to etc act hr etc act ratio was higher under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions maximum of 0 11 the mutual effects of cd and hr lessened soil water deficit making them important ecohydrological processes affecting the response of dryland jujube plantations to soil desiccation keywords actual evapotranspiration ecohydrological effects soil desiccation water balance semi arid region 1 introduction china s loess plateau is a typical arid and semi arid region where rainfall is the only source of soil water for dryland farming xin et al 2011 this hilly loess terrain has seen a significant decline in soil water during the last 50 years xin et al 2011 large scale anthropogenic plantings of vegetation can absorb soil water from deep in the soil profile to maintain growth needs during the dry season the insufficient rainwater supply hardly replenishes deep soil water in the long term leading to a continuous uptake of soil water to develop a utilization type of soil desiccation shao et al 2016 this pronounced hydrological phenomenon is specific to china s loess plateau liu and diamond 2005 yan et al 2015 infiltrating precipitation in the loess soil region finds it difficult to reach a soil layer where soil water is used by evapotranspiration wang et al 2015 the result is soil desiccation that leaves a thick soil layer with a huge long term water deficit shao et al 2016 however soil water is critical for soil microbial respiration the biogeochemical cycle and the maintenance of bio atmospheric and hydrological processes sun et al 2020 liu et al 2018b soil desiccation directly affects ecosystem productivity and restoration of damaged ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions abaker et al 2017 in response to soil and leaf water potential gradients soil water absorbed by plant roots flows through the xylem system to reach the plant canopy from where it is transpired into the atmosphere through leaf stomata however in cases where the water potential of plant roots is lower than the soil water potential the root system also releases absorbed water into dry soil in a process called hydraulic redistribution hr bazihizina et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 hr is a process driven by the water potential gradient and it is the redistribution of soil water by plant roots causing soil water to flow upward downward or laterally this water can be absorbed and utilized by plants in order to maintain the water balance of plants by rewetting the surface layer at night in the dry season gaines et al 2016 priyadarshini et al 2016 prieto and ryel 2014 hr can occur in any ecosystem and for any plant species everywhere in the world neumann and cardon 2012 it can increase transpiration and photosynthetic rate in dry seasons increase plant nutrient uptake in shallow soil maintain active microbes or stimulate microbial activity prolong the life span of fine roots maintain root soil contact in dry soils and move the non evaporated precipitation on the soil surface down to deeper soil layers neumann and cardon 2012 in addition hr is a vital mechanism that drives energy and water partitioning and the biogeochemical cycle luo et al 2016 neumann et al 2014 quijano and kumar 2016 in arid and semi arid ecosystems where soil water is scarce dew is a common and significant water resource accounting for 4 5 64 0 of the local rainfall hanisch et al 2015 hao

meteorology plant physiology agriculture and ecology groh et al 2018 hanisch et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 many scholars have studied the formation occurrence conditions influencing factors and

muselli et al 2009 the thin water layer or water droplets formed by dew on leaf surfaces can be used as a supplementary plant water source under soil water deficit conditions and this water can be absorbed and utilized by plants dawson and goldsmith 2018 dew can reduce vapor pressure deficit and transpiration change the energy balance of the plant canopy maintain carbon dioxide absorption and improve water use efficiency konrad et al 2015 wang et al 2017a dew on leaf surfaces can transport solutes inside leaves burkhardt et al 2012 this process can drive key nutrients to be absorbed and used by leaves fernandez and eichert 2009 concurrently water absorbed by leaves can promote cell expansion by increasing turgor pressure and thereby promote stem and leaf growth dawson and goldsmith 2018 in addition the long term presence of dew on plant leaves can cause propagation of fungal pathogens and leaching of nutrients that can harm leaves and fruits of plants dawson and goldsmith 2018 rowlandson et al 2015 hr only occurs at night when transpiration is negligible and a water potential gradient exists within the soil root canopy system bazihizina et al 2017 dew on plant leaves creates a temporary humid environment at the leaf air boundary gerlein safdi et al 2018a 2018b deposited dew on plant leaves can be directly absorbed and utilized through the leaf cuticle stomata and other specialized plant organs berry et al 2019 fernandez et al 2017 water absorbed by leaves increases leaf water potential limm et al 2009 and the absorbed water can even be transported to the soil near the root zone through xylem vessels thereby changing the soil water potential cassana et al 2016 eller et al 2013 the changed leaf water potential or soil water potential will change the water potential gradient between the soil roots and canopy of a plant and then affect hr in short the occurrence of dew will affect hr the loess plateau has experienced significant warming 1 9 c 50 yr and drying 47 6 mm 50 yr trends wang et al 2012 this warming and drying of the climate is not conducive to increasing soil water and also accelerates the consumption of soil water by vegetation resulting in new and increasingly serious soil desiccation such that the spatial distribution of the soil dry layer continues to increase shao et al 2016 soil desiccation is particularly obvious in the loess hilly region of china the dryland jujube plantation is a typical soil desiccation area in the loess hilly region of china in this region the dry soil layer is up to 3 4 m deep due to rainfall being unable to meet the transpiration water demand of jujube and this has affected hr and the regional hydrological cycle wang et al 2015 soil condensation and dew are common forms of condensation soil condensation is more likely than dew to occur during calm nights kidron and starinsky 2019 but soil condensation rarely occurs in jujube plantations due to high soil temperatures dew events occur more frequently in jujube plantations with higher frequency and stability than rainfall gao et al 2020b heavy dews 0 2 mm accounted for 85 2 of dew days wang et al 2017b however dew amount and frequency will be affected by climate change in the future tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 this could significantly increase the challenges for plant species survival in the region it is important to understand the response of dew and hr to soil water as this knowledge can help us understand the hydrological processes and ecological effects of dew and hr in rainfed dryland jujube plantations however it is not clear whether the effect of dew and hr on jujube plantations is related to soil water content we hypothesized that dew and hr had different effects on jujube plantations under different soil water conditions the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the amount and duration of dew under various soil water deficit conditions 2 compare the formation processes of dew under various soil water deficit conditions 3 determine the mode of hr in the soil and the effect of dew on hr under various soil water deficit conditions and 4 investigate eco hydrological eﬀects and contributions of dew and hr to transpiration and evapotranspiration in jujube plantations in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at the jujube demonstration base in mizhi county in shaanxi province china 38 11 n 109 28 e this is a semi arid temperate climate region with a typical hilly and gully landscape in china s loess plateau fig 1 supplementary fig 1 mean annual precipitation for 2000 2018 in the region was 440 mm with 61 9 occurring in july through september the annual total solar radiation is 447 9 w m 2 and the mean temperature is 8 4 c gao et al 2020b the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei since 2005 has been less than 1 0 suggesting that drought is frequent for the growth period of jujube may to october however spei has shown a significant negative trend the standard normal variable z 0 i e the degree of drought weakens during the growth period fig 2 in the 0 200 cm soil layer available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are respectively 30 1 1 6 and 89 3 mg kg 1 the soil ﬁeld water capacity is 22 1 with a wilting point of 6 7 the water table generally sits at about 50 m below the soil surface the experiment was conducted during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2018 and 2019 table 1 the non irrigated dwarf jujube trees were planted on 25 east facing rainfed terraced land in 2003 with trees planted with a row spacing of 3 m the trees were spaced 2 m apart within rows and the mean diameter of jujube trunks at about 20 cm above the soil surface was 8 cm three main branches were maintained on the trunk at about 80 cm above the ground as an efficient management measure the non irrigated jujube trees were pruned every 21 days during the growing season to maintain tree height at 2 2 0 12 m and canopy size at 2 2 2 2 m 2 2 measurements to analyze the amount and duration of dew and hydraulic redistribution under various soil water conditions average volumetric soil water data θ for the 20 60 cm soil layer fig 3 were divided into four groups θ 9 9 θ 11 6 11 6 θ 14 2 and θ 14 2 these groups represented severe soil water deficit moderate deficit slight deficit and no deficit supplementary material 1 2 2 1 canopy dew amount and duration three dielectric leaf wetness sensors lws decagon devices inc usa were set up horizontally 0 angle at the canopy tops of the three selected non irrigated dwarf jujube trees to monitor canopy dew intensity and duration canopy dew intensity was determined as a strong power function of the voltage recorded from the lws gao et al 2020b the lws sensors were calibrated using visual and tactile observations sentelhas et al 2004 and the lws wetness threshold was set to 455 raw counts when the lws threshold was greater than 455 raw counts jujube leaves were wetted by dew when the lws wetness threshold was less than 455 raw counts jujube leaves were dry gao et al 2020a rainfall can also cause lws wetting the lws measurements were compared with rainfall data measured by nearby meteorological stations to exclude the rainfall periods from the dew measurements signals from the lws sensors were automatically recorded every 30 min by a single em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa the voltages collected by the em50 at the study site were converted into canopy dew intensity via calibration the calibration process was as follows a small sprinkler was used to spray a certain amount of water on the surface of the lws and the voltage was recorded by the em50 a functional relationship between water and voltage was established and then canopy dew intensity was calculated by the function the calibration process has been well documented in the past see gao et al 2020b there is currently no uniform standard for the definition of daily dew amount tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 in this study the daily canopy dew amount was calculated using the method given in previous studies kabela et al 2009 xu et al 2012 gao et al 2020b 1 c d d i i max 2 l a i d where c d d is daily canopy dew amount mm d 1 i i max is maximum canopy dew intensity mm d 1 measured using lws at the time i 2 is the coeﬃcient needed to account for upper and lower leaf surfaces and l a i d is the daily leaf area index for the specific dew day winscanopy analysis equipment regent instruments inc canada was used to get canopy photographs every 10 days during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the photographs of jujube canopies were concurrently measured ﬁve times in each of the four cardinal directions and then the jujube leaf area index lai was derived using the winscanopy 2005a software a logistic growth function fit the relationship between lai and day of year doy well with coeﬃcients of determination r2 0 9 l a i d was interpolated using the ﬁtted equations fig 4 daily canopy dew duration was calculated using eq 2 as 2 d d i 1 n t i where dd is daily canopy dew duration h ti is measured duration of the ith leaf wetness event h and n is total number of leaf wetness events per day the influence of meteorological factors on dew has been widely reported kidron et al 2019 the relationship between soil water and canopy dew cd is somewhat unclear because dew is affected by meteorological factors reference evapotranspiration eto is a comprehensive parameter that reflects meteorological conditions typical days with similar eto must be used in the comparisons of meteorological conditions chen et al 2014 daily dynamics of cd intensity under different soil water conditions with similar eto were used to determine the effect of soil water on daily cd intensity thus four dew days 18 00 18 00 h on the next day with similar eto under the four soil water conditions were selected as typical days the typical days under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions were respectively august 12 13 eto 3 73 mm august 17 18 eto 3 70 mm july 12 13 eto 3 93 mm and july 20 21 eto 3 64 mm in 2019 also in order to investigate the response of dew to different soil water contents at a daily time scale the relationship between daily average cd intensity and average soil water content should be analyzed 2 2 2 transpiration sap ﬂux in the three selected jujube trees was monitored using the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 for each tree a single thermal dissipation probe tdp dynamax co usa with two needles length 20 mm diameter 2 mm was uniformly inserted horizontally into the upper and lower drilled holes in sapwood on the northern sides of the tree trunks at 20 cm above the soil surface the sap ﬂux of the jujube trees was recorded every 30 min by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientiﬁc usa the jujube sap ﬂux density was calculated based on the temperature diﬀerence between the heated and unheated needles transpiration tc act was then calculated from the relationship between sap ﬂux density and sapwood area granier 1987 sap ﬂux and transpiration calculations have been detailed in previous studies gao et al 2020b chen et al 2015 used the bayesian calibration and uncertainty analysis to calibrate test and validate the shuttleworth wallace model sw model against observed t and soil evaporation data for jujube plantations in this study area they found that the sw model can accurately estimate daily actual evapotranspiration etc act of a jujube plantation therefore the calibrated sw model can be used to calculate daily etc act during the jujube growing season jujube evaporation e is the diﬀerence between estimated etc act and measured tc act the calibration and validation of the sw model has been well documented by chen et al 2015 2 2 3 hydraulic redistribution hydraulic redistribution hr in topsoil is susceptible to water vapor adsorption hirotaka et al 2006 considered that the 0 15 cm soil layer is the main activity place for vapor ﬂux driven by the temperature gradient and when deep soil 15 cm temperature is higher than shallow soil 1 cm temperature water vapor molecules accumulate on the surface soil and finally get adsorbed by surface soil in a process called water vapor adsorption the daily change in soil water content in the 0 15 cm soil layer is mainly caused by water vapor adsorption agam and berliner 2009 the apparent daytime hr in the 0 20 cm soil layer was thus out of phase from normal patterns of nocturnal hr in deeper layers 20 cm the increase in soil water in the 0 20 cm soil layer was often quite large much greater than nocturnal hr observed in deeper soil layers and the absolute magnitude of hr in the 0 20 cm soil layer is not easily quantiﬁed warren et al 2011 in addition analysis of table 1 see neumann and cardon 2012 suggests that 80 of the experiments in the literature use the layer below the 15 or 20 cm soil depth as the initial soil layer for hr determination neumann and cardon 2012 water vapor adsorption in dryland jujube plantations mainly occurred in the 0 15 cm soil layer the maximum frequency of water vapor adsorption for the entire growing season was 72 gao et al 2020b li et al 2017 and ma et al 2012 investigated jujube roots by the trench profile method and mechanical excavation combined with a water spraying method and found that about 60 90 of fine roots with root diameter 2 mm of jujube trees of different ages occur mainly in the 20 60 cm soil layer therefore the volumetric water contents in the 20 60 cm soil layer were measured to calculate hr in the dryland jujube plantation using eq 3 the soil particle composition and bulk density of the three layers are given in table 2 the volumetric water contents at the 20 40 and 60 cm soil depths under the three jujube canopy conditions used for dew monitoring were measured using gs3 sensors decagon devices inc usa placed 30 cm away from the jujube trunks a total of nine gs3 sensors were connected to the em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa that automatically recorded volumetric soil water content every 30 min concurrently with lws the oven drying method was used to calibrate collected data in each soil layer the calibrated volumetric soil water contents over time are shown in fig 3 hr is defined as the increase in soil water content at night on non rainfall days when the water content of the next day is greater than that of the current day hr is the difference between the maximum soil water content θ max n 1 of the next day and the minimum value of the current day brooks et al 2006 sun et al 2018 2020 neumann and cardon 2012 hr for a specific soil layer is given as follows 3 h r 10 θ max n 1 θ min n h where hr is hydraulic redistribution mm d 1 θ max n 1 is the maximum soil water content on the next day cm3 cm 3 θ min n is the minimum soil water content on the current day cm3 cm 3 and h is soil depth cm when continuous or intermittent rainfall occurs infiltration of rainfall will affect soil water potential warren et al 2007 therefore hr was not calculated during continuous or intermittent rainfall when the topsoil became wet after rainfall hr was the dominant process and tree roots transferred infiltrated rainfall from the surface soil to deeper soil downward hr burgess et al 2001 hultine et al 2004 neumann and cardon 2012 according to ryel et al 2003 when infiltrated rainfall reaches depths of 0 3 1 5 m in a silt loam soil the portion redistributed by roots was 100 for light rainfall 8 mm and 74 for moderate rainfall 36 mm the soil in jujube planations in the loess hilly region is silty loam soil the rainfall in this region occurs mainly as light rain and moderate rain light rain events account for 58 3 67 6 of the total rainfall events in a year the frequency of moderate rain events is lower than the frequency of light rain events with a maximum frequency of 32 4 supplementary fig 2 fig 3 wang et al 2021 used a cs650 cr1000 automatic monitoring system to conduct long term observations of rainfall and soil water in this study area and found that 1 after a typical independent light rain event the wetting front took 27 5 h to reach a maximum soil depth 30 cm and the soil water at 20 30 cm only increased 0 1 compared with the soil water before the rain event 2 after a typical independent moderate rain event the wetting front took 72 5 h to reach the maximum soil depth 40 cm and the soil water at 20 40 cm only increased 0 4 compared with the soil water before the rain event the soil layer used to calculate hr in this study was 20 60 cm when using eq 3 to calculate hr in the 20 40 cm soil layer it takes time for the wetting front to reach the maximum soil depth 30 cm and 40 cm and soil water in the 20 40 cm soil layer will be affected by the wetting front and hr a phenomenon that may occur is that the θ max n 1 value may be the soil water when the wetting front arrives and θ min n is the soil water when there is no rainfall resulting in a large hr calculated for the 20 40 cm soil layer but it will not affect hr in the 40 60 cm soil layer zhang et al 2017 also found that the wetting front can move to the 90 cm depth after a typical intermittent rainfall event in this study area light moderate rain soil water in the 20 60 cm layer increased compared with the soil water before rainfall however when hr was calculated by eq 3 hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer was not affected by the wetting front intermittent rain often occurred during the experiment in 2017 2019 and the maximum occurrence of independent moderate rain affecting hr was two times 2017 fig 3 therefore the influence of the wetting front on hr was very small after rainfall and the wetting front and hr were not distinguished in this study table 2 2 2 4 meteorological factors precipitation p mm air temperature tair c relative humidity rh solar

various soil conditions in a multiple comparison the results obtained were tested at p 0 05 in the lsd post hoc test the signiﬁcance of diﬀerences in hr with and without dew was determined at the 95 conﬁdence level using the non parametric mann whitney u test 3 results 3 1 canopy dew duration the frequency of cd decreased with increasing degree of soil water deficit specifically the average numbers of cd days for the no deficit slight deficit moderate deficit and severe deficit water conditions were 43 46 13 and 5 days respectively fig 5a accounting for 80 72 72 92 65 35 and 62 86 of the total number of days during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 there was no significant difference in cd days under the no deficit and slight soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 and the number of cd days for these two treatments was significantly higher than the number under the moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 the cd days under the no deficit and slight soil water deficit conditions were 1 19 9 57 times the cd days under moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions fig 5a also cd duration decreased with increasing degree of soil water deficit fig 5b the average cd duration was 10 07 h d 1 under the no deficit condition and the average cd duration was 5 39 h d 1 under the severe soil water deficit condition in addition cd duration under the no deficit soil water condition was significantly higher than under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 cd duration under the no deficit condition was 1 87 3 56 and 4 68 h d 1 longer than under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions respectively fig 5b 3 2 canopy dew amount 3 2 1 diurnal dew intensity dynamics the daily dynamics of cd intensity consisted of dew accumulation and evaporation stages fig 6 cd intensity started accumulating after 18 30 h local time under the no deficit condition but this was respectively 0 5 1 0 5 2 and 0 5 4 h earlier than under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions cd intensity peaked at about 05 00 06 30 h under all four soil water conditions reaching respectively 0 09 0 1 0 04 0 06 0 02 0 09 and 0 03 0 06 mm h 1 in 2017 2019 under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions considering the frequencies of cd intensity occurrence the accumulation stage of cd intensity mainly occurred during 20 30 06 30 h under the no deficit condition 22 30 06 00 h under the slight soil water deficit condition 00 00 06 00 h under the moderate soil water deficit condition and 1 30 6 00 under the severe soil water deficit condition the frequencies of cd intensity occurrence at those times were respectively 34 48 89 65 29 57 76 56 25 00 55 55 and 15 00 71 43 for the four soil water conditions however the evaporation stage of cd intensity lasted for a relatively short time mainly occurring at 6 30 9 00 h under the four soil water conditions the frequency of cd intensity occurrence after 09 00 h was always less than 18 00 3 2 2 daily canopy dew amount the maximum daily cd amounts occurred under the no deficit condition 0 90 0 64 and 0 68 mm d 1 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively minimum daily cd amounts were observed under slight soil water deficit in 2017 0 36 mm d 1 slight soil water deficit in 2018 0 36 mm d 1 and moderate soil water deficit in 2019 0 28 mm d

no statistically significant differences in cd amount under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 with a cd amount range of 0 40 0 53 mm d 1 fig 7 3 3 canopy dew and evapotranspiration dew as a water input greatly contributed to the water output terms tc act and etc act at the daily time scale the contributions of cd to tc act cd tc act and cd to etc act cd etc act mainly occurred under the no deficit condition with respective maximum values of 0 87 and 0 82 in 2018 compared with cd tc act and cd etc act under the no deficit condition cd tc act and cd etc act decreased under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions the range of frequency in cd tc act and cd etc act was 0 00 0 40 fig 8 although the ratio of cd to tc act or etc act changed with temporal upscaling it still hugely contributed to water output for the jujube growing season the maximum values of cd tc act and cd etc act occurred under the no deficit condition 0 34 and 0 21 respectively in 2018 table 3 compared with cd tc act and cd etc act under the no deficit condition cd tc act and cd etc act decreased under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions the maximum values of cd tc act and cd etc act were 0 25 and 0 13 under the slight soil water deficit condition in 2019 table 3 3 4 canopy dew and hydraulic redistribution fig 9 shows the number of days of hr occurrence and hr amount in the 20 60 cm soil layer under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the average hr days were 27 51 16 and 8 days fig 9a accounting for 50 79 80 30 89 81 and 95 00 respectively of the total number of days for the no deficit slight deficit moderate deficit and severe deficit soil water conditions in jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the frequency of hr increased with increasing degree of soil water deficit the change in the frequency of hr with the degree of soil water deficit was the reverse of that with cd under the same soil water conditions hr varied from year to year for example the average hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer under the moderate soil water deficit condition was 0 43 mm d 1 and 0 16 mm d 1 in 2017 and 2019 respectively hr under the moderate soil water deficit condition in 2017 was 2 69 times the value observed in 2019 fig 9b hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer increased with increasing degree of soil water deficit average hr reached its minimum value under the no deficit condition with a value of 0 20 mm d 1 also the largest average hr value was observed under the severe soil water deficit condition 0 30 mm d 1 hr under the no deficit condition was significantly lower than under severe soil water deficit p 0 05 but there were no statistically significant differences in average hr under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 hr mainly occurred in the 60 cm soil layer under the no deficit condition and was 1 74 times greater than in the 20 40 cm soil layer hr mainly occurred in the 20 40 cm soil layer under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions hr values in the 20 40 cm soil layer under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions were 3 73 1 72 and 1 69 times higher respectively than in the 60 cm soil layer under the same soil water condition fig 9b to understand the relationship between cd and hr under different soil water conditions hr with and without cd under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions are shown in fig 10 hr was affected by the occurrence of cd under the no deficit condition hr with cd was 1 57 times hr without cd however the difference between hr with cd and hr without cd was not statistically significant p 0 05 under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions hr with cd was lower than hr without cd but the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 hr with cd under these three soil water conditions accounted for 96 0 72 0 and 83 0 respectively of hr without cd under the same soil water condition 4 discussion 4 1 effect of soil water on canopy dew dew formation is an extremely complex process that is related to the dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of air ye et al 2007 the effect of meteorological factors on dew formation in dryland jujube plantations has been studied by gao et al 2020a and wang et al 2017b under similar meteorological conditions the dynamics of cd intensity were affected by soil water content cd intensity and its duration under the no deficit condition were higher than cd intensity under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions with increasing soil water deficits cd intensity and its duration decreased fig 11a in addition there was a significant functional relationship between cd intensity and soil water content in both sufficient no deficit and deficit slight moderate and severe soil water conditions the fitted function between cd intensity and soil water content fig 11b indicated that soil water was the source of water vapor that affected dew formation the sensitivity of dew to soil water was different due to different soil water conditions therefore it is reasonable and necessary to compare dew under different soil water conditions wen et al 2012 used the isotope tracing method to study water sources for dew formation in densely planted farmlands growing winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l and grassland stipa krysi agropyron cristatum and artemisia frigida they noted that 98 0 of dew originated from precipitation and atmospheric water vapor above the plant canopy and that 2 0 of the dew originated from soil water in the lower canopy however kaseke et al 2017 noted that soil water in the shallow soil layer 0 5 m provided a source of water vapor for the formation of dew aguirre gutierrez et al 2019 calculated dew formation based on the energy balance and believed that energy lost by the canopy and the soil was the main driver of dew formation zhuang and zhao 2017 noted that large amounts of plant transpiration and soil water evaporation provided sufficient water vapor for the formation of dew in haloxylon ammodendron plantations a statistical analysis by ritter et al 2019 found that dew events only occurred once a week in forest lands in the absence of a water source under the same environmental conditions dense grass can completely cover the soil and reduce soil evaporation however a single tree or shrub can occupy a larger land area with soil water easy to evaporate also trees or shrubs have higher transpiration rates providing a greater water source for dew formation the focus of our research was a dwarf jujube plantation with row spacing of 3 m and within row tree spacing of 2 m thus evaporation and transpiration for a single jujube tree growing on 6 m2 of bare land were as high as 203 76 mm and 278 48 mm per year respectively table 3 under the no deficit condition suitable meteorological conditions and sufficient soil water increased both cd duration fig 5b and cd amount fig 7 4 2 hydraulic redistribution and canopy dew we found that hr under cd was higher than hr without cd under the no deficit condition but the reverse was observed under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions fig 10 because the water potential of jujube leaves roots and different soil layers were not measured in this study only reasonable inferences are possible regarding the above phenomena soil water content was different in the 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm soil layers fig 3 it is assumed that water potential gradients exist between jujube roots distal wet soil ϕ r d wet soil ϕ s d dry soil patches ϕ r s and dry soil ϕ s s under the no deficit condition ϕ r d and ϕ s d ϕ r d and ϕ r s ϕ r s and ϕ s s water potential gradients were close but ϕ r s and ϕ r d changed under cd this increased water potential gradients between ϕ r d ϕ s d ϕ r s and ϕ s s and thereby increased hr this resulted in higher hr with cd than without cd under the no deficit condition under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions ϕ r d and ϕ s d ϕ r d and ϕ r s and ϕ r s and ϕ s s water potential gradients were large the occurrence of dew changed ϕ r s and ϕ r d water potentials decreasing water potential gradients across ϕ r d ϕ s d ϕ r s and ϕ s s this in turn inhibited hr and resulted in lower hr with cd than without cd under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions this explanation is only conjecture determining whether it is true or not will require measurements of the water potential of leaves stems roots and soil in a jujube planation in order to quantitatively determine the water potential between leaves roots and soil on days with and without dew in combination with the heat ratio method 4 3 ecohydrological effects 4 3 1 plant physiology and evapotranspiration dew as a water input in dryland jujube plantations occurred more frequently and was quantitatively more stable than rainfall gao et al 2020b dew on plant leaves can be absorbed and used by plants and the maximum water absorption is 90 kim and lee 2011 the maximum dew days and dew duration for jujube were respectively 43 d 80 72 of the total monitored days and 11 38 h d 1 fig 5 long term wetting of plant leaves will change leaf and canopy temperatures and will affect plant metabolism and energy flux rate in the ecosystem dawson and goldsmith 2018 this can develop new potential interactions that may change the characteristics of leaf surfaces rowlandson et al 2015 long term wetting of leaves also reduces vapor pressure deficit and increases relative humidity konrad et al 2015 this affects transpiration the transpiration rate of wet leaves of c esculenta dropped by 30 from the control value gerlein safdi et al 2018a then water saved by suppression of transpiration was up to 25 gerlein safdi et al 2018b under the no deficit condition during the entire growing season the ranges of cd tc act and cd etc act ratios were respectively 0 31 0 34 and 0 17 0 21 table 3 cd tc act and cd etc act ratios in this study were higher than those reported for rice oryza sativa l in the subtropical monsoon climate of china liu et al 2018a these values were also higher than those recorded for the semiarid desert valley ecosystem in the great basin of the western usa malek et al 1999 cd tc act and cd etc act were lower under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions than under no deficit conditions for the entire growing season table 3 4 3 2 hydraulic redistribution soil water and evapotranspiration the process of hr has a strong regulating effect on soil water content sardans and peuelas 2014 the frequency of occurrence of hr in a dryland jujube plantation was as high as 95 and daily hr varied within 0 16 0 43 mm d 1 fig 9b daily hr in this study was very close to the hr for forest lands reported by yu and d odorico 2014 soil water content affects hr and the frequency and amount of hr increased with increasing soil water deficit hr under soil water deficit slight moderate and severe was higher than under non deficit soil water conditions fig 9 soil water content also affects hr in the ecosystem driven by a combination of soil parameters e g soil texture and plant morphological and physiological characteristics prieto et al 2010 however hr did not continuously increase with increasing water deficit hr was observed to decrease in the dry season due to decreasing root hydraulic conductance and the accumulation of embolisms in roots caused by drought stress warren et al 2007 the magnitude of hr is inﬂuenced by soil water potential hr declines with decreasing root or soil hydraulic conductivity when drying soils reach a given water potential threshold neumann et al 2014 the eco hydrologic impact of hr depends on the contribution and time of the hr process neumann and cardon 2012 under the same conditions the hr e ratio 0 05 0 26 was higher than the hr tc act ratio 0 03 0 19 table 3 the contribution of hr to tc act hr tc act was extremely small under the no deficit condition with a range of 0 03 0 08 the contribution of hr to t was 0 08 0 19 under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions the average hr tc act was 0 12 table 3 close to average hr tc act 0 15 reported by neumann and cardon 2012 under the no deficit soil water condition ample water can be transported via hr from shallow soil layers 20 40 cm to deeper soil layers 60 cm on the other hand water in deep layers can be transported via hr under deficit soil water slight moderate and severe conditions this redistribution releases water into shallow soil layers to respond to water deﬁciency fig 9 plants can extract more water from shallow soil layers due to the greater distribution of fine roots in that layer plants can also increase root activity or grow more fine roots to increase water uptake from the root zone to compensate for water stress under soil water deficit conditions zhu et al 2017 the corresponding sap flow changed steadily from 21 00 h to 08 00 h and then changed sharply after 08 00 h hitting peak values at 15 00 h chen et al 2014 the maximum soil water content due to hr occurred at 06 00 07 00 h the increased soil water due to hr can be used by jujube trees for transpiration thereby delaying shallow soil water use renée et al 2002 this can also maintain or induce recovery of root conductivity during the night resulting in reduced plant water stress enhanced overall plant carbon assimilation and increased plant resistance to drought prieto and ryel 2014 5 conclusions in a dryland jujube plantation in china s hilly loess region severe soil water deﬁcit easily developed daily cd decreased with increasing soil water deficit and daily hr increased with increasing soil water deficit in the 20 60 cm soil layer while the contribution of cd to etc act mainly occurred under the no deficit condition the contribution of hr to etc act mainly occurred under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions hr was affected by the cd complementary effects of cd and hr positively alleviated soil water deficit this can be an important ecological and hydrological

9387,soil desiccation occurs widely across china s loess plateau due to long term water demand in excess of water supply hydraulic redistribution hr the movement of water from wet to dry soil via roots and canopy dew cd are crucial to water replenishment in dryland ecosystems however much is still not known about the response of cd and hr to soil water deficits including no deficit slight deficit moderate deficit and severe deficit water conditions in dryland jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations in china s hilly loess region to this end the duration and intensity of dew were monitored using dielectric leaf wetness sensors to better understand the effects of soil water status on dew also soil water content sap ﬂow and meteorological variables were measured during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the results showed that the time of occurrence of cd under the no deficit condition came earlier than the time of occurrence of cd under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions peak cd appeared at 5 00 6 30 am and ended at 6 30 9 00 am local time under the four soil water conditions the amount duration and frequency of cd decreased with increasing soil water deficit the amount and duration of cd under the no deficit condition were significantly higher than under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 the amount and frequency of hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer increased with increasing soil water deficit under the no deficit condition hr was significantly lower than under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 while hr was influenced by cd cd enhanced hr under the no deficit condition but inhibited hr under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions for the growing season the contribution of cd to total actual evapotranspiration etc act cd etc act ratio was highest under the no deficit condition maximum cd etc act ratio of 0 21 the contribution of hr to etc act hr etc act ratio was higher under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions maximum of 0 11 the mutual effects of cd and hr lessened soil water deficit making them important ecohydrological processes affecting the response of dryland jujube plantations to soil desiccation keywords actual evapotranspiration ecohydrological effects soil desiccation water balance semi arid region 1 introduction china s loess plateau is a typical arid and semi arid region where rainfall is the only source of soil water for dryland farming xin et al 2011 this hilly loess terrain has seen a significant decline in soil water during the last 50 years xin et al 2011 large scale anthropogenic plantings of vegetation can absorb soil water from deep in the soil profile to maintain growth needs during the dry season the insufficient rainwater supply hardly replenishes deep soil water in the long term leading to a continuous uptake of soil water to develop a utilization type of soil desiccation shao et al 2016 this pronounced hydrological phenomenon is specific to china s loess plateau liu and diamond 2005 yan et al 2015 infiltrating precipitation in the loess soil region finds it difficult to reach a soil layer where soil water is used by evapotranspiration wang et al 2015 the result is soil desiccation that leaves a thick soil layer with a huge long term water deficit shao et al 2016 however soil water is critical for soil microbial respiration the biogeochemical cycle and the maintenance of bio atmospheric and hydrological processes sun et al 2020 liu et al 2018b soil desiccation directly affects ecosystem productivity and restoration of damaged ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions abaker et al 2017 in response to soil and leaf water potential gradients soil water absorbed by plant roots flows through the xylem system to reach the plant canopy from where it is transpired into the atmosphere through leaf stomata however in cases where the water potential of plant roots is lower than the soil water potential the root system also releases absorbed water into dry soil in a process called hydraulic redistribution hr bazihizina et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 hr is a process driven by the water potential gradient and it is the redistribution of soil water by plant roots causing soil water to flow upward downward or laterally this water can be absorbed and utilized by plants in order to maintain the water balance of plants by rewetting the surface layer at night in the dry season gaines et al 2016 priyadarshini et al 2016 prieto and ryel 2014 hr can occur in any ecosystem and for any plant species everywhere in the world neumann and cardon 2012 it can increase transpiration and photosynthetic rate in dry seasons increase plant nutrient uptake in shallow soil maintain active microbes or stimulate microbial activity prolong the life span of fine roots maintain root soil contact in dry soils and move the non evaporated precipitation on the soil surface down to deeper soil layers neumann and cardon 2012 in addition hr is a vital mechanism that drives energy and water partitioning and the biogeochemical cycle luo et al 2016 neumann et al 2014 quijano and kumar 2016 in arid and semi arid ecosystems where soil water is scarce dew is a common and significant water resource accounting for 4 5 64 0 of the local rainfall hanisch et al 2015 hao et al 2012 jacobs et al 2006 the contribution of dew to transpiration can reach 25 8 gao et al 2020b dew is the only source of water for the biological crusts insects small animals and plants in extremely arid desert areas agam and berliner 2006 kaseke et al 2017 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 recently dew research has attracted interdisciplinary interests from the ﬁelds of meteorology plant physiology agriculture and ecology groh et al 2018 hanisch et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 many scholars have studied the formation occurrence conditions influencing factors and duration and amount of dew in desert arid semi arid humid tropical and alpine areas gao et al 2020a groh et al 2018 hanisch et al 2015 kaseke et al 2017 kidron and starinsky 2019 liu et al 2020 muselli et al 2009 the thin water layer or water droplets formed by dew on leaf surfaces can be used as a supplementary plant water source under soil water deficit conditions and this water can be absorbed and utilized by plants dawson and goldsmith 2018 dew can reduce vapor pressure deficit and transpiration change the energy balance of the plant canopy maintain carbon dioxide absorption and improve water use efficiency konrad et al 2015 wang et al 2017a dew on leaf surfaces can transport solutes inside leaves burkhardt et al 2012 this process can drive key nutrients to be absorbed and used by leaves fernandez and eichert 2009 concurrently water absorbed by leaves can promote cell expansion by increasing turgor pressure and thereby promote stem and leaf growth dawson and goldsmith 2018 in addition the long term presence of dew on plant leaves can cause propagation of fungal pathogens and leaching of nutrients that can harm leaves and fruits of plants dawson and goldsmith 2018 rowlandson et al 2015 hr only occurs at night when transpiration is negligible and a water potential gradient exists within the soil root canopy system bazihizina et al 2017 dew on plant leaves creates a temporary humid environment at the leaf air boundary gerlein safdi et al 2018a 2018b deposited dew on plant leaves can be directly absorbed and utilized through the leaf cuticle stomata and other specialized plant organs berry et al 2019 fernandez et al 2017 water absorbed by leaves increases leaf water potential limm et al 2009 and the absorbed water can even be transported to the soil near the root zone through xylem vessels thereby changing the soil water potential cassana et al 2016 eller et al 2013 the changed leaf water potential or soil water potential will change the water potential gradient between the soil roots and canopy of a plant and then affect hr in short the occurrence of dew will affect hr the loess plateau has experienced significant warming 1 9 c 50 yr and drying 47 6 mm 50 yr trends wang et al 2012 this warming and drying of the climate is not conducive to increasing soil water and also accelerates the consumption of soil water by vegetation resulting in new and increasingly serious soil desiccation such that the spatial distribution of the soil dry layer continues to increase shao et al 2016 soil desiccation is particularly obvious in the loess hilly region of china the dryland jujube plantation is a typical soil desiccation area in the loess hilly region of china in this region the dry soil layer is up to 3 4 m deep due to rainfall being unable to meet the transpiration water demand of jujube and this has affected hr and the regional hydrological cycle wang et al 2015 soil condensation and dew are common forms of condensation soil condensation is more likely than dew to occur during calm nights kidron and starinsky 2019 but soil condensation rarely occurs in jujube plantations due to high soil temperatures dew events occur more frequently in jujube plantations with higher frequency and stability than rainfall gao et al 2020b heavy dews 0 2 mm accounted for 85 2 of dew days wang et al 2017b however dew amount and frequency will be affected by climate change in the future tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 this could significantly increase the challenges for plant species survival in the region it is important to understand the response of dew and hr to soil water as this knowledge can help us understand the hydrological processes and ecological effects of dew and hr in rainfed dryland jujube plantations however it is not clear whether the effect of dew and hr on jujube plantations is related to soil water content we hypothesized that dew and hr had different effects on jujube plantations under different soil water conditions the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the amount and duration of dew under various soil water deficit conditions 2 compare the formation processes of dew under various soil water deficit conditions 3 determine the mode of hr in the soil and the effect of dew on hr under various soil water deficit conditions and 4 investigate eco hydrological eﬀects and contributions of dew and hr to transpiration and evapotranspiration in jujube plantations in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at the jujube demonstration base in mizhi county in shaanxi province china 38 11 n 109 28 e this is a semi arid temperate climate region with a typical hilly and gully landscape in china s loess plateau fig 1 supplementary fig 1 mean annual precipitation for 2000 2018 in the region was 440 mm with 61 9 occurring in july through september the annual total solar radiation is 447 9 w m 2 and the mean temperature is 8 4 c gao et al 2020b the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei since 2005 has been less than 1 0 suggesting that drought is frequent for the growth period of jujube may to october however spei has shown a significant negative trend the standard normal variable z 0 i e the degree of drought weakens during the growth period fig 2 in the 0 200 cm soil layer available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are respectively 30 1 1 6 and 89 3 mg kg 1 the soil ﬁeld water capacity is 22 1 with a wilting point of 6 7 the water table generally sits at about 50 m below the soil surface the experiment was conducted during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2018 and 2019 table 1 the non irrigated dwarf jujube trees were planted on 25 east facing rainfed terraced land in 2003 with trees planted with a row spacing of 3 m the trees were spaced 2 m apart within rows and the mean diameter of jujube trunks at about 20 cm above the soil surface was 8 cm three main branches were maintained on the trunk at about 80 cm above the ground as an efficient management measure the non irrigated jujube trees were pruned every 21 days during the growing season to maintain tree height at 2 2 0 12 m and canopy size at 2 2 2 2 m 2 2 measurements to analyze the amount and duration of dew and hydraulic redistribution under various soil water conditions average volumetric soil water data θ for the 20 60 cm soil layer fig 3 were divided into four groups θ 9 9 θ 11 6 11 6 θ 14 2 and θ 14 2 these groups represented severe soil water deficit moderate deficit slight deficit and no deficit supplementary material 1 2 2 1 canopy dew amount and duration three dielectric leaf wetness sensors lws decagon devices inc usa were set up horizontally 0 angle at the canopy tops of the three selected non irrigated dwarf jujube trees to monitor canopy dew intensity and duration canopy dew intensity was determined as a strong power function of the voltage recorded from the lws gao et al 2020b the lws sensors were calibrated using visual and tactile observations sentelhas et al 2004 and the lws wetness threshold was set to 455 raw counts when the lws threshold was greater than 455 raw counts jujube leaves were wetted by dew when the lws wetness threshold was less than 455 raw counts jujube leaves were dry gao et al 2020a rainfall can also cause lws wetting the lws measurements were compared with rainfall data measured by nearby meteorological stations to exclude the rainfall periods from the dew measurements signals from the lws sensors were automatically recorded every 30 min by a single em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa the voltages collected by the em50 at the study site were converted into canopy dew intensity via calibration the calibration process was as follows a small sprinkler was used to spray a certain amount of water on the surface of the lws and the voltage was recorded by the em50 a functional relationship between water and voltage was established and then canopy dew intensity was calculated by the function the calibration process has been well documented in the past see gao et al 2020b there is currently no uniform standard for the definition of daily dew amount tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 in this study the daily canopy dew amount was calculated using the method given in previous studies kabela et al 2009 xu et al 2012 gao et al 2020b 1 c d d i i max 2 l a i d where c d d is daily canopy dew amount mm d 1 i i max is maximum canopy dew intensity mm d 1 measured using lws at the time i 2 is the coeﬃcient needed to account for upper and lower leaf surfaces and l a i d is the daily leaf area index for the specific dew day winscanopy analysis equipment regent instruments inc canada was used to get canopy photographs every 10 days during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the photographs of jujube canopies were concurrently measured ﬁve times in each of the four cardinal directions and then the jujube leaf area index lai was derived using the winscanopy 2005a software a logistic growth function fit the relationship between lai and day of year doy well with coeﬃcients of determination r2 0 9 l a i d was interpolated using the ﬁtted equations fig 4 daily canopy dew duration was calculated using eq 2 as 2 d d i 1 n t i where dd is daily canopy dew duration h ti is measured duration of the ith leaf wetness event h and n is total number of leaf wetness events per day the influence of meteorological factors on dew has been widely reported kidron et al 2019 the relationship between soil water and canopy dew cd is somewhat unclear because dew is affected by meteorological factors reference evapotranspiration eto is a comprehensive parameter that reflects meteorological conditions typical days with similar eto must be used in the comparisons of meteorological conditions chen et al 2014 daily dynamics of cd intensity under different soil water conditions with similar eto were used to determine the effect of soil water on daily cd intensity thus four dew days 18 00 18 00 h on the next day with similar eto under the four soil water conditions were selected as typical days the typical days under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions were respectively august 12 13 eto 3 73 mm august 17 18 eto 3 70 mm july 12 13 eto 3 93 mm and july 20 21 eto 3 64 mm in 2019 also in order to investigate the response of dew to different soil water contents at a daily time scale the relationship between daily average cd intensity and average soil water content should be analyzed 2 2 2 transpiration sap ﬂux in the three selected jujube trees was monitored using the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 for each tree a single thermal dissipation probe tdp dynamax co usa with two needles length 20 mm diameter 2 mm was uniformly inserted horizontally into the upper and lower drilled holes in sapwood on the northern sides of the tree trunks at 20 cm above the soil surface the sap ﬂux of the jujube trees was recorded every 30 min by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientiﬁc usa the jujube sap ﬂux density was calculated based on the temperature diﬀerence between the heated and unheated needles transpiration tc act was then calculated from the relationship between sap ﬂux density and sapwood area granier 1987 sap ﬂux and transpiration calculations have been detailed in previous studies gao et al 2020b chen et al 2015 used the bayesian calibration and uncertainty analysis to calibrate test and validate the shuttleworth wallace model sw model against observed t and soil evaporation data for jujube plantations in this study area they found that the sw model can accurately estimate daily actual evapotranspiration etc act of a jujube plantation therefore the calibrated sw model can be used to calculate daily etc act during the jujube growing season jujube evaporation e is the diﬀerence between estimated etc act and measured tc act the calibration and validation of the sw model has been well documented by chen et al 2015 2 2 3 hydraulic redistribution hydraulic redistribution hr in topsoil is susceptible to water vapor adsorption hirotaka et al 2006 considered that the 0 15 cm soil layer is the main activity place for vapor ﬂux driven by the temperature gradient and when deep soil 15 cm temperature is higher than shallow soil 1 cm temperature water vapor molecules accumulate on the surface soil and finally get adsorbed by surface soil in a process called water vapor adsorption the daily change in soil water content in the 0 15 cm soil layer is mainly caused by water vapor adsorption agam and berliner 2009 the apparent daytime hr in the 0 20 cm soil layer was thus out of phase from normal patterns of nocturnal hr in deeper layers 20 cm the increase in soil water in the 0 20 cm soil layer was often quite large much greater than nocturnal hr observed in deeper soil layers and the absolute magnitude of hr in the 0 20 cm soil layer is not easily quantiﬁed warren et al 2011 in addition analysis of table 1 see neumann and cardon 2012 suggests that 80 of the experiments in the literature use the layer below the 15 or 20 cm soil depth as the initial soil layer for hr determination neumann and cardon 2012 water vapor adsorption in dryland jujube plantations mainly occurred in the 0 15 cm soil layer the maximum frequency of water vapor adsorption for the entire growing season was 72 gao et al 2020b li et al 2017 and ma et al 2012 investigated jujube roots by the trench profile method and mechanical excavation combined with a water spraying method and found that about 60 90 of fine roots with root diameter 2 mm of jujube trees of different ages occur mainly in the 20 60 cm soil layer therefore the volumetric water contents in the 20 60 cm soil layer were measured to calculate hr in the dryland jujube plantation using eq 3 the soil particle composition and bulk density of the three layers are given in table 2 the volumetric water contents at the 20 40 and 60 cm soil depths under the three jujube canopy conditions used for dew monitoring were measured using gs3 sensors decagon devices inc usa placed 30 cm away from the jujube trunks a total of nine gs3 sensors were connected to the em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa that automatically recorded volumetric soil water content every 30 min concurrently with lws the oven drying method was used to calibrate collected data in each soil layer the calibrated volumetric soil water contents over time are shown in fig 3 hr is defined as the increase in soil water content at night on non rainfall days when the water content of the next day is greater than that of the current day hr is the difference between the maximum soil water content θ max n 1 of the next day and the minimum value of the current day brooks et al 2006 sun et al 2018 2020 neumann and cardon 2012 hr for a specific soil layer is given as follows 3 h r 10 θ max n 1 θ min n h where hr is hydraulic redistribution mm d 1 θ max n 1 is the maximum soil water content on the next day cm3 cm 3 θ min n is the minimum soil water content on the current day cm3 cm 3 and h is soil depth cm when continuous or intermittent rainfall occurs infiltration of rainfall will affect soil water potential warren et al 2007 therefore hr was not calculated during continuous or intermittent rainfall when the topsoil became wet after rainfall hr was the dominant process and tree roots transferred infiltrated rainfall from the surface soil to deeper soil downward hr burgess et al 2001 hultine et al 2004 neumann and cardon 2012 according to ryel et al 2003 when infiltrated rainfall reaches depths of 0 3 1 5 m in a silt loam soil the portion redistributed by roots was 100 for light rainfall 8 mm and 74 for moderate rainfall 36 mm the soil in jujube planations in the loess hilly region is silty loam soil the rainfall in this region occurs mainly as light rain and moderate rain light rain events account for 58 3 67 6 of the total rainfall events in a year the frequency of moderate rain events is lower than the frequency of light rain events with a maximum frequency of 32 4 supplementary fig 2 fig 3 wang et al 2021 used a cs650 cr1000 automatic monitoring system to conduct long term observations of rainfall and soil water in this study area and found that 1 after a typical independent light rain event the wetting front took 27 5 h to reach a maximum soil depth 30 cm and the soil water at 20 30 cm only increased 0 1 compared with the soil water before the rain event 2 after a typical independent moderate rain event the wetting front took 72 5 h to reach the maximum soil depth 40 cm and the soil water at 20 40 cm only increased 0 4 compared with the soil water before the rain event the soil layer used to calculate hr in this study was 20 60 cm when using eq 3 to calculate hr in the 20 40 cm soil layer it takes time for the wetting front to reach the maximum soil depth 30 cm and 40 cm and soil water in the 20 40 cm soil layer will be affected by the wetting front and hr a phenomenon that may occur is that the θ max n 1 value may be the soil water when the wetting front arrives and θ min n is the soil water when there is no rainfall resulting in a large hr calculated for the 20 40 cm soil layer but it will not affect hr in the 40 60 cm soil layer zhang et al 2017 also found that the wetting front can move to the 90 cm depth after a typical intermittent rainfall event in this study area light moderate rain soil water in the 20 60 cm layer increased compared with the soil water before rainfall however when hr was calculated by eq 3 hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer was not affected by the wetting front intermittent rain often occurred during the experiment in 2017 2019 and the maximum occurrence of independent moderate rain affecting hr was two times 2017 fig 3 therefore the influence of the wetting front on hr was very small after rainfall and the wetting front and hr were not distinguished in this study table 2 2 2 4 meteorological factors precipitation p mm air temperature tair c relative humidity rh solar

various soil conditions in a multiple comparison the results obtained were tested at p 0 05 in the lsd post hoc test the signiﬁcance of diﬀerences in hr with and without dew was determined at the 95 conﬁdence level using the non parametric mann whitney u test 3 results 3 1 canopy dew duration the frequency of cd decreased with increasing degree of soil water deficit specifically the average numbers of cd days for the no deficit slight deficit moderate deficit and severe deficit water conditions were 43 46 13 and 5 days respectively fig 5a accounting for 80 72 72 92 65 35 and 62 86 of the total number of days during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 there was no significant difference in cd days under the no deficit and slight soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 and the number of cd days for these two treatments was significantly higher than the number under the moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 the cd days under the no deficit and slight soil water deficit conditions were 1 19 9 57 times the cd days under moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions fig 5a also cd duration decreased with increasing degree of soil water deficit fig 5b the average cd duration was 10 07 h d 1 under the no deficit condition and the average cd duration was 5 39 h d 1 under the severe soil water deficit condition in addition cd duration under the no deficit soil water condition was significantly higher than under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 cd duration under the no deficit condition was 1 87 3 56 and 4 68 h d 1 longer than under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions respectively fig 5b 3 2 canopy dew amount 3 2 1 diurnal dew intensity dynamics the daily dynamics of cd intensity consisted of dew accumulation and evaporation stages fig 6 cd intensity started accumulating after 18 30 h local time under the no deficit condition but this was respectively 0 5 1 0 5 2 and 0 5 4 h earlier than under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions cd intensity peaked at about 05 00 06 30 h under all four soil water conditions reaching respectively 0 09 0 1 0 04 0 06 0 02 0 09 and 0 03 0 06 mm h 1 in 2017 2019 under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions considering the frequencies of cd intensity occurrence the accumulation stage of cd intensity mainly occurred during 20 30 06 30 h under the no deficit condition 22 30 06 00 h under the slight soil water deficit condition 00 00 06 00 h under the moderate soil water deficit condition and 1 30 6 00 under the severe soil water deficit condition the frequencies of cd intensity occurrence at those times were respectively 34 48 89 65 29 57 76 56 25 00 55 55 and 15 00 71 43 for the four soil water conditions however the evaporation stage of cd intensity lasted for a relatively short time mainly occurring at 6 30 9 00 h under the four soil water conditions the frequency of cd intensity occurrence after 09 00 h was always less than 18 00 3 2 2 daily canopy dew amount the maximum daily cd amounts occurred under the no deficit condition 0 90 0 64 and 0 68 mm d 1 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively minimum daily cd amounts were observed under slight soil water deficit in 2017 0 36 mm d 1 slight soil water deficit in 2018 0 36 mm d 1 and moderate soil water deficit in 2019 0 28 mm d

no statistically significant differences in cd amount under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 with a cd amount range of 0 40 0 53 mm d 1 fig 7 3 3 canopy dew and evapotranspiration dew as a water input greatly contributed to the water output terms tc act and etc act at the daily time scale the contributions of cd to tc act cd tc act and cd to etc act cd etc act mainly occurred under the no deficit condition with respective maximum values of 0 87 and 0 82 in 2018 compared with cd tc act and cd etc act under the no deficit condition cd tc act and cd etc act decreased under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions the range of frequency in cd tc act and cd etc act was 0 00 0 40 fig 8 although the ratio of cd to tc act or etc act changed with temporal upscaling it still hugely contributed to water output for the jujube growing season the maximum values of cd tc act and cd etc act occurred under the no deficit condition 0 34 and 0 21 respectively in 2018 table 3 compared with cd tc act and cd etc act under the no deficit condition cd tc act and cd etc act decreased under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions the maximum values of cd tc act and cd etc act were 0 25 and 0 13 under the slight soil water deficit condition in 2019 table 3 3 4 canopy dew and hydraulic redistribution fig 9 shows the number of days of hr occurrence and hr amount in the 20 60 cm soil layer under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions during the jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the average hr days were 27 51 16 and 8 days fig 9a accounting for 50 79 80 30 89 81 and 95 00 respectively of the total number of days for the no deficit slight deficit moderate deficit and severe deficit soil water conditions in jujube growing seasons in 2017 2019 the frequency of hr increased with increasing degree of soil water deficit the change in the frequency of hr with the degree of soil water deficit was the reverse of that with cd under the same soil water conditions hr varied from year to year for example the average hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer under the moderate soil water deficit condition was 0 43 mm d 1 and 0 16 mm d 1 in 2017 and 2019 respectively hr under the moderate soil water deficit condition in 2017 was 2 69 times the value observed in 2019 fig 9b hr in the 20 60 cm soil layer increased with increasing degree of soil water deficit average hr reached its minimum value under the no deficit condition with a value of 0 20 mm d 1 also the largest average hr value was observed under the severe soil water deficit condition 0 30 mm d 1 hr under the no deficit condition was significantly lower than under severe soil water deficit p 0 05 but there were no statistically significant differences in average hr under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions p 0 05 hr mainly occurred in the 60 cm soil layer under the no deficit condition and was 1 74 times greater than in the 20 40 cm soil layer hr mainly occurred in the 20 40 cm soil layer under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions hr values in the 20 40 cm soil layer under the slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions were 3 73 1 72 and 1 69 times higher respectively than in the 60 cm soil layer under the same soil water condition fig 9b to understand the relationship between cd and hr under different soil water conditions hr with and without cd under no deficit slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions are shown in fig 10 hr was affected by the occurrence of cd under the no deficit condition hr with cd was 1 57 times hr without cd however the difference between hr with cd and hr without cd was not statistically significant p 0 05 under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions hr with cd was lower than hr without cd but the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 hr with cd under these three soil water conditions accounted for 96 0 72 0 and 83 0 respectively of hr without cd under the same soil water condition 4 discussion 4 1 effect of soil water on canopy dew dew formation is an extremely complex process that is related to the dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of air ye et al 2007 the effect of meteorological factors on dew formation in dryland jujube plantations has been studied by gao et al 2020a and wang et al 2017b under similar meteorological conditions the dynamics of cd intensity were affected by soil water content cd intensity and its duration under the no deficit condition were higher than cd intensity under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions with increasing soil water deficits cd intensity and its duration decreased fig 11a in addition there was a significant functional relationship between cd intensity and soil water content in both sufficient no deficit and deficit slight moderate and severe soil water conditions the fitted function between cd intensity and soil water content fig 11b indicated that soil water was the source of water vapor that affected dew formation the sensitivity of dew to soil water was different due to different soil water conditions therefore it is reasonable and necessary to compare dew under different soil water conditions wen et al 2012 used the isotope tracing method to study water sources for dew formation in densely planted farmlands growing winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l and grassland stipa krysi agropyron cristatum and artemisia frigida they noted that 98 0 of dew originated from precipitation and atmospheric water vapor above the plant canopy and that 2 0 of the dew originated from soil water in the lower canopy however kaseke et al 2017 noted that soil water in the shallow soil layer 0 5 m provided a source of water vapor for the formation of dew aguirre gutierrez et al 2019 calculated dew formation based on the energy balance and believed that energy lost by the canopy and the soil was the main driver of dew formation zhuang and zhao 2017 noted that large amounts of plant transpiration and soil water evaporation provided sufficient water vapor for the formation of dew in haloxylon ammodendron plantations a statistical analysis by ritter et al 2019 found that dew events only occurred once a week in forest lands in the absence of a water source under the same environmental conditions dense grass can completely cover the soil and reduce soil evaporation however a single tree or shrub can occupy a larger land area with soil water easy to evaporate also trees or shrubs have higher transpiration rates providing a greater water source for dew formation the focus of our research was a dwarf jujube plantation with row spacing of 3 m and within row tree spacing of 2 m thus evaporation and transpiration for a single jujube tree growing on 6 m2 of bare land were as high as 203 76 mm and 278 48 mm per year respectively table 3 under the no deficit condition suitable meteorological conditions and sufficient soil water increased both cd duration fig 5b and cd amount fig 7 4 2 hydraulic redistribution and canopy dew we found that hr under cd was higher than hr without cd under the no deficit condition but the reverse was observed under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions fig 10 because the water potential of jujube leaves roots and different soil layers were not measured in this study only reasonable inferences are possible regarding the above phenomena soil water content was different in the 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm soil layers fig 3 it is assumed that water potential gradients exist between jujube roots distal wet soil ϕ r d wet soil ϕ s d dry soil patches ϕ r s and dry soil ϕ s s under the no deficit condition ϕ r d and ϕ s d ϕ r d and ϕ r s ϕ r s and ϕ s s water potential gradients were close but ϕ r s and ϕ r d changed under cd this increased water potential gradients between ϕ r d ϕ s d ϕ r s and ϕ s s and thereby increased hr this resulted in higher hr with cd than without cd under the no deficit condition under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions ϕ r d and ϕ s d ϕ r d and ϕ r s and ϕ r s and ϕ s s water potential gradients were large the occurrence of dew changed ϕ r s and ϕ r d water potentials decreasing water potential gradients across ϕ r d ϕ s d ϕ r s and ϕ s s this in turn inhibited hr and resulted in lower hr with cd than without cd under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions this explanation is only conjecture determining whether it is true or not will require measurements of the water potential of leaves stems roots and soil in a jujube planation in order to quantitatively determine the water potential between leaves roots and soil on days with and without dew in combination with the heat ratio method 4 3 ecohydrological effects 4 3 1 plant physiology and evapotranspiration dew as a water input in dryland jujube plantations occurred more frequently and was quantitatively more stable than rainfall gao et al 2020b dew on plant leaves can be absorbed and used by plants and the maximum water absorption is 90 kim and lee 2011 the maximum dew days and dew duration for jujube were respectively 43 d 80 72 of the total monitored days and 11 38 h d 1 fig 5 long term wetting of plant leaves will change leaf and canopy temperatures and will affect plant metabolism and energy flux rate in the ecosystem dawson and goldsmith 2018 this can develop new potential interactions that may change the characteristics of leaf surfaces rowlandson et al 2015 long term wetting of leaves also reduces vapor pressure deficit and increases relative humidity konrad et al 2015 this affects transpiration the transpiration rate of wet leaves of c esculenta dropped by 30 from the control value gerlein safdi et al 2018a then water saved by suppression of transpiration was up to 25 gerlein safdi et al 2018b under the no deficit condition during the entire growing season the ranges of cd tc act and cd etc act ratios were respectively 0 31 0 34 and 0 17 0 21 table 3 cd tc act and cd etc act ratios in this study were higher than those reported for rice oryza sativa l in the subtropical monsoon climate of china liu et al 2018a these values were also higher than those recorded for the semiarid desert valley ecosystem in the great basin of the western usa malek et al 1999 cd tc act and cd etc act were lower under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions than under no deficit conditions for the entire growing season table 3 4 3 2 hydraulic redistribution soil water and evapotranspiration the process of hr has a strong regulating effect on soil water content sardans and peuelas 2014 the frequency of occurrence of hr in a dryland jujube plantation was as high as 95 and daily hr varied within 0 16 0 43 mm d 1 fig 9b daily hr in this study was very close to the hr for forest lands reported by yu and d odorico 2014 soil water content affects hr and the frequency and amount of hr increased with increasing soil water deficit hr under soil water deficit slight moderate and severe was higher than under non deficit soil water conditions fig 9 soil water content also affects hr in the ecosystem driven by a combination of soil parameters e g soil texture and plant morphological and physiological characteristics prieto et al 2010 however hr did not continuously increase with increasing water deficit hr was observed to decrease in the dry season due to decreasing root hydraulic conductance and the accumulation of embolisms in roots caused by drought stress warren et al 2007 the magnitude of hr is inﬂuenced by soil water potential hr declines with decreasing root or soil hydraulic conductivity when drying soils reach a given water potential threshold neumann et al 2014 the eco hydrologic impact of hr depends on the contribution and time of the hr process neumann and cardon 2012 under the same conditions the hr e ratio 0 05 0 26 was higher than the hr tc act ratio 0 03 0 19 table 3 the contribution of hr to tc act hr tc act was extremely small under the no deficit condition with a range of 0 03 0 08 the contribution of hr to t was 0 08 0 19 under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions the average hr tc act was 0 12 table 3 close to average hr tc act 0 15 reported by neumann and cardon 2012 under the no deficit soil water condition ample water can be transported via hr from shallow soil layers 20 40 cm to deeper soil layers 60 cm on the other hand water in deep layers can be transported via hr under deficit soil water slight moderate and severe conditions this redistribution releases water into shallow soil layers to respond to water deﬁciency fig 9 plants can extract more water from shallow soil layers due to the greater distribution of fine roots in that layer plants can also increase root activity or grow more fine roots to increase water uptake from the root zone to compensate for water stress under soil water deficit conditions zhu et al 2017 the corresponding sap flow changed steadily from 21 00 h to 08 00 h and then changed sharply after 08 00 h hitting peak values at 15 00 h chen et al 2014 the maximum soil water content due to hr occurred at 06 00 07 00 h the increased soil water due to hr can be used by jujube trees for transpiration thereby delaying shallow soil water use renée et al 2002 this can also maintain or induce recovery of root conductivity during the night resulting in reduced plant water stress enhanced overall plant carbon assimilation and increased plant resistance to drought prieto and ryel 2014 5 conclusions in a dryland jujube plantation in china s hilly loess region severe soil water deﬁcit easily developed daily cd decreased with increasing soil water deficit and daily hr increased with increasing soil water deficit in the 20 60 cm soil layer while the contribution of cd to etc act mainly occurred under the no deficit condition the contribution of hr to etc act mainly occurred under slight moderate and severe soil water deficit conditions hr was affected by the cd complementary effects of cd and hr positively alleviated soil water deficit this can be an important ecological and hydrological

9388,farmland shelterbelt system fss in oasis desert ecotones can effectively improve ecosystem services especially in fragile agricultural areas however the spatial temporal heterogeneity of its

played a more important role in reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity than vegetation attributes and microclimates which the independent influence can explain 48 5 of total influence among all factors our results provide an efficient theoretical basis for fss construction and agricultural water management practices keywords farmland shelterbelt system desert oasis ecotones land management spatial temporal heterogeneity ecological effects 1 introduction farmland shelterbelt system fss has a recognized great significance for improving the environment harnessing wind erosion and protecting farmland shen et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 by adjusting the microclimate and improving soil physical chemical properties the fsss can generate favorable conditions for crop production and achieve high and stable yields bao et al 2012 as a crucial measure of ecological recovery fss construction begins with the western great plains of the united states in the 1930 s then the rehabilitation of nature project in the former soviet union in the 1950 s and finally after the chinese three north shelter forest programme tnsfp in the 1970s smith et al 2021 nowadays the significance of fss has been gradually recognized worldwide under the context of the more and more serious global environmental issues related to climate change land degradation processes and loss of biodiversity fang 2021 haddaway et al 2018 in fsss a dependent relationship exists between environmental factors soil climate and biology etc and ecosystem functions soil hydrology etc which show the beneficial effects and contributions on the regional ecological system yin et al 2021 shen et al 2016 anwar et al 2021 however due to the shading effects and lateral extension of the root system by shelterbelts resource competition e g water solar and nutrient exists between shelterbelts and farmland zhao et al 2008 fu et al 2020 as fss can effectively improve the microclimate conditions and soil properties and then enhance ecological benefits they should be efficiently managed cao et al 2021 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 for example fsss can reduce wind speed by 20 30 compared to open farmlands through their influence on airflow structure musat et al 2021 reduction in wind speed and variation of other meteorological factors e g air temperature and solar radiation can also reduce evaporation by 20 30 increase the soil water content by 1 4 and air relative humidity by 5 10 and then generate a microclimate conducive to the crop growth smith et al 2021 shelterbelt patterns of fss mean the arrangements of forest lines around farmland which are usually composed of natural forests and plantations haddaway et al 2018 the factors that determine the ecological benefit of fss include plant height coverage size and arrangement in shelterbelts haddaway et al 2018 xie et al 2019 fsss can improve soil environment and quality then modify ecosystem functions of reserving water storage and controlling soil salt contents under different patterns fu et al 2016 valipour et al 2020 the biological drainage of shelterbelt can also reduce the activation of the non desired soil hydrological process and then strengthen the leaching power to achieve the alleviation of soil salinization which also prevents soil secondary salinization dong et al 2021 the fss is also able to delay the accumulation of salt and accelerate soil desalting through decreasing evaporation qiao et al 2016 which is also affected by the shelterbelt patterns in fsss the decomposition of the dead leaves and underground microorganisms makes them symbiotic and fertilizing promotes the soil ripening process thus enhancing the ecological function and sustainable farmland productivity zhang et al 2019 yin et al 2021 and soil properties zhang et al 2019 2012 the distribution of soil water and salt contents in different patterns of fsss is characterized by complex spatial temporal heterogeneity dong et al 2021 specifically when it exists an interdependence between soil water and salt content their distribution varies in horizontal distance vertical depth and seasons in fsss shen et al 2016 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 studies have shown that the pattern of fss has a great influence on vegetation water absorption and spatial temporal dynamics in soil moisture shen et al 2016 du et al 2021 therefore the shelterbelt shows an effect on soil moisture in farmland namely the horizontal distance from the shelterbelt edge directly affects soil moisture distribution fu et al 2016 in addition some studies have shown that the vertical distribution of soil moisture is mainly affected by the differences in vegetation physiological activity e g root water uptake and soil texture conditions in fsss rivest et al 2013 yang et al 2012 attending the temporal scale the differences in water consumption and competition caused by every growth stage of shelterbelt and farmland during each period of growing seasons will lead to variations in soil water and salt distribution yang et al 2018 at present there are many theoretical analyses about the effects of the fss patterns on environmental factors and ecological benefits but the focus based on the spatiotemporal scale and the specific interaction mechanism remains to be further studied wang et al 2015 valipour et al 2020 anwar et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to analyze the spatial temporal variation characteristics and influencing factors of soil moisture and salinity under different patterns of fsss to guide the management of agricultural water resources and saline soil amelioration in practice shi et al 2011 therefore in this study different patterns of fsss were selected in a representative desert oasis ecotone and soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors across three different spatial temporal dimensions were measured during three growing seasons in recent years which represent the corresponding ecosystem functions li et al 2003 the main goals of this research are 1 clarifying the spatiotemporal distributions of soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors as well as soil water storage soil salt content and related ecosystem functions under different patterns of fsss 2 exploring the relationship between environmental factors and ecosystem functions under different spatiotemporal dimensions and patterns of fsss and 3 finding the more sustainable and long term patterns of fsss in terms of water conservation and soil amelioration we hypothesize that this study could provide a firm data basis for fsss and a novel theoretical basis for future planning of farmland shelterbelt construction and agricultural water management 2 materials and methods 2 1

practices i e two lines patterns twlp four lines patterns folp five lines patterns filp and eight lines patterns eilp were selected as experimental sites to compare the soil physicochemical properties biological attributes soil water storages and soil slat contents among different patterns of shelterbelts modified agricultural systems fig 1c trees in the shelterbelts have a similar stand age 30 years and height 20 25 m and the vegetation also has similar attributes in farmlands of fsss the current vegetation status dimensions and specific information of each sampling site are included in table 1 there are three sampling plots at each site which are set away from each main shelterbelt farmland edge toward the direction of the protected farmland namely at 0 3 h 0 7 h 1 h 2 h and 3 h of each sampling plot h equals the canopy height of the main shelterbelt notably the 3 h sampling points are located at the center of farmlands so locations serve as control treatments with no influence by shelterbelts soil samples were collected at the beginning middle and end may august and october of each growing season during 2019 2021 at each site three sampling points were selected randomly with a minimum distance of 3 m between the plots to minimize sampling error at each sampling point soil samples were collected separately and taken to the laboratory for analysis with a soil auger at the depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm fig 1b 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil physicochemical properties in the laboratory soil samples were stored in aluminium boxes to conserve the initial conditions first soil water content swc g g 1 using the oven drying method at 105 c for a period of 9 h was measured moreover soil cores for estimating bulk density bd g cm 3 were used and also dried at 105 weighed all samples were air dried and then sieved through a 2 mm mesh sieve then it was able to estimate soil electrical conductivity ec μs cm 1 and ph by extraction solution and using a conductivity meter dds 307a mingbo china soil organic carbon soc g kg 1 was also determined using the k2cr2o7 oxidation reduction titration method walkley 1947 soil texture clay 0 002 mm silt

functions of reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity respectively soil moisture storage sms mm was calculated using eq 1 1 s m s i 1 n θ i b d i s t i 10 where i is the number of the soil

soil layer g cm 3 finally 10 is considered the transfer coefficient according to the empirical formula the water soluble total soil salt content c g kg 1 was calculated using eq 2 2 c i ec i 9 2 2000 where c i and ec i were the total soil salt content c g kg 1 and soil electrical conductivity μs cm 1 at 25 c in the ith soil layer respectively 2 3 2 microclimate factors affected by shelterbelt microclimate conditions around the sampling points were characterized coinciding with each experimental period the miniature lysimeters height 15 cm inner diameter 20 cm were used to measure the evapotranspiration ev mm at each sampling point of the shelterbelt for 3 consecutive days wang et al 2020 the device was weighed after sunset 19 00 20 00 every evening by an electronic balance with a sensitivity of 1 00 g the solar radiation sr lux air temperature ta and relative humidity rh at the height of 2 m in each forest network were observed in parallel with a digital illuminometer gm1020 and a hand held temperature and humidity measuring instrument in each shelterbelt network at 8 00 10 00 11 00 13 00 and 17 00 19 00 every day for 3 consecutive days the wind speeds sw m s 1 at 0 3 h 0 7 h 1 h 2 h and 3 h from the leeward side of farmland shelterbelts were measured continuously with the use of a multi channel anemometer zagfskx iiometer where the point at the farthest location serves as control treatments with no influence by shelterbelts 2 3 3 vegetation attributes in farmland and shelterbelt vegetation attributes in farmland and shelterbelt were also surveyed in the middle of each growing season august from 2019 to 2021 for above ground attributes in a shelterbelt lidar light detection and ranging method was conducted to scan different patterns of a shelterbelt specifically the selected shelterbelts were scanned using a riegl vz 400 series ground based scanner to get point cloud database cao et al 2021 to reduce data redundancy the lidar point cloud is preprocessed by splicing denoising and normalization lidar 360 software geocue usa was used to extract the single tree according to seed spots the improved progressive triangulation dense algorithm was also used to classify ground points and then the irregular triangulation interpolation algorithm is used to generate an accurate and high resolution dem digital elevation model achieving the separation of the point cloud from the ground and finally extracting the single tree with the values of each plant height m diameter at breast height dbh m canopy size cs m2 height below branch hbb m and canopy volume cv m3 the individual height of crop and crop yield were conducted by measuring standard samples selected by the average standard sample method and farm household survey in the field respectively moreover vegetation cover vc was estimated by photographs taken from a high angle and photo analysis in photoshop 2018 software adobe usa was done the mean value of each horizontal point

which is calculated from k times measurement for fine roots biomass density frbd g kg 1 in farmlands and shelterbelts samples were collected to a depth close to 100 cm using a 7 cm diameter root auger around each sampling location samples were sealed in plastic bags transported to the laboratory washed with a water spray and then the fine roots were picked out manually the roots were oven dried at 70 c for 24 h to obtain dry root biomass fine roots biomass density frbd g cm 3 was calculated as follows in eq 4 fu et al 2010 4 frbd w d v s where w d is the dry weight of root systems g and v s

the three sets of environmental variables expressed as r2 adjusted by the number of variables of each set principal component analysis pca and redundancy analysis rda were also conducted in canoco 5 0 microcomputer power usa to compare the relationship between environmental factors and ecosystem functions under different conditions or patterns of fsss the significance of the fractions of variance calculated with variation partitioning was tested by running a monte carlo permutation test 999 permutations the interpolation and maps of soil moisture storage and soil salt contents were generated

microsoft usa 3 results 3 1 soil properties under different patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems there were no significant differences in ec bd and ph among different patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems for ec value the filp obtained the lowest values 169 78 μs cm 1 and twlp the highest ones 240 28 μs cm 1 fig 2a soil bd was very similar in the four patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems reaching 1 65 g cm 3 1 64 g cm 3 1 63 g cm 3 1 62 g cm 3 respectively fig 2b soil ph of four patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems was all weak alkaline 8 08 7 93 8 05 7 89 fig 2c the significant differences appeared in the soil particle composition fig 2d f soil clay content was low in all four patterns from 1 2 in eilp to 3 3 in twlp in folp and eilp the silt content was relatively low reaching 51 6 and 41 5 respectively fig 2e however sand content in those two patterns was significantly higher than in the other ones fig 2f in addition the soil clay content in twlp was significantly higher than that of eilp 3 2 differences in vegetation attributes at different patterns of fsss the plant heights of different patterns of fss were similar all of them around 20 25 m fig 3a however the dbh and hbb obtained significant differences among the studied patterns the folp and eilp registered the highest hbb than the other ones which reached 1 82 and 2 01 m respectively the folp and filp obtained the largest dbh 0 41 and 0 48 m respectively the filp and twlp amounted to the minimum hbb and dbh which were 1 08 and 1 74 respectively fig 3b c for the canopy morphology significant differences exist considering the various patterns of studied fss the folp and eilp showed significant advantages in canopy size and canopy volume while the twlp and filp recorded the lower ones fig 3d e the canopy size of different fss ranked from the highest to lowest values as follows folp 8 70 m2 eilp 6 91 m2 twlp 4 64 m2 filp 4 47 m2 with their canopy volume folp 88 97 m3 eilp 77 41 m3 filp 43 99 m3 twlp 22 30 m3 the fine root biomass density frbd was significantly different while vegetation cover vc did not obtain significant differences among them the frbd in twlp was 0 74 g cm 2 and significantly lower than that in folp 1 31 g cm 2 and filp 1 24 g cm 2 the vegetation attributes in farmland were similar among different fsss for example the vc of cultivated crop in four patterns of fss were 87 7 85 7 86 1 and 84 3 respectively fig 3f g the individual height of the crop were 124 6 cm 134 5 cm 129 1 cm and 130 9 cm with crop yield of 15 06 t hm 2 15 75 t hm 2 149 29 t hm 2 and 155 64 t hm 2 in twlp folp filp and eilp respectively fig 3h i 3 3 differences in environmental factors microclimate at different patterns of fss we observed significant differences between the farmland shelterbelt systems and the control treatments namely the fsss registered the fine ecological effects fig 4 specifically the ecological effects of twlp were relatively weak while eilp were the best it is worth noting that folp or filp achieved equivalent protective effects to eilp fig 4 for the wind speed the twlp was significantly greater than other patterns fig 4a reaching a 41 8 reduction compared to the control plot so as the solar radiation 23 9 for the relative humidity air temperature and evaporation the four patterns had significantly improved effects compared to the control treatments while there were no significant differences among them fig 4c e especially the evaporation was reduced than the control by 60 7 72 3 68 3 and 73 1 in twlp folp filp and eilp respectively specifically fss can effectively reduce soil evaporation as the highlight contents shown in table 2 the evaporation ev at various horizontal distances in the fss was significantly lower than that at the control point the ev in eilp was the lowest one 0 47 mm which was reduced by 55 the wind speed sw of all points in fss was significantly lower than that of the control point 3 4 m s 1 and the sw in folp 0 90 m s 1 was reduced by 74 solar radiation sr in fss was also lower than that in the control point 104733 lux in the horizontal distances the sr at 0 3 h from the shelterbelt edge was significantly lower than that of other sampling points in fss table 2 from 1 3 h sr gradually increased with the distance from the shelterbelt edge while it decreased significantly at 0 3 h near the shelterbelt edge shelterbelt showed cooling and humidification effects the air temperatures ta in fss were lower than that in the control point 23 2 and the relative humidity rh in fss was higher than in the control point 22 1 3 4 spatial temporal distribution of soil water storage and soil salt contents under different patterns of fsss the results showed that it exists spatiotemporal differences in the distribution of soil moisture storage considering different patterns of fss fig 5 in general for the spatial scale the moisture storage in the deep layers was better than that in the surface layers while that in the near shelterbelt edge was slightly lower than that in the far locations at the temporal scale at the beginning of the growing season the moisture storage was relatively better than that in the middle and end of the growing season specifically the total moisture storage in 0 100 cm in may august and october were 281 90 mm 231 61 mm and 150 22 mm respectively on the other hand the moisture storage in filp and eilp was relatively low and the drop in soil moisture level in the surface layer and along the middle and end of the growing season for twlp and folp better soil moisture storage existed in the deep soil layer and far locations from the edge of the shelterbelt fig 5 as shown in fig 6 the spatiotemporal distribution of soil salt content in different patterns of fss was different considering the vertical soil layer the salt contents were lower than that in the deep ones the mean salt content was higher than 0 10 g kg 1 when the soil layer reached 40 60 cm soil depth for the horizontal distance from the shelterbelt edge there was no significant difference in soil salt content from 0 3 h to 3 h which were all around 0 11 g kg 1 on average at each location paying attention to the temporal scale soil salt content at the beginning may 0 11 g kg 1 and middle august 0 12 g kg 1 of the growing season was similar which was slightly higher than that at the end of the growing season october 0 09 g kg 1 specifically the concentration of soil salinity in twlp and folp was migrated from the far locations to the near shelterbelt edge during the growing season fig 6 on the other hand there existed differences in soil salinity during the growing season in filp and eilp the salt contents in eilp were relatively low and mainly concentrated in the deep soil near the shelterbelt edge fig 6 overall the median values of the soil moisture storage sms mm decreased from folp 231 34 mm to eilp 226 74 mm filp 219 27 mm and twlp 198 38 mm so the upper quartile values fig 7a the filp registered the lowest quartile values 156 22 mm and minimum ones 74 34 mm among different patterns of fss while the folp had the highest upper quartile values 298 95 mm and maximum ones 395 31 mm the upper and lower quartile values of soil moisture storage ranged from 156 22 to 298 95 mm which was almost twice the fold for the soil salt contents the median values decreased from eilp 0 122 g kg 1 to filp 0 113 g kg 1 twlp 0 092 g kg 1 and folp 0 088 g kg 1 so as the upper and lower quartile values fig 7b the folp had the minimum soil salt content 0 050 g kg 1 and the eilp had the maximum one 0 322 g kg 1 3 5 relationship between environmental factors and ecosystem functions in fsss in general the soil moisture content was closely correlated to the soil particle composition and it was negatively correlated with sand content but positively correlated with clay and silt content nevertheless soil salinity was correlated to the meteorological factors which recorded a negative relationship with relative humidity and air temperature whereas the bulk density and soil moisture were slightly positively correlated with soil salinity fig 8 furthermore the principal component analysis pca under the various spatial temporal dimensions i e vertical depths horizontal distances and temporal scale in fss was conducted to analyze the heterogeneity of the sample among dimensional distributions the results showed that the heterogeneity in samples among different soil layers was relatively high fig 8a while the horizontal distances had the least heterogeneity fig 8b and samples heterogeneity in temporal scale were between them fig 8c in fig 9 the results of the redundancy analysis was depicted they indicated that ec c bd ph silt and clay contents were all positively correlated to each other in twlp fig 9a while the vegetation attributes of cover height and dbh were slightly positively correlated among them in folp fig 9b the microclimate factors were closely correlated to sms and c specifically the sw was positively correlated to sms and c whereas the ta and rh had negative correlations at the same time the same factor had a converse relationship in filp fig 9c where ta and rh had positive effects and the dbh cv frbd sw had negative effects on c and sms for the eilp the soil particle compositions were the dominant factors in soil moisture storage and soil salt contents whereas the microclimate factors had little effect on them in this fss fig 9d to comprehensively evaluate the influence of soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors on soil moisture storage and soil salt content the partial redundancy analysis prda and variation partitioning vp based on these three groups were performed fig 10 for soil moisture storage sms fig 10a soil properties explained more variation than the attributes and microclimate factors which the independent influence can explain 48 5 of total influence p 0 01 the followed group was the vegetation attributes reaching 16 2 of the total influence p 0 01 while microclimate factors registered the lowest contribution with 8 7 of total influence p 0 01 the coupled effect and interaction of soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors played a key role 10 9 p 0 01 in reserving soil water for soil salt contents fig 10b the soil properties and microclimate factors were considered as two major contributors with 37 9 and 26 7 of the total influence respectively the vegetation attributes stood the 8 0 of total influence p 0 01 however the analyses were not significant p 0 05 therefore the most dominant factor for soil salinity was the effects of soil properties and microclimate factors fig 10b overall the soil properties played a more important role in reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of fss on soil properties and vegetation attributes enhancing soil properties using nature based solutions designing sustainable and integrated soil management practices or conserving the vegetation cover are some of the most important ecological benefits that soil surfaces can adopt which also coincide with our results and other ones in the fss qiao et al 2016 tiessen et al 1994 cerdà et al 2021 rodrigo comino et al 2020 in this study there were significant differences in soil properties under different patterns of fsss on the one hand soil bulk density bd and soil ph have no significant differences although the differences exist in particle size among treatments soil bulk density is influenced greatly by soil texture but it reflects the comprehensive soil state and is also affected by many factors such as soil organic matter content soil porosity soil hydrological processes and human activities e g management measures due to the same local tillage method and fertilization management local bd and soil ph among different patterns of fsss is consistent which also indicates the important impacts of human activities and management on soil properties wu et al 2018 cao et al 2020 bogunovic et al 2020 on the other hand this study found that the major difference in soil properties is soil particle composition among different patterns of fss because the shelterbelts improve the soil environment in fsss they change the soil s physical chemical processes which can lead to soil improvement under the long term protective effects of fsss hou et al 2003 in particular the soil particle composition expresses many key hydraulic properties such as porosity and soil water holding capacity which is also closely related to water and salt movement in soils rivest et al 2013 different patterns of fsss often have heterogeneity in structures of fsss including both aboveground and underground attributes lang et al 2019 for example the deeply rooted systems can develop downward and hold the surrounding soil in place to improve the air and water permeability and then the formed soil macropores are conducive to rainwater infiltration gas exchange and heat exchange liu et al 2018 in this way the fsss can avoid the oxygen poor layer in soils due to the too firm or sticky soil texture kizito et al 2007 furthermore it is beneficial to the absorption and exchange of nutrient elements and the formation of soil aggregates kuang et al 2016 tiessen et al 1994 inside fsss the deciduous layer on the ground forms humus in the ecosystem which increases soil organic matter and plays a key role in enhancing soil fertility kort 1988 lal et al 2015 because the ecological benefits depend on the low buffering capacity of the sandy loam soil in the study area leading the slight moderating role of the micro climate in subdesertic areas the vegetation attributes in fsss are relative important factors to determine the achievement of ecological benefits haddaway et al 2018 liu et al 2018 we found obvious differences in vegetation attributes among different patterns of fsss because of the competition between shelterbelt and farmland the utilization of water solar and nutrients resources are different which leads to differences in vegetation growth and growth states zhang et al 2019 the effects of vegetation attributes on the microenvironment will positively affect the composition and activity of soil microorganisms and then lead to variations in soil characteristics fertility and structure dong et al 2021 qiao et al 2016 notably fsss not only protect farmland ecology but also have some negative effects on the soil although in this study the crop growing states and crop yield were similar fig 3 among different patterns of fsss studies showed that there exist the stress of resource competition between tree roots and crops for water and nutrients in fsss smith et al 2021 therefore during the fss construction it is necessary to consider how the fss with different patterns can better alleviate the problem of resource competition to achieve better ecological benefits dong et al 2021 berger et al 2002 4 2 the effects of fss on the microclimate within the sphere of influences the microclimate is one of the most direct environmental factors that are protected and improved by sustainable management of fss wu et al 2019 musat et al 2021 due to the shelterbelt s windproof effects cooling effects and shielding effect fss directly affects the microclimate fu et al 2016 our study found that shelterbelts significantly reduced wind speed the primary ecological benefit and purpose of fss is the reduction of wind erosion guo et al 2020 qiao et al 2016 in farmland when the driving force caused by wind speed exceeds the limit of soil erosion resistance soil underlying the surface will produce energy and material dispersion process namely soil wind erosion especially during the dry period and poor vegetation coverage hou et al 2003 feizi et al 2019 the main reasons that shelterbelt weakens the wind are as follow a shelterbelt blocks the wind and changes the wind flow direction on the leeward side xie et al 2019 also the resistance of the shelterbelt will reduce the momentum of the wind and make it escape on the ground and then lead to a weakened wind with lower momentum zhang et al 2019 therefore different patterns of fsss had different effects on wind speed and all of them had a significantly lower wind speed than control treatments folp filp and eilp had similar windproof effects and were better than twlp fss is an effective measure to control wind erosion because of this windproof effect it can reduce the loss of fertile surface soil and promote crops growing in the field zhang et al 2019 fss can also reduce the variation range of near ground and soil temperature and have an important impact on water resources such as relative humidity evaporation horizontal precipitation etc first by changing the components of the heat budget in the vicinity of shelterbelts it can regulate the temperature in different seasons and times and create good conditions for the normal physiological activities and growth of crops fu et al 2016 xiao and huang 2016 therefore fss can adjust the temperature and humidity conditions and provide a good growth environment for crops second within the sphere of influence due to the shelterbelt s shielding effect the shelterbelt can effectively reduce solar radiation and light intensity with the reduction in evaporation the absolute humidity of near ground air in the fss was higher than that in the surrounding wilderness which in arid areas means increasing soil water content and reducing soil dryness lang et al 2019 fsss mainly depend on regulating the exchange of airflow and solar energy which affects the variations of microclimate factors hou et al 2003 moreover with the variations of microclimate factors an objective judgment on the protective effect and mechanism of fss on the eco environment can be made in practice liu et al 2018 this is not only very important for theoretical work but also very helpful for solving many agricultural management problems in ecological barren areas fu et al 2020 4 3 effects of different environmental factors on soil water storage and soil salinity as a green barrier of farmland the shelterbelt reduces water evaporation and controls groundwater level which plays a role in drainage of waterlogging and improvement of soil salinization dong et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 because of the redistribution and interception of atmospheric precipitation forest canopy in fsss can slow down surface runoff reduce raindrop splash erosion prevent surface erosion increase infiltration and achieve hydrological effects yin et al 2021 yang et al 2018 anwar et al 2021 this study found the spatial temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture storage and soil salt contents among different patterns of fsss in terms of the influence of fsss on soil moisture similar studies have found that the soil moisture content increased by 1 8 3 5 from may to june due to reduced soil evaporation fu et al 2016 the spatial and temporal distribution of sms and c under different patterns of fss are compared in this study the results showed that the deep layers were higher than the surface layers in vertical scales due to the influence of shelterbelts soil moisture storage decreased from the edge of the forest to 0 7 h while increasing from 0 7 to 3 h on the horizontal scale the variation in spatial distribution is mainly due to resource competition between farmland and shelterbelt hao et al 2019 the normal growth of trees requires relatively adequate water conditions and shelterbelts in fsss have the lush growth of trees which is supplied by irrigation farmland guo et al 2020 therefore different patterns of fsss have variations in the distribution of sms because the diversities in water resource utilization and consumption exist in each pattern the spatial temporal distribution of soil salinity was also compared in different patterns of fsss it has been proved that trees can accelerate soil desalting and relieve soil salinization yin et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 on the one hand the reason may be that trees reduce evaporation by reducing air temperature and wind speed wang et al 2015 on the other hand leaf transpiration and root water uptake can absorb and reduce soil salt which has a significant salt reduction effect within the fsss fu et al 2016 the main reasons for the variations of the spatial temporal distribution of soil salt content under different patterns of fsss were the reciprocal relationship between salinity and moisture in the soils there was a significant correlation between soil water and salt contents indicating a high degree of water and salt relation in the soils of fsss mayrinck et al 2019 specifically the effect of soil salt accumulation varied among the distances from the shelterbelt which was caused by the different degrees of solar radiation and evaporation due to the shielding effects of the shelterbelt zhao et al 2008 therefore the farmland near shelterbelt has a higher soil salt content than that in far away from shelterbelt the soil salt accumulation at the edge of the shelterbelt will affect the growth and development of crops in farmland in practice salt accumulation can be alleviated by agricultural measures such as straw mulching and broad irrigation lang et al 2019 4 4 implications for fss construction and agricultural water management in regards to differences in ecosystem functions of fsss this study focused on the comparison of water conservation and soil protection functions of different patterns of fsss zhao et al 2008 to sum up fsss have outstanding ecosystem functions with a variety of ecological environmental benefits smith et al 2021 besides there exists carbon fixation and oxygen release purification of environmental pollution and other ecological benefits fang 2021 cao et al 2021 because of the effects on soil moisture and microclimate fsss provided a suitable growth environment for farmland which can avoid strong wind erosion with warming sufficient fertilizer water supply notably shelterbelts also have an impact on the physiological functions of crops studies have shown that their effects are mainly manifested in turgor pressure photosynthesis water use efficiency stomatal opening and other aspects of plants which enhance photosynthesis and facilitate biomass accumulation hao et al 2019 within the fsss alfalfa maize and soybean can increase yield by 25 200 on average and leaf quality of herbage can also improve obviously mayrinck et al 2019 therefore fss has significant benefits to improve the crop growth environment in addition this study found that differences in soil properties in different patterns of fsss are mainly concentrated in the soil particle composition the microclimate factors and vegetation morphological attributes witness differences in spatial temporal scales among different patterns of fsss folp filp and eilp have a similar level of environmental benefits therefore in term of the area and cost during the fss construction folp has achieved the preferable ecological benefits and are worth popularization in the study area overall implications for fss construction and agricultural water management are that the environmental factors should be noticed and considered due to their effects on ecosystem functions such as soil properties and vegetation attributes shen et al 2016 yin et al 2021 cao et al 2021 nevertheless it is worth noticing that there exist the error sources in this study such as the influences of irrigation management or cultivated crops observation which may lead to overestimate the role of the fss on the modifications of soil properties the salt accumulation in the lower horizon is probably due to the soil texture and depends on the irrigation practices amounts and frequency which should be considered in further investigations also on the other hand the comprehensive evaluation methods and results focus on the spatial temporal distributions of soil properties vegetation attributes microclimates and related ecosystem functions based on soil water and salt conditions which could prove that fss should be actively promoted and encouraged ecological afforestation projects and agricultural water management in other regions with similar environmental conditions e g climate in the future haddaway et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of soil properties vegetation attributes microclimate soil moisture storage and salt contents under different patterns of fsss located in a typical desert oasis zone were analyzed to discuss the ecological effects and ecosystem functions of shelterbelt systems the key findings are as follows first the leading difference in soil properties of fss is the soil particle composition and the folp and eilp have more soil sand contents than others for vegetation attributes the folp and eilp registered a larger canopy size than others second compared to the control all patterns of fss have significant ecological effects on microclimate improvement however the folp and filp achieved the same level of ecological effects as eilp and all of them are better than the twlp third the spatial and temporal distribution of sms and c under different patterns of fss are that mainly different at the vertical scales rather than horizontal or temporal scales at last based on rda and vp analysis the soil properties played a dominant role in reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity especially the soil particle composition we thus suggest that the folp had the better ecological effects in this study area moreover notably not only the patterns of fss but also their actual growing conditions and soil properties should be considered in practice thereby better ecological effects

9388,farmland shelterbelt system fss in oasis desert ecotones can effectively improve ecosystem services especially in fragile agricultural areas however the spatial temporal heterogeneity of its ecological effects still needs further clarity because the interactions are complex and multiple understanding this allows us to know the key practical significance of ecological construction and

played a more important role in reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity than vegetation attributes and microclimates which the independent influence can explain 48 5 of total influence

management spatial temporal heterogeneity ecological effects 1 introduction farmland shelterbelt system fss has a recognized great significance for improving the environment harnessing wind erosion and protecting farmland shen et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 by adjusting the microclimate and improving soil physical chemical properties the fsss can generate favorable conditions for crop production and achieve high and stable yields bao et al 2012 as a crucial measure of ecological recovery fss construction begins with the western great plains of the united states in the 1930 s then the rehabilitation of nature project in the former soviet union in the 1950 s and finally after the chinese three north shelter forest programme tnsfp in the 1970s smith et al 2021 nowadays the significance of fss has been gradually recognized worldwide under the context of the more and more serious global environmental issues related to climate change land degradation processes and loss of biodiversity fang 2021 haddaway et al 2018 in fsss a dependent relationship exists between environmental factors soil climate and biology etc and ecosystem functions soil hydrology etc which show the beneficial effects and contributions on the regional ecological system yin et al 2021 shen et al 2016 anwar et al 2021 however due to the shading effects and lateral extension of the root system by shelterbelts resource competition e g water solar and nutrient exists between shelterbelts and farmland zhao et al 2008 fu et al 2020 as fss can effectively improve the microclimate conditions and soil properties and then enhance ecological benefits they should be efficiently managed cao et al 2021 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 for example fsss can reduce wind speed by 20 30 compared to open farmlands through their influence on airflow structure musat et al 2021 reduction in wind speed and variation of other meteorological factors e g air temperature and solar radiation can also reduce evaporation by 20 30 increase the soil water content by 1 4 and air relative humidity by 5 10 and then generate a microclimate conducive to the crop growth smith et al 2021 shelterbelt patterns of fss mean the arrangements of forest lines around farmland which are usually composed of natural forests and plantations haddaway et al 2018 the factors that determine the ecological benefit of fss include plant height coverage size and arrangement in shelterbelts haddaway et al 2018 xie et al 2019 fsss can improve soil environment and quality then modify ecosystem functions of reserving water storage and controlling soil salt contents under different patterns fu et al 2016 valipour et al 2020 the biological drainage of shelterbelt can also reduce the activation of the non desired soil hydrological process and then strengthen the leaching power to achieve the alleviation of soil salinization which also prevents soil secondary salinization dong et al 2021 the fss is also able to delay the accumulation of salt and accelerate soil desalting through decreasing evaporation qiao et al 2016 which is also affected by the shelterbelt patterns in fsss the decomposition of the dead leaves and underground microorganisms makes them symbiotic and fertilizing promotes the soil ripening process thus enhancing the ecological function and sustainable farmland productivity zhang et al 2019 yin et al 2021 and soil properties zhang et al 2019 2012 the distribution of soil water and salt contents in different patterns of fsss is characterized by complex spatial temporal heterogeneity dong et al 2021 specifically when it exists an interdependence between soil water and salt content their distribution varies in horizontal distance vertical depth and seasons in fsss shen et al 2016 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 studies have shown that the pattern of fss has a great influence on vegetation water absorption and spatial temporal dynamics in soil moisture shen et al 2016 du et al 2021 therefore the shelterbelt shows an effect on soil moisture in farmland namely the horizontal distance from the shelterbelt edge directly affects soil moisture distribution fu et al 2016 in addition some studies have shown that the vertical distribution of soil moisture is mainly affected by the differences in vegetation physiological activity e g root water uptake and soil texture conditions in fsss rivest et al 2013 yang et al 2012 attending the temporal scale the differences in water consumption and competition caused by every growth stage of shelterbelt and farmland during each period of growing seasons will lead to variations in soil water and salt distribution yang et al 2018 at present there are many theoretical analyses about the effects of the fss patterns on environmental factors and ecological benefits but the focus based on the spatiotemporal scale and the specific interaction mechanism remains to be further studied wang et al 2015 valipour et al 2020 anwar et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to analyze the spatial temporal variation characteristics and influencing factors of soil moisture and salinity under different patterns of fsss to guide the management of agricultural water resources and saline soil amelioration in practice shi et al 2011 therefore in this study different patterns of fsss were selected in a representative desert oasis ecotone and soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors across three different spatial temporal dimensions were measured during three growing seasons in recent years which represent the corresponding ecosystem functions li et al 2003 the main goals of this research are 1 clarifying the spatiotemporal distributions of soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors as well as soil water storage soil salt content and related ecosystem functions under different patterns of fsss 2 exploring the relationship between environmental factors and ecosystem functions under different spatiotemporal dimensions and patterns of fsss and 3 finding the more sustainable and long term patterns of fsss in terms of water conservation and soil amelioration we hypothesize that this study could provide a firm data basis for fsss and a novel theoretical basis for future planning of farmland shelterbelt construction and agricultural water management 2 materials and methods 2 1

the study area the soil texture under 0 1 m depth is mainly sandy loam and the soil type is mainly brown calcic soil and gray desert soil hao 2022 to ensure the quality of agricultural production and the ecological environment a shelterbelt is the main local practical measure for ecological protection there are different conventional patterns of shelterbelt and agricultural systems in this region aiming to get fine eco environmental effects in practice with the traditional grid and banded structure the shelterbelt system includes the primary tree species of populus populus alba var populus popular s populus gansuensis salix cheilophila schneid and elaeagnus angustifolia linn the main crops associated with the shelterbelts are corn zea mays l sunflower helianthus annuus l and summer squash cucurbita pepo l 2 2 experimental site design and field sampling method in this study four typical and representative patterns of farmland shelterbelts with the fine ecological benefits in practices i e two lines patterns twlp four lines patterns folp five lines patterns filp and eight lines patterns eilp were selected as experimental sites to compare the soil physicochemical properties biological attributes soil water storages and soil slat contents among different patterns of shelterbelts modified agricultural systems fig 1c trees in the shelterbelts have a similar stand age 30 years and height 20 25 m and the vegetation also has similar attributes in farmlands of fsss the current vegetation status dimensions and specific information of each sampling site are included in table 1 there are three sampling plots at each site which are set away from each main shelterbelt farmland edge toward the direction of the protected farmland namely at 0 3 h 0 7 h 1 h 2 h and 3 h of each sampling plot h equals the canopy height of the main shelterbelt notably the 3 h sampling points are located at the center of farmlands so locations serve as control treatments with no influence by shelterbelts soil samples were collected at the beginning middle and end may august and october of each growing season during 2019 2021 at each site three sampling points were selected randomly with a minimum distance of 3 m between the plots to minimize sampling error at each sampling point soil samples were collected separately and taken to the laboratory for analysis with a soil auger at the depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm fig 1b 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil physicochemical properties in the laboratory soil samples were stored in aluminium boxes to conserve the initial conditions first soil water content swc g g 1 using the oven drying method at 105 c for a period of 9 h was measured moreover soil cores for estimating bulk density bd g cm 3 were used and also dried at 105 weighed all samples were air dried and then sieved through a 2 mm mesh sieve then it was able to estimate soil electrical conductivity ec μs cm 1 and ph by extraction solution and using a conductivity meter dds 307a mingbo china soil organic carbon soc g kg 1 was also determined using the k2cr2o7 oxidation reduction titration method walkley 1947 soil texture clay 0 002 mm silt 0 02 0 002 mm and sand 2 0 02 mm was analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england in this study soil moisture storage and salt contents were chosen to represent ecosystem functions of reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity respectively soil moisture storage sms mm was calculated using eq 1 1 s m s i 1 n θ i b d i s t i 10 where i is the number of the soil layer and n represents the total soil layers θ i and t i means the soil water content g g 1 and soil depth m in the ith soil layer s is related to the plot area m2 bd i is the bulk density in the ith soil layer g cm 3 finally 10 is considered the transfer coefficient according to the empirical formula the water soluble total soil salt content c g kg 1 was calculated using eq 2 2 c i ec i 9 2 2000 where c i and ec i were the total soil salt content c g kg 1 and soil electrical conductivity μs cm 1 at 25 c in the ith soil layer respectively 2 3 2 microclimate factors affected by shelterbelt microclimate conditions around the sampling points were characterized coinciding with each experimental period the miniature lysimeters height 15 cm inner diameter 20 cm were used to measure the evapotranspiration ev mm at each sampling point of the shelterbelt for 3 consecutive days wang et al 2020 the device was weighed after sunset 19 00 20 00 every evening by an electronic balance with a sensitivity of 1 00 g the solar radiation sr lux air temperature ta and relative humidity rh at the height of 2 m in each forest network were observed in parallel with a digital illuminometer gm1020 and a hand held temperature and humidity measuring instrument in each shelterbelt network at 8 00 10 00 11 00 13 00 and 17 00 19 00 every day for 3 consecutive days the wind speeds sw m s 1 at 0 3 h 0 7 h 1 h 2 h and 3 h from the leeward side of farmland shelterbelts were measured continuously with the use of a multi channel anemometer zagfskx iiometer where the point at the farthest location serves as control treatments with no influence by shelterbelts 2 3 3 vegetation attributes in farmland and shelterbelt vegetation attributes in farmland and shelterbelt were also surveyed in the middle of each growing season august from 2019 to 2021 for above ground attributes in a shelterbelt lidar light detection and ranging method was conducted to scan different patterns of a shelterbelt specifically the selected shelterbelts were scanned using a riegl vz 400 series ground based scanner to get point cloud database cao et al 2021 to reduce data redundancy the lidar point cloud is preprocessed by splicing denoising and normalization lidar 360 software geocue usa was used to extract the single tree according to seed spots the improved progressive triangulation dense algorithm was also used to classify ground points and then the irregular triangulation interpolation algorithm is used to generate an accurate and high resolution dem digital elevation model achieving the separation of the point cloud from the ground and finally extracting the single tree with the values of each plant height m diameter at breast height dbh m canopy size cs m2 height below branch hbb m and canopy volume cv m3 the individual height of crop and crop yield were conducted by measuring standard samples selected by the average standard sample method and farm household survey in the field respectively moreover vegetation cover vc was estimated by photographs taken from a high angle and photo analysis in photoshop 2018 software adobe usa was done the mean value of each horizontal point represents the data of this fss eq 3 3 v c i 1 n n 1 n 1 k k 1 k v c n where n is the times of measurements and vc n represents the vegetation coverage in i patterns of fss i e twlp folp filp and eilp which is calculated from k times measurement for fine roots biomass density frbd g kg 1 in farmlands and shelterbelts samples were collected to a depth close to 100 cm using a 7 cm diameter root auger around each sampling location samples were sealed in plastic bags transported to the laboratory washed with a water spray and then the fine roots were picked out manually the roots were oven dried at 70 c for 24 h to obtain dry root biomass fine roots biomass density frbd g cm 3 was calculated as follows in eq 4 fu et al 2010 4 frbd w d v s where w d is the dry weight of root systems g and v s represents the soil volume cm3 2 4 statistical analyses the mean and the standard deviation of every index in this study were calculated one way anova and lsd were used to determine the differences

the three sets of environmental variables expressed as r2 adjusted by the number of variables of each set principal component analysis pca and redundancy analysis rda were also conducted in canoco 5 0 microcomputer power usa to compare the relationship between environmental factors and ecosystem functions under different conditions or patterns of fsss the significance of the fractions of variance calculated with variation partitioning was tested by running a monte carlo permutation test 999 permutations the interpolation and maps of soil moisture storage and soil salt contents were generated

microsoft usa 3 results 3 1 soil properties under different patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems there were no significant differences in ec bd and ph among different patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems for ec value the filp obtained the lowest values 169 78 μs cm 1 and twlp the highest ones 240 28 μs cm 1 fig 2a soil bd was very similar in the four patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems reaching 1 65 g cm 3 1 64 g cm 3 1 63 g cm 3 1 62 g cm 3 respectively fig 2b soil ph of four patterns of farmland shelterbelt systems was all weak alkaline 8 08 7 93 8 05 7 89 fig 2c the significant differences appeared in the soil particle composition fig 2d f soil clay content was low in all four patterns from 1 2 in eilp to 3 3 in twlp in folp and eilp the silt content was relatively low reaching 51 6 and 41 5 respectively fig 2e however sand content in those two patterns was significantly higher than in the other ones fig 2f in addition the soil clay content in twlp was significantly higher than that of eilp 3 2 differences in vegetation attributes at different patterns of fsss the plant heights of different patterns of fss were similar all of them around 20 25 m fig 3a however the dbh and hbb obtained significant differences among the studied patterns the folp and eilp registered the highest hbb than the other ones which reached 1 82 and 2 01 m respectively the folp and filp obtained the largest dbh 0 41 and 0 48 m respectively the filp and twlp amounted to the minimum hbb and dbh which were 1 08 and 1 74 respectively fig 3b c for the canopy morphology significant differences exist considering the various patterns of studied fss the folp and eilp showed significant advantages in canopy size and canopy volume while the twlp and filp recorded the lower ones fig 3d e the canopy size of different fss ranked from the highest to lowest values as follows folp 8 70 m2 eilp 6 91 m2 twlp 4 64 m2 filp 4 47 m2 with their canopy volume folp 88 97 m3 eilp 77 41 m3 filp 43 99 m3 twlp 22 30 m3 the fine root biomass density frbd was significantly different while vegetation cover vc did not obtain significant differences among them the frbd in twlp was 0 74 g cm 2 and significantly lower than that in folp 1 31 g cm 2 and filp 1 24 g cm 2 the vegetation attributes in farmland were similar among different fsss for example the vc of cultivated crop in four patterns of fss were 87 7 85 7 86 1 and 84 3 respectively fig 3f g the individual height of the crop were 124 6 cm 134 5 cm 129 1 cm and 130 9 cm with crop yield of 15 06 t hm 2 15 75 t hm 2 149 29 t hm 2 and 155 64 t hm 2 in twlp folp filp and eilp respectively fig 3h i 3 3 differences in environmental factors microclimate at different patterns of fss we observed significant differences between the farmland shelterbelt systems and the control treatments namely the fsss registered the fine ecological effects fig 4 specifically the ecological effects of twlp were relatively weak while eilp were the best it is worth noting that folp or filp achieved equivalent protective effects to eilp fig 4 for the wind speed the twlp was significantly greater than other patterns fig 4a reaching a 41 8 reduction compared to the control plot so as the solar radiation 23 9 for the relative humidity air temperature and evaporation the four patterns had significantly improved effects compared to the control treatments while there were no significant differences among them fig 4c e especially the evaporation was reduced than the control by 60 7 72 3 68 3 and 73 1 in twlp folp filp and eilp respectively specifically fss can effectively reduce soil evaporation as the highlight contents shown in table 2 the evaporation ev at various horizontal distances in the fss was significantly lower than that at the control point the ev in eilp was the lowest one 0 47 mm which was reduced by 55 the wind speed sw of all points in fss was significantly lower than that of the control point 3 4 m s 1 and the sw in folp 0 90 m s 1 was reduced by 74 solar radiation sr in fss was also lower than that in the control point 104733 lux in the horizontal distances the sr at 0 3 h from the shelterbelt edge was significantly lower than that of other sampling points in fss table 2 from 1 3 h sr gradually increased with the distance from the shelterbelt edge while it decreased significantly at 0 3 h near the shelterbelt edge shelterbelt showed cooling and humidification effects the air temperatures ta in fss were lower than that in the control point 23 2 and the relative humidity rh in fss was higher than in the control point 22 1 3 4 spatial temporal distribution of soil water storage and soil salt contents under different patterns of fsss the results showed that it exists spatiotemporal differences in the distribution of soil moisture storage considering different patterns of fss fig 5 in general for the spatial scale the moisture storage in the deep layers was better than that in the surface layers while that in the near shelterbelt edge was slightly lower than that in the far locations at the temporal scale at the beginning of the growing season the moisture storage was relatively better than that in the middle and end of the growing season specifically the total moisture storage in 0 100 cm in may august and october were 281 90 mm 231 61 mm and 150 22 mm respectively on the other hand the moisture storage in filp and eilp was relatively low and the drop in soil moisture level in the surface layer and along the middle and end of the growing season for twlp and folp better soil moisture storage existed in the deep soil layer and far locations from the edge of the shelterbelt fig 5 as shown in fig 6 the spatiotemporal distribution of soil salt content in different patterns of fss was different considering the vertical soil layer the salt contents were lower than that in the deep ones the mean salt content was higher than 0 10 g kg 1 when the soil layer reached 40 60 cm soil depth for the horizontal distance from the shelterbelt edge there was no significant difference in soil salt content from 0 3 h to 3 h which were all around 0 11 g kg 1 on average at each location paying attention to the temporal scale soil salt content at the beginning may 0 11 g kg 1 and middle august 0 12 g kg 1 of the growing season was similar which was slightly higher than that at the end of the growing season october 0 09 g kg 1 specifically the concentration of soil salinity in twlp and folp was migrated from the far locations to the near shelterbelt edge during the growing season fig 6 on the other hand there existed differences in soil salinity during the growing season in filp and eilp the salt contents in eilp were relatively low and mainly concentrated in the deep soil near the shelterbelt edge fig 6 overall the median values of the soil moisture storage sms mm decreased from folp 231 34 mm to eilp 226 74 mm filp 219 27 mm and twlp 198 38 mm so the upper quartile values fig 7a the filp registered the lowest quartile values 156 22 mm and minimum ones 74 34 mm among different patterns of fss while the folp had the highest upper quartile values 298 95 mm and maximum ones 395 31 mm the upper and lower quartile values of soil moisture storage ranged from 156 22 to 298 95 mm which was almost twice the fold for the soil salt contents the median values decreased from eilp 0 122 g kg 1 to filp 0 113 g kg 1 twlp 0 092 g kg 1 and folp 0 088 g kg 1 so as the upper and lower quartile values fig 7b the folp had the minimum soil salt content 0 050 g kg 1 and the eilp had the maximum one 0 322 g kg 1 3 5 relationship between environmental factors and ecosystem functions in fsss in general the soil moisture content was closely correlated to the soil particle composition and it was negatively correlated with sand content but positively correlated with clay and silt content nevertheless soil salinity was correlated to the meteorological factors which recorded a negative relationship with relative humidity and air temperature whereas the bulk density and soil moisture were slightly positively correlated with soil salinity fig 8 furthermore the principal component analysis pca under the various spatial temporal dimensions i e vertical depths horizontal distances and temporal scale in fss was conducted to analyze the heterogeneity of the sample among dimensional distributions the results showed that the heterogeneity in samples among different soil layers was relatively high fig 8a while the horizontal distances had the least heterogeneity fig 8b and samples heterogeneity in temporal scale were between them fig 8c in fig 9 the results of the redundancy analysis was depicted they indicated that ec c bd ph silt and clay contents were all positively correlated to each other in twlp fig 9a while the vegetation attributes of cover height and dbh were slightly positively correlated among them in folp fig 9b the microclimate factors were closely correlated to sms and c specifically the sw was positively correlated to sms and c whereas the ta and rh had negative correlations at the same time the same factor had a converse relationship in filp fig 9c where ta and rh had positive effects and the dbh cv frbd sw had negative effects on c and sms for the eilp the soil particle compositions were the dominant factors in soil moisture storage and soil salt contents whereas the microclimate factors had little effect on them in this fss fig 9d to comprehensively evaluate the influence of soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors on soil moisture storage and soil salt content the partial redundancy analysis prda and variation partitioning vp based on these three groups were performed fig 10 for soil moisture storage sms fig 10a soil properties explained more variation than the attributes and microclimate factors which the independent influence can explain 48 5 of total influence p 0 01 the followed group was the vegetation attributes reaching 16 2 of the total influence p 0 01 while microclimate factors registered the lowest contribution with 8 7 of total influence p 0 01 the coupled effect and interaction of soil properties vegetation attributes and microclimate factors played a key role 10 9 p 0 01 in reserving soil water for soil salt contents fig 10b the soil properties and microclimate factors were considered as two major contributors with 37 9 and 26 7 of the total influence respectively the vegetation attributes stood the 8 0 of total influence p 0 01 however the analyses were not significant p 0 05 therefore the most dominant factor for soil salinity was the effects of soil properties and microclimate factors fig 10b overall the soil properties played a more important role in reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of fss on soil properties and vegetation attributes enhancing soil properties using nature based solutions designing sustainable and integrated soil management practices or conserving the vegetation cover are some of the most important ecological benefits that soil surfaces can adopt which also coincide with our results and other ones in the fss qiao et al 2016 tiessen et al 1994 cerdà et al 2021 rodrigo comino et al 2020 in this study there were significant differences in soil properties under different patterns of fsss on the one hand soil bulk density bd and soil ph have no significant differences although the differences exist in particle size among treatments soil bulk density is influenced greatly by soil texture but it reflects the comprehensive soil state and is also affected by many factors such as soil organic matter content soil porosity soil hydrological processes and human activities e g management measures due to the same local tillage method and fertilization management local bd and soil ph among different patterns of fsss is consistent which also indicates the important impacts of human activities and management on soil properties wu et al 2018 cao et al 2020 bogunovic et al 2020 on the other hand this study found that the major difference in soil properties is soil particle composition among different patterns of fss because the shelterbelts improve the soil environment in fsss they change the soil s physical chemical processes which can lead to soil improvement under the long term protective effects of fsss hou et al 2003 in particular the soil particle composition expresses many key hydraulic properties such as porosity and soil water holding capacity which is also closely related to water and salt movement in soils rivest et al 2013 different patterns of fsss often have heterogeneity in structures of fsss including both aboveground and underground attributes lang et al 2019 for example the deeply rooted systems can develop downward and hold the surrounding soil in place to improve the air and water permeability and then the formed soil macropores are conducive to rainwater infiltration gas exchange and heat exchange liu et al 2018 in this way the fsss can avoid the oxygen poor layer in soils due to the too firm or sticky soil texture kizito et al 2007 furthermore it is beneficial to the absorption and exchange of nutrient elements and the formation of soil aggregates kuang et al 2016 tiessen et al 1994 inside fsss the deciduous layer on the ground forms humus in the ecosystem which increases soil organic matter and plays a key role in enhancing soil fertility kort 1988 lal et al 2015 because the ecological benefits depend on the low buffering capacity of the sandy loam soil in the study area leading the slight moderating role of the micro climate in subdesertic areas the vegetation attributes in fsss are relative important factors to determine the achievement of ecological benefits haddaway et al 2018 liu et al 2018 we found obvious differences in vegetation attributes among different patterns of fsss because of the competition between shelterbelt and farmland the utilization of water solar and nutrients resources are different which leads to differences in vegetation growth and growth states zhang et al 2019 the effects of vegetation attributes on the microenvironment will positively affect the composition and activity of soil microorganisms and then lead to variations in soil characteristics fertility and structure dong et al 2021 qiao et al 2016 notably fsss not only protect farmland ecology but also have some negative effects on the soil although in this study the crop growing states and crop yield were similar fig 3 among different patterns of fsss studies showed that there exist the stress of resource competition between tree roots and crops for water and nutrients in fsss smith et al 2021 therefore during the fss construction it is necessary to consider how the fss with different patterns can better alleviate the problem of resource competition to achieve better ecological benefits dong et al 2021 berger et al 2002 4 2 the effects of fss on the microclimate within the sphere of influences the microclimate is one of the most direct environmental factors that are protected and improved by sustainable management of fss wu et al 2019 musat et al 2021 due to the shelterbelt s windproof effects cooling effects and shielding effect fss directly affects the microclimate fu et al 2016 our study found that shelterbelts significantly reduced wind speed the primary ecological benefit and purpose of fss is the reduction of wind erosion guo et al 2020 qiao et al 2016 in farmland when the driving force caused by wind speed exceeds the limit of soil erosion resistance soil underlying the surface will produce energy and material dispersion process namely soil wind erosion especially during the dry period and poor vegetation coverage hou et al 2003 feizi et al 2019 the main reasons that shelterbelt weakens the wind are as follow a shelterbelt blocks the wind and changes the wind flow direction on the leeward side xie et al 2019 also the resistance of the shelterbelt will reduce the momentum of the wind and make it escape on the ground and then lead to a weakened wind with lower momentum zhang et al 2019 therefore different patterns of fsss had different effects on wind speed and all of them had a significantly lower wind speed than control treatments folp filp and eilp had similar windproof effects and were better than twlp fss is an effective measure to control wind erosion because of this windproof effect it can reduce the loss of fertile surface soil and promote crops growing in the field zhang et al 2019 fss can also reduce the variation range of near ground and soil temperature and have an important impact on water resources such as relative humidity evaporation horizontal precipitation etc first by changing the components of the heat budget in the vicinity of shelterbelts it can regulate the temperature in different seasons and times and create good conditions for the normal physiological activities and growth of crops fu et al 2016 xiao and huang 2016 therefore fss can adjust the temperature and humidity conditions and provide a good growth environment for crops second within the sphere of influence due to the shelterbelt s shielding effect the shelterbelt can effectively reduce solar radiation and light intensity with the reduction in evaporation the absolute humidity of near ground air in the fss was higher than that in the surrounding wilderness which in arid areas means increasing soil water content and reducing soil dryness lang et al 2019 fsss mainly depend on regulating the exchange of airflow and solar energy which affects the variations of microclimate factors hou et al 2003 moreover with the variations of microclimate factors an objective judgment on the protective effect and mechanism of fss on the eco environment can be made in practice liu et al 2018 this is not only very important for theoretical work but also very helpful for solving many agricultural management problems in ecological barren areas fu et al 2020 4 3 effects of different environmental factors on soil water storage and soil salinity as a green barrier of farmland the shelterbelt reduces water evaporation and controls groundwater level which plays a role in drainage of waterlogging and improvement of soil salinization dong et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 because of the redistribution and interception of atmospheric precipitation forest canopy in fsss can slow down surface runoff reduce raindrop splash erosion prevent surface erosion increase infiltration and achieve hydrological effects yin et al 2021 yang et al 2018 anwar et al 2021 this study found the spatial temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture storage and soil salt contents among different patterns of fsss in terms of the influence of fsss on soil moisture similar studies have found that the soil moisture content increased by 1 8 3 5 from may to june due to reduced soil evaporation fu et al 2016 the spatial and temporal distribution of sms and c under different patterns of fss are compared in this study the results showed that the deep layers were higher than the surface layers in vertical scales due to the influence of shelterbelts soil moisture storage decreased from the edge of the forest to 0 7 h while increasing from 0 7 to 3 h on the horizontal scale the variation in spatial distribution is mainly due to resource competition between farmland and shelterbelt hao et al 2019 the normal growth of trees requires relatively adequate water conditions and shelterbelts in fsss have the lush growth of trees which is supplied by irrigation farmland guo et al 2020 therefore different patterns of fsss have variations in the distribution of sms because the diversities in water resource utilization and consumption exist in each pattern the spatial temporal distribution of soil salinity was also compared in different patterns of fsss it has been proved that trees can accelerate soil desalting and relieve soil salinization yin et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 on the one hand the reason may be that trees reduce evaporation by reducing air temperature and wind speed wang et al 2015 on the other hand leaf transpiration and root water uptake can absorb and reduce soil salt which has a significant salt reduction effect within the fsss fu et al 2016 the main reasons for the variations of the spatial temporal distribution of soil salt content under different patterns of fsss were the reciprocal relationship between salinity and moisture in the soils there was a significant correlation between soil water and salt contents indicating a high degree of water and salt relation in the soils of fsss mayrinck et al 2019 specifically the effect of soil salt accumulation varied among the distances from the shelterbelt which was caused by the different degrees of solar radiation and evaporation due to the shielding effects of the shelterbelt zhao et al 2008 therefore the farmland near shelterbelt has a higher soil salt content than that in far away from shelterbelt the soil salt accumulation at the edge of the shelterbelt will affect the growth and development of crops in farmland in practice salt accumulation can be alleviated by agricultural measures such as straw mulching and broad irrigation lang et al 2019 4 4 implications for fss construction and agricultural water management in regards to differences in ecosystem functions of fsss this study focused on the comparison of water conservation and soil protection functions of different patterns of fsss zhao et al 2008 to sum up fsss have outstanding ecosystem functions with a variety of ecological environmental benefits smith et al 2021 besides there exists carbon fixation and oxygen release purification of environmental pollution and other ecological benefits fang 2021 cao et al 2021 because of the effects on soil moisture and microclimate fsss provided a suitable growth environment for farmland which can avoid strong wind erosion with warming sufficient fertilizer water supply notably shelterbelts also have an impact on the physiological functions of crops studies have shown that their effects are mainly manifested in turgor pressure photosynthesis water use efficiency stomatal opening and other aspects of plants which enhance photosynthesis and facilitate biomass accumulation hao et al 2019 within the fsss alfalfa maize and soybean can increase yield by 25 200 on average and leaf quality of herbage can also improve obviously mayrinck et al 2019 therefore fss has significant benefits to improve the crop growth environment in addition this study found that differences in soil properties in different patterns of fsss are mainly concentrated in the soil particle composition the microclimate factors and vegetation morphological attributes witness differences in spatial temporal scales among different patterns of fsss folp filp and eilp have a similar level of environmental benefits therefore in term of the area and cost during the fss construction folp has achieved the preferable ecological benefits and are worth popularization in the study area overall implications for fss construction and agricultural water management are that the environmental factors should be noticed and considered due to their effects on ecosystem functions such as soil properties and vegetation attributes shen et al 2016 yin et al 2021 cao et al 2021 nevertheless it is worth noticing that there exist the error sources in this study such as the influences of irrigation management or cultivated crops observation which may lead to overestimate the role of the fss on the modifications of soil properties the salt accumulation in the lower horizon is probably due to the soil texture and depends on the irrigation practices amounts and frequency which should be considered in further investigations also on the other hand the comprehensive evaluation methods and results focus on the spatial temporal distributions of soil properties vegetation attributes microclimates and related ecosystem functions based on soil water and salt conditions which could prove that fss should be actively promoted and encouraged ecological afforestation projects and agricultural water management in other regions with similar environmental conditions e g climate in the future haddaway et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of soil properties vegetation attributes microclimate soil moisture storage and salt contents under different patterns of fsss located in a typical desert oasis zone were analyzed to discuss the ecological effects and ecosystem functions of shelterbelt systems the key findings are as follows first the leading difference in soil properties of fss is the soil particle composition and the folp and eilp have more soil sand contents than others for vegetation attributes the folp and eilp registered a larger canopy size than others second compared to the control all patterns of fss have significant ecological effects on microclimate improvement however the folp and filp achieved the same level of ecological effects as eilp and all of them are better than the twlp third the spatial and temporal distribution of sms and c under different patterns of fss are that mainly different at the vertical scales rather than horizontal or temporal scales at last based on rda and vp analysis the soil properties played a dominant role in reserving soil water and controlling soil salinity especially the soil particle composition we thus suggest that the folp had the better ecological effects in this study area moreover notably not only the patterns of fss but also their actual growing conditions and soil properties should be considered in practice thereby better ecological effects

9389,the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is a widely used watershed scale model however it does not comprise any functions that can be used to simulate rice paddy fields thereby hindering its applicability in many asian countries to address this limitation a paddy field simulation method was developed by considering the water detention effect and seasonal changes in the outlet height of paddy fields this was achieved using the existing functions of hspf surface ftable a function of the relationship between surface water storage and outflow was applied to represent the physical structure and inundated condition of paddy fields surface ftable was temporally changed by special actions an hspf module to reflect the seasonal variation in drainage outlet height by employing these methods hspf was applied to paddy fields for evaluating the model performance on comparing the simulated and observed values of ponding depth and surface outflow the model showed good performance with a coefficient of determination that ranged from 0 71 to 0 89 and an index of agreement that ranged from 0 92 to 0 97 comparing the results of the simulation performed with or without surface ftable the simulation with surface ftable exhibited a reduced surface outflow 40 0 due to the blocking effect of the paddy field a decreased infiltration 17 3 due to the saturation of the upper soil zone and a higher level of soil water in all subsurface layers based on these differences in each component it is necessary to apply surface ftable when considering the hydrological processes of paddy fields for hspf modeling the simulation method developed in this study only uses the existing functions of hspf without performing any external modifications therefore it can be used conveniently to improve the applicability of hspf in rice growing regions keywords paddy field watershed modeling hydrological simulation program fortran surface ftable special actions outlet height 1 introduction in watershed modeling it is important to understand the characteristics of the target basin to facilitate appropriate utilization of models and yield accurate simulation results rice paddy fields are widely distributed in asian countries and exhibit hydrological processes that are different from those observed in other agricultural lands chin et al 2002 this aspect needs to be carefully considered in watershed modeling owing to the physical structure of rice paddy fields water tends to accumulate in these fields and water movement is delayed during the growing season kang et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of water detention on watershed modeling moreover runoff characteristics in rice paddy fields exhibit temporal variations because the drainage outlet height changes depending on the growth stage of rice crops fao 1989 therefore it is important to reproduce the characteristic features of rice paddy fields in watershed modeling of rice growing regions such as korea and other asian countries most hydrological models that incorporate the governing mechanisms of paddy fields are field scale models such as creams paddy chin et al 2002 seo et al 2002 gleams paddy chung et al 2003 paddymod jeon et al 2004 and apex paddy choi et al 2017 2021 field scale models are specialized for performing detailed analyses of the physical processes that occur in paddy fields or small agricultural watersheds jung et al 2011 thus the primary characteristics of paddy fields such as water detention effects and seasonal variations in the outlet height are considered in field scale models however if a watershed scale analysis considering the hydrological process in paddy fields is required field scale models do not have the capacity to perform the analysis alone and need to be combined with watershed scale models kim et al 2020 lee et al 2018 the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf johanson et al 1980 and the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 are representative watershed scale models that have mainly been used for agricultural lands however they lack the functions needed for watershed modeling in paddy fields because they were first developed for agricultural lands that only comprised ordinary fields agricultural lands are classified into various categories when using hspf however there is no category corresponding to paddy fields although paddy fields are specified in the land use classification when using swat there is no option to select the type of paddy field dry or inundation thus the water detention effects of paddy fields cannot be simulated to overcome the limitations of existing field scale or watershed scale models several studies have modified watershed scale models to ensure that the mechanisms of paddy fields are included based on the above mentioned watershed scale models swat and hspf modified models or simulation methods have been developed to consider the effects of paddy fields in watershed modeling modified swat models such as swat agriman kim et al 2005 swat paddy tsuchiya et al 2018 and several unnamed models kang et al 2006 sakaguchi et al 2014 are based on the pothole module of swat the pothole module was originally developed to simulate potholes or enclosed shallow depressions in some regions of america du et al 2005 as the module can simulate surface water storage researchers have attempted to modify its source code to account for the characteristics of paddy fields however the pothole module exhibits some drawbacks in simulating particular forms of paddy fields or calculating the amount of irrigation evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the paddy fields kang et al 2006 kim et al 2005 sakaguchi et al 2014 tsuchiya et al 2018 several modified swat models have been suggested to improve different aspects of the pothole module however these models are inadequate for completely resolving the above mentioned problems or fail to indicate the changes in drainage height over time hspf paddy jeon et al 2007 is a modified hspf model that comprises additional functions to simulate the hydrology and water quality of rice paddy fields this model was developed by modifying the source code of the surface water section proute in hspf however it was designed for water discharge over the dike thereby overlooking the drainage outlet height or its variation paddy rch jung et al 2019 is a simulation method based on a feature of hspf ftable in the free flowing reach or mixed reservoir rchres module which is used to represent the hydrological processes in paddy fields however the rchres module comprises no function to simulate infiltration therefore the infiltration process under the water detention effect is not fully considered in paddy rch additionally the drainage outlet height can only be changed up to five times due to the limitation of ftable seong et al 2018 also developed a paddy simulation method based on a feature of hspf surface ftable in the pervious land perlnd module surface ftable is a feature for simulating surface water storage in low gradient areas usepa 2018 and can consider the drainage outlet height dikes and water detention effect associated with paddy fields in addition because all the hydrological components including infiltration are simulated in the perlnd module surface ftable seems to be an appropriate tool for paddy simulation however the drainage outlet height was maintained as a constant in the study conducted by seong et al 2018 rather than varying it seasonally therefore the drainage height was not practically managed of the two models aforementioned hspf seems to have more advantages than swat when applied as the watershed scale model for paddy field simulation hspf can simulate the hydrological processes of rice paddy fields only by its existing functions such as surface ftable and special actions not by modification of the source code special actions one of hspf s modules can vary parameters according to a specific time or condition usepa 2018 and be combined with surface ftable to apply the changes in drainage outlet height at each growing stage furthermore water movement in hspf is more flexible hspf can transfer the outflows from a subbasin to another subbasin as well as the downstream reach while swat can connect subbasins only to the downstream reach accordingly hspf has the potential to simulate more various types of paddy fields such as rice terraces in this study we aimed to address the limitations associated with hspf for paddy field simulation we developed a method to simulate the water detention effect and the seasonally varied outlet height of paddy fields by combining the surface ftable and special actions features of hspf subsequently these features were applied to the study area for evaluating the performance of this improved model 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological process simulation in hspf 2 1 1 perlnd implnd and rchres modules for watershed modeling in hspf a watershed is divided into several subbasins designated as either pervious land or impervious land each subbasin is connected to a reach or a reservoir and can also be connected directly to another subbasin the hydrological processes in pervious lands impervious lands and reaches or reservoirs are simulated by the perlnd pervious land implnd impervious land and rchres the free flowing reach or mixed reservoir module modules respectively in the perlnd module all hydrological components such as interception evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff are simulated while the implnd module and the rchres module do not have any functions to simulate infiltration fig 1 shows a comparison of the hydrological components among the three modules ftable and surface ftable are similar functions to represent surface water storage included in the rchres and perlnd modules respectively they have been applied to account for the characteristics of paddy fields in watershed modeling jung et al 2019 seong et al 2018 however infiltration is not simulated in the rchres module therefore ftable is inadequate for modeling the entire hydrological processes or satisfying the water balance equation for paddy fields however the surface ftable of the perlnd module can simulate the overall hydrological process in paddy fields and thus it was applied in this study 2 1 2 hydrological components of the perlnd module the perlnd module comprises seven layers from the surface to subsurface and each layer has inflow and outflow components as shown in fig 1 the surface zone comprises interception and surface storages and the subsurface zone comprises upper zone lower zone active groundwater and inactive groundwater storages in the surface zone the inflow components comprise precipitation and irrigation and the total inflow excluding the interception storage capacity is added to the surface storage subtracting the infiltration and evapotranspiration amount from this storage and applying a surface outflow calculation method to the remaining quantities yields the surface outflow and storage of the current time step surface ftable is one of the surface outflow calculation methods and a detailed description is given in section 2 2 in the subsurface zone the interflow storage is where the delayed interflow remains while upper zone storage is where the delayed lower zone inflow remains the lower zone storage is the main storage of soil moisture above the groundwater table the active groundwater storage is where groundwater flows in and out and no interaction occurs in the inactive groundwater storage where inflow water simply accumulates the interflow inflow the upper zone inflow and the lower zone inflow from the surface are the components moving from the surface to subsurface the last one is named infiltration in hspf but applied here as a portion of total infiltration these components are calculated based on philip s infiltration equation philip 1957 and other empirical equations crawford and donigian 1973 that take into account soil permeability land slopes soil surface conditions soil moisture content and their areal distribution usepa 2018 the percolation active groundwater inflow and inactive groundwater inflow are calculated depending on the current water amount of associated storages and the related parameters evapotranspiration occurs from all layers except for the interflow and inactive groundwater storage it is calculated as a portion of the current water amount for each storage within the total daily requirement input by a researcher accordingly the evapotranspiration rate can be controlled by the requirement values or the current water amount of each storage and the related parameters parameters associated with infiltration or evapotranspiration are given in table 4 2 1 3 perlnd module and paddy fields comparing the perlnd module and the physical structure of paddy fields it can be said that the interception storage represents rice canopies the surface storage represents ponding depth the interflow and upper zone storages represent soil layers near the roots almost saturated and muddy and the lower zone storage represents a relatively less saturated soil layer below the upper zone the infiltration in paddy fields was defined as the sum of three hydrological components in the perlnd module moving from the surface to subsurface the interflow inflow the upper zone inflow and the lower zone inflow from the surface which directly affect the change in ponding depth the hardpan layer an impervious layer created at a depth of 20 30 cm in paddy fields cannot be strictly associated with a specific layer of the perlnd module however it was assumed that the hardpan layer and the infiltration characteristics of it were represented by using the parameters related to the soil moisture of the upper and lower zone storages in addition as hspf can connect a subbasin to another subbasin the outflow components can be delivered directly to the adjacent paddy field representing water movement between paddy fields as in rice terraces 2 2 development of surface ftable 2 2 1 surface ftable surface ftable is a function that calculates surface outflow in the perlnd module of hspf for low gradient landscapes that experience water accumulation such as wetlands or paddy fields in this method surface outflow acts as a function of the current depth of the surface detention storage usepa 2018 as expressed in eq 1 1 suro sfrac surs where suro is the surface outflow mm h 1 surs is the surface detention storage mm and sfrac is the runoff fraction of surface storage surface ftable has a tabular form consisting of two columns namely depth and runoff fractions at different depths per time interval surface outflow is calculated using the current surface storage and the corresponding runoff fraction owing to the simple structure of the table the water storage or drainage outlet height of paddy fields can be conveniently modeled 2 2 2 development of surface ftable based on the physical shape of paddy fields paddy fields are characterized by a wide and shallow water storage structure with a drainage outlet at the edge of the dike fig 2 to incorporate the structure of a paddy field into surface ftable three factors should be considered dike height h drainage outlet height p and runoff fractions r x at different depths x per time interval the drainage outlet height controls surface outflow from paddy fields such that surface outflow only occurs when the ponding depth is higher than the drainage outlet height kim et al 2009 if the ponding depth ranges between the drainage outlet height and dike height values only a fraction of the overflow depth is converted to surface outflow because of the limited outlet width b thus an outlet parameter k h which is a function of the overflow depth h equal to x p p x h has been introduced to consider this blocking effect if the ponding depth is higher than the dike height the entire overflow is converted to surface outflow therefore runoff fraction r x can be expressed as shown in eq 2 2 r x 0 0 x p k h x p x p x h x h k h max h p x x h where h is the dike height m p is the drainage outlet height m x is the ponding depth m h is the overflow depth m equal to x p p x h h max is the overflow depth m when x h and is equal to h p k h is the outlet parameter and r x is the runoff fraction in this study hspf was simulated on an hourly basis consequently runoff fraction r x was also calculated hourly after 1 h from one point of time the ponding depth x reflecting infiltration and evapotranspiration over the past 1 h was newly applied to calculate the surface outflow therefore r x reflected only the outflow according to the physical shape of the paddy field not considering the effects of infiltration and evapotranspiration consequently the outlet parameter k h was determined using the broad crested weir formula expressed in eq 3 3 q h μ b h 1 5 4 μ 2 g 2 k 2 1 k 2 p h k p h h where μ is the coefficient of discharge h is the overflow depth m q h is the outflow through the drainage outlet m 3 s 1 g is the gravity acceleration m s 2 and k is a constant equal to 2 0 1 7 and 1 85 for free flow submerged flow and paddy fields respectively odhiambo and murty 1996 wang and hagan 1981 in this study it was assumed that a paddy field is filled with water up to the dike height and the water starts to flow out overflow depth h is temporally varied and decreases as water flows out through the drainage outlet therefore eq 3 can be rewritten as eq 5 5 q t a d h t dt μ b h t 1 5 where q t and h t are the temporal expressions of q h and h respectively and a is the area of a paddy field m 2 from eqs 4 and 5 eq 6 can be obtained which is only affected by the drainage outlet height p drainage outlet width b and area of a paddy field a with constant g and k if the values of b and a are the same for all paddy fields in the watershed h t is determined only by the seasonal value of the drainage outlet height p this approach can be applied not only to a single paddy simulation but also to a watershed scale simulation with multiple paddy fields because the ratio b a is kept constant 6 d h t dt 2 g 2 k 2 1 k 2 p h t k p h t h t b a h t 1 5 eq 6 was solved using the fourth order runge kutta technique press and teukolsky 1992 with t 1 s finally hourly values of the outlet parameter k h were obtained using eq 7 7 k h h t h t 3600 h t fig 3 shows the runoff fraction curve as a function of depth and the surface ftable function with a 70 mm drainage outlet height the values of trisection points on curves plotted between drainage height and dike height 0 25 m or between dike height and maximum height 0 5 m were incorporated into surface ftable 2 3 special actions module for seasonal variations in drainage outlet height the special actions module is used to change the values of the hspf variables at specified dates and times updated parameters or conditional actions can be applied using the special actions module usepa 2018 the conditional statements in this module are used to assign specific dates and values of surface ftable subsequently changes in surface ftable or the drainage outlet heights are applied to the model the drainage outlet height of paddy fields needs to be adjusted several times depending on the growth stage of rice korean farmers are known to control the height and length of the drainage outlet in their own ways kim et al 2009 however they usually implement conventional methods thereby ensuring that on average the seasonal values are similar fig 4 shows seasonal variations in the drainage outlet height in korea in this study seasonal surface ftable functions were developed based on the drainage outlet management in the study area the drainage outlet heights were measured at two paddy fields during the rice growing season from may to october in 2013 and 2014 using these values and time periods seasonal surface ftable functions were obtained and applied by the special actions module to account for the practical changes in the drainage outlet heights of paddy fields table 1 shows the period and drainage outlet heights of the study area table 2 and fig 5 show the applied surface ftable functions 2 4 study area hspf with the paddy simulation method based on surface ftable and special actions was applied to the study area for testing the model performance two paddy fields located in iksan si republic of korea were selected for the analysis these paddy fields plots a and b provided essential data for this study such as seasonal variations in drainage outlet heights ponding depth irrigation surface outflow and infiltration which have been monitored during the rice growing season from 2013 to 2014 each field was measured 3850 m 2 in area and the soil texture classes were loam and silt loam table 3 fig 6 shows an overview of the study area and monitoring systems installed in each field irrigation was measured by installing flowmeters in the inlet pipes drainage discharge was measured using weirs at the outlet ponding depth was measured via ultrasonic level meters and infiltration was measured by employing ring infiltrometers the irrigation data were input to the model and the ponding depth surface outflow and infiltration data were used to evaluate the model performance seasonal data of drainage outlet heights were used to develop surface ftable functions table 2 rainfall data were collected using a gauge near the study area and other meteorological data were obtained from the jeonju national weather station which is approximately 11 km southeast of the study area rainfall temperature wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and cloud cover data were collected and applied to the model evapotranspiration requirement was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation and the crop coefficients for paddy rice by yoo et al 2006 2 5 model evaluation 2 5 1 model calibration and validation the hydrological parameters of the perlnd module were calibrated and validated using daily ponding depth surface outflow and infiltration data of the study paddy fields the simulation period was from 2012 to 2014 including 2012 for stabilization of the model and the data from 2013 and 2014 were used for calibration and validation of the model respectively the main parameters with high sensitivity were calibrated using the trial and error method while others were set to the default values of hspf the parameters were determined by considering the hydrological characteristics of paddy fields in paddy fields interception storage and evapotranspiration increase as rice grows therefore monthly varied parameters were applied for better accuracy during the growing season the upper zone of the soil is almost saturated the lower zone is relatively less saturated and the groundwater storage is at higher levels therefore the parameters related to soil layers were set to reflect these characteristics table 4 shows the descriptions and calibrated values for all parameters 2 5 2 statistical criteria the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 index of agreement d willmott 1981 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the model performance r 2 is a goodness of fit measure for the linear regression between the observed and simulated data the r 2 value lies between 0 and 1 the greater the value the better the fit of the regression model and 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship between the observed and simulated values nse is an indicator of the predictive capability of a model and lies in the range of 1 the closer the nse is to 1 the better the simulated values reflect the tendency of the observed values the index of agreement d is always between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement the rmse indicates the extent to which the simulated values match the observed values if the simulated and observed values are exactly the same the rmse is zero table 5 shows the performance evaluation criteria for hydrological modeling moriasi et al 2015 although the criteria for r 2 and nse are appropriate for watershed scale and that for d has a monthly temporal scale these were applied as a reference to evaluate the model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation the key components used to evaluate the hydrological simulation performance of the paddy field model were ponding depth and surface outflow ponding depth represents the amount of water trapped on the surface and surface outflow is the main factor for calculating runoff in a watershed as shown in table 6 hspf with surface ftable and special actions achieved good or very good levels of model evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2015 in simulating ponding depth and surface outflow of paddy fields the model performed well in the simulation of ponding depth with r 2 0 72 good and d 0 92 very good for calibration and r 2 0 89 very good and d 0 97 very good for validation as for surface outflow the model showed good performance with r 2 0 76 good and d 0 93 very good for calibration and r 2 0 71 good and d 0 92 very good for validation fig 7 shows a comparison between the observed and simulated ponding depths in 2013 and 2014 the simulation results appeared to be similar to the observed data the ponding depths increased during irrigation or rainfall when there was no inflow they gradually decreased by equivalent amounts of daily infiltration and evapotranspiration in early july ponding depth decreased to zero due to mid term drainage except for plot a in 2014 most of the values did not exceed the height of the drainage outlet set for each growth stage however several values exceeded the outlet height in both observed and simulated data if irrigation or rainfall occurs continuously or heavily the outlet may fail to exclude drainage water and the ponding depth may exceed the outlet height since surface ftable was developed for elucidating the physical structure of paddy fields it seems to successfully reveal this natural effect fig 8 shows a comparison between the observed and simulated surface outflow values for 2013 and 2014 surface outflow mainly occurred due to heavy rainfall or irrigation which caused the ponding depth to become greater than the drainage outlet height the observed and simulated data showed similar results with regard to the days exhibiting surface outflow and the corresponding amount of surface outflow 3 2 simulation of hydrology in paddy fields 3 2 1 water balance analysis as shown in fig 1 the perlnd module consists of seven layers from the surface to subsurface table 7 shows the results of the water balance analysis for each layer in plot a during the rice cultivation period from june to october in the surface zone the inflow component simulated with or without surface ftable was the same however there was a large difference in the outflow components the simulation with surface ftable had a 333 6 mm higher evapotranspiration 227 9 due to the surface storage surface outflow was 247 9 mm lower 40 0 for the simulation with surface ftable because of the blocking effect of the paddy field moreover the infiltration was 87 8 mm lower 17 3 for the simulation with surface ftable because the upper zone tends to become saturated as the surface is inundated with water in the subsurface zone surface ftable exhibited a higher soil water content in all soil layers despite a lower infiltration from the surface in the interflow storage most of the inflow became outflow leaving a small amount of water in the upper zone the simulation with surface ftable showed a 171 5 mm lower inflow 44 7 but a much lower outflow 176 7 mm 45 9 than the simulation without surface ftable since the upper zone is covered by surface storage in paddy fields evapotranspiration from the upper zone is blocked in the simulation with surface ftable consequently the average change inflow outflow in the upper zone storage was greater in the simulation with surface ftable in the lower zone and active groundwater storage the simulation with surface ftable had a higher outflow 117 0 mm and 110 8 mm respectively than that without surface ftable while the average change was greater because of much more inflow 133 8 mm and 146 5 mm respectively 3 2 2 evapotranspiration the total amount of evapotranspiration simulated without surface ftable for plots a and b was 551 6 mm and 569 3 mm respectively while that simulated with surface ftable was slightly larger at 570 4 mm for plot a 3 41 and 587 1 mm for plot b 3 13 from june to october averaged from 2013 to 2014 the evapotranspiration from the interception storage was 146 6 mm the same in both cases which usually occurred after rainfall events during the rice cultivation period however the evapotranspiration from the surface storage was almost zero in the simulation without surface ftable while the simulation with surface ftable showed 333 6 mm which usually occurred when the ponding depth was greater than zero the evapotranspiration from the upper zone and lower zone storage was much greater in the simulation without surface ftable 285 2 mm and 29 7 mm since it usually occurred when the ponding depth was zero the daily evapotranspiration simulated with surface ftable was 3 78 mm day on average during the cultivation period the daily evapotranspiration in paddy fields has been suggested to be 4 0 mm day by ryu et al 2018 in korea or 3 5 mm day by ikawa et al 2017 in japan and the results of this study correspond to this 3 2 3 infiltration the infiltration was represented by the sum of three hydrological components of the perlnd module moving from the surface to subsurface interflow inflow upper zone inflow and lower zone inflow from the surface table 8 shows the observed and simulated infiltration with or without surface ftable during the rice cultivation period from june to september of 2013 and 2014 the total infiltration simulated without surface ftable was 34 9 plot a or 27 6 plot b greater than the observed value while that simulated using surface ftable was only greater by 8 7 plot a or 0 0 plot b the daily average of the observed infiltration was 2 9 mm day and the simulated value with surface ftable was 3 2 mm day plot a or 2 9 mm day plot b these values were similar to the average infiltration 3 0 mm day of silt loam paddy fields in korea cho and han 2002 han et al 1998 jung et al 2008 yoon et al 2006 fig 9 shows the daily infiltration simulated with or without surface ftable at the start of irrigation or right after the mid term drainage season the infiltration increased due to dry conditions similar in both cases however after sufficient irrigation the infiltration with surface ftable became smaller due to saturated conditions since the upper area of the soil layer is almost saturated in paddy fields due to surface water storage the flow of water moving down from the surface may decrease therefore when using surface ftable the infiltration was lower than that simulated without surface ftable fig 10 shows the average sum of each infiltration component with or without surface ftable among these components the interflow inflow and the lower zone inflow from the surface appeared to be greater with surface ftable because these components increase as the surface storage increases in hspf however at the same time the upper zone inflow decreases as upper zone storage increases overall as the contribution of the upper zone inflow to the total infiltration was the largest among the three components the total infiltration was lower with surface ftable 3 2 4 soil water the soil water content was analyzed for upper zone lower zone and active groundwater storages where a relatively large amount of water stays in the subsurface zone fig 10 shows the water contents of each soil storage in plot a simulated with or without surface ftable for all storage types the simulation with surface ftable appeared to indicate a higher water storage especially during the irrigation period in the upper zone storage fig 10 a soil water simulated with surface ftable increased to approximately 73 0 mm and remained saturated during the irrigation period contrarily soil water simulated without surface ftable fluctuated and on average remained at 60 8 of the soil water simulated using surface ftable a sharp descent of the graph in early july 2013 was due to mid term drainage in the lower zone storage fig 10 b the change in soil water storage was smoother as compared to that in the upper zone after the first irrigation cycle in june 2013 soil water simulated with surface ftable continuously increased and the gap between the two lines gradually widened until the irrigation was performed next year during the irrigation period the average soil water storage simulated without surface ftable in the lower zone was 73 3 of the soil water simulated with surface ftable in the active groundwater storage fig 10 c soil water simulated with surface ftable increased significantly during the irrigation period it was 2 5 times the soil water storage simulated without surface ftable on average and subsequently decreased fig 11 4 conclusions in this study we developed a paddy field simulation method using hspf features by focusing on the water detention effect and seasonal changes in the drainage outlet heights of paddy fields this approach used surface ftable and special actions with the aim of overcoming the problems associated with hspf for paddy field simulation to elucidate the water detention effect we proposed a method to build surface ftable by considering the physical structure of paddy fields furthermore the seasonally varied surface ftable was applied using special actions according to the drainage outlet height depending on the rice growth stage hspf with these special settings was applied to the study area for evaluating the model performance comparing the observed and simulated values of ponding depths surface outflow and infiltration the model showed good performance in reproducing the hydrological components of paddy fields comparing the results of the simulations performed with or without surface ftable the amount of evapotranspiration surface outflow infiltration or water storage in each layer significantly differed for the two cases although these results were derived from a field scale analysis these differences can have a considerable impact on watersheds especially in regions with paddy fields therefore it is necessary to use surface ftable for hspf modeling in watersheds containing paddy fields several other approaches have been used for hspf modeling of paddy fields however all these methods modified hspf the method developed in this study uses the in built functions of hspf without performing any external modifications thereby rendering it more convenient furthermore due to the flexibility of hspf water can be delivered directly between paddy fields which possibly enables to simulate various types of paddy fields

9389,the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is a widely used watershed scale model however it does not comprise any functions that can be used to simulate rice paddy fields thereby hindering its applicability in many asian countries to address this limitation a paddy field simulation method was developed by considering the water detention effect and seasonal changes in the outlet height of paddy fields this was achieved using the existing functions of hspf surface ftable a function of the relationship between surface water storage and outflow was applied to represent the physical structure and inundated condition of paddy fields surface ftable was temporally changed by special actions an hspf module to reflect the seasonal variation in drainage outlet height by employing these methods hspf was applied to paddy fields for evaluating the model performance on comparing the simulated and observed values of ponding depth and surface outflow the model showed good performance with a coefficient of determination that ranged from 0 71 to 0 89 and an index of agreement that ranged from 0 92 to 0 97 comparing the results of the simulation performed with or without surface ftable the simulation with surface ftable exhibited a reduced surface outflow 40 0 due to the blocking effect of the paddy field a decreased infiltration 17 3 due to the saturation of the upper soil zone and a higher level of soil water in all subsurface layers based on these differences in each component it is necessary to apply surface ftable when considering the hydrological processes of paddy fields for hspf modeling the simulation method developed in this study only uses the existing functions of hspf without performing any external modifications therefore it can be used conveniently to improve the applicability of hspf in rice growing regions keywords paddy field watershed modeling hydrological simulation program fortran surface ftable special actions outlet height 1 introduction in watershed modeling it is important to understand the characteristics of the target basin to facilitate appropriate utilization of models and yield accurate simulation results rice paddy fields are widely distributed in asian countries and exhibit hydrological processes that are different from those observed in other agricultural lands chin et al 2002 this aspect needs to be carefully considered in watershed modeling owing to the physical structure of rice paddy fields water tends to accumulate in these fields and water movement is delayed during the growing season kang et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of water detention on watershed modeling moreover runoff characteristics in rice paddy fields exhibit temporal variations because the drainage outlet height changes depending on the growth stage of rice crops fao 1989 therefore it is important to reproduce the characteristic features of rice paddy fields in watershed modeling of rice growing regions such as korea and other asian countries most hydrological models that incorporate the governing mechanisms of paddy fields are field scale models such as creams paddy chin et al 2002 seo et al 2002 gleams paddy chung et al 2003 paddymod jeon et al 2004 and apex paddy choi et al 2017 2021 field scale models are specialized for performing detailed analyses of the physical processes that occur in paddy fields or small agricultural watersheds jung et al 2011 thus the primary characteristics of paddy fields such as water detention effects and seasonal variations in the outlet height are considered in field scale models however if a watershed scale analysis considering the hydrological process in paddy fields is required field scale models do not have the capacity to perform the analysis alone and need to be combined with watershed scale models kim et al 2020 lee et al 2018 the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf johanson et al 1980 and the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 are representative watershed scale models that have mainly been used for agricultural lands however they lack the functions needed for watershed modeling in paddy fields because they were first developed for agricultural lands that only comprised ordinary fields agricultural lands are classified into various categories when using hspf however there is no category corresponding to paddy fields although paddy fields are specified in the land use classification when using swat there is no option to select the type of paddy field dry or inundation thus the water detention effects of paddy fields cannot be simulated to overcome the limitations of existing field scale or watershed scale models several studies have modified watershed scale models to ensure that the mechanisms of paddy fields are included based on the above mentioned watershed scale models swat and hspf modified models or simulation methods have been developed to consider the effects of paddy fields in watershed modeling modified swat models such as swat agriman kim et al 2005 swat paddy tsuchiya et al 2018 and several unnamed models kang et al 2006 sakaguchi et al 2014 are based on the pothole module of swat the pothole module was originally developed to simulate potholes or enclosed shallow depressions in some regions of america du et al 2005 as the module can simulate surface water storage researchers have attempted to modify its source code to account for the characteristics of paddy fields however the pothole module exhibits some drawbacks in simulating particular forms of paddy fields or calculating the amount of irrigation evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the paddy fields kang et al 2006 kim et al 2005 sakaguchi et al 2014 tsuchiya et al 2018 several modified swat models have been suggested to improve different aspects of the pothole module however these models are inadequate for completely resolving the above mentioned problems or fail to indicate the changes in drainage height over time hspf paddy jeon et al 2007 is a modified hspf model that comprises additional functions to simulate the hydrology and water quality of rice paddy fields this model was developed by modifying the source code of the surface water section proute in hspf however it was designed for water discharge over the dike thereby overlooking the drainage outlet height or its variation paddy rch jung et al 2019 is a simulation method based on a feature of hspf ftable in the free flowing reach or mixed reservoir rchres module which is used to represent the hydrological processes in paddy fields however the rchres module comprises no function to simulate infiltration therefore the infiltration process under the water detention effect is not fully considered in paddy rch additionally the drainage outlet height can only be changed up to five times due to the limitation of ftable seong et al 2018 also developed a paddy simulation method based on a feature of hspf surface ftable in the pervious land perlnd module surface ftable is a feature for simulating surface water storage in low gradient areas usepa 2018 and can consider the drainage outlet height dikes and water detention effect associated with paddy fields in addition because all the hydrological components including infiltration are simulated in the perlnd module surface ftable seems to be an appropriate tool for paddy simulation however the drainage outlet height was maintained as a constant in the study conducted by seong et al 2018 rather than varying it seasonally therefore the drainage height was not practically managed of the two models aforementioned hspf seems to have more advantages than swat when applied as the watershed scale model for paddy field simulation hspf can simulate the hydrological processes of rice paddy fields only by its existing functions such as surface ftable and special actions not by modification of the source code special actions one of hspf s modules can vary parameters according to a specific time or condition usepa 2018 and be combined with surface ftable to apply the changes in drainage outlet height at each growing stage furthermore water movement in hspf is more flexible hspf can transfer the outflows from a subbasin to another subbasin as well as the downstream reach while swat can connect subbasins only to the downstream reach accordingly hspf has the potential to simulate more various types of paddy fields such as rice terraces in this study we aimed to address the limitations associated with hspf for paddy field simulation we developed a method to simulate the water detention effect and the seasonally varied outlet height of paddy fields by combining the surface ftable and special actions features of hspf subsequently these features were applied to the study area for evaluating the performance of this improved model 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological process simulation in hspf 2 1 1 perlnd implnd and rchres modules for watershed modeling in hspf a watershed is divided into several subbasins designated as either pervious land or impervious land each subbasin is connected to a reach or a reservoir and can also be connected directly to another subbasin the hydrological processes in pervious lands impervious lands and reaches or reservoirs are simulated by the perlnd pervious land implnd impervious land and rchres the free flowing reach or mixed reservoir module modules respectively in the perlnd module all hydrological components such as interception evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff are simulated while the implnd module and the rchres module do not have any functions to simulate infiltration fig 1 shows a comparison of the hydrological components among the three modules ftable and surface ftable are similar functions to represent surface water storage included in the rchres and perlnd modules respectively they have been applied to account for the characteristics of paddy fields in watershed modeling jung et al 2019 seong et al 2018 however infiltration is not simulated in the rchres module therefore ftable is inadequate for modeling the entire hydrological processes or satisfying the water balance equation for paddy fields however the surface ftable of the perlnd module can simulate the overall hydrological process in paddy fields and thus it was applied in this study 2 1 2 hydrological components of the perlnd module the perlnd module comprises seven layers from the surface to subsurface and each layer has inflow and outflow components as shown in fig 1 the surface zone comprises interception and surface storages and the subsurface zone comprises upper zone lower zone active groundwater and inactive groundwater storages in the surface zone the inflow components comprise precipitation and irrigation and the total inflow excluding the interception storage capacity is added to the surface storage subtracting the infiltration and evapotranspiration amount from this storage and applying a surface outflow calculation method to the remaining quantities yields the surface outflow and storage of the current time step surface ftable is one of the surface outflow calculation methods and a detailed description is given in section 2 2 in the subsurface zone the interflow storage is where the delayed interflow remains while upper zone storage is where the delayed lower zone inflow remains the lower zone storage is the main storage of soil moisture above the groundwater table the active groundwater storage is where groundwater flows in and out and no interaction occurs in the inactive groundwater storage where inflow water simply accumulates the interflow inflow the upper zone inflow and the lower zone inflow from the surface are the components moving from the surface to subsurface the last one is named infiltration in hspf but applied here as a portion of total infiltration these components are calculated based on philip s infiltration equation philip 1957 and other empirical equations crawford and donigian 1973 that take into account soil permeability land slopes soil surface conditions soil moisture content and their areal distribution usepa 2018 the percolation active groundwater inflow and inactive groundwater inflow are calculated depending on the current water amount of associated storages and the related parameters evapotranspiration occurs from all layers except for the interflow and inactive groundwater storage it is calculated as a portion of the current water amount for each storage within the total daily requirement input by a researcher accordingly the evapotranspiration rate can be controlled by the requirement values or the current water amount of each storage and the related parameters parameters associated with infiltration or evapotranspiration are given in table 4 2 1 3 perlnd module and paddy fields comparing the perlnd module and the physical structure of paddy fields it can be said that the interception storage represents rice canopies the surface storage represents ponding depth the interflow and upper zone storages represent soil layers near the roots almost saturated and muddy and the lower zone storage represents a relatively less saturated soil layer below the upper zone the infiltration in paddy fields was defined as the sum of three hydrological components in the perlnd module moving from the surface to subsurface the interflow inflow the upper zone inflow and the lower zone inflow from the surface which directly affect the change in ponding depth the hardpan layer an impervious layer created at a depth of 20 30 cm in paddy fields cannot be strictly associated with a specific layer of the perlnd module however it was assumed that the hardpan layer and the infiltration characteristics of it were represented by using the parameters related to the soil moisture of the upper and lower zone storages in addition as hspf can connect a subbasin to another subbasin the outflow components can be delivered directly to the adjacent paddy field representing water movement between paddy fields as in rice terraces 2 2 development of surface ftable 2 2 1 surface ftable surface ftable is a function that calculates surface outflow in the perlnd module of hspf for low gradient landscapes that experience water accumulation such as wetlands or paddy fields in this method surface outflow acts as a function of the current depth of the surface detention storage usepa 2018 as expressed in eq 1 1 suro sfrac surs where suro is the surface outflow mm h 1 surs is the surface detention storage mm and sfrac is the runoff fraction of surface storage surface ftable has a tabular form consisting of two columns namely depth and runoff fractions at different depths per time interval surface outflow is calculated using the current surface storage and the corresponding runoff fraction owing to the simple structure of the table the water storage or drainage outlet height of paddy fields can be conveniently modeled 2 2 2 development of surface ftable based on the physical shape of paddy fields paddy fields are characterized by a wide and shallow water storage structure with a drainage outlet at the edge of the dike fig 2 to incorporate the structure of a paddy field into surface ftable three factors should be considered dike height h drainage outlet height p and runoff fractions r x at different depths x per time interval the drainage outlet height controls surface outflow from paddy fields such that surface outflow only occurs when the ponding depth is higher than the drainage outlet height kim et al 2009 if the ponding depth ranges between the drainage outlet height and dike height values only a fraction of the overflow depth is converted to surface outflow because of the limited outlet width b thus an outlet parameter k h which is a function of the overflow depth h equal to x p p x h has been introduced to consider this blocking effect if the ponding depth is higher than the dike height the entire overflow is converted to surface outflow therefore runoff fraction r x can be expressed as shown in eq 2 2 r x 0 0 x p k h x p x p x h x h k h max h p x x h where h is the dike height m p is the drainage outlet height m x is the ponding depth m h is the overflow depth m equal to x p p x h h max is the overflow depth m when x h and is equal to h p k h is the outlet parameter and r x is the runoff fraction in this study hspf was simulated on an hourly basis consequently runoff fraction r x was also calculated hourly after 1 h from one point of time the ponding depth x reflecting infiltration and evapotranspiration over the past 1 h was newly applied to calculate the surface outflow therefore r x reflected only the outflow according to the physical shape of the paddy field not considering the effects of infiltration and evapotranspiration consequently the outlet parameter k h was determined using the broad crested weir formula expressed in eq 3 3 q h μ b h 1 5 4 μ 2 g 2 k 2 1 k 2 p h k p h h where μ is the coefficient of discharge h is the overflow depth m q h is the outflow through the drainage outlet m 3 s 1 g is the gravity acceleration m s 2 and k is a constant equal to 2 0 1 7 and 1 85 for free flow submerged flow and paddy fields respectively odhiambo and murty 1996 wang and hagan 1981 in this study it was assumed that a paddy field is filled with water up to the dike height and the water starts to flow out overflow depth h is temporally varied and decreases as water flows out through the drainage outlet therefore eq 3 can be rewritten as eq 5 5 q t a d h t dt μ b h t 1 5 where q t and h t are the temporal expressions of q h and h respectively and a is the area of a paddy field m 2 from eqs 4 and 5 eq 6 can be obtained which is only affected by the drainage outlet height p drainage outlet width b and area of a paddy field a with constant g and k if the values of b and a are the same for all paddy fields in the watershed h t is determined only by the seasonal value of the drainage outlet height p this approach can be applied not only to a single paddy simulation but also to a watershed scale simulation with multiple paddy fields because the ratio b a is kept constant 6 d h t dt 2 g 2 k 2 1 k 2 p h t k p h t h t b a h t 1 5 eq 6 was solved using the fourth order runge kutta technique press and teukolsky 1992 with t 1 s finally hourly values of the outlet parameter k h were obtained using eq 7 7 k h h t h t 3600 h t fig 3 shows the runoff fraction curve as a function of depth and the surface ftable function with a 70 mm drainage outlet height the values of trisection points on curves plotted between drainage height and dike height 0 25 m or between dike height and maximum height 0 5 m were incorporated into surface ftable 2 3 special actions module for seasonal variations in drainage outlet height the special actions module is used to change the values of the hspf variables at specified dates and times updated parameters or conditional actions can be applied using the special actions module usepa 2018 the conditional statements in this module are used to assign specific dates and values of surface ftable subsequently changes in surface ftable or the drainage outlet heights are applied to the model the drainage outlet height of paddy fields needs to be adjusted several times depending on the growth stage of rice korean farmers are known to control the height and length of the drainage outlet in their own ways kim et al 2009 however they usually implement conventional methods thereby ensuring that on average the seasonal values are similar fig 4 shows seasonal variations in the drainage outlet height in korea in this study seasonal surface ftable functions were developed based on the drainage outlet management in the study area the drainage outlet heights were measured at two paddy fields during the rice growing season from may to october in 2013 and 2014 using these values and time periods seasonal surface ftable functions were obtained and applied by the special actions module to account for the practical changes in the drainage outlet heights of paddy fields table 1 shows the period and drainage outlet heights of the study area table 2 and fig 5 show the applied surface ftable functions 2 4 study area hspf with the paddy simulation method based on surface ftable and special actions was applied to the study area for testing the model performance two paddy fields located in iksan si republic of korea were selected for the analysis these paddy fields plots a and b provided essential data for this study such as seasonal variations in drainage outlet heights ponding depth irrigation surface outflow and infiltration which have been monitored during the rice growing season from 2013 to 2014 each field was measured 3850 m 2 in area and the soil texture classes were loam and silt loam table 3 fig 6 shows an overview of the study area and monitoring systems installed in each field irrigation was measured by installing flowmeters in the inlet pipes drainage discharge was measured using weirs at the outlet ponding depth was measured via ultrasonic level meters and infiltration was measured by employing ring infiltrometers the irrigation data were input to the model and the ponding depth surface outflow and infiltration data were used to evaluate the model performance seasonal data of drainage outlet heights were used to develop surface ftable functions table 2 rainfall data were collected using a gauge near the study area and other meteorological data were obtained from the jeonju national weather station which is approximately 11 km southeast of the study area rainfall temperature wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and cloud cover data were collected and applied to the model evapotranspiration requirement was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation and the crop coefficients for paddy rice by yoo et al 2006 2 5 model evaluation 2 5 1 model calibration and validation the hydrological parameters of the perlnd module were calibrated and validated using daily ponding depth surface outflow and infiltration data of the study paddy fields the simulation period was from 2012 to 2014 including 2012 for stabilization of the model and the data from 2013 and 2014 were used for calibration and validation of the model respectively the main parameters with high sensitivity were calibrated using the trial and error method while others were set to the default values of hspf the parameters were determined by considering the hydrological characteristics of paddy fields in paddy fields interception storage and evapotranspiration increase as rice grows therefore monthly varied parameters were applied for better accuracy during the growing season the upper zone of the soil is almost saturated the lower zone is relatively less saturated and the groundwater storage is at higher levels therefore the parameters related to soil layers were set to reflect these characteristics table 4 shows the descriptions and calibrated values for all parameters 2 5 2 statistical criteria the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 index of agreement d willmott 1981 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the model performance r 2 is a goodness of fit measure for the linear regression between the observed and simulated data the r 2 value lies between 0 and 1 the greater the value the better the fit of the regression model and 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship between the observed and simulated values nse is an indicator of the predictive capability of a model and lies in the range of 1 the closer the nse is to 1 the better the simulated values reflect the tendency of the observed values the index of agreement d is always between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement the rmse indicates the extent to which the simulated values match the observed values if the simulated and observed values are exactly the same the rmse is zero table 5 shows the performance evaluation criteria for hydrological modeling moriasi et al 2015 although the criteria for r 2 and nse are appropriate for watershed scale and that for d has a monthly temporal scale these were applied as a reference to evaluate the model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation the key components used to evaluate the hydrological simulation performance of the paddy field model were ponding depth and surface outflow ponding depth represents the amount of water trapped on the surface and surface outflow is the main factor for calculating runoff in a watershed as shown in table 6 hspf with surface ftable and special actions achieved good or very good levels of model evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2015 in simulating ponding depth and surface outflow of paddy fields the model performed well in the simulation of ponding depth with r 2 0 72 good and d 0 92 very good for calibration and r 2 0 89 very good and d 0 97 very good for validation as for surface outflow the model showed good performance with r 2 0 76 good and d 0 93 very good for calibration and r 2 0 71 good and d 0 92 very good for validation fig 7 shows a comparison between the observed and simulated ponding depths in 2013 and 2014 the simulation results appeared to be similar to the observed data the ponding depths increased during irrigation or rainfall when there was no inflow they gradually decreased by equivalent amounts of daily infiltration and evapotranspiration in early july ponding depth decreased to zero due to mid term drainage except for plot a in 2014 most of the values did not exceed the height of the drainage outlet set for each growth stage however several values exceeded the outlet height in both observed and simulated data if irrigation or rainfall occurs continuously or heavily the outlet may fail to exclude drainage water and the ponding depth may exceed the outlet height since surface ftable was developed for elucidating the physical structure of paddy fields it seems to successfully reveal this natural effect fig 8 shows a comparison between the observed and simulated surface outflow values for 2013 and 2014 surface outflow mainly occurred due to heavy rainfall or irrigation which caused the ponding depth to become greater than the drainage outlet height the observed and simulated data showed similar results with regard to the days exhibiting surface outflow and the corresponding amount of surface outflow 3 2 simulation of hydrology in paddy fields 3 2 1 water balance analysis as shown in fig 1 the perlnd module consists of seven layers from the surface to subsurface table 7 shows the results of the water balance analysis for each layer in plot a during the rice cultivation period from june to october in the surface zone the inflow component simulated with or without surface ftable was the same however there was a large difference in the outflow components the simulation with surface ftable had a 333 6 mm higher evapotranspiration 227 9 due to the surface storage surface outflow was 247 9 mm lower 40 0 for the simulation with surface ftable because of the blocking effect of the paddy field moreover the infiltration was 87 8 mm lower 17 3 for the simulation with surface ftable because the upper zone tends to become saturated as the surface is inundated with water in the subsurface zone surface ftable exhibited a higher soil water content in all soil layers despite a lower infiltration from the surface in the interflow storage most of the inflow became outflow leaving a small amount of water in the upper zone the simulation with surface ftable showed a 171 5 mm lower inflow 44 7 but a much lower outflow 176 7 mm 45 9 than the simulation without surface ftable since the upper zone is covered by surface storage in paddy fields evapotranspiration from the upper zone is blocked in the simulation with surface ftable consequently the average change inflow outflow in the upper zone storage was greater in the simulation with surface ftable in the lower zone and active groundwater storage the simulation with surface ftable had a higher outflow 117 0 mm and 110 8 mm respectively than that without surface ftable while the average change was greater because of much more inflow 133 8 mm and 146 5 mm respectively 3 2 2 evapotranspiration the total amount of evapotranspiration simulated without surface ftable for plots a and b was 551 6 mm and 569 3 mm respectively while that simulated with surface ftable was slightly larger at 570 4 mm for plot a 3 41 and 587 1 mm for plot b 3 13 from june to october averaged from 2013 to 2014 the evapotranspiration from the interception storage was 146 6 mm the same in both cases which usually occurred after rainfall events during the rice cultivation period however the evapotranspiration from the surface storage was almost zero in the simulation without surface ftable while the simulation with surface ftable showed 333 6 mm which usually occurred when the ponding depth was greater than zero the evapotranspiration from the upper zone and lower zone storage was much greater in the simulation without surface ftable 285 2 mm and 29 7 mm since it usually occurred when the ponding depth was zero the daily evapotranspiration simulated with surface ftable was 3 78 mm day on average during the cultivation period the daily evapotranspiration in paddy fields has been suggested to be 4 0 mm day by ryu et al 2018 in korea or 3 5 mm day by ikawa et al 2017 in japan and the results of this study correspond to this 3 2 3 infiltration the infiltration was represented by the sum of three hydrological components of the perlnd module moving from the surface to subsurface interflow inflow upper zone inflow and lower zone inflow from the surface table 8 shows the observed and simulated infiltration with or without surface ftable during the rice cultivation period from june to september of 2013 and 2014 the total infiltration simulated without surface ftable was 34 9 plot a or 27 6 plot b greater than the observed value while that simulated using surface ftable was only greater by 8 7 plot a or 0 0 plot b the daily average of the observed infiltration was 2 9 mm day and the simulated value with surface ftable was 3 2 mm day plot a or 2 9 mm day plot b these values were similar to the average infiltration 3 0 mm day of silt loam paddy fields in korea cho and han 2002 han et al 1998 jung et al 2008 yoon et al 2006 fig 9 shows the daily infiltration simulated with or without surface ftable at the start of irrigation or right after the mid term drainage season the infiltration increased due to dry conditions similar in both cases however after sufficient irrigation the infiltration with surface ftable became smaller due to saturated conditions since the upper area of the soil layer is almost saturated in paddy fields due to surface water storage the flow of water moving down from the surface may decrease therefore when using surface ftable the infiltration was lower than that simulated without surface ftable fig 10 shows the average sum of each infiltration component with or without surface ftable among these components the interflow inflow and the lower zone inflow from the surface appeared to be greater with surface ftable because these components increase as the surface storage increases in hspf however at the same time the upper zone inflow decreases as upper zone storage increases overall as the contribution of the upper zone inflow to the total infiltration was the largest among the three components the total infiltration was lower with surface ftable 3 2 4 soil water the soil water content was analyzed for upper zone lower zone and active groundwater storages where a relatively large amount of water stays in the subsurface zone fig 10 shows the water contents of each soil storage in plot a simulated with or without surface ftable for all storage types the simulation with surface ftable appeared to indicate a higher water storage especially during the irrigation period in the upper zone storage fig 10 a soil water simulated with surface ftable increased to approximately 73 0 mm and remained saturated during the irrigation period contrarily soil water simulated without surface ftable fluctuated and on average remained at 60 8 of the soil water simulated using surface ftable a sharp descent of the graph in early july 2013 was due to mid term drainage in the lower zone storage fig 10 b the change in soil water storage was smoother as compared to that in the upper zone after the first irrigation cycle in june 2013 soil water simulated with surface ftable continuously increased and the gap between the two lines gradually widened until the irrigation was performed next year during the irrigation period the average soil water storage simulated without surface ftable in the lower zone was 73 3 of the soil water simulated with surface ftable in the active groundwater storage fig 10 c soil water simulated with surface ftable increased significantly during the irrigation period it was 2 5 times the soil water storage simulated without surface ftable on average and subsequently decreased fig 11 4 conclusions in this study we developed a paddy field simulation method using hspf features by focusing on the water detention effect and seasonal changes in the drainage outlet heights of paddy fields this approach used surface ftable and special actions with the aim of overcoming the problems associated with hspf for paddy field simulation to elucidate the water detention effect we proposed a method to build surface ftable by considering the physical structure of paddy fields furthermore the seasonally varied surface ftable was applied using special actions according to the drainage outlet height depending on the rice growth stage hspf with these special settings was applied to the study area for evaluating the model performance comparing the observed and simulated values of ponding depths surface outflow and infiltration the model showed good performance in reproducing the hydrological components of paddy fields comparing the results of the simulations performed with or without surface ftable the amount of evapotranspiration surface outflow infiltration or water storage in each layer significantly differed for the two cases although these results were derived from a field scale analysis these differences can have a considerable impact on watersheds especially in regions with paddy fields therefore it is necessary to use surface ftable for hspf modeling in watersheds containing paddy fields several other approaches have been used for hspf modeling of paddy fields however all these methods modified hspf the method developed in this study uses the in built functions of hspf without performing any external modifications thereby rendering it more convenient furthermore due to the flexibility of hspf water can be delivered directly between paddy fields which possibly enables to simulate various types of paddy fields worldwide this study may improve the applicability of hspf in rice growing regions all over the world and provide a helpful tool for agricultural water management in watersheds declaration of
