plants it has received wide attention and development because of its unique and excellent characteristics for example the process is operable under normal temperature conditions and on a large scale it features high mass transfer rate low water content and high purity of particle crystals and easy solid liquid separation the application direction has gradually expanded to recover fluoride remove phosphate recover heavy metals and synthesize crystals this article reviews the application of fluidized bed crystallization in water softening fluoride recovery phosphate removal recover heavy metals and synthetic crystals in recent decades the structure of a fluidized bed reactor carrier material fluid flow rate feed concentration dosage and other important operating parameters were discussed this work lays a theoretical foundation for the development and application of high efficiency and industrialized fluidized bed crystallization granulation this review concludes with an overview of the challenges faced by this research focus and the authors personal views keywords fluidized bed crystallization calcium removal fluorine removal phosphorous removal heavy metals removal synthetic crystal 1 introduction with the rapid economic development the internal allocation mechanism of various elements of the natural environment has become out of balance and the environment is deteriorating water the source of life affects the quality of human life development of water treatment technology is of great significance to the protection of water resources fluidized bed crystallization fbc granulation is a new type of water treatment technology it is also an intensified crystallization process flocculation precipitation and other operation units are not needed in the process the water content of crystal particles is low and solid liquid separation is easy the equipment covers a small area and high processing efficiency the treated water can easily reach the standard and does not cause secondary pollution to the environment most importantly this technology can effectively recover calcium carbonate calcium fluoride phosphate and other substances from water it not only solves the problems of water treatment and discharge but also makes use of crystal particles collected from water as industrial raw materials because of their high purity and low water content it is a green industrial technology that turns waste into treasure fbc granulation technology has significant advantages and potential application prospects in the fields of chemical industry pharmaceuticals 1 2 environmental protection metallurgy 3 5 and water treatment 6 in 1971 fbc was first used in water softening treatment in the netherlands 7 8 on the one hand fbc granulation technology can reduce water hardness and the concentration of harmful elements which are important factors for public health on the other hand reducing the generation of scale during the heating process enhancing heat transfer and preventing additional energy consumption can also be achieved by this technology through long term practice and in depth research on softening technology fbc technology is beneficial for public health has significant environmental benefits and offers reduced social costs 9 in 1978 dhv de hewei company published a study on fbc dephosphorization and determined that the granular product is composed of calcium phosphate and carrier seeds moreover the product can be directly used in the phosphate rock industry 10 in recent years more phosphate crystals magnesium ammonium phosphate hydroxyapatite and magnesium phosphate have been developed and applied to actual industrial production compared with the impact of hardness and phosphorus on public health the presence of fluorine in water is more harmful scientific research has found that fluoride has a strong affinity for calcium and phosphate in the human body it can destroy the normal metabolism of calcium and phosphate in the human body inhibit the activity of certain enzymes and even could cause endemic fluorosis in 1990 lee et al designed and developed an fbc process system for treating fluoride containing wastewater this system can separate fluoride ions in the form of cryolite or calcium fluoride to treating fluoride containing wastewater however the operating specifications must be strictly controlled to avoid clogging the pipe with floccules 12 with the development of technology fbc gradually expanded to various industries that contain heavy metal wastewater such as chemical metal processing and production 11 the pure metal carbonate particles recovered from the fbc system can be reused in these industries resulting in considerable economic benefits besides recovering the above mentioned elements fbc can synthesize crystals as well a research group in japan studied the crystallization of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate in a fluidized bed reactor 13 14 fig 1 shows the selected focus of the fbc development process as the state pays increasing attention to environmental protection and water and soil resources relevant policies are also tightening fbc has attracted great attention in the field of environmental protection and water treatment at present several studies have reported fluidized bed reviews 8 15 16 bello et al and tisa et al mainly reviewed the fluidized bed combined with advanced oxidation discussed fluidized bed fenton fluidized bed photocatalysis and fluidized bed bioreactor and reported research applications for the treatment of refractory compounds 8 15 segura et al reviewed the treatment of refractory organics in fluidized bed fenton in detail 16 literature in the field of fbc granulation for recovering calcium fluoride phosphate and synthetic crystals is lacking therefore this article mainly focused on the research and application of fbc in the field of recovery of calcium 31 50 fluorine 51 75 phosphorus 76 109 heavy metals 110 117 and synthetic crystals 118 128 as well as introduces the development background basic concepts excellent characteristics and specific applications of fbc in different types of wastewater this work seeks to guide future scholars and encourage further exploration of the technology fig 2 provides an overview of fbc which aims to provide a reference and preliminary understanding for summarizing the relevant knowledge of fbc the scope of application includes but is not limited to the above mentioned scope more details will be introduced in the following chapters 2 related theories of fbc 2 1 liquid solid fluidization liquid solid fluidization is a method of contacting solid particles with liquid the liquid flows upward through the solid particle bed to make the solid particles have fluid characteristics this phenomenon is called liquid fluidization or particle fluidization 17 18 fluidized crystallization has the characteristics of variable crystal movement and complex fluidized behavior 19 the realization of the fluidization process is related to the minimum fluidization speed the fluidized bed reactor is partially filled with solid carrier particles the top of the reactor is open and the bottom of the reactor is provided with a distribution plate to support the solid particle bed water flow is evenly distributed on the entire section and the direction of the water flow is perpendicular to the distribution plate from bottom to top the superficial velocity is maintained at a very low speed without causing any movement of the small solid medium this situation is described as the flow through the filter and the pressure drop will increase in proportion to the superficial velocity the apparent velocity also produces friction resistance to small solid medium with the gradual increase in the superficial velocity the pressure drop increases but the particles do not move and the bed height remains unchanged at a certain speed the pressure drop on the bed and the bed balances the gravity or the weight of the solid particles any further increase in speed will cause the particles to move and sometimes exhibit slightly granular bed expansion but the particles remain in contact with further increase in speed particles are separated sufficiently to move within the bed and true fluidization begins once the bed is fluidized the pressure drop of the bed remains unchanged but the bed height continues to increase as the flow rate increases in this process the minimum fluidization velocity is the minimum superficial velocity when the bed starts to expand the equation for the minimum fluidization velocity can be obtained by setting the pressure drop on the bed equal to the weight of the bed per unit area or cross section and considering the buoyancy of the liquid to be replaced 20 the derivative formulas are expressed as eqs 1 4 1 p g g c 1 ε ρ p ρ l 2 u 1 k e 3 s 2 1 e 2 μ p l 3 u 1 k 1 36 e 3 s 2 1 e 2 d 2 ρ p ρ μ g 4 u mf 1 k 1 36 e mf 3 s 2 1 e mf 2 d 2 ρ p ρ μ g for larger sized solid media given that the flow phenomenon is not linear a more suitable equation is proposed by ergon defined as eq 5 21 5 p l 150 1 e mf 2 e mf 3 μ u mf d 2 1 75 1 e mf e mf 3 ρ u mf 2 d the combined equation is eq 6 6 ρ ρ p ρ g d 2 u 2 150 1 e mf e mf 3 u mf dρ u 1 75 e mf 3 u mf dρ u 2 if the upward velocity of the liquid is greater than the sedimentation velocity of the particles the particles continue to move upwards are carried out by the liquid and no longer stay in the bed w t is the critical speed at which the particles are removed also known as the maximum fluidization velocity which is the same as the minimum fluidization velocity and is related to the properties of solid particles and liquids the take out speed is the upper limit of the liquid velocity in the fluidized bed and it is also an important parameter for the research and design of the fluidized bed for spherical particles the calculation formula of the carry out speed is expressed as eq 7 7 w t d ρ 2 ρ d ρ g 18 μ where p is pressure drop g is gravitational acceleration m s2 g c is newton s law proportionality factor the value is 32 174 ε is porosity or volume fraction of voids in bed of solids ρ is density kg m3 ρ p is density of particle kg m3 l is total height of fluidized bed m u is superficial velocity e is porosity s is specific surface area μ is viscosity of fluid k is the kozeny equation generally 5 u mf is minimum fluidization velocity e mf is minimum porosity and w t is the take out speed 2 2 process principle fbc granulation first needs to fill a suitable carrier or seed crystal at the bottom of the fluidized bed reactor as shown in fig 3 waste water is introduced from the bottom of the fluidized bed at a certain flow rate so the carrier seed crystals are in a fluidized state adding the precipitation agent makes the solution reach a moderately oversaturated state and the generated insoluble substances precipitate on the carrier to form heterogeneous crystals as crystallization progresses the carrier particles continue to increase and become heavier and they gradually settle to the bottom of the reactor at this time the particle sediment is removed for a time period while new carrier seeds are added to the reactor and the reactor is continuously operated the core of this technology is to operate depending on supersaturation in solution supersaturation reflects the concentration gradient of crystal formation and precipitation in the supersaturated solution and it is the driving force for crystal formation the degree of supersaturation is related to the concentration of the solution and the solubility product of the precipitated crystals the solubility product is constant at a certain temperature and its size reflects the solubility of matter for the same number of ions the smaller the solubility product is the more insoluble it is supersaturation is expressed as eq 8 8 s r c c 0 c 0 where s r is supersaturation c is the actual concentration and c 0 is the saturation concentration the crystallization process of fbc is composed of the formation and growth of the crystal nucleus the formation of the crystal nucleus includes heterogeneous nucleation fig 4 a or homogeneous nucleation fig 4 b heterogeneous nucleation refers to the growth of particles by the precipitation of supersaturated materials on the surface of support particles such as silica which occurs at the phase interface homogeneous nucleation refers to that in supersaturated solution wherein the ions also known as crystallographic ions that make up the precipitates associate with each other due to electrostatic interaction and form crystal nucleus spontaneously and large particles as the reaction proceeds heterogeneous nucleation is more commonly used in fbc granulation technology homogeneous nucleation requires greater supersaturation and chemical driving force whereas heterogeneous nucleation requires less and the crystal can be easily opened the internal ions of the crystal form obtained by heterogeneous nucleation are regularly arranged and the structure is tight the particles have low moisture content the treated wastewater can be directly discharged or recycled making it highly environmentally friendly 22 23 2 3 typical fluidized bed reactor the structure and shape of the reactor should comprehensively consider the residence time of the water body the way of distributing the medicine the treatment capacity and other parameters the residence time is mainly determined by the crystallization rate which is determined by experiments the scale and structure of the reactor are generally designed by the residence time and the treatment capacity the residence time is expressed as eq 9 9 t v b q in where t is the residence time vb is the volume of the expanded bed m3 and qin is the inlet water flow h m3 the reactor used in fbc granulation technology is called a fluidized bed reactor also known as a pellet reactor to date the four typical fluidized bed reactors are as follows spiractor blackpool reactor amsterdam reactor and woerden reactor as shown in fig 5 these reactors were originally developed to soften water the basic structures of these four types of fluidized bed reactors are as follows 7 since 1938 four types of reactors have been researched and developed one after another 24 table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the four reactors and the amsterdam reactor is the most widely used in the end compared with other fluidized bed reactors the amsterdam reactor has a reasonable structure and good practical effects the dhv group headquartered in the netherlands has developed and registered an amsterdam reactor known as crystalactor dhv company has conducted extensive application research on it and successfully applied it to water softening and the removal and recovery of fluoride phosphate and heavy metals 10 25 26 many domestic and foreign studies on fbc precipitation are related to dhv and the amsterdam reactor has become the most widely used reactor in the field fig 6 a shows a schematic of a flat bottomed amsterdam reactor and fig 6 b shows examples of flat and cone bottomed reactors for example nielsen et al used a 5 5 m high and 14 5 cm inner diameter column reactor to remove heavy metals from flue gas desulfurization wastewater 27 lee et al utilized a column reactor with a height of 1 05 m and an inner diameter of 8 cm to remove phosphate from wastewater by crystalline struvite 28 mitani et al employed a column reactor with a height of 5 3 m and an inner diameter of 60 cm to recover phosphate from low phosphate containing wastewater 29 yan et al used a column reactor with a height of 0 6 m and inner diameter of 3 cm to treat copper containing wastewater 30 3 removal and recovery of calcium fbc granulation technology exhibits remarkable advantages over traditional precipitation technology when used to soften water for removing calcium by controlling specific process conditions and system settings in the fluidized bed the traditional precipitation method obtained sludge with a water content of 60 80 after fluidized bed treatment the final result was crystalline particles with a water content of only 1 5 no sludge was produced and the particles could be recycled saving a high amount of waste disposal costs these findings were fully in line with the sustainable development and circular economy policies advocated by the state fbc granulation technology to remove and recover calcium can be divided into two main categories one is groundwater and the other is wastewater groundwater body is relatively pure with less impurity ions the composition of wastewater is very complex which may contain heavy metal ions insoluble organic matter and so on these two systems are the two most commonly used typical systems groundwater is closely related to human beings well water and spring water are the most commonly used groundwater in our daily life groundwater can be developed and utilized as a source of domestic water industrial water and farmland irrigation water groundwater has the advantages of stable water supply and less pollution it is very necessary to remove the calcium hardness in its presence wastewater refers to the general term of water discharged during residents activities and runoff rainwater it includes domestic sewage industrial wastewater and other useless water 3 1 principle of calcium removal fbc granulation removes or recovers calcium given that calcium is in the form of calcium bicarbonate in water the solubility product of calcium bicarbonate in water ksp 1 07 is large the generation of scale is due to the presence of calcium bicarbonate by adding an alkaline agent hydroxide reacts with bicarbonate to form carbonate thereby forming calcium carbonate on the surface of the carrier the solubility product of calcium carbonate in water is very small ksp 5 0 10 9 11 so the formed precipitation particles are excluded the reaction process is shown in eqs 10 and 11 10 ca2 2hco3 ca oh 2 2caco3 2h2o 11 ca2 hco3 naoh caco3 na 2h2o 3 2 groundwater and its simulation water chen et al invented a kind of groundwater softening treatment device 31 the carrier used mineral particles with particle size of 0 1 0 5 mm the total hardness of the influent was 455 mg l the treatment capacity was 100 m3 h and the total hardness of the effluent was 136 5 mg l the discharged calcium carbonate particles could also be used as absorbent of the desulfurization system the removal of hardness by the fluidized bed particle reactor combined with membrane filtration has been studied in the literature the hardness removal efficiency of different carrier particles was also examined at ph 9 0 the carrier used 32 2 g of hot iron oxide particles with a diameter of 0 005 mm for maximum removal efficiency and the removal efficiency of hardness increased with the increase in ph and surface area 32 zhi used fluidized bed chemical crystallization technology to remove hardness from groundwater of water plant 33 the fluidized bed reactor was an internal and external jacketed reactor and the chemicals were naoh and hcl when the influent flow rate was 100 l h the line speed was 60 m h the ph was adjusted to 9 7 the dosages of naoh and hcl were 140 and 60 mg l respectively the total hardness of effluent was 120 mg l the concentration of calcium ion was 8 mg l and the removal rate of calcium ion exceeded 85 mahvi et al carried out a feasibility study on crystallization softened water in a pellet reactor and the effect of the reagent addition method on hardness removal was explored the addition of both ca oh 2 and naoh had no significant difference compared with ca oh 2 or naoh added separately the device is shown in fig 7 the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor was 1 9 cm the height was 175 cm and the volume was 500 ml the carrier was quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 0 3 mm and the filling height was 0 6 m raw water adopts simulated groundwater hardness when the influent hardness values were 150 mg l the removal rates were 76 the experimental operation showed that the fluidized bed reactor could be used for groundwater and other water treatment particles with low water content will be generated and discharged regularly 34 hu et al used a fluidized bed reactor to remove the hardness of groundwater 35 the treatment efficiency under different particle sizes of carrier ph and inlet water speed was studied through pilot tests the device is shown in fig 8 the diameter and height of the reactor were 18 and 400 cm respectively garnet with particle size of 0 1 0 25 mm inlet calcium concentration of 74 9 mg l ph 7 7 and turbidity of 0 11 ntu was used as carrier when the optimum dosage of softener was 110 mg l ph was 9 4 inlet water speed was 30 90 m h outlet water calcium ion concentration was 5 mg l and removal rate was 93 the diameter of round calcium carbonate particles reached 1 2 mm and the reaction crystallization rate was 1 96 10 9 m s homogeneous crystallization has been used to remove calcium from simulated groundwater the process parameters such as ph of effluent molar ratio of initial carbonate to calcium and rising flow rate were considered the diameter and height of the lower part of the fluidized bed reactor were 2 and 80 cm respectively the upper part was 4 cm in diameter and 15 cm in height fig 9 under the optimum process conditions sodium carbonate was the precipitator the calcium concentration in the inlet solution was 300 mg l the inlet flow was 6 l h the ph was adjusted to 11 the reflux flow was 1 2 l h the calcium removal rate was 92 the reaction ran for 300 h and the particle size of calcium carbonate reached 1 2 mm sem images showed that the calcium carbonate particles were formed by the aggregation of fine crystals about 5 μm 36 chen et al combined the fluidized bed with the induced crystallization technology to treat simulated wastewater 37 the carrier in the reactor adopted quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm and the filling height was 0 5 m the calcium concentration in wastewater was 450 mg l the inflow was 60 l h ph was 9 5 and the calcium concentration of effluent was 60 mg l thus the removal rate reached 86 6 the surface material of the discharged particles was mainly calcium carbonate and the moisture content was 15 994 given the low water content dehydration treatment was no longer needed which could save the cost of water treatment veen et al studied a device for softening groundwater which can reduce the hardness of calcium carbonate from 250 mg l to 100 mg l 8 the temperature was 0 c 45 c the ph was 8 8 and the residence time of the seed material was 100 days on average the caco3 particles that did not require any treatment were softened by adding caustic soda crystals when calcium carbonate crystallized on the seed particles very low water content 0 2 0 5 was achieved after several hours of drainage the softener was selected in the ratio of carbonate to total hardness in the raw water lime was found to be an efficient softener at a high hardness ratio whereas soda ash was preferred at a low hardness ratio hadi et al studied hardness removal by crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor with sand medium 38 when the influent calcium concentration was 240 mg l and the influent flow rate was 0 75 l h the calcium removal rate was 96 36 hu et al studied the application of chemical crystallization circulating particle fluidized bed in the softening of simulated groundwater in thermal power plants 39 the diameter of the circulating particle fluidized bed was 240 cm the calcium ion concentration of circulating water was 70 mg l ph was 7 7 and calcium ion concentration was 16 mg l the calcium carbonate particles obtained could be used as desulfurizer in the power plant desulfurization system because the cao content was 51 10 sun et al studied crystallization softening and crystal growth kinetics of high hardness groundwater in a fluidized bed 40 the parameters such as dosage of agent particle size of carrier height of filler inflow flow rate and supersaturation of calcium carbonate were discussed and studied the relationship between the growth rate of particle size and other parameters was determined the smaller the particle size of carrier the better the effect of heterogeneous nucleation and the faster the crystallization rate however the smaller the particle size the faster the flow rate of the fluidized bed could cause particle loss the optimized reaction conditions could control the ph of effluent below 8 5 and no scale was produced after boiling a new type of circulating granular fluidized bed reactor was studied and the softening effect of the reactor applied to groundwater was discussed as shown in fig 10 garnet crystal with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm was used as carrier naoh was used as softener and hcl was used as ph regulator the total hardness of raw water was 286 mg l and the concentration of calcium ion was 75 mg l at the naoh dosage of 180 mg l hcl dosage of 50 mg l and ph 8 the calcium ion removal rate was 90 outlet ph was 9 5 turbidity was 1 0 ntu and the particle size of the discharged particles could reach 3 5 mm the operating cost of the system was 0 074 m3 which demonstrated high hardness removal efficiency good economic benefits and environmentally friendly and social benefits 41 tiangco et al removed and recovered calcium from simulated groundwater by fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization 42 as shown in fig 11 when the molar ratio of co3 2 ca2 was 1 0 the outlet ph was 10 2 the removal rate of calcium was 99 8 the crystallization rate was 98 9 and the particle size of the discharged particles was 0 5 mm however the addition of f no3 and so4 2 could inhibit the particle size of the discharged particles fine crystals with particle sizes of 0 149 0 297 and 0 297 mm were discharged from the three systems 3 3 wastewater and its simulated water the treatment of wastewater from the waste paper industry by anaerobic systems still cannot effectively reduce or remove the high concentration of calcium leading to extensive calcium carbonate precipitation blockage 43 this problem can be avoided by removing calcium from the influent in a fluidized bed reactor given that the addition of alkaline chemicals is costly the possibility of reusing the alkalinity produced by circulating water was studied in this paper the concentration of calcium in the influent was 1800 mg l the recycling of anaerobic effluent provides sufficient bicarbonate alkalinity for crystallization so no reagent was added at ph 7 1 the white precipitate was recovered and almost all calcium was removed in the fluidized bed reactor chen et al used fluidized bed induced crystallization to remove calcium hardness from simulated wastewater 44 caco3 precipitation was induced on the surface of quartz sand the device is shown in fig 12 the different particle size carriers bed filling height ph and flow rate were discussed and the optimal conditions were finally determined quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm was used in the reactor the filling height was 0 5 m the ph was adjusted to 9 5 the influent flow rate was 60 l h the reflux flow rate was 30 l h the temperature was 25 c the removal rate of calcium was the highest the removal rate was 86 6 and the effluent calcium concentration was 60 mg l noshadi et al used fbc to study the removal effect of calcium in reverse osmosis system wastewater 45 they demonstrated that fbc with 100 mg l naoh can remove calcium well and compound consumption is low at ph 8 the removal rate of calcium was 90 hiroyuki et al attempted to treat calcium in landfill leachate by fbc the changes in the calcium ion concentration turbidity and ph were measured and the flow state and simple characteristic model of the fluidized bed were calculated 46 the carrier was blast furnace slag the calcium ion removal rate reached 60 effluent ph was 7 8 and turbidity was less than 30 so there was no need to adjust follow up treatment norman studied the removal of calcium carbonate from reverse osmosis filter wastewater in a fluidized bed reactor 47 their results showed the reduction of conductivity by crystallization of calcium carbonate in sandy media using caustic soda as a chemical with high ph could reduce the calcium concentration and the effluent turbidity was very low 1 0 ntu the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor was 5 cm the height was 270 cm the carrier was silica sand with particle size of 0 425 0 85 mm and the filling height was 0 4 m at ph 9 5 the highest removal rate was 56 and the turbidity of the effluent was 2 0 ntu tan used a fluidized bed reactor to remove calcium from semiconductor wastewater 20 this experiment provides favorable guidance for the use of fbc technology in the direction of pharmaceuticals the removal rate of calcium ion was 80 precipitation agents ca oh 2 naoh and na2co3 can be used to create supersaturation conditions and make calcium crystallize into calcium carbonate if the alkalinity is high ca oh 2 or naoh can be used but they are not as good as ca oh 2 na2co3 can remove all calcium from semiconductor wastewater but the alkalinity will be very high liu developed a stirred crystallization separation integrated reactor for the research and treatment of high salinity wastewater 48 this experiment provides a favorable reference for the treatment of high concentration water bodies with fbc technology the carrier was in fluidization state by water inflow or return water or granular calcium carbonate sediment was produced by stirring which could be easily treated after slag removal a reagent was not added saving the dosage of reagent the final calcium removal rate of the whole system was 98 and the particle size was 1 mm liang applied fluidized bed technology to remove high salt steel wastewater in the iron and steel industry 49 their experimental results showed that the two phase self crystallizing fluidized bed was suitable and the hardness removal effect of the reactor was good the bed demonstrated high crystal purity and minimal harmful elements indicating that it could be used in the sintering process of iron and steel 3 4 summary fbc granulation has been greatly developed and applied to soften water and remove and recover calcium 50 since the late 1970s softening technology has been successfully applied in the netherlands before a comprehensive breakthrough graveland et al began a long term discussion and in depth study of softening technology in 1983 7 by 2006 almost all drinking water in the netherlands was adjusted to the best water quality the initial calcium concentration of drinking water can be reduced from 76 8 and 100 mg l to 43 1 and 53 mg l respectively the use of softening technology has resulted in high economic benefits the technology is clearly beneficial to public health has significant environmental benefits and reduces social costs tables 2 and 3 show that the two systems have differences in process parameters such as fluidized bed reactor structure carrier particles inlet calcium ion concentration and calcium removal rate according to the literature we checked in the groundwater section the maximum diameter of the reactor is 2 4 m it can be seen from the literature that a large number of practical applications have been used to treat this kind of water body in the wastewater section the maximum diameter of the reactor is 5 cm the carrier particles used in groundwater treatment are relatively pure such as silica calcium carbonate crystal etc however blast furnace slag containing more impurities can be used as the carrier of wastewater treatment in terms of incoming calcium concentration most of the incoming calcium concentration of groundwater is low the maximum is 450 mg l and the calcium hardness removal rate is more than 80 while the incoming calcium concentration of wastewater can reach 1353 mg l and the calcium hardness removal rate is more than 56 the research progress is still in the laboratory or pilot test stage and there is a gap from the practical application therefore the treatment of calcium in wastewater by this process still needs further research 4 removal and recovery of fluoride the waste water discharged from fluoride ore mining metal smelting electronics electroplating chemical industry and other industries usually contains different concentrations of fluoride thus the problem of fluoride pollution is becoming increasingly serious most of these fluorides exist in the form of fluoride ions if fluoride containing wastewater is discharged directly without treatment it will seriously pollute the living environment of human beings 51 traditional fluoride containing wastewater treatment methods have been used to remove fluoride in wastewater in the form of sludge or waste but such techniques cannot achieve the purpose of saving resources and recycling 52 fbc granulation is an efficient induced crystallization process which is dedicated to removing fluoride from wastewater and recycling it on the basis of the treatment of fluoride wastewater fbc granulation can be divided into low concentration and high concentration on the basis of the needs of fluorine wastewater treatment the process parameters are designed according to the concentration range so high concentration and low concentration are divided low concentration fluoride containing wastewater can only remove fluoride ions with crystalline calcium fluoride while high concentration fluoride containing wastewater can remove fluoride ions with both crystalline calcium fluoride and crystalline cryolite there are also some differences between the two in reagent consumption treatment standard and effluent results this is described in detail below 4 1 principle of fluoride removal using fbc granulation to remove or recover fluoride can form the corresponding insoluble calcium fluoride by adding calcium salt ksp 3 46 10 11 53 the particles are formed by spontaneous crystallization or precipitation on the carrier and grow into large diameter particles which are finally discharged from the bottom of the reactor and then recycled 54 the reaction process is shown in eq 12 12 ca2 2f caf2 to reduce economic cost and remove additional fluoride some researchers use crystal precipitation in the form of cryolite which can easily form crystal in high concentration fluoride wastewater due to its high solubility the soluble aluminum reagent and sodium reagent are added into the fluidized bed reactor to form cryolite coating on the carrier and lead to particle precipitation for recycling the reaction process is shown in eq 13 13 3na al3 6f na3alf6 4 2 low concentration fluoride containing wastewater jansen et al used a fluidized bed reactor to remove fluoride from wastewater 55 elemental fluoride in wastewater was removed by mixing the wastewater with the test agent in the form of micro soluble salt the precipitation agent was calcium chloride solution the concentration of fluoride ion in wastewater was 100 mg l and the ph was 4 5 the fluoride concentration of wastewater treated by the system was 5 10 mg l the calcium fluoride particles with size of 1 3 mm could be obtained by this process and the moisture content was very low 5 chen removed fluoride from wastewater by carrier induced precipitation crystallization 24 quartz sand induces caf2 precipitation in reaction kinetics and thermodynamics when quartz sand is fluidizing the induced precipitates adhere to the surface of quartz sand increasing the concentration of suspended quartz sand can increase the speed of removing fluoride quartz sand induced precipitation and crystallization can be used for the defluoridation of industrial wastewater this experiment provides favorable guidance for research on silica sand carrier in the treatment of fluorine wastewater by fbc technology aldaco et al used granular calcite as carrier and a fluidized bed reactor to recover calcium fluoride from fluoride containing wastewater 56 57 under certain technological conditions the particle size of 0 463 mm was obtained and the mass fraction of calcium fluoride reached 87 the crystal particle was used as a seed to carry out the experiment again after running for 110 h the particle size of 0 769 mm was obtained and the mass fraction of calcium fluoride was 97 7 it could be used repeatedly as raw material for hydrofluoric acid production which reduced waste generation and material recovery watanabe et al studied the methods and equipment for treating fluoride containing wastewater 58 the carrier was composed of hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate the volume of 1 m3 with an average particle size of 0 8 mm was filled in the reactor the fluoride concentration of 12 mg l was reduced to 6 9 mg l to determine the effect of fbc on fluoride containing wastewater with different concentrations jiang et al studied the effects of supersaturation on the fluoride removal rate and calcium fluoride crystallization rate 59 when the concentration was 100 mg l and supersaturation was 7 0 the concentration of effluent was lower than 10 mg l and the precipitation condition was located in the calcium fluoride metastable zone which was conducive to the growth of crystal in the process of operation control of fluidized bed defluoridation the relationship between supersaturation and calcium fluoride metastable zone should be considered to reduce the supersaturation of solution properly and improve the defluoridation efficiency and calcium fluoride recovery 4 3 high concentration fluoride containing wastewater lee et al studied the crystallization process for fluoride removal from wastewater 60 61 the precipitant used in fluidized bed was soluble sodium salt solution such as sodium chloride sodium hydroxide sodium sulfate and sodium nitrate and soluble aluminum salt solution such as aluminum chloride aluminum sulfate and aluminum nitrate the fluoride concentration of wastewater was 5500 mg l the fluoride concentration discharged from the treated water after the full reaction was 73 mg l in the process of the invention cryolite na3alf6 with diameter of 1 2 mm formed on the carrier in the reactor and its water content was less than 10 lee et al used two fluidized bed crystallizers in series to treat wastewater containing 5200 mg l fluoride 60 as shown in fig 13 the wastewater flowed into the first reactor at a flow rate of 0 624 m3 h calcium reagent with ca2 concentration of 1630 mg l and aluminum reagent with al3 concentration of 1120 mg l were added the range of molar ratio was al3 ca2 f 0 8 1 2 0 8 1 2 6 0 and na f 1 6 the fluoride concentration in the effluent was 291 mg l the effluent was added to the sedimentation tank and the ph adjusted to 7 0 with sodium hydroxide the adjusted water was mixed with another wastewater with low fluoride concentration in the buffer pool after adding calcium reagent the range of molar ratio was ca2 f 0 5 2 1 the large diameter caf2 grains formed on the carrier were discharged and the fluoride concentration in the effluent was 12 mg l aldaco et al systematically studied the removal of recovered fluoride by induced crystallization in fluidized beds 62 63 their results showed that supersaturation plays an important role in the nucleation mechanism leading to the formation of fine powder and the reduction of recovery efficiency therefore controlling the initial fluoride concentration below 150 mg l can help improve the fluoride removal rate to reduce fluoride concentration and recover wastewater comparative experiments were carried out the experimental setup is shown in fig 14 the results showed that suspended solids were retained in the sand filter bed which improved the process efficiency calcium fluoride precipitation on quartz sand in the fluidized bed reactor increased finally under high hydraulic load calcium fluoride particles with particle size of 1 2 mm mass fraction higher than 97 were obtained and the water content was less than 5 the growth kinetics of caf2 in fluidized bed crystallizer with constant ph has been studied 64 the growth rate of caf2 crystal measured in fluidized bed increases with the increase in supersaturation ph surface velocity and seed size the growth rate of different grain sizes varies and the growth rate increases with the increase in grain size li et al studied high concentration wastewater treatment by fbc 65 the experimental setup is shown in fig 15 which involved fluoride containing wastewater with a concentration of 1000 mg l the fluoride concentration of effluent decreased to below 10 mg l the turbidity of effluent was below 60 ntu and the ph of effluent was 6 7 the moisture content of the calcium fluoride sludge produced was 24 7 and the calcium fluoride particles after drying were homogeneous with an average particle size of 0 378 mm and a purity of 98 the crystal was suitable for preservation under ph 5 and ph 10 given that the concentration of effluent in the pilot plant did not reach the discharge standard jiang et al optimized the process to ensure that the final effluent could meet the discharge standard the effluent was treated by flocculation 54 calcium chloride and polyaluminum chloride were selected as flocculants ca2 f 1 1 ph was 7 9 the concentration of fluoride ion in the effluent was stably lower than 10 mg l and the turbidity was lower than 10 ntu these conditions reached the first class national integrated wastewater discharge standard the feasibility of recovering calcium fluoride from high fluoride wastewater has never stopped jiang et al discussed the feasibility of recovering calcium fluoride from high fluoride wastewater and studied the effects of supersaturation seed size and other factors on the growth rate of calcium fluoride 66 under low supersaturation 6 01 25 91 calcium fluoride particles can grow on the surface of seeds by heterogeneous nucleation moreover the growth rate of large particle seeds is higher than that of small particle seeds and the growth of calcium fluoride particles is favorable at ph 7 9 a pilot study on fluoride industrial wastewater was carried out 67 sand like calcium fluoride was recovered by fbc the influent fluoride concentration was 900 1700 mg l when the molar ratio of ca2 f was 0 6 1 0 at ph 8 11 the fluoride concentration in the effluent was 30 100 mg l when the operation time was 30 h the particle size of calcium fluoride was 0 0867 mm when the operation time was 50 h the particle size of calcium fluoride was 0 1531 mm the moisture content of the recovered product was 27 in addition the composition of caf2 particles was caf2 71 65 and caco3 4 43 broeck et al used a crystalactor to treat fluoride containing wastewater from the semiconductor industry 68 the performance of the reactor depends largely on the initial concentration of calcium and fluoride at the bottom of the reactor bu et al also used a crystalactor to treat high concentration fluoride wastewater 52 the reaction mechanism and characteristics of the process were described and the influencing factors existing problems and solutions in the operation process were analyzed wang et al used two different forms of fluidized bed reactor to induce crystallization to treat chemical wastewater containing fluoride 69 the bubbling fluidized bed was used to treat wastewater containing fluoride with the concentration of 1000 mg l the fluoride concentration in the effluent was less than 10 mg l which reached the allowable discharge standard the treatment effect was better than that of a conventional fluidized bed liang et al used a two stage two phase fluidized bed to treat high fluoride wastewater 70 the discharged particles at the bottom of the first stage reactor were 0 06 0 2 mm calcium fluoride particles at the same time the secondary reactor could recover calcium ions in the effluent of the primary reactor as calcium carbonate crystal particles with the particle size of 1 3 mm jiang et al studied the effect of aluminum on the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater and determined the effect of aluminum on the equilibrium concentration of calcium fluoride suspension 71 the effect of aluminum on the operation of the fluidized bed reactor was studied and the feasibility of recovering calcium fluoride was discussed the calcium fluoride particles could be used as raw materials jiang et al also studied the efficiency and stability of the fluidized bed reactor for the treatment of high concentration fluoride containing wastewater 72 the difference between the former and the latter is that calcium fluoride particles were used as crystal species the fluidized bed reactor was operated efficiently and stably and the fluoride concentration of effluent liquid was lower than 10 mg l some measures were proposed to reduce the generation or overflow of fine particles zeng et al used fbc to remove fluoride from rare earth smelting wastewater and recover calcium fluoride 73 the effects of different carrier materials carrier particle size and carrier dosage on fluoride removal and calcium fluoride recovery in fluidized bed were studied the removal of fluoride from rare earth industrial wastewater was feasible and economical by using silica sand as carrier in the fluidized bed reactor the particle size of the recovered calcium fluoride was about 1 5 mm the recovery cost of calcium fluoride from wastewater was 1 21 m3 4 4 summary to promote the development of sustainable technology the recovery and reuse of fluoride in industrial wastewater is an important goal 74 in fluoride salt glass semiconductor and other industries as well as electroplating and metal processing industries if the fluoride containing wastewater discharged in the production process is not treated it can cause great harm to water soil animals plants and humans 52 75 the literature shows that the fluidized bed reactor is effective for the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater since 1990 fbc granulation has been applied to the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater tables 4 and 5 indicate the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor ranges from 2 cm to 1 75 m whereas its height is from 50 cm to 9 3 m the concentration of fluoride wastewater is as low as 10 12 mg l and as high as 10 000 mg l the effluent effect is good and the product particles can be recycled the biggest difference between low concentration and high concentration is that the reagent consumption is different treating high concentration fluoride containing wastewater requires more reagent consumption and higher cost moreover the treatment standards of high concentration fluoride wastewater are different from those of low concentration wastewater most of the fluoride ion concentration in high concentration effluent stays above 10 mg l and will not continue to decrease while the fluoride ion in low concentration effluent can be reduced to 4 33 mg l after the treatment of high concentration fluoride wastewater it is necessary to reduce the fluorine ion concentration in the effluent for a second time the fluidized bed reactor needs a higher level of process control to ensure the smooth completion of the crystallization process compared with the traditional process this technology has a higher one time investment 52 however fbc granulation has the advantages of fast reaction small area and no sludge in the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater therefore the technology has good development and application prospects 5 removal and recovery of phosphate the treatment of phosphate containing wastewater has always been a problem due to the cost of treating phosphate rich sludge the strict regulation of limiting the discharge of phosphate to the aquatic environment and the shortage of resources caused by the limited reserves of phosphate rock phosphate is a non renewable and irreplaceable resource which is the main limiting factor of water eutrophication therefore phosphate must be removed from wastewater for recycling 76 79 fbc granulation is one of the most effective processes for the removal or recovery of phosphate from wastewater 5 1 principle of phosphate removal insoluble phosphate is produced by adding the corresponding precipitant in phosphate containing wastewater to remove phosphate the various forms of phosphate recovery are magnesium ammonium phosphate map hydroxyapatite hap calcium phosphate cp and magnesium phosphate mp the main recovery forms are map crystallization and hap crystallization map crystallization involves adding magnesium salt and ammonium salt in proportion to wastewater po4 3 nh4 and mg2 in water will react to form insoluble map under alkaline conditions commonly known as struvite the chemical formula is mgnh4po4 6h2o the solubility product constant of map is ksp 2 5 10 13 t 25 c 80 and phosphate in wastewater is removed by solid liquid separation 81 the reaction process is shown in eqs 14 16 14 mg2 nh4 po4 3 6h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o 15 mg2 nh4 hpo4 2 6h2o h mgnh4po4 6h2o 16 mg2 nh4 hpo4 2 6h2o oh h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o hap crystallization is formed by adding appropriate calcium salt to wastewater when po4 3 ca2 and oh in water reach saturation state calcium phosphate precipitate is formed and finally converted into hap the chemical formula is ca10 po4 6 oh 2 the solubility product constant of hap is ksp 1 26 10 56 t 25 c 82 the reaction process is shown in eq 17 17 5ca2 oh 3po4 3 ca5 po4 3oh 5 2 map guanguanite is a natural crystal of magnesium ammonium and phosphate battistoni et al studied the fixation of phosphate in the sludge treatment solution of wastewater treatment plant through the crystallization of bird dung 83 the feasibility and optimum operation conditions of the process were determined the removal rate of phosphate could reach 89 6 without adding any reagent in a wastewater treatment plant a large amount of sludge is produced by phosphate removal technology and the increase in phosphate load can lead to the deterioration of effluent quality given that these processes cannot remove phosphate to overcome technical difficulties ueno et al developed a map crystallizer to produce guanguanite by using the dehydrated filtrate digested by anaerobic sludge 84 using this reactor and technology struvite particles with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm were obtained within 10 days münch et al used a three phase fluidized bed reactor to remove phosphate from the side stream of the anaerobic digester 85 the device is shown in fig 16 the inner diameter of the reactor was 30 cm in the lower part and 60 cm in the upper part the effluent phosphate concentration was 4 mg l and the removal rate was 94 the struvite content in the crystal product was more than 90 map products have low concentrations of cadmium lead and mercury they can be used as slow release fertilizers mitani et al developed a liquid solid two phase fluidized bed for low phosphate wastewater 29 the influent condition of struvite precipitation prior to calcium phosphate precipitation was determined as ca2 mg2 0 25 the device scheme is shown in fig 17 the diameter of the lower part of the reactor was 60 cm the diameter of the upper part was 85 cm and the total height was 5 3 m the concentrated wastewater with po4 p concentration of 41 8 mg l was treated the average diameter of struvite was 2 mm the substances in the influent have a certain influence on the recovery rate of struvite however if this effect is controlled then the reactor can recover struvite particles shimamura et al used a fluidized bed reactor for phosphate removal the treatment performance influent phosphate loading map microcrystallization and phosphate recovery were

applications 6 1 removal of heavy metals nickel copper zinc and arsenic are the main trace elements of high concern in heavy metal wastewater compared with the traditional chemical precipitation method fbc granulation technology has significant advantages in treating heavy metal wastewater the traditional method obtains sludge with a moisture content of 60 80 through specific process conditions and system settings the particles recovered by fbc granulation technology are pure with a water content of only 1 5 which can be recycled the treated heavy metal wastewater can be discharged saving waste treatment costs 110 in 1980 dhv developed a pellet reactor crystallization system which was used in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater in the chemical metal processing and electroplating industries in 1987 the first nickel recovery plant in the field of heavy metal recovery was put into operation the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor was 0 6 m the reactor system had a compact structure and featured relatively low investment cost stable crystallization process and easy operation 110 wilms et al used a fluidized bed reactor to crystallize nickel carbonate to recover nickel from the waste plating solution the nickel concentration in the effluent was less than 0 5 mg l and nickel bicarbonate particles with a diameter of about 1 mm were obtained by dissolving the particles in acid a pure solution of nickel chloride is obtained which shows that the fluidized bed crystallization granulation technology was effective in treating nickel wastewater 111 in the patent of lu et al nickel wastewater was treated by fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization and the nickel containing solution and oxidizing agent were introduced into the reactor and mixed to produce basic nickel oxide particle crystals the obtained processing efficiency and crystal particle purity were high 112 lertratwattana et al used fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization

malachite was the only crystal phase and copper hydroxide precipitation was the main crystal phase composition of malachite 113 there is a patent mentioning a method and equipment for crystallizing copper sulfide a fluidized bed reactor is used to crystallize copper into sulfide to remove copper from sewage and enable the material to be recycled the agent uses calcium sulfide cas or sodium sulfide monohydrate na2s 6h2o and copper sulfide crystals are finally obtained 114 jansen proposed a method to remove zinc from wastewater by crystallization of the corresponding heavy metal carbonate

the effluent was 7 2 mg l and the concentration of arsenic after passing through the ultrafiltration system was 0 5 mg l 116 nielsen et al used a fluidized bed reactor to remove heavy metals in flue gas desulfurization wastewater 117 research has shown that fbc granulation technology can treat several dissolved heavy metals in industrial wastewater and groundwater the concentrations of nickel cadmium and zinc in the influent water were 510 640 and 1900 mg l respectively and the recovery rates reached 99 92 and 97 respectively the density of the dense particles produced by the system was 2 5 3 0 kg l and the water content after artificial dehydration was less than 20 after heavy metal wastewater was treated by fbc granulation technology the removal rate of heavy metal ions was relatively high and the treated wastewater could be discharged in a standardized manner the system did not produce sludge the metal coated particles had a low moisture content compact structure and could easily dissolve in strong acid thus they could be reused in industry according to the reviewed literature it can treat both single metal wastewater and multi metal mixed wastewater therefore the use of fbc granulation technology to remove heavy metals is a good way to recover metals and realize resource utilization 6 2 synthesis of crystalline fbc not only can recover all kinds of elements in wastewater but also has potential for the synthesis of crystals in the bayer process of the aluminum industry bauxite ore is converted into sodium carbonate and sodium oxalate oxalate is a kind of anti nutritional and toxic substance which can cause corrosive damage to human internal tissue 118 moreover it can form a stable complex with metal and pollute groundwater and nearby sewage systems 119 the mineral coagulants commonly used in the water treatment industry are aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride which are used to remove the color and turbidity of water 120 when used the coagulant will partially dissolve and remain in the treated water even if the water contains a small amount of aluminum purifying the water is highly challenging 121 to solve these problems fbc granulation has been applied and achieved good results it can synthesize oxalate crystal and alumina crystal recover barium borate from high concentration boron containing waste water and produce sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride in the work of guevara et al the bottom of the reactor was filled with 0 5 cm glass beads to buffer the influent water 122 the initial concentration of oxalate

products or wastewater treatment fbc technology has been studied to synthesize aluminum crystals to remove aluminum from waste water 124 carrier addition was not needed and the system involved an influent aluminum ion concentration of 200 mg l and employed sodium hydroxide as reagent when oh al3 molar ratio was 1 5 2 5 upflow velocity was 28 65 m h the total concentration of aluminum in the effluent was 0 5 mg l and the granular product was alumina vilando et al recovered calcium from aqueous solution by using a seedless fluidized bed reactor 125 under the optimal conditions the influent aluminum concentration was 334 1 mg l the molar ratio of oh al3 was 2 5 the aluminum removal rate was 98 8 and the crystallization rate was 96 9 the formed particles had the same lattice parameters as the orthorhombic structure of alumina cho et al studied the synthesis of barium borate homogeneous particles by fbc granulation 126 the crystallization device is shown in fig 21 through the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with boron ion and adding barium ion as coagulant in fluidized bed homogeneous barium perborate particles with water content less than 5 and particle size more than 0 5 mm were produced they presented volume reduction and high purity which were conducive to subsequent recovery and processing two fluidized bed reactors in series were used to pretreat boron containing wastewater with hydrogen peroxide and barium salt solution as precipitant without adding carrier the total removal rate reached about 80 in which the first reactor accounted for 60 and the second reactor accounted for 20 a recent patent was made to study the crystallization of sodium chloride in a fluidized bed 127 the supersaturated solution passed through the distributor at a certain temperature below the fluidized bed and the supersaturated aqueous solution of 0 3 0 5 g l sodium chloride used at 50 c 100 c was preferred finally the spherical sodium chloride crystal with diameter of 3 mm or more was prepared other patents on the use of fbc of sodium bicarbonate have been filed 128 the traditional process is time consuming and expensive and the product is an irregular fine powder in the fluidized bed process sodium bicarbonate particles in the form of egg or spherical particles can be obtained the average particle size of sodium bicarbonate crystal is 0 25 1 mm when the temperature is controlled at 60 c the average particle size of coarse sodium bicarbonate is 0 92 mm the above literature reported that fbc granulation technology can also be used in the synthesis of crystals and it is also widely used in the treatment of modern industrial wastewater the crystallized particles have good shape and high utilization value which can effectively solve environmental problems and provide recycling resources for the industry greatly reducing economic costs it is a feasible recycling water treatment process 7 conclusions and future outlook this review introduced the development background operation process and industrial application of fbc in the field of water treatment after summarizing the working characteristics of four different types of reactors the applications of fbc in softening water removing and recovering fluoride and phosphate and synthesizing industrial crystallization were introduced although most of the data in the current study are in the experimental stage fbc has been applied in areas with a relatively deep development foundation such as the netherlands and taiwan this work fully demonstrated the feasibility and development of the industrial application of fbc granulation our comprehensive data can help scholars with further research although fbc has obtained encouraging results in previous studies more research is needed to solve some gaps and related problems in the literature the future direction was summarized as follow 1 this technology is the most widely used in water softening fluorine phosphorus and heavy metals have begun to be used in a small range and are in the expansion stage applications should be developed in new areas 2 regarding reactor design and operational modifications the most widely used structure is the amsterdam reactor the operation mode of adding a carrier and forming a heterogeneous nucleus is the most common 3 the influence of the method of dispensing is more prominent although the crystallization and granulation processes have been improved by adding multiple inlets the structure of the reactor has been changed and the difficulty of system piping design has been increased further research may be necessary in the future 4 in the whole process of crystallization and granulation spontaneous homogeneous crystallization and turbidity of the particles are inevitable although many researchers have alleviated the agglomeration phenomenon by changing the types of carriers and solution systems improving agents and adding dispersants they still need continuous improvement 5 fbc granulation technology has a wide range of applications and excellent performance but its operating cost in practical applications is related to the amount of medicament used and the amount of water treated by balancing benefits and performance making the processing process have added value and low cost is a problem that must be considered in the practical application of fbc transformation from the beginning of its application to the present research on this technology remains popular in recent years people s interest in this subject has increased possibly because fbc can be fully utilized in water treatment overall fbc has the effect of improved process performance and low cost of various water treatments if properly treated fbc can not only solve the actual discharge problem but also realize the application of water resources therefore the large scale research of fbc has huge development space and application prospects declaration of competing interest the authors declare

this work lays a theoretical foundation for the development and application of high efficiency and industrialized fluidized bed crystallization granulation this review concludes with an overview of the challenges faced by this research focus and the authors personal views keywords fluidized bed crystallization calcium removal fluorine removal phosphorous removal heavy metals removal synthetic crystal 1 introduction with the rapid economic development the internal allocation mechanism of various elements of the natural environment has become out of balance and the environment is deteriorating water the source of life affects the quality of human life development of water treatment technology is of great significance to the protection of water resources fluidized bed crystallization fbc granulation is a new type of water treatment technology it is also an intensified crystallization process flocculation precipitation and other operation units are not needed in the process the water content of crystal particles is low and solid liquid separation is easy the equipment covers a small area and high processing efficiency the treated water can easily reach the standard and does not cause secondary pollution to the environment most importantly this technology can effectively recover calcium carbonate calcium fluoride phosphate and other substances from water it not only solves the problems of water treatment and discharge but also makes use of crystal particles collected from water as industrial raw materials because of their high purity and low water content it is a green industrial technology that turns waste into treasure fbc granulation technology has significant advantages and potential application prospects in the fields of chemical industry pharmaceuticals 1 2 environmental protection metallurgy 3 5 and water treatment 6 in 1971 fbc was first used in water softening treatment in the netherlands 7 8 on the one hand fbc granulation technology can reduce water hardness and the concentration of harmful elements which are important factors for public health on the other hand reducing the generation of scale during the heating process enhancing heat transfer and preventing additional energy consumption can also be achieved by this technology through long term practice and in depth research on softening technology fbc technology is beneficial for public health has significant environmental benefits and offers reduced social costs 9 in 1978 dhv de hewei company published a study on fbc dephosphorization and determined that the granular product is composed of calcium phosphate and carrier seeds moreover the product can be directly used in the phosphate rock industry 10 in recent years more phosphate crystals magnesium ammonium phosphate hydroxyapatite and magnesium phosphate have been developed and applied to actual industrial production compared with the impact of hardness and phosphorus on public health the presence of fluorine in water is more harmful scientific research has found that fluoride has a strong affinity for calcium and phosphate in the human body it can destroy the normal metabolism of calcium and phosphate in the human body inhibit the activity of certain enzymes and even could cause endemic fluorosis in 1990 lee et al designed and developed an fbc process system for treating fluoride containing wastewater this system can separate fluoride ions in the form of cryolite or calcium fluoride to treating fluoride containing wastewater however the operating specifications must be strictly controlled to avoid clogging the pipe with floccules 12 with the development of technology fbc gradually expanded to various industries that contain heavy metal wastewater such as chemical metal processing and production 11 the pure metal carbonate particles recovered from the fbc system can be reused in these industries resulting in considerable economic benefits besides recovering the above mentioned elements fbc can synthesize crystals as well a research group in japan studied the crystallization of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate in a fluidized bed reactor 13 14 fig 1 shows the selected focus of the fbc development process as the state pays increasing attention to environmental protection and water and soil resources relevant policies are also tightening fbc has attracted great attention in the field of environmental protection and water treatment at present several studies have reported fluidized bed reviews 8 15 16 bello et al and tisa et al mainly reviewed the fluidized bed combined with advanced oxidation discussed fluidized bed fenton fluidized bed photocatalysis and fluidized bed bioreactor and reported research applications for the treatment of refractory compounds 8 15 segura et al reviewed the treatment of refractory organics in fluidized bed fenton in detail 16 literature in the field of fbc granulation for recovering calcium fluoride phosphate and synthetic crystals is lacking therefore this article mainly focused on the research and application of fbc in the field of recovery of calcium 31 50 fluorine 51 75 phosphorus 76 109 heavy metals 110 117 and synthetic crystals 118 128 as well as introduces the development background basic concepts excellent characteristics and specific applications of fbc in different types of wastewater this work seeks to guide future scholars and encourage further exploration of the technology fig 2 provides an overview of fbc which aims to provide a reference and preliminary understanding for summarizing the relevant knowledge of fbc the scope of application includes but is not limited to the above mentioned scope more details will be introduced in the following chapters 2 related theories of fbc 2 1 liquid solid fluidization liquid solid fluidization is a method of contacting solid particles with liquid the liquid flows upward through the solid particle bed to make the solid particles have fluid characteristics this phenomenon is called liquid fluidization or particle fluidization 17 18 fluidized crystallization has the characteristics of variable crystal movement and complex fluidized behavior 19 the realization of the fluidization process is related to the minimum fluidization speed the fluidized bed reactor is partially filled with solid carrier particles the top of the reactor is open and the bottom of the reactor is provided with a distribution plate to support the solid particle bed water flow is evenly distributed on the entire section and the direction of the water flow is perpendicular to the distribution plate from bottom to top the superficial velocity is maintained at a very low speed without causing any movement of the small solid medium this situation is described as the flow through the filter and the pressure drop will increase in proportion to the superficial velocity the apparent velocity also produces friction resistance to small solid medium with the gradual increase in the superficial velocity the pressure drop increases but the particles do not move and the bed height remains unchanged at a certain speed the pressure drop on the bed and the bed balances the gravity or the weight of the solid particles any further increase in speed will cause the particles to move and sometimes exhibit slightly granular bed expansion but the particles remain in contact with further increase in speed particles are separated sufficiently to move within the bed and true fluidization begins once the bed is fluidized the pressure drop of the bed remains unchanged but the bed height continues to increase as the flow rate increases in this process the minimum fluidization velocity is the minimum superficial velocity when the bed starts to expand the equation for the minimum fluidization velocity can be obtained by setting the pressure drop on the bed equal to the weight of the bed per unit area or cross section and considering the buoyancy of the liquid to be replaced 20 the derivative formulas are expressed as eqs 1 4 1 p g g c 1 ε ρ p ρ l 2 u 1 k e 3 s 2 1 e 2 μ p l 3 u 1 k 1 36 e 3 s 2 1 e 2 d 2 ρ p ρ μ g 4 u mf 1 k 1 36 e mf 3 s 2 1 e mf 2 d 2 ρ p ρ μ g for larger sized solid media given that the flow phenomenon is not linear a more suitable equation is proposed by ergon defined as eq 5 21 5 p l 150 1 e mf 2 e mf 3 μ u mf d 2 1 75 1 e mf e mf 3 ρ u mf 2 d the combined equation is eq 6 6 ρ ρ p ρ g d 2 u 2 150 1 e mf e mf 3 u mf dρ u 1 75 e mf 3 u mf dρ u 2 if the upward velocity of the liquid is greater than the sedimentation velocity of the particles the particles continue to move upwards are carried out by the liquid and no longer stay in the bed w t is the critical speed at which the particles are removed also known as the maximum fluidization velocity which is the same as the minimum fluidization velocity and is related to the properties of solid particles and liquids the take out speed is the upper limit of the liquid velocity in the fluidized bed and it is also an important parameter for the research and design of the fluidized bed for spherical particles the calculation formula of the carry out speed is expressed as eq 7 7 w t d ρ 2 ρ d ρ g 18 μ where p is pressure drop g is gravitational acceleration m s2 g c is newton s law proportionality factor the value is 32 174 ε is porosity or volume fraction of voids in bed of solids ρ is density kg m3 ρ p is density of particle kg m3 l is total height of fluidized bed m u is superficial velocity e is porosity s is specific surface area μ is viscosity of fluid k is the kozeny equation generally 5 u mf is minimum fluidization velocity e mf is minimum porosity and w t is the take out speed 2 2 process principle fbc granulation first needs to fill a suitable carrier or seed crystal at the bottom of the fluidized bed reactor as shown in fig 3 waste water is introduced from the bottom of the fluidized bed at a certain flow rate so the carrier seed crystals are in a fluidized state adding the precipitation agent makes the solution reach a moderately oversaturated state and the generated insoluble substances precipitate on the carrier to form heterogeneous crystals as crystallization progresses the carrier particles continue to increase and become heavier and they gradually settle to the bottom of the reactor at this time the particle sediment is removed for a time period while new carrier seeds are added to the reactor and the reactor is continuously operated the core of this technology is to operate depending on supersaturation in solution supersaturation reflects the concentration gradient of crystal formation and precipitation in the supersaturated solution and it is the driving force for crystal formation the degree of supersaturation is related to the concentration of the solution and the solubility product of the precipitated crystals the solubility product is constant at a certain temperature and its size reflects the solubility of matter for the same number of ions the smaller the solubility product is the more insoluble it is supersaturation is expressed as eq 8 8 s r c c 0 c 0 where s r is supersaturation c is the actual concentration and c 0 is the saturation concentration the crystallization process of fbc is composed of the formation and growth of the crystal nucleus the formation of the crystal nucleus includes heterogeneous nucleation fig 4 a or homogeneous nucleation fig 4 b heterogeneous nucleation refers to the growth of particles by the precipitation of supersaturated materials on the surface of support particles such as silica which occurs at the phase interface homogeneous nucleation refers to that in supersaturated solution wherein the ions also known as crystallographic ions that make up the precipitates associate with each other due to electrostatic interaction and form crystal nucleus spontaneously and large particles as the reaction proceeds heterogeneous nucleation is more commonly used in fbc granulation technology homogeneous nucleation requires greater supersaturation and chemical driving force whereas heterogeneous nucleation requires less and the crystal can be easily opened the internal ions of the crystal form obtained by heterogeneous nucleation are regularly arranged and the structure is tight the particles have low moisture content the treated wastewater can be directly discharged or recycled making it highly environmentally friendly 22 23 2 3 typical fluidized bed reactor the structure and shape of the reactor should comprehensively consider the residence time of the water body the way of distributing the medicine the treatment capacity and other parameters the residence time is mainly determined by the crystallization rate which is determined by experiments the scale and structure of the reactor are generally designed by the residence time and the treatment capacity the residence time is expressed as eq 9 9 t v b q in where t is the residence time vb is the volume of the expanded bed m3 and qin is the inlet water flow h m3 the reactor used in fbc granulation technology is called a fluidized bed reactor also known as a pellet reactor to date the four typical fluidized bed reactors are as follows spiractor blackpool reactor amsterdam reactor and woerden reactor as shown in fig 5 these reactors were originally developed to soften water the basic structures of these four types of fluidized bed reactors are as follows 7 since 1938 four types of reactors have been researched and developed one after another 24 table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the four reactors and the amsterdam reactor is the most widely used in the end compared with other fluidized bed reactors the amsterdam reactor has a reasonable structure and good practical effects the dhv group headquartered in the netherlands has developed and registered an amsterdam reactor known as crystalactor dhv company has conducted extensive application research on it and successfully applied it to water softening and the removal and recovery of fluoride phosphate and heavy metals 10 25 26 many domestic and foreign studies on fbc precipitation are related to dhv and the amsterdam reactor has become the most widely used reactor in the field fig 6 a shows a schematic of a flat bottomed amsterdam reactor and fig 6 b shows examples of flat and cone bottomed reactors for example nielsen et al used a 5 5 m high and 14 5 cm inner diameter column reactor to remove heavy metals from flue gas desulfurization wastewater 27 lee et al utilized a column reactor with a height of 1 05 m and an inner diameter of 8 cm to remove phosphate from wastewater by crystalline struvite 28 mitani et al employed a column reactor with a height of 5 3 m and an inner diameter of 60 cm to recover phosphate from low phosphate containing wastewater 29 yan et al used a column reactor with a height of 0 6 m and inner diameter of 3 cm to treat copper containing wastewater 30 3 removal and recovery of calcium fbc granulation technology exhibits remarkable advantages over traditional precipitation technology when used to soften water for removing calcium by controlling specific process conditions and system settings in the fluidized bed the traditional precipitation method obtained sludge with a water content of 60 80 after fluidized bed treatment the final result was crystalline particles with a water content of only 1 5 no sludge was produced and the particles could be recycled saving a high amount of waste disposal costs these findings were fully in line with the sustainable development and circular economy policies advocated by the state fbc granulation technology to remove and recover calcium can be divided into two main categories one is groundwater and the other is wastewater groundwater body is relatively pure with less impurity ions the composition of wastewater is very complex which may contain heavy metal ions insoluble organic matter and so on these two systems are the two most commonly used typical systems groundwater is closely related to human beings well water and spring water are the most commonly used groundwater in our daily life groundwater can be developed and utilized as a source of domestic water industrial water and farmland irrigation water groundwater has the advantages of stable water supply and less pollution it is very necessary to remove the calcium hardness in its presence wastewater refers to the general term of water discharged during residents activities and runoff rainwater it includes domestic sewage industrial wastewater and other useless water 3 1 principle of calcium removal fbc granulation removes or recovers calcium given that calcium is in the form of calcium bicarbonate in water the solubility product of calcium bicarbonate in water ksp 1 07 is large the generation of scale is due to the presence of calcium bicarbonate by adding an alkaline agent hydroxide reacts with bicarbonate to form carbonate thereby forming calcium carbonate on the surface of the carrier the solubility product of calcium carbonate in water is very small ksp 5 0 10 9 11 so the formed precipitation particles are excluded the reaction process is shown in eqs 10 and 11 10 ca2 2hco3 ca oh 2 2caco3 2h2o 11 ca2 hco3 naoh caco3 na 2h2o 3 2 groundwater and its simulation water chen et al invented a kind of groundwater softening treatment device 31 the carrier used mineral particles with particle size of 0 1 0 5 mm the total hardness of the influent was 455 mg l the treatment capacity was 100 m3 h and the total hardness of the effluent was 136 5 mg l the discharged calcium carbonate particles could also be used as absorbent of the desulfurization system the removal of hardness by the fluidized bed particle reactor combined with membrane filtration has been studied in the literature the hardness removal efficiency of different carrier particles was also examined at ph 9 0 the carrier used 32 2 g of hot iron oxide particles with a diameter of 0 005 mm for maximum removal efficiency and the removal efficiency of hardness increased with the increase in ph and surface area 32 zhi used fluidized bed chemical crystallization technology to remove hardness from groundwater of water plant 33 the fluidized bed reactor was an internal and external jacketed reactor and the chemicals were naoh and hcl when the influent flow rate was 100 l h the line speed was 60 m h the ph was adjusted to 9 7 the dosages of naoh and hcl were 140 and 60 mg l respectively the total hardness of effluent was 120 mg l the concentration of calcium ion was 8 mg l and the removal rate of calcium ion exceeded 85 mahvi et al carried out a feasibility study on crystallization softened water in a pellet reactor and the effect of the reagent addition method on hardness removal was explored the addition of both ca oh 2 and naoh had no significant difference compared with ca oh 2 or naoh added separately the device is shown in fig 7 the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor was 1 9 cm the height was 175 cm and the volume was 500 ml the carrier was quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 0 3 mm and the filling height was 0 6 m raw water adopts simulated groundwater hardness when the influent hardness values were 150 mg l the removal rates were 76 the experimental operation showed that the fluidized bed reactor could be used for groundwater and other water treatment particles with low water content will be generated and discharged regularly 34 hu et al used a fluidized bed reactor to remove the hardness of groundwater 35 the treatment efficiency under different particle sizes of carrier ph and inlet water speed was studied through pilot tests the device is shown in fig 8 the diameter and height of the reactor were 18 and 400 cm respectively garnet with particle size of 0 1 0 25 mm inlet calcium concentration of 74 9 mg l ph 7 7 and turbidity of 0 11 ntu was used as carrier when the optimum dosage of softener was 110 mg l ph was 9 4 inlet water speed was 30 90 m h outlet water calcium ion concentration was 5 mg l and removal rate was 93 the diameter of round calcium carbonate particles reached 1 2 mm and the reaction crystallization rate was 1 96 10 9 m s homogeneous crystallization has been used to remove calcium from simulated groundwater the process parameters such as ph of effluent molar ratio of initial carbonate to calcium and rising flow rate were considered the diameter and height of the lower part of the fluidized bed reactor were 2 and 80 cm respectively the upper part was 4 cm in diameter and 15 cm in height fig 9 under the optimum process conditions sodium carbonate was the precipitator the calcium concentration in the inlet solution was 300 mg l the inlet flow was 6 l h the ph was adjusted to 11 the reflux flow was 1 2 l h the calcium removal rate was 92 the reaction ran for 300 h and the particle size of calcium carbonate reached 1 2 mm sem images showed that the calcium carbonate particles were formed by the aggregation of fine crystals about 5 μm 36 chen et al combined the fluidized bed with the induced crystallization technology to treat simulated wastewater 37 the carrier in the reactor adopted quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm and the filling height was 0 5 m the calcium concentration in wastewater was 450 mg l the inflow was 60 l h ph was 9 5 and the calcium concentration of effluent was 60 mg l thus the removal rate reached 86 6 the surface material of the discharged particles was mainly calcium carbonate and the moisture content was 15 994 given the low water content dehydration treatment was no longer needed which could save the cost of water treatment veen et al studied a device for softening groundwater which can reduce the hardness of calcium carbonate from 250 mg l to 100 mg l 8 the temperature was 0 c 45 c the ph was 8 8 and the residence time of the seed material was 100 days on average the caco3 particles that did not require any treatment were softened by adding caustic soda crystals when calcium carbonate crystallized on the seed particles very low water content 0 2 0 5 was achieved after several hours of drainage the softener was selected in the ratio of carbonate to total hardness in the raw water lime was found to be an efficient softener at a high hardness ratio whereas soda ash was preferred at a low hardness ratio hadi et al studied hardness removal by crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor with sand medium 38 when the influent calcium concentration was 240 mg l and the influent flow rate was 0 75 l h the calcium removal rate was 96 36 hu et al studied the application of chemical crystallization circulating particle fluidized bed in the softening of simulated groundwater in thermal power plants 39 the diameter of the circulating particle fluidized bed was 240 cm the calcium ion concentration of circulating water was 70 mg l ph was 7 7 and calcium ion concentration was 16 mg l the calcium carbonate particles obtained could be used as desulfurizer in the power plant desulfurization system because the cao content was 51 10 sun et al studied crystallization softening and crystal growth kinetics of high hardness groundwater in a fluidized bed 40 the parameters such as dosage of agent particle size of carrier height of filler inflow flow rate and supersaturation of calcium carbonate were discussed and studied the relationship between the growth rate of particle size and other parameters was determined the smaller the particle size of carrier the better the effect of heterogeneous nucleation and the faster the crystallization rate however the smaller the particle size the faster the flow rate of the fluidized bed could cause particle loss the optimized reaction conditions could control the ph of effluent below 8 5 and no scale was produced after boiling a new type of circulating granular fluidized bed reactor was studied and the softening effect of the reactor applied to groundwater was discussed as shown in fig 10 garnet crystal with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm was used as carrier naoh was used as softener and hcl was used as ph regulator the total hardness of raw water was 286 mg l and the concentration of calcium ion was 75 mg l at the naoh dosage of 180 mg l hcl dosage of 50 mg l and ph 8 the calcium ion removal rate was 90 outlet ph was 9 5 turbidity was 1 0 ntu and the particle size of the discharged particles could reach 3 5 mm the operating cost of the system was 0 074 m3 which demonstrated high hardness removal efficiency good economic benefits and environmentally friendly and social benefits 41 tiangco et al removed and recovered calcium from simulated groundwater by fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization 42 as shown in fig 11 when the molar ratio of co3 2 ca2 was 1 0 the outlet ph was 10 2 the removal rate of calcium was 99 8 the crystallization rate was 98 9 and the particle size of the discharged particles was 0 5 mm however the addition of f no3 and so4 2 could inhibit the particle size of the discharged particles fine crystals with particle sizes of 0 149 0 297 and 0 297 mm were discharged from the three systems 3 3 wastewater and its simulated water the treatment of wastewater from the waste paper industry by anaerobic systems still cannot effectively reduce or remove the high concentration of calcium leading to extensive calcium carbonate precipitation blockage 43 this problem can be avoided by removing calcium from the influent in a fluidized bed reactor given that the addition of alkaline chemicals is costly the possibility of reusing the alkalinity produced by circulating water was studied in this paper the concentration of calcium in the influent was 1800 mg l the recycling of anaerobic effluent provides sufficient bicarbonate alkalinity for crystallization so no reagent was added at ph 7 1 the white precipitate was recovered and almost all calcium was removed in the fluidized bed reactor chen et al used fluidized bed induced crystallization to remove calcium hardness from simulated wastewater 44 caco3 precipitation was induced on the surface of quartz sand the device is shown in fig 12 the different particle size carriers bed filling height ph and flow rate were discussed and the optimal conditions were finally determined quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 0 4 mm was used in the reactor the filling height was 0 5 m the ph was adjusted to 9 5 the influent flow rate was 60 l h the reflux flow rate was 30 l h the temperature was 25 c the removal rate of calcium was the highest the removal rate was 86 6 and the effluent calcium concentration was 60 mg l noshadi et al used fbc to study the removal effect of calcium in reverse osmosis system wastewater 45 they demonstrated that fbc with 100 mg l naoh can remove calcium well and compound consumption is low at ph 8 the removal rate of calcium was 90 hiroyuki et al attempted to treat calcium in landfill leachate by fbc the changes in the calcium ion concentration turbidity and ph were measured and the flow state and simple characteristic model of the fluidized bed were calculated 46 the carrier was blast furnace slag the calcium ion removal rate reached 60 effluent ph was 7 8 and turbidity was less than 30 so there was no need to adjust follow up treatment norman studied the removal of calcium carbonate from reverse osmosis filter wastewater in a fluidized bed reactor 47 their results showed the reduction of conductivity by crystallization of calcium carbonate in sandy media using caustic soda as a chemical with high ph could reduce the calcium concentration and the effluent turbidity was very low 1 0 ntu the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor was 5 cm the height was 270 cm the carrier was silica sand with particle size of 0 425 0 85 mm and the filling height was 0 4 m at ph 9 5 the highest removal rate was 56 and the turbidity of the effluent was 2 0 ntu tan used a fluidized bed reactor to remove calcium from semiconductor wastewater 20 this experiment provides favorable guidance for the use of fbc technology in the direction of pharmaceuticals the removal rate of calcium ion was 80 precipitation agents ca oh 2 naoh and na2co3 can be used to create supersaturation conditions and make calcium crystallize into calcium carbonate if the alkalinity is high ca oh 2 or naoh can be used but they are not as good as ca oh 2 na2co3 can remove all calcium from semiconductor wastewater but the alkalinity will be very high liu developed a stirred crystallization separation integrated reactor for the research and treatment of high salinity wastewater 48 this experiment provides a favorable reference for the treatment of high concentration water bodies with fbc technology the carrier was in fluidization state by water inflow or return water or granular calcium carbonate sediment was produced by stirring which could be easily treated after slag removal a reagent was not added saving the dosage of reagent the final calcium removal rate of the whole system was 98 and the particle size was 1 mm liang applied fluidized bed technology to remove high salt steel wastewater in the iron and steel industry 49 their experimental results showed that the two phase self crystallizing fluidized bed was suitable and the hardness removal effect of the reactor was good the bed demonstrated high crystal purity and minimal harmful elements indicating that it could be used in the sintering process of iron and steel 3 4 summary fbc granulation has been greatly developed and applied to soften water and remove and recover calcium 50 since the late 1970s softening technology has been successfully applied in the netherlands before a comprehensive breakthrough graveland et al began a long term discussion and in depth study of softening technology in 1983 7 by 2006 almost all drinking water in the netherlands was adjusted to the best water quality the initial calcium concentration of drinking water can be reduced from 76 8 and 100 mg l to 43 1 and 53 mg l respectively the use of softening technology has resulted in high economic benefits the technology is clearly beneficial to public health has significant environmental benefits and reduces social costs tables 2 and 3 show that the two systems have differences in process parameters such as fluidized bed reactor structure carrier particles inlet calcium ion concentration and calcium removal rate according to the literature we checked in the groundwater section the maximum diameter of the reactor is 2 4 m it can be seen from the literature that a large number of practical applications have been used to treat this kind of water body in the wastewater section the maximum diameter of the reactor is 5 cm the carrier particles used in groundwater treatment are relatively pure such as silica calcium carbonate crystal etc however blast furnace slag containing more impurities can be used as the carrier of wastewater treatment in terms of incoming calcium concentration most of the incoming calcium concentration of groundwater is low the maximum is 450 mg l and the calcium hardness removal rate is more than 80 while the incoming calcium concentration of wastewater can reach 1353 mg l and the calcium hardness removal rate is more than 56 the research progress is still in the laboratory or pilot test stage and there is a gap from the practical application therefore the treatment of calcium in wastewater by this process still needs further research 4 removal and recovery of fluoride the waste water discharged from fluoride ore mining metal smelting electronics electroplating chemical industry and other industries usually contains different concentrations of fluoride thus the problem of fluoride pollution is becoming increasingly serious most of these fluorides exist in the form of fluoride ions if fluoride containing wastewater is discharged directly without treatment it will seriously pollute the living environment of human beings 51 traditional fluoride containing wastewater treatment methods have been used to remove fluoride in wastewater in the form of sludge or waste but such techniques cannot achieve the purpose of saving resources and recycling 52 fbc granulation is an efficient induced crystallization process which is dedicated to removing fluoride from wastewater and recycling it on the basis of the treatment of fluoride wastewater fbc granulation can be divided into low concentration and high concentration on the basis of the needs of fluorine wastewater treatment the process parameters are designed according to the concentration range so high concentration and low concentration are divided low concentration fluoride containing wastewater can only remove fluoride ions with crystalline calcium fluoride while high concentration fluoride containing wastewater can remove fluoride ions with both crystalline calcium fluoride and crystalline cryolite there are also some differences between the two in reagent consumption treatment standard and effluent results this is described in detail below 4 1 principle of fluoride removal using fbc granulation to remove or recover fluoride can form the corresponding insoluble calcium fluoride by adding calcium salt ksp 3 46 10 11 53 the particles are formed by spontaneous crystallization or precipitation on the carrier and grow into large diameter particles which are finally discharged from the bottom of the reactor and then recycled 54 the reaction process is shown in eq 12 12 ca2 2f caf2 to reduce economic cost and remove additional fluoride some researchers use crystal precipitation in the form of cryolite which can easily form crystal in high concentration fluoride wastewater due to its high solubility the soluble aluminum reagent and sodium reagent are added into the fluidized bed reactor to form cryolite coating on the carrier and lead to particle precipitation for recycling the reaction process is shown in eq 13 13 3na al3 6f na3alf6 4 2 low concentration fluoride containing wastewater jansen et al used a fluidized bed reactor to remove fluoride from wastewater 55 elemental fluoride in wastewater was removed by mixing the wastewater with the test agent in the form of micro soluble salt the precipitation agent was calcium chloride solution the concentration of fluoride ion in wastewater was 100 mg l and the ph was 4 5 the fluoride concentration of wastewater treated by the system was 5 10 mg l the calcium fluoride particles with size of 1 3 mm could be obtained by this process and the moisture content was very low 5 chen removed fluoride from wastewater by carrier induced precipitation crystallization 24 quartz sand induces caf2 precipitation in reaction kinetics and thermodynamics when quartz sand is fluidizing the induced precipitates adhere to the surface of quartz sand increasing the concentration of suspended quartz sand can increase the speed of removing fluoride quartz sand induced precipitation and crystallization can be used for the defluoridation of industrial wastewater this experiment provides favorable guidance for research on silica sand carrier in the treatment of fluorine wastewater by fbc technology aldaco et al used granular calcite as carrier and a fluidized bed reactor to recover calcium fluoride from fluoride containing wastewater 56 57 under certain technological conditions the particle size of 0 463 mm was obtained and the mass fraction of calcium fluoride reached 87 the crystal particle was used as a seed to carry out the experiment again after running for 110 h the particle size of 0 769 mm was obtained and the mass fraction of calcium fluoride was 97 7 it could be used repeatedly as raw material for hydrofluoric acid production which reduced waste generation and material recovery watanabe et al studied the methods and equipment for treating fluoride containing wastewater 58 the carrier was composed of hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate the volume of 1 m3 with an average particle size of 0 8 mm was filled in the reactor the fluoride concentration of 12 mg l was reduced to 6 9 mg l to determine the effect of fbc on fluoride containing wastewater with different concentrations jiang et al studied the effects of supersaturation on the fluoride removal rate and calcium fluoride crystallization rate 59 when the concentration was 100 mg l and supersaturation was 7 0 the concentration of effluent was lower than 10 mg l and the precipitation condition was located in the calcium fluoride metastable zone which was conducive to the growth of crystal in the process of operation control of fluidized bed defluoridation the relationship between supersaturation and calcium fluoride metastable zone should be considered to reduce the supersaturation of solution properly and improve the defluoridation efficiency and calcium fluoride recovery 4 3 high concentration fluoride containing wastewater lee et al studied the crystallization process for fluoride removal from wastewater 60 61 the precipitant used in fluidized bed was soluble sodium salt solution such as sodium chloride sodium hydroxide sodium sulfate and sodium nitrate and soluble aluminum salt solution such as aluminum chloride aluminum sulfate and aluminum nitrate the fluoride concentration of wastewater was 5500 mg l the fluoride concentration discharged from the treated water after the full reaction was 73 mg l in the process of the invention cryolite na3alf6 with diameter of 1 2 mm formed on the carrier in the reactor and its water content was less than 10 lee et al used two fluidized bed crystallizers in series to treat wastewater containing 5200 mg l fluoride 60 as shown in fig 13 the wastewater flowed into the first reactor at a flow rate of 0 624 m3 h calcium reagent with ca2 concentration of 1630 mg l and aluminum reagent with al3 concentration of 1120 mg l were added the range of molar ratio was al3 ca2 f 0 8 1 2 0 8 1 2 6 0 and na f 1 6 the fluoride concentration in the effluent was 291 mg l the effluent was added to the sedimentation tank and the ph adjusted to 7 0 with sodium hydroxide the adjusted water was mixed with another wastewater with low fluoride concentration in the buffer pool after adding calcium reagent the range of molar ratio was ca2 f 0 5 2 1 the large diameter caf2 grains formed on the carrier were discharged and the fluoride concentration in the effluent was 12 mg l aldaco et al systematically studied the removal of recovered fluoride by induced crystallization in fluidized beds 62 63 their results showed that supersaturation plays an important role in the nucleation mechanism leading to the formation of fine powder and the reduction of recovery efficiency therefore controlling the initial fluoride concentration below 150 mg l can help improve the fluoride removal rate to reduce fluoride concentration and recover wastewater comparative experiments were carried out the experimental setup is shown in fig 14 the results showed that suspended solids were retained in the sand filter bed which improved the process efficiency calcium fluoride precipitation on quartz sand in the fluidized bed reactor increased finally under high hydraulic load calcium fluoride particles with particle size of 1 2 mm mass fraction higher than 97 were obtained and the water content was less than 5 the growth kinetics of caf2 in fluidized bed crystallizer with constant ph has been studied 64 the growth rate of caf2 crystal measured in fluidized bed increases with the increase in supersaturation ph surface velocity and seed size the growth rate of different grain sizes varies and the growth rate increases with the increase in grain size li et al studied high concentration wastewater treatment by fbc 65 the experimental setup is shown in fig 15 which involved fluoride containing wastewater with a concentration of 1000 mg l the fluoride concentration of effluent decreased to below 10 mg l the turbidity of effluent was below 60 ntu and the ph of effluent was 6 7 the moisture content of the calcium fluoride sludge produced was 24 7 and the calcium fluoride particles after drying were homogeneous with an average particle size of 0 378 mm and a purity of 98 the crystal was suitable for preservation under ph 5 and ph 10 given that the concentration of effluent in the pilot plant did not reach the discharge standard jiang et al optimized the process to ensure that the final effluent could meet the discharge standard the effluent was treated by flocculation 54 calcium chloride and polyaluminum chloride were selected as flocculants ca2 f 1 1 ph was 7 9 the concentration of fluoride ion in the effluent was stably lower than 10 mg l and the turbidity was lower than 10 ntu these conditions reached the first class national integrated wastewater discharge standard the feasibility of recovering calcium fluoride from high fluoride wastewater has never stopped jiang et al discussed the feasibility of recovering calcium fluoride from high fluoride wastewater and studied the effects of supersaturation seed size and other factors on the growth rate of calcium fluoride 66 under low supersaturation 6 01 25 91 calcium fluoride particles can grow on the surface of seeds by heterogeneous nucleation moreover the growth rate of large particle seeds is higher than that of small particle seeds and the growth of calcium fluoride particles is favorable at ph 7 9 a pilot study on fluoride industrial wastewater was carried out 67 sand like calcium fluoride was recovered by fbc the influent fluoride concentration was 900 1700 mg l when the molar ratio of ca2 f was 0 6 1 0 at ph 8 11 the fluoride concentration in the effluent was 30 100 mg l when the operation time was 30 h the particle size of calcium fluoride was 0 0867 mm when the operation time was 50 h the particle size of calcium fluoride was 0 1531 mm the moisture content of the recovered product was 27 in addition the composition of caf2 particles was caf2 71 65 and caco3 4 43 broeck et al used a crystalactor to treat fluoride containing wastewater from the semiconductor industry 68 the performance of the reactor depends largely on the initial concentration of calcium and fluoride at the bottom of the reactor bu et al also used a crystalactor to treat high concentration fluoride wastewater 52 the reaction mechanism and characteristics of the process were described and the influencing factors existing problems and solutions in the operation process were analyzed wang et al used two different forms of fluidized bed reactor to induce crystallization to treat chemical wastewater containing fluoride 69 the bubbling fluidized bed was used to treat wastewater containing fluoride with the concentration of 1000 mg l the fluoride concentration in the effluent was less than 10 mg l which reached the allowable discharge standard the treatment effect was better than that of a conventional fluidized bed liang et al used a two stage two phase fluidized bed to treat high fluoride wastewater 70 the discharged particles at the bottom of the first stage reactor were 0 06 0 2 mm calcium fluoride particles at the same time the secondary reactor could recover calcium ions in the effluent of the primary reactor as calcium carbonate crystal particles with the particle size of 1 3 mm jiang et al studied the effect of aluminum on the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater and determined the effect of aluminum on the equilibrium concentration of calcium fluoride suspension 71 the effect of aluminum on the operation of the fluidized bed reactor was studied and the feasibility of recovering calcium fluoride was discussed the calcium fluoride particles could be used as raw materials jiang et al also studied the efficiency and stability of the fluidized bed reactor for the treatment of high concentration fluoride containing wastewater 72 the difference between the former and the latter is that calcium fluoride particles were used as crystal species the fluidized bed reactor was operated efficiently and stably and the fluoride concentration of effluent liquid was lower than 10 mg l some measures were proposed to reduce the generation or overflow of fine particles zeng et al used fbc to remove fluoride from rare earth smelting wastewater and recover calcium fluoride 73 the effects of different carrier materials carrier particle size and carrier dosage on fluoride removal and calcium fluoride recovery in fluidized bed were studied the removal of fluoride from rare earth industrial wastewater was feasible and economical by using silica sand as carrier in the fluidized bed reactor the particle size of the recovered calcium fluoride was about 1 5 mm the recovery cost of calcium fluoride from wastewater was 1 21 m3 4 4 summary to promote the development of sustainable technology the recovery and reuse of fluoride in industrial wastewater is an important goal 74 in fluoride salt glass semiconductor and other industries as well as electroplating and metal processing industries if the fluoride containing wastewater discharged in the production process is not treated it can cause great harm to water soil animals plants and humans 52 75 the literature shows that the fluidized bed reactor is effective for the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater since 1990 fbc granulation has been applied to the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater tables 4 and 5 indicate the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor ranges from 2 cm to 1 75 m whereas its height is from 50 cm to 9 3 m the concentration of fluoride wastewater is as low as 10 12 mg l and as high as 10 000 mg l the effluent effect is good and the product particles can be recycled the biggest difference between low concentration and high concentration is that the reagent consumption is different treating high concentration fluoride containing wastewater requires more reagent consumption and higher cost moreover the treatment standards of high concentration fluoride wastewater are different from those of low concentration wastewater most of the fluoride ion concentration in high concentration effluent stays above 10 mg l and will not continue to decrease while the fluoride ion in low concentration effluent can be reduced to 4 33 mg l after the treatment of high concentration fluoride wastewater it is necessary to reduce the fluorine ion concentration in the effluent for a second time the fluidized bed reactor needs a higher level of process control to ensure the smooth completion of the crystallization process compared with the traditional process this technology has a higher one time investment 52 however fbc granulation has the advantages of fast reaction small area and no sludge in the treatment of fluoride containing wastewater therefore the technology has good development and application prospects 5 removal and recovery of phosphate the treatment of phosphate containing wastewater has always been a problem due to the cost of treating phosphate rich sludge the strict regulation of limiting the discharge of phosphate to the aquatic environment and the shortage of resources caused by the limited reserves of phosphate rock phosphate is a non renewable and irreplaceable resource which is the main limiting factor of water eutrophication therefore phosphate must be removed from wastewater for recycling 76 79 fbc granulation is one of the most effective processes for the removal or recovery of phosphate from wastewater 5 1 principle of phosphate removal insoluble phosphate is produced by adding the corresponding precipitant in phosphate containing wastewater to remove phosphate the various forms of phosphate recovery are magnesium ammonium phosphate map hydroxyapatite hap calcium phosphate cp and magnesium phosphate mp the main recovery forms are map crystallization and hap crystallization map crystallization involves adding magnesium salt and ammonium salt in proportion to wastewater po4 3 nh4 and mg2 in water will react to form insoluble map under alkaline conditions commonly known as struvite the chemical formula is mgnh4po4 6h2o the solubility product constant of map is ksp 2 5 10 13 t 25 c 80 and phosphate in wastewater is removed by solid liquid separation 81 the reaction process is shown in eqs 14 16 14 mg2 nh4 po4 3 6h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o 15 mg2 nh4 hpo4 2 6h2o h mgnh4po4 6h2o 16 mg2 nh4 hpo4 2 6h2o oh h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o hap crystallization is formed by adding appropriate calcium salt to wastewater when po4 3 ca2 and oh in water reach saturation state calcium phosphate precipitate is formed and finally converted into hap the chemical formula is ca10 po4 6 oh 2 the solubility product constant of hap is ksp 1 26 10 56 t 25 c 82 the reaction process is shown in eq 17 17 5ca2 oh 3po4 3 ca5 po4 3oh 5 2 map guanguanite is a natural crystal of magnesium ammonium and phosphate battistoni et al studied the fixation of phosphate in the sludge treatment solution of wastewater treatment plant through the crystallization of bird dung 83 the feasibility and optimum operation conditions of the process were determined the removal rate of phosphate could reach 89 6 without adding any reagent in a wastewater treatment plant a large amount of sludge is produced by phosphate removal technology and the increase in phosphate load can lead to the deterioration of effluent quality given that these processes cannot remove phosphate to overcome technical difficulties ueno et al developed a map crystallizer to produce guanguanite by using the dehydrated filtrate digested by anaerobic sludge 84 using this reactor and technology struvite particles with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm were obtained within 10 days münch et al used a three phase fluidized bed reactor to remove phosphate from the side stream of the anaerobic digester 85 the device is shown in fig 16 the inner diameter of the reactor was 30 cm in the lower part and 60 cm in the upper part the effluent phosphate concentration was 4 mg l and the removal rate was 94 the struvite content in the crystal product was more than 90 map products have low concentrations of cadmium lead and mercury they can be used as slow release fertilizers mitani et al developed a liquid solid two phase fluidized bed for low phosphate wastewater 29 the influent condition of struvite precipitation prior to calcium phosphate precipitation was determined as ca2 mg2 0 25 the device scheme is shown in fig 17 the diameter of the lower part of the reactor was 60 cm the diameter of the upper part was 85 cm and the total height was 5 3 m the concentrated wastewater with po4 p concentration of 41 8 mg l was treated the average diameter of struvite was 2 mm the substances in the influent have a certain influence on the recovery rate of struvite however if this effect is controlled then the reactor can recover struvite particles shimamura et al used a fluidized bed reactor for phosphate removal the treatment performance influent phosphate loading map microcrystallization and phosphate recovery were studied 86 the particle size of map loaded into the reactor was 1 2 mm which achieved the best phosphate recovery in the fbc phosphate removal system shimamura et al studied and developed map recovery from a fluidized bed phosphate removal system 87 a double tank reactor was designed a side reaction tank was added to the reactor the main reaction tank to keep the particle size of map in the main reaction tank constant so that the recovery rate was stable the recoveries of phosphate were 91 and 92 on the basis of previous studies the method of phosphate recovery from raw water in the form of map crystal by using a fluidized bed reactor was studied 88 and a long term pilot test was carried out when the supersaturation was 3 7 the phosphate recovery was the best when the total phosphate of raw water was 250 300 mg l the total phosphate of treated water was 10 25 mg l and the recovery rate exceeded 90 shimamura et al developed a phosphate recovery system that can maintain a high recovery rate and reduce chemical cost 89 a kind of fluidized bed reactor with seeding reactor was designed and tested in the factory the treatment process was stable the effluent quality showed no great change and the phosphate recovery rate reached 94 lee et al recovered nutrients from piggery wastewater by struvite formation in a fluidized bed reactor 28 the seed material could effectively form struvite at the dose of 30 g when the molar ratio of magnesium to phosphate was 2 1 the removal rates of nh4 n and po4 p were 79 and 90 respectively rahaman et al studied the recovery of phosphate from the supernatant of an anaerobic digestion tank by struvite crystallization 90 the initial concentration of po4 p in the supernatant was 45 mg l when the bed height was 1 0 m the effluent po4 p concentration was 5 mg l and the removal rate was 89 bhuiyan et al studied the utilization of a fluidized bed to produce bird dung stone to recover phosphate in wastewater 91 the reactor was divided into four sections from the bottom to the top the device is shown in fig 18 the diameters were 7 6 10 2 15 2 and 38 1 cm the mg p molar ratio was 1 3 when the ph was 8 0 8 2 75 85 phosphate was removed the diameter of bird dung particles formed by the system was 0 5 3 5 mm and the purity was about 98 when the supersaturation in the reactor was 2 6 the system performance was the best de luna et al studied the recovery of phosphate using magnesium ammonium phosphate as seed material 92 when the dosage of magnesium ammonium phosphate seed crystal was 2 g l the concentration of po4 p was 110 mg l the concentration of nh4 n was 165 mg l and the ph was 8 5 the liquid solid conversion rate was the highest at about 74 when the influent flow was 0 72 l h and the hydraulic retention time was 2 h the recovered solid was the aggregate of struvite crystal and its average size was 0 06 mm guadie et al studied the enhanced recovery of struvite from wastewater in a conical fluidized bed reactor 93 under low and high phosphate concentrations the phosphate removal efficiency was 93 and 98 respectively the literature showed that inserting cones into each part of the reactor plays an important role in improving the recovery of struvite from various phosphate containing wastewater shih et al discussed the factors affecting phosphate removal from synthetic wastewater via struvite crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor 94 the effects of ph influent phosphate concentration and coexisting ions on the phosphate removal efficiency of a fluidized bed reactor were investigated

and the crystallization rate was 93 5 tubular struvite was obtained and the average particle size was 1 mm su et al also used the same principle to remove phosphate from synthetic wastewater and investigated the effects of ph and mg p molar ratio on struvite crystallization their results showed that the total concentration of phosphate increased with the increase in ph and mg p molar ratio of influent 95 lu et al used an improved fluidized bed struvite crystallization process to remove phosphate from wastewater 96 different physicochemical and hydraulic conditions were explored and the process parameters were optimized under the optimal conditions of phosphate concentration of 25 mg l ph 9 hrt of 12 h mg p molar ratio of 1 25 and n p molar ratio of 7 5 the removal rate of phosphate exceeded 90 ye et al studied the application of image processing in the recovery of struvite from piggery wastewater by using a fluidized bed 97 the morphology size distribution quantity density and mass concentration of different types of struvite particles were analyzed by image processing technology their results showed that the growth particles of the carrier were formed by dense aggregates or clusters casoni et al studied the effect of phosphate removal from synthetic wastewater in an aerated fluidized bed reactor 98 about 110 g of kh2po4 and 128 7 g of nh4cl were dissolved in 110 l of distilled water to prepare synthetic wastewater the concentration of po4 p in wastewater was 870 mg l after 4 h the effluent po4 p concentration was 150 mg l the removal rate was 82 76 their results showed that phosphate in wastewater could be effectively removed by the crystallization process of increasing aeration rate and reactant contact time a patent was proposed to remove phosphate from phosphate containing water 99 and a series of fluidized bed reactors was designed the po4 p concentration in raw water was 106 mg l nh4 n was 246 mg l and mg concentration was 2 6 mg l after 30 days the po4 p concentration in treated water was 5 0 mg l the particle size of map in the reactor was 1 2 1 5 mm le et al studied the recovery of phosphate from synthetic urine by fbc their results showed

and the crystallization rate was 86 5 the average particle size was 0 85 mm and the purity was about 95 the profit of phosphate recovery by this method was 0 26 m3 5 3 hap and cp dijk et al studied phosphate removal from fluidized beds a new process of phosphate removal from the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant was proposed 10 which was based on the crystallization of calcium phosphate in a fluidized bed the main advantage was that no sludge was produced and a small amount of anhydrous particles could be reused in the phosphate industry eggers et al studied the crystallization process of phosphate in a crystal reactor granular calcium phosphate was crystallized in a compact fluidized bed reactor 101 the po4 p concentration was 7 5 mg l the upflow rate was 40 m h and the ph

battistoni et al studied the removal of phosphate from anaerobic supernatant 102 different from other studies chemical substances were not added for precipitation the experimental device consisted of an aeration part and fluidized bed reactor the ph of influent water was adjusted to 6 9 8 7 by aeration tank the removal rate of phosphate was 59 3 88 1 no carrier can save the fixed cost but the selection of a suitable carrier is also a key factor affecting the phosphate removal effect moriyama et al developed a calcium silicate hydrate 5cao 6sio2 5h2o artificial seed material suitable for

phosphate containing wastewater the literature patents reviewed reported that the netherlands began to use fbc of calcium phosphate to remove phosphate from wastewater in 1984 with continuous development the scale of the fluidized bed device the form of crystallization and the economic effect were enriched the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor was from 1 5 cm to 250 cm the height was from 42 cm to 900 cm and the phosphate concentration of wastewater was as low as 4 5 mg l as high as 1500 mg l the obtained crystalline products exhibit a wide range of applications according to table 6 and 7 there are some differences in the process of removing phosphate in different crystalline forms the same point is that the ph range in the crystallization process is 8 10 the difference is that the carriers used for map crystallization are magnesium ammonium phosphate and silica and the carriers used for hap and cp are phosphate rock silica and other composites the precipitation agent is also different the former uses magnesium chloride or magnesium ion and the latter uses calcium hydroxide map can be widely used in medicine chemical industry and other industries at the same time it is rich in n p and mg which are necessary for the growth of plants it can be used in the cultivation of rice vegetables and flowers with existing fertilizers 84 hap can be used as the raw material of the phosphate industry effectively reducing industrial costs mp potassium magnesium phosphate hexahydrate and other crystalline forms are new research topics in fbc granulation technology for example the recovery of crystals from human urine into potassium magnesium phosphate hexahydrate has been attempted it has a very good guiding significance for the development of fbc technology 6 other applications 6 1 removal of heavy metals nickel copper zinc and arsenic are the main trace elements of high concern in heavy metal wastewater compared with the traditional chemical precipitation method fbc granulation technology has significant advantages in treating heavy metal wastewater the traditional method obtains sludge with a moisture content of 60 80 through specific process conditions and system settings the particles recovered by fbc granulation technology are pure with a water content of only 1 5 which can be recycled the treated heavy metal wastewater can be discharged saving waste treatment costs 110 in 1980 dhv developed a pellet reactor crystallization system which was used in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater in the chemical metal processing and electroplating industries in 1987 the first nickel recovery plant in the field of heavy metal recovery was put into operation the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor was 0 6 m the reactor system had a compact structure and featured relatively low investment cost stable crystallization process and easy operation 110 wilms et al used a fluidized bed reactor to crystallize nickel carbonate to recover nickel from the waste plating solution the nickel concentration in the effluent was less than 0 5 mg l and nickel bicarbonate particles with a diameter of about 1 mm were obtained by dissolving the particles in acid a pure solution of nickel chloride is obtained which shows that the fluidized bed crystallization granulation technology was effective in treating nickel wastewater 111 in the patent of lu et al nickel wastewater was treated by fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization and the nickel containing solution and oxidizing agent were introduced into the reactor and mixed to produce basic nickel oxide particle crystals the obtained processing efficiency and crystal particle purity were high 112 lertratwattana et al used fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization to remove and recover copper from metallurgical industrial wastewater when the copper concentration of the wastewater was 400 mg l in the dual ph operation mode ph 6 8 co3 2 cu2 substances the volume ratio was 1 5 the inlet water flow rate was 0 6 l h the copper removal rate was 92 and the particle recovery rate was 96 3 the characterization of the spherical crystal product confirmed that malachite was the only crystal phase and copper hydroxide precipitation was the main crystal phase composition of malachite 113 there is a patent mentioning a method and equipment for crystallizing copper sulfide a fluidized bed reactor is used to crystallize copper into sulfide to remove copper from sewage and enable the material to be recycled the agent uses calcium sulfide cas or sodium sulfide monohydrate na2s 6h2o and copper sulfide crystals are finally obtained 114 jansen proposed a method to remove zinc from wastewater by crystallization of the corresponding heavy metal carbonate precipitate on the reactor carrier in the cylindrical reactor sand particles are used as the crystallization carrier and the precipitation agent is alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate na2co3 nahco3 k2co3 and khco3 for wastewater with a zinc concentration of 45 mg l the carrier filler height was 2 m the inlet water flow rate was 40 m h and the ph was 7 5 8 the zinc removal rate reached 95 the carbonate particles with a particle size of about 1 3 mm removed by the process had a moisture content of less than 0 5 which was suitable for wastewater treatment in the electroplating process 115 lee et al used a reactor filled with a carrier fluidized bed to remove arsenic from water sodium sulfide solution was used as the precipitant the influent arsenic concentration was 611 mg l the influent flow rate was 0 3 l h the crystallization rate was 93 and the orange crystals discharged from the reactor a mixture of ass and as2s3 had a diameter of 1 3 mm the concentration of arsenic in the effluent was 7 2 mg l and the concentration of arsenic after passing through the ultrafiltration system was 0 5 mg l 116 nielsen et al used a fluidized bed reactor to remove heavy metals in flue gas desulfurization wastewater 117 research has shown that fbc granulation technology can treat several dissolved heavy metals in industrial wastewater and groundwater the concentrations of nickel cadmium and zinc in the influent water were 510 640 and 1900 mg l respectively and the recovery rates reached 99 92 and 97 respectively the density of the dense particles produced by the system was 2 5 3 0 kg l and the water content after artificial dehydration was less than 20 after heavy metal wastewater was treated by fbc granulation technology the removal rate of heavy metal ions was relatively high and the treated wastewater could be discharged in a standardized manner the system did not produce sludge the metal coated particles had a low moisture content compact structure and could easily dissolve in strong acid thus they could be reused in industry according to the reviewed literature it can treat both single metal wastewater and multi metal mixed wastewater therefore the use of fbc granulation technology to remove heavy metals is a good way to recover metals and realize resource utilization 6 2 synthesis of crystalline fbc not only can recover all kinds of elements in wastewater but also has potential for the synthesis of crystals in the bayer process of the aluminum industry bauxite ore is converted into sodium carbonate and sodium oxalate oxalate is a kind of anti nutritional and toxic substance which can cause corrosive damage to human internal tissue 118 moreover it can form a stable complex with metal and pollute groundwater and nearby sewage systems 119 the mineral coagulants commonly used in the water treatment industry are aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride which are used to remove the color and turbidity of water 120 when used the coagulant will partially dissolve and remain in the treated water even if the water contains a small amount of aluminum purifying the water is highly challenging 121 to solve these problems fbc granulation has been applied and achieved good results it can synthesize oxalate crystal and alumina crystal recover barium borate from high concentration boron containing waste water and produce sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride in the work of guevara et al the bottom of the reactor was filled with 0 5 cm glass beads to buffer the influent water 122 the initial concentration of oxalate was 264 mg l when the molar ratio of ca2 c2o4 2 was 1 75 the removal rate was 87 6 the crystallization efficiency was 85 6 and the particle size of the crystal product calcium oxalate monohydrate com cac2o4 h2o was 1 mm lu et al synthesized oxalate crystal by fluidized bed technology 123 when the concentration of oxalate ion in influent was 300 mg l the ph of influent was 6 5 the molar ratio of ca2 c2o4 2 was 1 the reaction time was 110 h and the crystallization efficiency was 94 55 the oxalate crystal particles demonstrated high purity and they could be used in the synthesis of chemical products or wastewater treatment fbc technology has been studied to synthesize aluminum crystals to remove aluminum from waste water 124 carrier addition was not needed and the system involved an influent aluminum ion concentration of 200 mg l and employed sodium hydroxide as reagent when oh al3 molar ratio was 1 5 2 5 upflow velocity was 28 65 m h the total concentration of aluminum in the effluent was 0 5 mg l and the granular product was alumina vilando et al recovered calcium from aqueous solution by using a seedless fluidized bed reactor 125 under the optimal conditions the influent aluminum concentration was 334 1 mg l the molar ratio of oh al3 was 2 5 the aluminum removal rate was 98 8 and the crystallization rate was 96 9 the formed particles had the same lattice parameters as the orthorhombic structure of alumina cho et al studied the synthesis of barium borate homogeneous particles by fbc granulation 126 the crystallization device is shown in fig 21 through the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with boron ion and adding barium ion as coagulant in fluidized bed homogeneous barium perborate particles with water content less than 5 and particle size more than 0 5 mm were produced they presented volume reduction and high purity which were conducive to subsequent recovery and processing two fluidized bed reactors in series were used to pretreat boron containing wastewater with hydrogen peroxide and barium salt solution as precipitant without adding carrier the total removal rate reached about 80 in which the first reactor accounted for 60 and the second reactor accounted for 20 a recent patent was made to study the crystallization of sodium chloride in a fluidized bed 127 the supersaturated solution passed through the distributor at a certain temperature below the fluidized bed and the supersaturated aqueous solution of 0 3 0 5 g l sodium chloride used at 50 c 100 c was preferred finally the spherical sodium chloride crystal with diameter of 3 mm or more was prepared other patents on the use of fbc of sodium bicarbonate have been filed 128 the traditional process is time consuming and expensive and the product is an irregular fine powder in the fluidized bed process sodium bicarbonate particles in the form of egg or spherical particles can be obtained the average particle size of sodium bicarbonate crystal is 0 25 1 mm when the temperature is controlled at 60 c the average particle size of coarse sodium bicarbonate is 0 92 mm the above literature reported that fbc granulation technology can also be used in the synthesis of crystals and it is also widely used in the treatment of modern industrial wastewater the crystallized particles have good shape and high utilization value which can effectively solve environmental problems and provide recycling resources for the industry greatly reducing economic costs it is a feasible recycling water treatment process 7 conclusions and future outlook this review introduced the development background operation process and industrial application of fbc in the field of water treatment after summarizing the working characteristics of four different types of reactors the applications of fbc in softening water removing and recovering fluoride and phosphate and synthesizing industrial crystallization were introduced although most of the data in the current study are in the experimental stage fbc has been applied in areas with a relatively deep development foundation such as the netherlands and taiwan this work fully demonstrated the feasibility and development of the industrial application of fbc granulation our comprehensive data can help scholars with further research although fbc has obtained encouraging results in previous studies more research is needed to solve some gaps and related problems in the literature the future direction was summarized as follow 1 this technology is the most widely used in water softening fluorine phosphorus and heavy metals have begun to be used in a small range and are in the expansion stage applications should be developed in new areas 2 regarding reactor design and operational modifications the most widely used structure is the amsterdam reactor the operation mode of adding a carrier and forming a heterogeneous nucleus is the most common 3 the influence of the method of dispensing is more prominent although the crystallization and granulation processes have been improved by adding multiple inlets the structure of the reactor has been changed and the difficulty of system piping design has been increased further research may be necessary in the future 4 in the whole process of crystallization and granulation spontaneous homogeneous crystallization and turbidity of the particles are inevitable although many researchers have alleviated the agglomeration phenomenon by changing the types of carriers and solution systems improving agents and adding dispersants they still need continuous improvement 5 fbc granulation technology has a wide range of applications and excellent performance but its operating cost in practical applications is related to the amount of medicament used and the amount of water treated by balancing benefits and performance making the processing process have added value and low cost is a problem that must be considered in the practical application of fbc transformation from the beginning of its application to the present research on this technology remains popular in recent years people s interest in this subject has increased possibly because fbc can be fully utilized in water treatment overall fbc has the effect of improved process performance and low cost of various water treatments if properly treated fbc can not only solve the actual discharge problem but also realize the application of water resources therefore the large scale research of fbc has huge development space and application prospects declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13206,this study assesses the potential of constructed wetland systems to treat tannery effluent te and mixed industry effluent mie after each of the three influent cells acting as settling cells three treatment cells in horizontal series along with a control were applied each of the cells was subjected to horizontal surface flow and planted with hemarthria compressa l f r br perennial whip grass the percent decline in heavy metal concentrations between settling and cell 3 over a period of 60 days varied as follows zinc zn 35 83 95 59 chromium cr 30 63 95 49 copper cu 24 3 97 05 and nickel ni 20 3 93 2 the drop in chemical oxygen demand cod mg l 1 ranged between 3 95 and 72 14 whilst the total dissolved solids tds g l 1 decline was between 3 23 and 98 75 the ph and electrical conductivity ec drop ranges were between 1 4 and 11 72 along with up to 92 92 respectively the determined decline rates of pollutants and the cumulative biomass yield of h compressa at p 0 05 were between 0 76 and 0 96 20 d 1 the heavy metal tolerance index for h compressa in te and mie were 0 25 3 25 and 0 25 2 2 respectively although treated te and mie discharged from cell 3 of each of the effluent treatment series on the 60th day had zn ni cr and cu concentrations greater than the local permissible limits punjab environmental quality standards of liquid industrial effluents the treated water through the constructed wetland system proved safe for cultivation of okra abelmoscus esculentus l moench vegetables graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biological wastewater processing constructed treatment wetland heavy metal contamination tannery effluent water and food security 1 introduction water resources are under stress because of rapid urbanization population boom as well as agriculture and industrial growth resulting in about 70 of the world s population likely to face medium to severe water shortage unfortunately pakistan has exhausted its water reserves 1 and with a lower precipitation to evaporation rate long droughts and lack of adequate water reservoirs severe water scarcity seems inevitable 2 4 the leather industry represents a significant portion of pakistan s economy its ecological impacts are devastating due to the release of a substantial amount of toxic wastewater carrying both organic and heavy metal pollutants the district kasur is one such example where quite a large number of tanneries are located other significant industries contributing to heavy metal pollution are the electroplating textile and steel industries natural wetlands have been recognized as effective water purifiers for various organic and inorganic pollutants 5 urbanization industrialization and changing trends in agriculture have led to an increase in the pollution load resulting in the degradation of wetlands in the last decade constructed wetland technology has evidently been a viable alternative to established wastewater treatment processes 6 due to its features like low operational and maintenance costs minimal energy usage eco friendly design and simultaneous treatment of various pollutants constructed wetlands are increasingly being applied to municipal industrial and agricultural wastewaters alike 7 vegetation having the adaptation mechanism characteristics for heavy metal accumulation and tolerance are preferred where heavy metal removal is the prime purpose the complex behavior of metals in aqueous systems can include interactions among different phases of the wetland system such as roots sediments biofilms plants soil and water various processes such as adsorption complexation precipitation plant uptake and dissimilatory reactions by the associated microbial community are responsible for causing the reduction in metal concentration 8 9 hemarthria compressa l f r br is a common anchored and emergent hydrophyte mostly found in ponds in the plains of punjab and has been shown to absorb heavy metals efficiently 10 11 in this study the efficiency of h compressa in a pilot plant constructed wetland was observed tannery effluent te was obtained from kasur tannery waste management agency ktwma mixed industrial effluent mie from three industries was taken from a collective drain both waters were treated in a three phase wetland system triplicate series of wetlands planted with h compressa were used to treat the wastewaters the effluent obtained after treatment was used to irrigate the vegetable crop abelmoschus esculentus to assess the risk of any heavy metal uptake the aim of this study was to evaluate if secondary treatment of industrial effluents using wetland systems can reduce metals to below permissible limits both in the effluent and after reuse in agriculture the corresponding objectives were to assess a the use of h compressa in constructed wetland systems to reduce pollution levels in industrial effluents b the tolerance of this plant to heavy metal toxicity and c if the treated effluents can be safely applied for irrigation of crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of effluents the tannery effluent was obtained from lagoons following the primary wastewater treatment in the kasur tannery waste management agency ktwma depalpur road kasur pakistan n 31 05 968 e 074 27 747 and an elevation of 191 m the mixed industrial effluent was collected from a drain at a point where effluents from

lines limited n 31 40 549 e 074 05 559 and an elevation of 202 m at the lahore sheikhupura road 2 2 collection of hemarthria compressa the hydrophyte hemarthria compressa has been observed in polluted ponds in the vicinity of industrial areas with a fast mode of propagation through its runners because of its known ability to uptake heavy metals it was selected as the test plant hemarthria compressa was collected from the heavy metal contaminated ponds along the lahore kasur road these hydrophytes are tolerant to high metal pollution loads young plants sprouting vegetatively from the sides of mature plants were raised within a concrete water reservoir in the botanical garden university of the punjab lahore pakistan 2 3 experimental set up three series of wetlands were constructed in parallel to each other in the botanical garden fiberglass troughs with dimensions of 1 52 m length 0 61 m width and 0 46 m depth were utilized as horizontal flow free surface water wetlands the system configuration is shown in fig 1 alluvial stones obtained from the river jhelum were used as the bedding material within each trough the stones of approximately equal size one cm diameter were filled in each trough up to a height of 0 3 m which acted as a substratum for the anchorage of plants as well as for biofilm formation by microbes a total of nine cells were placed in three series each containing three interconnected cells on concrete platforms a natural hydraulic gradient was established by raising the cells at different heights in each series the first cell was placed at a height of 1 22 m followed by the second at 0 61 m and the third at ground level this height difference was constant for the three series in each fiberglass trough the inlet was kept at a higher position as compared to the outlet the outlets of previous cells were connected with the inlets of the following cells using pvc pipes a handle valve connected with the outlet was used to control the flow of water from one cell to the next three settling tanks were placed at a height of 1 83 m and connected to the first fiberglass trough at a height of 1 22 m through similar pvc pipes having handle valves each series of troughs was connected to a settling water tank placed on a concrete platform to be filled in with the effluent in such a way that the highest trough was connected to the water tank through a pvc pipe having a handle valve the area next to the last cell filled with soil at the ground level was insulated to a depth of 0 76 m with a high quality geomembrane three flower planting beds of 0 61 m2 were prepared below the last cells of the wetlands to grow vegetables or food crops for subsequent risk assessment of heavy metals the flower beds were irrigated with the effluent obtained from the last cell of each wetland series the three experimental series included the control receiving irrigation water tannery effluent te and mixed industrial effluent mie the first series was referred to as series a with cells a1 a2 and a3 for control the second series was named series b with cells b1 b2 and b3 for te and the final series c with cells c1 c2 and c3 for mie wetlands in each trough were established by planting twenty plants of h compressa of roughly equal size and a uniform biomass of 120 g with irrigation water approximately 162 l standing 12 5 cm above the level of stones and left for two months to acclimatize and form a uniform turf of the grass the level of water at 12 5 cm above the substratum was maintained using irrigation water after the turf was fully established and covered the whole surface in the trough the storage tank was filled up with irrigation water in series a tannery effluent in series b and mixed industrial effluent in series c the effluent was allowed to settle within the tank for three days and effluents were allowed to enter the first level for treatment by opening the handle valve connecting the first trough to the tank before this process the water already present in the trough was allowed to drain out a hydraulic retention time of 20 days was allocated to each water sample in each cell with the final treated water released after a total of 60 days the experiment was carried out in batch mode and each batch flow was allowed to be retained within the cell for twenty days with the effluent running through the cell line just once a natural system was maintained where there was water loss through evapotranspiration and incoming water from rainfall during this time whenever the water level receded below a marked level of 12 5 cm above the stones it was compensated for by distilled water to maintain its height within the trough effluent samples were collected in triplicates for analyses at the completion of the hrt after completion of water treatment for sixty days twenty days in each cell the effluents from the wetlands were used to irrigate abelmoschus esculentus certified seeds of a esculentus l moench var sabzpari were sown with 10 seeds per flower bed prepared in soil near the final effluent outlet ten days prior to completion of water treatment in the wetlands after about 5 or 6 days of germination the final treated effluent was intermittently applied for irrigation purposes 2 4 operational conditions the experiment was performed during mid november 2019 and mid january 2020 while a

wetland the volume of water l day 1 at the inlet and outlet of each cell was monitored based on reading of the analogue mechanical flow meters installed at the outlet of each cell and by using a water reservoir for collecting and measuring water at the outlet of each cell the observed values were computed to determine the mass balance for water moving in the cells of the constructed wetland 2 7 physico chemical analysis the ph ec tds and cod parameters were determined for wastewater samples before and after treatment at intervals of 20 days a microprocessor ph ec tds nacl meter hi 9835 hanna was used to determine the above mentioned parameters while the cod of the effluent samples was determined using the titrimetric methodology published by greenberg et al 10 the wastewater samples were acid digested with a digestion mixture of nitric acid and perchloric acid at a ratio of 1 4 10 the heavy metal estimation was done with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer gbc savant aa australia guidance for instrument setting calibration and element assays as specified in the corresponding manual were adhered to by the researchers metal standards were also run together with the unknown samples calibration curves were subsequently drawn to determine unknown heavy metal concentrations in effluent plant and sediment samples for maintenance of quality control certified reference materials with concentrations for zn cr cu and ni were analyzed the recovery rates were higher than 90 plants of hemarthria compressa were randomly sampled for biomass from each trough the plants from the wetland were collected after the wastewater was removed from the outlet nine representative plants were taken randomly from every part of the wetland and placed in groups of three with uniform size the average of each group was taken as one component of the triplicate for statistical analysis the plants were initially dried on blotting paper and then oven dried between 60 and 80 c for 24 h the roots and shoots were separately grounded in an electric crusher and digested by the method published by greenberg et al 10 until they became clear heavy metals were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer see above the sediment samples were digested with perchloric acid nitric acid and hydrochloric acid with 7 5 2 ratio digestion mixture according to maine et al 11 heavy metals were analyzed again by atomic absorption spectrophotometry the evaluation of h compressa for phytoextraction of metals was carried out by calculation of two indicators the tolerance index ti by wilkins 14 and the translocation factor tf by soda 15 plants of a esculentus were sampled randomly in triplicate from each bed after drying on blotting papers and in an oven their dry biomass was determined and then roots shoots leaves fruits and seeds were separately ground and acid digested in the same way as above heavy metals were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer see above 2 8 data analysis data were summarized using mean and standard deviation sd statistics of samples collected three times from a cell an analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the statistical significance p 0 05 among the treatments spss v 22 all illustrations were developed in ms excel ms office 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in physicochemical parameters of effluents after treatment there was a gradual decrease in ph from alkaline to slightly acidic in each cell for all three wetland series table 1 this was accompanied by a decrease in conductivity from 9060 μs cm 1 and 2410 μs cm 1 to less than 1000 μs cm 1 for te and mie respectively this decrease was less apparent for the control as the initial value was low i e 680 μs cm 1 similar to conductivity the tds of te were highest at 4 81 g l 1 followed by 0 73 g l 1 and 0 31 g l 1 for mie and the control respectively after treatment through their respective wetland cells a significant tds removal was observed for te in series b table 1 the different values for mie may be due to comparatively lower initial values and an increase in tds due to either dissolution of compounds from the substrate or nutrient release in water due to decay processes 16 the 70 decrease in cod for both te and mie as seen in table 1 indicated efficient reduction in organic compounds with the highest removal observed in the first b1 and c1 and last b3 and c3 cells enhanced sedimentation 16 due to high biofilm production in the first cell may have caused the increased removal rate the last cell received effluent with a majority of organic contaminants being removed in the preceding cells and bioactivity and uptake by the plant accounts for the highest cod removal in the last cell having passed through the longest retention time of 60 days in the three cells this confirms findings by soda et al 17 the metal content followed the order zn cr cu ni for both te and mie after passing through all wetland system stages zn was removed to the greatest extent 847 and 462 mg l 1 in comparison to the original concentrations of 12 370 mg l 1 and 10 478 mg l 1 for te and mie respectively chromium was also significantly reduced from 9312 to 420 mg l 1 in case of te and from 5900 mg l 1 to 790 mg l 1 in case of mie ni was reduced from 2425 mg l 1 in case of te and 1516 mg l 1 in case of mie to 165 and 252 mg l 1 respectively metals show a variety of characteristics within wetlands some of them are readily absorbed others tended to settle within sediments 3 2 plant growth and tolerance the growth of h compressa at each treatment stage represented by their dry weight is shown in fig 2 during the experiment no metal stress symptoms were observed for all plants accounting for the lack of variability in dry weights obtained from irrigation water and effluent from wetland cells the lack of growth inhibition in plants grown within te and mie 18 along with no metal induced symptoms such as wilting stunted growth or yellowing 19 20 indicates high heavy metal tolerance of h compressa the biomass of plants attained after 60 days of growth was the highest as they were grown in effluents with the least heavy metal concentration due to prior treatment at the first two stages 1 and 2 no substantial differences were observed among the dry weight of plants obtained from three series with the plants in cells a1 a2 and c3 showing maximum growth at the first second and third stages respectively fig 2 this trend was also observed for root lengths of the plants observed while the shoot lengths were the highest for plants grown in mie at c1 c2 and c3 stages table 2 the plants in c3 which were subjected to mie showed the highest biomass development probably due to two reasons firstly because of prior treatment at the first a and second b level of treatment and secondly because it was more enriched with organic matter and metals as compared to the irrigation water the ti provides an estimate of the short term effect of heavy metal toxicity 21 with values greater than or equal to one indicating a high tolerance to metal induced stress 22 the ti calculated for plants at each stage was greater than one showing tolerance to heavy metal toxicity table 2 3 3 root to shoot translocation of heavy metals the translocation factor in case of zn showed maximum root to shoot translocation in plants of the second cell fig 3 the increased initial heavy metal concentration may affect metal uptake by plants due to competition among metal ionic species 23 absorption by roots and other physiological properties 24 causing reduced root to shoot translocation in the second cell the translocation factor of above one for both te and mie indicates hyperaccumulation of zn in h compressa 25 the translocation factor of cr for the first cell was 1 4 for both effluents indicating hyperaccumulation further stages showed low to negligible cr content within shoots while consistently high cr load within the roots was observed fig 3 increased root accumulation has also been noted in previous studies 26 and is caused by immobilization of cr in root cell vacuoles which creates less toxic conditions 27 high translocation factors observed in all stages fig 3 for cu in te indicated phytoextraction as the main pathway for cu removal the reduction of ph along each stage can also increase cu ion mobility as observed in previous studies 28 the translocation factors of cu in hemarthria compressa were the highest for both te and mie among all metals observed fig 3 furthermore negligible translocation and excessive root accumulation in case of ni fig 3 indicates rhizo filtration where root exudates in the rhizosphere cause metal settling on root surfaces 27 3 4 heavy metal analyses and dynamics within wetland systems 3 4 1 dynamics of zinc the zinc concentration was the highest followed by those of cr cu and finally ni in both effluents comparison of influent metal concentration and effluent released from the third stage after 60 days showed a high removal rate 95 for all metals within both effluents the first stages b1 and c1 of the constructed wetland system showed zn removal efficiencies of 54 and 59 for te and mie respectively the removal efficiencies increased to 69 and 82 in the second stages b2 and c2 and 95 for both te and mie in the third stages b3 and c3 as observed in figs 3 and 4 the zn concentration reduced from 12 370 mg l 1 and 10 478 mg l 1 to below the detection limits for te and mie respectively in view of the mass balance ratio the zn removal pattern was gradual from both types of wastewater and increased over time figs 4 and 5 however a lesser amount of metal was absorbed in the first two levels of the wetland systems compared to the third level the settlement in sediments increased over time in case of te and was the highest in second levels concerning mie the zn accumulation in h compressa was the highest in plants growing in the first cell with gradual reduction in further stages for both te and mie the plants in the third cell showed lesser metal accumulation probably due to metal dilution in plants because of a greater biomass volume 19 3 4 2 dynamics of chromium after zn cr was the most abundant metal i e 9312 mg l 1 and 5900 mg l 1 in both te and mie in that order this metal showed a peculiar behavior because most of its removal occurred in the first level of the wetland cells for both te 59 and mie 38 figs 3 and 4 increased sedimentation can also account for up to 80 of cr removal sedimentation within the influent would be highest for the first stage magnifying removal efficiency at the first stage 29 the mass balance of cr indicated the highest load in plant biomass and the least in sediments indicating a good tolerance and uptake of this metal by h compressa particularly in the first level of the wetland system 29 unlike other metals the highest proportion of cr was removed by plants and not by sedimentation fig 4 3 4 3 dynamics of copper the influent concentration of cu was 3929 mgl 1 and 2713 mgl 1 for te and mie respectively and after the first stage corresponding 36 and 56 cu were removed diminishing removal rates were linked to the second stage figs 3 and 4 similar to cu also exaggerated cu removal for the first stage was observed cr uptake has been observed to correlate with increased cu concentration 30 due to the reduction of cu content to 1817 mg l 1 and 776 mg l 1 for te and mie at the second stage correspondingly the third stage showed 83 and 61 cu removal respectively the final metal concentrations for both effluents were close to the detection limit the mass balance of cu indicated deposition within sediments over time with more uptake by plants at later stages within the wetland in case of mixed industrial effluent a higher uptake by plants was observed as compared to the tannery effluents 3 4 4 dynamics of nickel the initial ni concentrations were 2425 mg l 1 and 1516 mg l 1 for te and mie correspondingly and showed a gradual increase in removal from the first to the third stage nickel removal increased from 43 to 84 fig 3 and 20 to 86 fig 4 from the first to the last treatment stage for te and mie respectively with the final effluent having 100 mg l 1 concentration high metal accumulation ranging from 346 to 744 mg kg 1 was observed in plant roots the mass balance of ni indicated very little accumulation in sediments comparable to cr figs 5 and 6 a good accumulation of ni was observed by h compressa in case of te but quite poorly in case of mie 3 5 reuse of treated effluents to irrigate abelmoschus esculentus a esculentus pods are often eaten raw pickled cooked or included in salads this plant may be used particularly in developing countries to mitigate malnutrition and support food security therefore a successful reuse of treated effluents in terms of a good yield of uncontaminated pots would be promising to determine the efficiency of the three stage wetland system the final effluent was used to irrigate the crop a esculentus for a risk assessment of heavy metal impact detections up to seed level of fruits were performed a esculentus irrigated with te treated effluent showed hyperaccumulation tendencies for zn cu and cr within shoots and even in leaves for cr as shown in fig 7 nickel accumulated very well within roots plants irrigated with mie treated effluent showed high heavy metal accumulation within roots for cr ni and cu fig 7 however zn removal was an exception with higher accumulation within the shoots instead of roots like other metals only cu and cr accumulated within the fruits for both te and mie but their concentrations were within who permissible limits for metal accumulation within vegetables 31 the metal accumulation pathways for a esculentus changed with the type of effluent regardless of similar metal concentration this highlights the variation due to physicochemical characteristics and the competition between metal ions which determines the major metal removal behavior of plants 3 6 mass balance for water in three sequential cells of constructed wetlands owing to the continuous drop in ambient air temperature the values of both eto and etc decreased over the course of the experiment as shown in fig 8 the drop in ambient air temperature was mainly driven by the decrease in solar radiation falling on the surface as well as by increases in relative humidity and vapor pressure ultimately there was a drop in both evapotranspiration and evaporation loss from the open treatment pan being dependent on the climatic factors the mass balance dynamics of water in three sequential treatment cells varied in the form of a decrease in volume of water from the initial cell to the final cell of treatment as given in fig 9 after 60 days of treatment 40 7 l of treated water was obtained for the irrigation of vegetable crops compared to the initially 227 l of the untreated wastewater introduced to the constructed wetland system 4 conclusions the use of aquatic hyperaccumulating plants like h compressa in constructed wetland systems can reduce pollution levels in industrial effluents and thus act as sinks for toxic metals hemarthria compressa exhibited tolerance to heavy metal toxicity having a tolerance index of above one with no apparent metal induced stress symptoms for zn cr cu and ni for both te and mie the final treated effluents when applied for irrigation of crops showed limited translocation to fruits making them safe for human consumption supporting food security particularly in developing countries subjected to draughts and overpopulation therefore secondary treatment of effluents using a wetland as proposed in this study can reduce the pollution load and especially metals to permissible limits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

13206,this study assesses the potential of constructed wetland systems to treat tannery effluent te and mixed industry effluent mie after each of the three influent cells acting as settling cells three treatment cells in horizontal series along with a control were applied each of the cells was subjected to horizontal surface flow and planted with hemarthria compressa l f r br perennial whip grass the percent decline in heavy metal concentrations between settling and cell 3 over a period of 60 days varied as follows zinc zn 35 83 95 59 chromium cr 30 63 95 49 copper cu 24 3 97 05 and nickel ni 20 3 93 2 the drop in chemical oxygen demand cod mg l 1 ranged between 3 95 and 72 14 whilst the total dissolved solids tds g l 1 decline was between 3 23 and 98 75 the ph and electrical conductivity ec drop ranges were between 1 4 and 11 72 along with up to 92 92 respectively the determined decline rates of pollutants and the cumulative biomass yield of h compressa at p 0 05 were between 0 76 and 0 96 20 d 1 the heavy metal tolerance index for h compressa in te and mie were 0 25 3 25 and 0 25 2 2 respectively although treated te and mie discharged from cell 3 of each of the effluent treatment series on the 60th day had zn ni cr and cu concentrations greater than the local permissible limits punjab environmental quality standards of liquid industrial effluents the treated water through the constructed wetland system proved safe for cultivation of okra abelmoscus esculentus l moench vegetables graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biological wastewater processing constructed treatment wetland heavy metal contamination tannery effluent water and food security 1 introduction water resources are under stress because of rapid urbanization population boom as well as agriculture and industrial growth resulting in about 70 of the world s population likely to face medium to severe water shortage unfortunately pakistan has exhausted its water reserves 1 and with a lower precipitation to evaporation rate long droughts and lack of adequate water reservoirs severe water scarcity seems inevitable 2 4 the leather industry represents a significant portion of pakistan s economy its ecological impacts are devastating due to the release of a substantial amount of toxic wastewater carrying both organic and heavy metal pollutants the district kasur is one such example where quite a large number of tanneries are located other significant industries contributing to heavy metal pollution are the electroplating textile and steel industries natural wetlands have been recognized as effective water purifiers for various organic and inorganic pollutants 5 urbanization industrialization and changing trends in agriculture have led to an increase in the pollution load resulting in the degradation of wetlands in the last decade constructed wetland technology has evidently been a viable alternative to established wastewater treatment processes 6 due to its features like low operational and maintenance costs minimal energy usage eco friendly design and simultaneous treatment of various pollutants constructed wetlands are increasingly being applied to municipal industrial and agricultural wastewaters alike 7 vegetation having the adaptation mechanism characteristics for heavy metal accumulation and tolerance are preferred where heavy metal removal is the prime purpose the complex behavior of metals in aqueous systems can include interactions among different phases of the wetland system such as roots sediments biofilms plants soil and water various processes such as adsorption complexation precipitation plant uptake and dissimilatory reactions by the associated microbial community are responsible for causing the reduction in metal concentration 8 9 hemarthria compressa l f r br is a common anchored and emergent hydrophyte mostly found in ponds in the plains of punjab and has been shown to absorb heavy metals efficiently 10 11 in this study the efficiency of h compressa in a pilot plant constructed wetland was observed tannery effluent te was obtained from kasur tannery waste management agency ktwma mixed industrial effluent mie from three industries was taken from a collective drain both waters were treated in a three phase wetland system triplicate series of wetlands planted with h compressa were used to treat the wastewaters the effluent obtained after treatment was used to irrigate the vegetable crop abelmoschus esculentus to assess the risk of any heavy metal uptake the aim of this study was to evaluate if secondary treatment of industrial effluents using wetland systems can reduce metals to below permissible limits both in the effluent and after reuse in agriculture the corresponding objectives were to assess a the use of h compressa in constructed wetland systems to reduce pollution levels in industrial effluents b the tolerance of this plant to heavy metal toxicity and c if the treated effluents can be safely applied for irrigation of crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of effluents the tannery effluent was obtained from lagoons following the primary wastewater treatment in the kasur tannery waste management agency ktwma depalpur road kasur pakistan n 31 05 968 e 074 27 747 and an elevation of 191 m the mixed industrial effluent was collected from a drain at a point where effluents from three industries were being mixed east pakistan chrome tannery n 31 40 404 e 074 06 249 and an elevation of 226 m a j match industries n 31 40 483 e 074 06 249 and an elevation of 206 m and steel lines limited n 31 40 549 e 074 05 559 and an elevation of 202 m at the lahore sheikhupura road 2 2 collection of hemarthria compressa the hydrophyte hemarthria compressa has been observed in polluted ponds in the vicinity of industrial areas with a fast mode of propagation through its runners because of its known ability to uptake heavy metals it was selected as the test plant hemarthria compressa was collected from the heavy metal contaminated ponds along the lahore kasur road these hydrophytes are tolerant to high metal pollution loads young plants sprouting vegetatively from the sides of mature plants were raised within a concrete water reservoir in the botanical garden university of the punjab lahore pakistan 2 3 experimental set up three series of wetlands were constructed in parallel to each other in the botanical garden fiberglass troughs with dimensions of 1 52 m length 0 61 m width and 0 46 m depth were utilized as horizontal flow free surface water wetlands the system configuration is shown in fig 1 alluvial stones obtained from the river jhelum were used as the bedding material within each trough the stones of approximately equal size one cm diameter were filled in each trough up to a height of 0 3 m which acted as a substratum for the anchorage of plants as well as for biofilm formation by microbes a total of nine cells were placed in three series each containing three interconnected cells on concrete platforms a natural hydraulic gradient was established by raising the cells at different heights in each series the first cell was placed at a height of 1 22 m followed by the second at 0 61 m and the third at ground level this height difference was constant for the three series in each fiberglass trough the inlet was kept at a higher position as compared to the outlet the outlets of previous cells were connected with the inlets of the following cells using pvc pipes a handle valve connected with the outlet was used to control the flow of water from one cell to the next three settling tanks were placed at a height of 1 83 m and connected to the first fiberglass trough at a height of 1 22 m through similar pvc pipes having handle valves each series of troughs was connected to a settling water tank placed on a concrete platform to be filled in with the effluent in such a way that the highest trough was connected to the water tank through a pvc pipe having a handle valve the area next to the last cell filled with soil at the ground level was insulated to a depth of 0 76 m with a high quality geomembrane three flower planting beds of 0 61 m2 were prepared below the last cells of the wetlands to grow vegetables or food crops for subsequent risk assessment of heavy metals the flower beds were irrigated with the effluent obtained from the last cell of each wetland series the three experimental series included the control receiving irrigation water tannery effluent te and mixed industrial effluent mie the first series was referred to as series a with cells a1 a2 and a3 for control the second series was named series b with cells b1 b2 and b3 for te and the final series c with cells c1 c2 and c3 for mie wetlands in each trough were established by planting twenty plants of h compressa of roughly equal size and a uniform biomass of 120 g with irrigation water approximately 162 l standing 12 5 cm above the level of stones and left for two months to acclimatize and form a uniform turf of the grass the level of water at 12 5 cm above the substratum was maintained using irrigation water after the turf was fully established and covered the whole surface in the trough the storage tank was filled up with irrigation water in series a tannery effluent in series b and mixed industrial effluent in series c the effluent was allowed to settle within the tank for three days and effluents were allowed to enter the first level for treatment by opening the handle valve connecting the first trough to the tank before this process the water already present in the trough was allowed to drain out a hydraulic retention time of 20 days was allocated to each water sample in each cell with the final treated water released after a total of 60 days the experiment was carried out in batch mode and each batch flow was allowed to be retained within the cell for twenty days with the effluent running through the cell line just once a natural system was maintained where there was water loss through evapotranspiration and incoming water from rainfall during this time whenever the water level receded below a marked level of 12 5 cm above the stones it was compensated for by distilled water to maintain its height within the trough effluent samples were collected in triplicates for analyses at the completion of the hrt after completion of water treatment for sixty days twenty days in each cell the effluents from the wetlands were used to irrigate abelmoschus esculentus certified seeds of a esculentus l moench var sabzpari were sown with 10 seeds per flower bed prepared in soil near the final effluent outlet ten days prior to completion of water treatment in the wetlands after about 5 or 6 days of germination the final treated effluent was intermittently applied for irrigation purposes 2 4 operational conditions the experiment was performed during mid november 2019 and mid january 2020 while a the permanent set up installed in the botanical garden of the university of the punjab in lahore pakistan latitude 31o49 81 50 n longitude 74 29 91 56 e elevation above sea level 214 m at the experimental site the average daily temperature range minimum maximum was between 20 7 21 6 c and 17 8 18 8 c over a period of 60 days the average daily ranges of other climatic factors were as

throughout the experiment there was no episode of precipitation the climatic conditions were recorded with a wireless weather station digitech touch screen wireless weather station with usb pc link xc0348 installed near the experimental site the collected data were compared with the data collected from the weather radar of the met station jail road shadman lahore pakistan the solar radiation energy insolation was measured with a hand held digital solar power meter pyranometer solar power meter 2 5 determination of reference evapotranspiration eto and evapotranspiration etc for h compressa the values of eto mm day 1 and etc mm day 1 were calculated on daily basis by using the penman monteith method as outlined by allen et al 12 in the fao 56 manual for determination of eto eq 1 was used

wetland the volume of water l day 1 at the inlet and outlet of each cell was monitored based on reading of the analogue mechanical flow meters installed at the outlet of each cell and by using a water reservoir for collecting and measuring water at the outlet of each cell the observed values were computed to determine the mass balance for water moving in the cells of the constructed wetland 2 7 physico chemical analysis the ph ec tds and cod parameters were determined for wastewater samples before and after treatment at intervals of 20 days a microprocessor ph ec tds nacl meter hi 9835 hanna was used to determine the above mentioned parameters while the cod of the effluent samples was determined using the titrimetric methodology published by greenberg et al 10 the wastewater samples were acid digested with a digestion mixture of nitric acid and perchloric acid at a ratio of 1 4 10 the heavy metal estimation was done with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer gbc savant aa australia guidance for instrument setting calibration and element assays as specified in the corresponding manual were adhered to by the researchers metal standards were also run together with the unknown samples calibration curves were subsequently drawn to determine unknown heavy metal concentrations in effluent plant and sediment samples for maintenance of quality control certified reference materials with concentrations for zn cr cu and ni were analyzed the recovery rates were higher than 90 plants of hemarthria compressa were randomly sampled for biomass from each trough the plants from the wetland were collected after the wastewater was removed from the outlet nine representative plants were taken randomly from every part of the wetland and placed in groups of three with uniform size the average of each group was taken as one component of the triplicate for statistical analysis the plants were initially dried on blotting paper and then oven dried between 60 and 80 c for 24 h the roots and shoots were separately grounded in an electric crusher and digested by the method published by greenberg et al 10 until they became clear heavy metals were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer see above the sediment samples were digested with perchloric acid nitric acid and hydrochloric acid with 7 5 2 ratio digestion mixture according to maine et al 11 heavy metals were analyzed again by atomic absorption spectrophotometry the evaluation of h compressa for phytoextraction of metals was carried out by calculation of two indicators the tolerance index ti by wilkins 14 and the translocation factor tf by soda 15 plants of a esculentus were sampled randomly in triplicate from each bed after drying on blotting papers and in an oven their dry biomass was determined and then roots shoots leaves fruits and seeds were separately ground and acid digested in the same way as above heavy metals were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer see above 2 8 data analysis data were summarized using mean and standard deviation sd statistics of samples collected three times from a cell an analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the statistical significance p 0 05 among the treatments spss v 22 all illustrations were developed in ms excel ms office 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in physicochemical parameters of effluents after treatment there was a gradual decrease in ph from alkaline to slightly acidic in each cell for all three wetland series table 1 this was accompanied by a decrease in conductivity from 9060 μs cm 1 and 2410 μs cm 1 to less than 1000 μs cm 1 for te and mie respectively this decrease was less apparent for the control as the initial value was low i e 680 μs cm 1 similar to conductivity the tds of te were highest at 4 81 g l 1 followed by 0 73 g l 1 and 0 31 g l 1 for mie and the control respectively after treatment through their respective wetland cells a significant tds removal was observed for te in series b table 1 the different values for mie may be due to comparatively lower initial values and an increase in tds due to either dissolution of compounds from the substrate or nutrient release in water due to decay processes 16 the 70 decrease in cod for both te and mie as seen in table 1 indicated efficient reduction in organic compounds with the highest removal observed in the first b1 and c1 and last b3 and c3 cells enhanced sedimentation 16 due to high biofilm production in the first cell may have caused the increased removal rate the last cell received effluent with a majority of organic contaminants being removed in the preceding cells and bioactivity and uptake by the plant accounts for the highest cod removal in the last cell having passed through the longest retention time of 60 days in the three cells this confirms findings by soda et al 17 the metal content followed the order zn cr cu ni for both te and mie after passing through all wetland system stages zn was removed to the greatest extent 847 and 462 mg l 1 in comparison to the original concentrations of 12 370 mg l 1 and 10 478 mg l 1 for te and mie respectively chromium was also significantly reduced from 9312 to 420 mg l 1 in case of te and from 5900 mg l 1 to 790 mg l 1 in case of mie ni was reduced from 2425 mg l 1 in case of te and 1516 mg l 1 in case of mie to 165 and 252 mg l 1 respectively metals show a variety of characteristics within wetlands some of them are readily absorbed others tended to settle within sediments 3 2 plant growth and tolerance the growth of h compressa at each treatment stage represented by their dry weight is shown in fig 2 during the experiment no metal stress symptoms were observed for all plants accounting for the lack of variability in dry weights obtained from irrigation water and effluent from wetland cells the lack of growth inhibition in plants grown within te and mie 18 along with no metal induced symptoms such as wilting stunted growth or yellowing 19 20 indicates high heavy metal tolerance of h compressa the biomass of plants attained after 60 days of growth was the highest as they were grown in effluents with the least heavy metal concentration due to prior treatment at the first two stages 1 and 2 no substantial differences were observed among the dry weight of plants obtained from three series with the plants in cells a1 a2 and c3 showing maximum growth at the first second and third stages respectively fig 2 this trend was also observed for root lengths of the plants observed while the shoot lengths were the highest for plants grown in mie at c1 c2 and c3 stages table 2 the plants in c3 which were subjected to mie showed the highest biomass development probably due to two reasons firstly because of prior treatment at the first a and second b level of treatment and secondly because it was more enriched with organic matter and metals as compared to the irrigation water the ti provides an estimate of the short term effect of heavy metal toxicity 21 with values greater than or equal to one indicating a high tolerance to metal induced stress 22 the ti calculated for plants at each stage was greater than one showing tolerance to heavy metal toxicity table 2 3 3 root to shoot translocation of heavy metals the translocation factor in case of zn showed maximum root to shoot translocation in plants of the second cell fig 3 the increased initial heavy metal concentration may affect metal uptake by plants due to competition among metal ionic species 23 absorption by roots and other physiological properties 24 causing reduced root to shoot translocation in the second cell the translocation factor of above one for both te and mie indicates hyperaccumulation of zn in h compressa 25 the translocation factor of cr for the first cell was 1 4 for both effluents indicating hyperaccumulation further stages showed low to negligible cr content within shoots while consistently high cr load within the roots was observed fig 3 increased root accumulation has also been noted in previous studies 26 and is caused by immobilization of cr in root cell vacuoles which creates less toxic conditions 27 high translocation factors observed in all stages fig 3 for cu in te indicated phytoextraction as the main pathway for cu removal the reduction of ph along each stage can also increase cu ion mobility as observed in previous studies 28 the translocation factors of cu in hemarthria compressa were the highest for both te and mie among all metals observed fig 3 furthermore negligible translocation and excessive root accumulation in case of ni fig 3 indicates rhizo filtration where root exudates in the rhizosphere cause metal settling on root surfaces 27 3 4 heavy metal analyses and dynamics within wetland systems 3 4 1 dynamics of zinc the zinc concentration was the highest followed by those of cr cu and finally ni in both effluents comparison of influent metal concentration and effluent released from the third stage after 60 days showed a high removal rate 95 for all metals within both effluents the first stages b1 and c1 of the constructed wetland system showed zn removal efficiencies of 54 and 59 for te and mie respectively the removal efficiencies increased to 69 and 82 in the second stages b2 and c2 and 95 for both te and mie in the third stages b3 and c3 as observed in figs 3 and 4 the zn concentration reduced from 12 370 mg l 1 and 10 478 mg l 1 to below the detection limits for te and mie respectively in view of the mass balance ratio the zn removal pattern was gradual from both types of wastewater and increased over time figs 4 and 5 however a lesser amount of metal was absorbed in the first two levels of the wetland systems compared to the third level the settlement in sediments increased over time in case of te and was the highest in second levels concerning mie the zn accumulation in h compressa was the highest in plants growing in

were 2425 mg l 1 and 1516 mg l 1 for te and mie correspondingly and showed a gradual increase in removal from the first to the third stage nickel removal increased from 43 to 84 fig 3 and 20 to 86 fig 4 from the first to the last treatment stage for te and mie respectively with the final effluent having 100 mg l 1 concentration high metal accumulation ranging from 346 to 744 mg kg 1 was observed in plant roots the mass balance of ni indicated very little accumulation in sediments comparable to cr figs 5 and 6 a good accumulation of ni was observed by h compressa in case of te but quite poorly in case of mie 3 5 reuse of treated effluents to irrigate abelmoschus esculentus a esculentus pods are often eaten raw pickled cooked or included in salads this plant may be used particularly in

decrease in solar radiation falling on the surface as well as by increases in relative humidity and vapor pressure ultimately there was a drop in both evapotranspiration and evaporation loss from the open treatment pan being dependent on the climatic factors the mass balance dynamics of water in three sequential treatment cells varied in the form of a decrease in volume of water from the initial cell to the final cell of treatment as given in fig 9 after 60 days of treatment 40 7 l of treated water was obtained for the irrigation of vegetable crops compared to the initially 227 l of the untreated wastewater introduced to the constructed wetland system 4 conclusions the use of aquatic hyperaccumulating plants like h compressa in constructed wetland systems can reduce pollution levels in industrial effluents and thus act as sinks for toxic metals hemarthria compressa exhibited tolerance to heavy metal toxicity having a tolerance index of above one with no apparent metal induced stress symptoms for zn cr cu and ni for both te and mie the final treated effluents when applied for irrigation of crops showed limited translocation to fruits making them safe for human consumption supporting food security particularly in developing countries subjected to draughts and overpopulation therefore secondary treatment of effluents using a wetland as proposed in this study can reduce

13207,phosphorus p recovery in source separated decentralised wastewater treatment processes is an eco efficient strategy in accordance with a circular economy perspective struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o capture allows a reduction of p discharged to surface waters and generates a product known for its slow release fertiliser properties however the cost and availability of current commercial mg2 sources hinder the downstream transfer of struvite precipitation although some alternative sources are available there is a lack of information on how they compare to conventional sources it is also not known how the mg po4 ratio affects process performance or fertiliser product suitability therefore this research evaluated the performance of two alternative sources seasalt and seawater bittern at different mg po4 ratios the results indicate that seasalt may be a problematic option owing to its high levels of nacl regardless of the mg po4 level which could affect soil fertility bittern meanwhile showed a high yield at ph 8 5 and mg po4 1 2 1 achieving 99 recovery of po4 and increasing also the recovery yield from 60 using conventional sources to 82 at mg po4 1 2 in addition bittern showed larger x type crystals than commercial sources the precipitate is composed mainly of struvite and newberyite mghpo4 3h2o with traces of k and no presence of nacl at mg po4 1 2 1 while at mg po4 1 2 it forms a mixture of struvite with presence of ca and k phosphates in conclusion bittern is an effective raw material to improve the downstream transfer of struvite precipitation into urine

keywords p recovery struvite precipitation bittern seasalt fertiliser applicability 1 introduction urine represents only 1 of municipal wastewaters yet it is responsible for 75 and 45 of total nitrogen n and phosphorous p discharged into surface waters 1 therefore upstream recovery of phosphates hereby referred to as po4 and nitrogen using source separating devices such as urine diverting toilets udt is a radical innovation towards new sanitation systems targeting nutrient recovery 2 p conservation and recovery has been the subject of several policy papers in recent decades because of the non renewable nature and geopolitical risks of mining facilities 3 moreover nitrogen discharge by wastewater treatment plants is an increasing concern partly because denitrification processes targeting n removal from water simply become a water to air trade off contamination both n and p are well known triggers of water eutrophication a leading freshwater quality problem highlighted by recent water framework directive assessments 4 struvite precipitation is considered an effective way to recover po4 and n from different matrixes including urine 5 struvite precipitation in udt source separated urine allows the production of a multi nutrient slow release fertiliser 6 with decreased cross contamination from faeces 2 however the attractiveness of this process is hindered by the need for an external mg2 source to achieve a 1 1 ratio of mg2 po4 3 hereby represented by mg po4 commercial magnesium reactants mainly magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h2o magnesium sulphate mgso4 7h2o and magnesium oxide mgo are much used but with distinct problems mgcl2 6h2o and mgso4 7h2o are expensive mgo is less expensive but presents a much lower solubility either requiring a longer contact time 5 or an additional solubilisation step 7 struvite precipitation will be viable for downstream applications if alternative mg2 sources are affordable and display useful processual properties furthermore downstream viability of struvite precipitation will also benefit if the fertiliser applicability of the crystals formed 6 is not compromised by the alternative mg2 source used with the objective to find suitable alternative mg2 sources several options were tested and are present in the literature one such possibility was magnesite mgco3 which achieved 92 po4 recovery 8 but still has water solubility problems similar to those of mgo 5 another known alternative is seawater which yields up to 99 recovery for urine with high po4 concentrations 638 mg p l 1 9 and over 90 for urine with lower po4 concentrations 194 mg p l 1 10 however in both cases dilution with seawater was reported to affect the final product quality and possible applications 10 pinatha et al 11 showed that sea salt hereby referred to as seasalt can recover 72 91 of the po4 from urine despite the good results better ones are envisaged because the ph range was too wide skipping possible optimal values in addition a seasalt with a higher mg content could be used bittern a by product of salt production in saltpans that is much less expensive than commercial salts 12 was also tested with promising results 90 recovery was obtained with mg po4 1 1 1 in stored urine 13 over 98 in hydrolysed urine 14 and 99 in industrial wastewaters 12 a straightforward conceptual design of struvite capture systems is required to reap the benefits of lower contamination granted by source separated urine in udt processes the few studies that went beyond the po4 recovery yield were focused on comparing the composition and crystal sizes among alternative mg2 choices but none gave information about critical operating factors or impacts on product quality 14 or when the impact on product quality was addressed it was studied on low p concentrated solutions 100 mg p l 1 instead of urine 15 a direct comparison with information on both yield and crystal properties between alternative and conventional mg2 sources for struvite precipitation in urine is needed to understand if any of the possible options is more suitable to be transferred downstream alternative sources like bittern seasalt or seawater also add ca2 k and other ions alongside mg2 to the solution 16 these added ions justify a reevaluation of the viability of struvite process at mg po4 1 1 not only in how much recovery yield can be increased with the extra cations but also in how the size and composition of the reaction products are affected if alternative mg2 sources can increase p recovery yield at mg po4 1 2 to much higher values compared to conventional mg2 sources while having no known harmful ions or salts in the product composition this may open an alternative path when 100 struvite purity is not a mandatory condition such as a possible combination of ca2 sources used for ph correction 17 with alternative mg2 sources in this study alternative magnesium sources were tested to replace commercial salts and promote downstream struvite precipitation as an option for po4 recovery while forming a product suitable for agricultural fertilisation with this goal in mind two alternative mg2 options seasalt and seawater bittern hereby referred to as bittern were compared with conventional mg2 sources mgcl2 6h2o and mgso4 7h2o seasalt aside from halite nacl has mg2 as one of its main constituents 18 the second mg2 source selected was bittern the remaining solution after nacl precipitation in saltpans which contains high amounts of ions such as ca2 and potassium k the aim was to assess which alternatives were viable at mg po4 1 2 1 a ratio considered as ideal 19 furthermore the effect of the alternative sources studied at mg po4 ratio 1 2 was also considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical grade chemicals kh2po4 nh4cl mgcl2 6h2o and nacl from panreac cacl2 and kcl from chem lab and na2so4 from labkem were used to prepare the synthetic hydrolysed urine solution with concentrations of po4 3 and nh4 closer to the content of a urine solution after hydrolysis of urea to ammonium 19 the ph corrections were made using 1 m naoh solution using analytical grade naoh pellets from panreac the additional mg2 chemical source mgso4 7h2o was from panreac analytical grade commercial seasalt was from nature foods and bittern was courtesy of necton companhia portuguesa de culturas marinhas s a the chemical composition of both materials was identified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a solaar s series aa the results of which are presented in table 1 2 2 crystallization process the optimal experimental conditions were determined in a previous study 19 the mg2 sources conventional and alternative were added to 0 3 dm3 of synthetic hydrolysed urine solution to achieve the intended mg po4 ratios 1 2 1 or 1 2 the procedure included a ph adjustment to 8 5 or 9 0 followed by 30 min of reaction time and 30 min of settling the crystals were then recovered by filtration using quantitative paper with pore size 7 9 μm from filter lab and dried at 50 0 1 c temperature value was chosen to accelerate drying while remaining below the initial degradation temperature defined by sarkar et al 20 and stored for further analysis the filtrate was analysed for phosphate using the vanadomolybdate method according to standard methods 21 using a hitachi u 2000 spectrophotometer all experiments were performed with triplicates and the analysis of variance anova was performed using minitab 19 to determine if the difference between recovery yield values obtained with each mg2 source was statistically significant 2 3 characterisation by sem edx and xrd particle size morphology and chemical analysis were assessed by scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray edx analysis mgso4 7h2o and mgcl2 6h2o analysis was performed with an analytical sem hitachi s2400 with a bruker light element eds detector and for bittern and seasalt an eg sem jeol 7001f with an oxford light element edx detector and electron backscatter diffraction detector was used all samples were coated in a thin film of gold palladium to increase conductivity the images obtained using different apparatus were adjusted to always present the same scale measurements on the sem images were made with imagej software identifying the average length and width of the crystals so different crystal morphologies were taken into account material characterisation was complemented by x ray powder diffraction xrd diffractograms were obtained in a pan analytical

measurements were made by continuous scanning from 7 to 40 with a step size of 0 017 2θ and a time per step of 19 6 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of alternative mg2 sources on po4 recovery yield 3 1 1 mg po ratio 1 2 1 fig 1 shows the effect on the mean po4 recovery yield values using mgcl2 6h2o mgso4 7h2o bittern and seasalt at ph 8 5 and 9 0 with mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 at ph 8 5 all p recoveries were high 99 6 regardless of the mg2 source used but the only statistically significant differences in p recovery yield were the ones between bittern and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 013 and between seasalt and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 011 the higher standard deviation of mgso47h2o results at this ph level made all remaining differences between p recovery yields non statistically significant p 0 050 at ph 9 0 the difference between alternative and commercial mg2 sources was clearer the difference between p recovery yields obtained with bittern and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 000 was statistically significant as was the difference between bittern and mgso47h2o p value 0 008 the differences in p recovery yield between seasalt and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 000 as well as between seasalt and mgso47h2o p value 0 011 are also statistically significant the main conclusions to take from fig 1 is the general tendency for alternative mg2 sources achieving a higher p recovery yield than commercial salts but there is no statistically significant difference between bittern and seasalt regardless of the ph level p value 0 050 regarding the results for bittern po4 recovery was above the 90 value achieved by etter et al 13 using an mg po4 value of 1 1 1 it was also slightly larger than the 96 p recovery obtained by bradford hartke et al 15 using an mg po4 ratio of 1 3 1 in low p concentrations 100 mg p l 1 concerning seasalt the results obtained in this study 99 recovery at 1 2 1 are higher than those recorded by pinatha et al 11 who achieved a recovery yield of 91 at an mg po4 ratio of 1 25 1 using a seasalt with significant compositional differences absence of both k and na from the composition from the one used in this paper if there is no visible significant difference between the p recovery yields when using seasalt and bittern table 1 show an important detail in this discussion there was a difference in mg2 content in each alternative source whereas 1 kg of the seasalt contained 3 76 g of mg2 1 l of bittern contained 80 g of mg2 the major impact of this different ionic concentration was how much of each source must be added to achieve a 1 2 1 mg po4 ratio for 1 l of untreated hydrolysed urine approximately 150 g of seasalt was needed to achieve a 1 2 1 ratio but bittern needed less than 10 ml to achieve the same 99 9 po4 recovery yield this means 1 kg of seasalt can be used to treat 6 l of urine at an mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 whereas 1 l of bittern can treat 100 l of urine under the same conditions obviously this is a highly significant difference for udt design and feasibility 3 1 2 mg po ratio 1 2 fig 2 presents the mean values of recovery yields achieved with each mg2 source tested under suboptimal conditions mg po4 1 2 there was a significant difference p value 0 050 between the performance of commercial magnesium reactants and both bittern and seasalt with commercial salts always granting less than 60 po4 recovery regardless of ph therefore changing to an alternative mg source granted between 15 and 22 greater po4 recovery in comparison with either of the two commercial reactants when an mg po4 ratio of 1 2 was adopted the recovery yield at ph 9 0 was always slightly above that at ph 8 5 this fact is in agreement with studies supporting the idea that struvite crystallization follows the pathway given by reaction 1 and not reaction 2 as previously assumed 22 the ph increase from 8 5 to 9 0 promoted the amount of po4 existing in hpo4 2 form instead of as h2po4 1 mg 2 nh 4 h po 4 2 6 h 2 o mg nh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o h 2 mg 2 nh 4 po 4 3 6 h 2 o mg nh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o when commercial mg2 salts are used and mg po4 is below 1 1 once the amount of mg2 available to interact with po4 3 or hpo4 2 is depleted the reactions to form new magnesium based po4 components stop 22 at this point any further recovery of po4 is obtained with its reaction with ca2 already present in the urine this explains why the p recovery yield for commercial salts reached a maximum value of 59 1 these data confirm mg2 as the limiting reagent for struvite precipitation under these conditions 22 however when bittern or seasalt is used this effect can be partially mitigated because external additional cations such as ca2 and k can continue to react with po4 ions which then explains the increase in yield over 80 the compositional analysis presented ahead in this paper was performed to answer these doubts over this possible effect these results confirm mg po4 1 1 as unviable for commercial reactants 23 however for alternative mg2 sources this result was not so clear the final answer being dependent on the quality of the particles obtained at this mg po4 ratio for this source 3 2 crystal composition and morphology 3 2 1 mg po4 ratio 1 2 1 fig 3 shows the crystal area distribution obtained using commercial salts bittern and seasalt at mg po4 1 2 1 the first tendency observable in fig 3 is how ph 8 5 forms crystals with higher length and width than at ph 9 0 agreeing with the known tendency for crystals to become thinner as ph increases 24 focusing on crystal dimensions at ph 8 5 where larger crystals were formed there was a distinction between the length and width of the crystals obtained using commercial and alternative mg2 sources the two commercial sources mgcl2 6h2o width 10 4 2 4 μm length 55 4 15 2 μm and mgso4 7h2o width 14 3 3 7 μm length 53 5 19 1 μm produced in general smaller and thinner crystals compared to bittern width 21 8 7 6 μm length 60 2 15 4 μm and seasalt width 18 4 9 1 μm length 53 3 18 8 μm between the two alternative mg2 sources bittern not only produces crystals with higher average width and length than those obtained with seasalt it also tends to have a lower number of crystals with smaller dimensions than those obtained with seasalt despite the lack of data in the literature the results were in line with literature reports regarding the interrelation among ph saturation index si and crystal size liu et al 14 showed that bittern produced larger crystals when used in matrixes with lower si than when higher si matrixes were used here the effect was replicated but at two different ph values with larger crystals forming at ph 8 5 than at ph 9 0 the increase in ph led to a higher si promoting crystal formation over crystal growth 25 this increase in nucleation generated more crystals at the cost of their size in terms of width and length the specific difference as to why alternative sources generate larger crystals may be explained using fig 4 for the commercial salts the crystals were more elongated but thinner with the occasional formation of y shaped crystals between commercial salts the crystals obtained with mgso4 7h2o showed a more laminar aspect than those obtained with mgcl2 6h2o which had a smoother appearance seasalt led to a mixture of elongated crystal structures and the formation of agglomerates explaining why it appears to generate larger and thicker crystals than the commercial salts the crystals formed in this study show a morphology that is different from the trapezoidal form obtained by pinatha et al 11 the composition of these agglomerates through xrd and edx analysis is needed because there is no report of such agglomerates in other studies using seasalt as the mg2 source furthermore these agglomerates seem to be the reason for the higher range of crystal dimensions shown in fig 3 when using seasalt the use of bittern leads to x shaped crystals that are generally thicker and larger than when using commercial sources contrasting with the trapezoidal crystals obtained by bradford hartke et al 15 using a solution with lower concentration of p and without the other main ions present in urine that change the solution s ionic strength and thus the si of the solution the presence of high concentrations of ammonium 26 and or high si as was expected from the addition of a complex source such as bittern are commonly reported as promoting the occurrence of x shaped crystals transiting to rod needle like ones as the si decreases 27 and becoming even thinner and smaller as ph increases 28 those x shaped crystals are also known to have poorer pack tightening than the particles obtained with mgcl2 6h2o 26 explaining the size differences the origin of x shaped crystals is well accepted but there is still no agreement about what causes the 2d or 3d growth of crystals that generates this x shape hypotheses such as the collision of independent crystals or oriented aggregation of smaller particles in specific parts of the forming struvite crystal have been suggested but the reason why this happens is yet to be clarified 29 at mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 the xrd and edx results for both commercial magnesium salts replicated what was found elsewhere for mgcl2 6h2o as a mixture of struvite and its storage degradation form newberyite 19 newberyite is a common mineral found with struvite it is usually considered a degradation product of struvite under humid conditions 30 despite the use of a temperature lower than the instability range pointed out by sarkar et al 20 in this study the value chosen might have favoured the production of newberyite as well the newberyite concentration also increases with decreasing ammonium levels 30 which can occur when nh4 is removed with struvite formation and some nh3 is evolved owing to the basic ph 31 figs 5 and 6 present respectively the xrd diffractograms and edx results obtained for seasalt and bittern at a 1 2 1 mg po4 ratio struvite was detected for both bittern and seasalt not only with the presence of mg o and p peaks in edx data but also as confirmed by the specific struvite peaks in the diffractograms the major fraction of po4 recovered was as struvite formed at both ph levels newberyite peaks were more evident when bittern was used with seasalt though at ph 9 0 some peaks appear around 14 and 16 which are usually found in phosphorroesslerite explaining the presence of k in edx this phase is usually highly unstable and easily transforms into newberyite during storage by dehydration 34 because of this it is not easily captured by edx the presence of phosphorroesslerite may mean either that newberyite would be forming if more storage time was given or that its formation preceded the formation of k struvite mgkpo4 6h2o which tends to form at a higher ph 33 justifying why the diffractogram at ph 9 0 had this mineral and the one at ph 8 5 did not there was ca2 detected in edx but in the absence of an identifiable phase in xrd the only assumption is the incorporation of ca2 in the struvite newberyite crystals lattice when ca2 is present in the reaction media it is known to be present alongside struvite crystals according to hao et al 35 it seems to be easier to detect it at ph higher than 8 5 thus explaining its presence at ph 9 0 and not at ph 8 5 a concerning feature of the diffractograms and edx results for seasalt is the high abundance of na and cl identified as halite by xrd this fact proves that the increased size of seasalt crystals in this study were undoubtedly affected by co precipitation of halite over the struvite crystals the presence of nacl in the precipitation product with seasalt may be problematic some plants can tolerate high levels of nacl but salinity is usually a problem for soil fertility 36 nacl also affects the uptake of other macronutrients such as k and ca2 37 for this reason unless a crystal washing step is added to remove part of the halite formed seasalt is not an appropriate mg2 source to recover po4 if struvite is intended for use as a soil fertiliser when bittern was used both halite and phosphorroesslerite seemed absent at either ph level the diffractogram also showed a peak at 38 that is typical of the mineral mg2kh po4 2 15h2o supported by the presence of k in edx results this mineral was mentioned by lahalle et al 33 as being the immediate precursor of k struvite at intermediate ph levels its appearance at ph 8 5 and not at ph 9 0 is in agreement with this idea k struvite is easier to precipitate at higher ph levels 38 decreasing the concentration of mg2kh po4 2 15h2o and the presence of k struvite is hard to confirm because its peaks are masked by regular struvite ones the presence of ca2 at ph 9 0 follows the same tendency found for seasalt 3 2 2 mg po4 ratio 1 2 the distribution of crystals dimensions width and length at mg po4 1 2 conditions is presented in fig 7 it shows that as ph increases from 8 5 to 9 0 the crystals have a tendency to reduce in width and length following what was already visible at mg po4 ratio 1 2 1 the best source when using a mg po4 ratio of 1 2 was clearly bittern at ph 8 5 width of 17 8 4 3 and length of 39 8 9 0 when compared to seasalt width of 17 6 9 6 and length of 47 1 10 3 but mostly with mgcl2 6h2o width of 14 0 4 9 and length of 36 1 8 8 and mgso4 7h2o width of 10 5 4 1 and length of 28 4 8 2 knowing how higher si affects crystal sizes smaller crystals might have been expected for this source based on the complexity of bittern composition however along with si another factor gains relevance for both commercial reactants once the mg2 ions are depleted the evolution of the reaction is severely affected and with it the growth of the crystals is strongly compromised the larger crystals obtained with bittern must be related to the higher quantity of cations available to react with po4 after the mg2 ions are depleted as such crystal growth could continue for longer and it may compensate the nucleation promoted by higher si 39 when mg po4 was set at 1 2 mgso4 7h2o showed the poorest p recovery yield and formed the smallest crystals from the four mg2 sources tested proving this mg2 source to be the least viable at 1 2 mg po4 therefore it was not considered for further analysis fig 8 presents the edx results for mgcl2 6h2o seasalt and bittern at ph 8 5 the level with larger crystals at mg po4 1 2 the edx results show the existence of a main phase composed of mg o and p regardless of crystal morphology with the co existence of k and ca ions in the matrix for mgcl2 6h2o seasalt and bittern the diffractograms for all three mg2 sources at ph 8 5 are presented in fig 9 the precipitates were a mixture of struvite and newberyite mghpo4 3h2o regardless of the mg2 source used apart from newberyite and struvite the diffractograms showed some irregularities at the baseline and some peaks of lesser phases this pattern fit ammonium phosphate hydrates with structure varying among nh4capo4 h2o powder diffraction file no 20 202 nh4cap3o9 3h2o powder diffraction file no 29 109 and an ammonium potassium phosphate with no known specific formula powder diffraction file no 1 925 matching the presence of ca and k in the sample referred to as nh4k ca in the diffractogram powder diffraction files were taken from gates rector and blanton 40 seasalt once again presented high amounts of na and cl elements present in edx confirmed as nacl through xrd analysis in bittern edx and xrd indicate that ca and k phosphates are likely present not as single formed minerals but as phases developing together with the main struvite phase this is probably the reason why these crystals grow more than the ones obtained with commercial magnesium reactants also despite a small amount of na being in the edx unless hidden by the most abundant phases there is no obvious structure of halite nacl the fact that na is present in such a low concentration and other macronutrients k ca mg po4 and nh4 are present in higher concentrations makes crystals produced with bittern at mg po4 1 2 suitable for application in fertiliser the higher quantities of both ca2 and k in edx data of bittern compared to mgcl2 6h2o and seasalt gives one possible explanation to why bittern at 1 2 mg po4 ratio can increase p recovery yield to higher values than when using commercial mg2 sources 4 conclusions two alternative magnesium sources bittern and seasalt were tested against two conventional sources mgcl2 6h2o and mgso4 7h2o in the framework of a udt approach in wastewater treatment systems the study showed that bittern can be a low cost alternative mg source leading to a high p recovery efficiency at both mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 and mg po4 ratio of 1 2 furthermore bittern leads to larger crystals than commercial mg sources with a positive effect on product recovery efficiency the obtained crystals include both struvite and newberyite and no sodium a major advantage when compared with seasalt use because of soil salinisation crystallization at ph 8 5 leads to a product with less newberyite and with a fair amount of k mg2kh po4 2 15h2o which can contribute to a higher value fertiliser value owing to the presence of another macronutrient at mg po4 ratio of 1 2 a similar composition is obtained but as k and ca2 phosphates instead of mg2kh po4 2 15h2o maintaining the multi nutrient characteristics of the crystals in conclusion bittern is a strong option as an mg source for precipitation of udt source separated urine increasing the downstream transferability of the process while generating struvite crystals with fertiliser applicability in addition struvite recovery using low cost magnesium sources will mitigate future runoff thanks to the slow release properties of this natural fertiliser product thus mitigating water contamination pressures besides its performance at mg po4 1 2 opens an explorable path to a simultaneous use of alternative mg2 sources as a main reactant and ca2 sources as a ph correction reactant in systems where pure struvite is not an à priori requirement declaration of competing interest the authors

find suitable alternative mg2 sources several options were tested and are present in the literature one such possibility was magnesite mgco3 which achieved 92 po4 recovery 8 but still has water solubility problems similar to those of mgo 5 another known alternative is seawater which yields up to 99 recovery for urine with high po4 concentrations 638 mg p l 1 9 and over 90 for urine with lower po4 concentrations 194 mg p l 1 10 however in both cases dilution with seawater was reported to affect the final product quality and possible applications 10 pinatha et al 11 showed that sea salt hereby referred to as seasalt can recover 72 91 of the po4 from urine despite the good results better ones are envisaged because the ph range was too wide skipping possible optimal values in addition a seasalt with a higher mg content could be used bittern a by product of salt production in saltpans that is much less expensive than commercial salts 12 was also tested with promising results 90 recovery was obtained with mg po4 1 1 1 in stored urine 13 over 98 in hydrolysed urine 14 and 99 in industrial wastewaters 12 a straightforward conceptual design of struvite capture systems is required to reap the benefits of lower contamination granted by source separated urine in udt processes the few studies that went beyond the po4 recovery yield were focused on comparing the composition and crystal sizes among alternative mg2 choices but none gave information about critical operating factors or impacts on product quality 14 or when the impact on product quality was addressed it was studied on low p concentrated solutions 100 mg p l 1 instead of urine 15 a direct comparison with information on both yield and crystal properties between alternative and conventional mg2 sources for struvite precipitation in urine is needed to understand if any of the possible options is more suitable to be transferred downstream alternative sources like bittern seasalt or seawater also add ca2 k and other ions alongside mg2 to the solution 16 these added ions justify a reevaluation of the viability of struvite process at mg po4 1 1 not only in how much recovery yield can be increased with the extra cations but also in how the size and composition of the reaction products are affected if alternative mg2 sources can increase p recovery yield at mg po4 1 2 to much higher values compared to conventional mg2 sources while having no known harmful ions or salts in the product composition this may open an alternative path when 100 struvite purity is not a mandatory condition such as a possible combination of ca2 sources used for ph correction 17 with alternative mg2 sources in this study alternative magnesium sources were tested to replace commercial salts and promote downstream struvite precipitation as an option for po4 recovery while forming a product suitable for agricultural fertilisation with this goal in mind two alternative mg2 options seasalt and seawater bittern hereby referred to as bittern were compared with conventional mg2 sources mgcl2 6h2o and mgso4 7h2o seasalt aside from halite nacl has mg2 as one of its main constituents 18 the second mg2 source selected was bittern the remaining solution after nacl precipitation in saltpans which contains high amounts of ions such as ca2 and potassium k the aim was to assess which alternatives were viable at mg po4 1 2 1 a ratio considered as ideal 19 furthermore the effect of the alternative sources studied at mg po4 ratio 1 2 was also considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical grade chemicals kh2po4 nh4cl mgcl2 6h2o and nacl from panreac cacl2 and kcl from chem lab and na2so4 from labkem were used to prepare the synthetic hydrolysed urine solution with concentrations of po4 3 and nh4 closer to the content of a urine solution after hydrolysis of urea to ammonium 19 the ph corrections were made using 1 m naoh solution using analytical grade naoh pellets from panreac the additional mg2 chemical source mgso4 7h2o was from panreac analytical grade commercial seasalt was from nature foods and bittern was courtesy of necton companhia portuguesa de culturas marinhas s a the chemical composition of both materials was identified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a solaar s series aa the results of which are presented in table 1 2 2 crystallization process the optimal experimental conditions were determined in a previous study 19 the mg2 sources conventional and alternative were added to 0 3 dm3 of synthetic hydrolysed urine solution to achieve the intended mg po4 ratios 1 2 1 or 1 2 the procedure included a ph adjustment to 8 5 or 9 0 followed by 30 min of reaction time and 30 min of settling the crystals were then recovered by filtration using quantitative paper with pore size 7 9 μm from filter lab and dried at 50 0 1 c temperature value was chosen to accelerate drying while remaining below the initial degradation temperature defined by sarkar et al 20 and stored for further analysis the filtrate was analysed for phosphate using the vanadomolybdate method according to standard methods 21 using a hitachi u 2000 spectrophotometer all experiments were performed with triplicates and the analysis of variance anova was performed using minitab 19 to determine if the difference between recovery yield values obtained with each mg2 source was statistically significant 2 3 characterisation by sem edx and xrd particle size morphology and chemical analysis were assessed by scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray edx analysis mgso4 7h2o and mgcl2 6h2o analysis was performed with an analytical sem hitachi s2400 with a bruker light element eds detector and for bittern and seasalt an eg sem jeol 7001f with an oxford light element edx detector and electron backscatter diffraction detector was used all samples were coated in a thin film of gold palladium to increase conductivity the images obtained using different apparatus were adjusted to always present the same scale measurements on the sem images were made with imagej software identifying the average length and width of the crystals so different crystal morphologies were taken into account material characterisation was complemented by x ray powder diffraction xrd diffractograms were obtained in a pan analytical pw3050 60 pert pro θ 2θ equipped with an x celerator detector and with automatic data acquisition x pert data collector v 2 0 software using a cukα radiation as the incident beam 40 kv 30 ma measurements were made by continuous scanning from 7 to 40 with a step size of 0 017 2θ and a time per step of 19 6 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of alternative mg2 sources on po4 recovery yield 3 1 1 mg po ratio 1 2 1 fig 1 shows the effect on the mean po4 recovery yield values using mgcl2 6h2o mgso4 7h2o bittern and seasalt at ph 8 5 and 9 0 with mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 at ph 8 5 all p recoveries were high 99 6 regardless of the mg2 source used but the only statistically significant differences in p recovery yield were the ones between bittern and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 013 and between seasalt and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 011 the higher standard deviation of mgso47h2o results at this ph level made all remaining differences between p recovery yields non statistically significant p 0 050 at ph 9 0 the difference between alternative and commercial mg2 sources was clearer the difference between p recovery yields obtained with bittern and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 000 was statistically significant as was the difference between bittern and mgso47h2o p value 0 008 the differences in p recovery yield between seasalt and mgcl2 6h2o p value 0 000 as well as between seasalt and mgso47h2o p value 0 011 are also statistically significant the main conclusions to take from fig 1 is the general tendency for alternative mg2 sources achieving a higher p recovery yield than commercial salts but there is no statistically significant difference between bittern and seasalt regardless of the ph level p value 0 050 regarding the results for bittern po4 recovery was above the 90 value achieved by etter et al 13 using an mg po4 value of 1 1 1 it was also slightly larger than the 96 p recovery obtained by bradford hartke et al 15 using an mg po4 ratio of 1 3 1 in low p concentrations 100 mg p l 1 concerning seasalt the results obtained in this study 99 recovery at 1 2 1 are higher than those recorded by pinatha et al 11 who achieved a recovery yield of 91 at an mg po4 ratio of 1 25 1 using a seasalt with significant compositional differences absence of both k and na from the composition from the one used in this paper if there is no visible significant difference between the p recovery yields when using seasalt and bittern table 1 show an important detail in this discussion there was a difference in mg2 content in each alternative source whereas 1 kg of the seasalt contained 3 76 g of mg2 1 l of bittern contained 80 g of mg2 the major impact of this different ionic concentration was how much of each source must be added to achieve a 1 2 1 mg po4 ratio for 1 l of untreated hydrolysed urine approximately 150 g of seasalt was needed to achieve a 1 2 1 ratio but bittern needed less than 10 ml to achieve the same 99 9 po4 recovery yield this means 1 kg of seasalt can be used to treat 6 l of urine at an mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 whereas 1 l of bittern can treat 100 l of urine under the same conditions obviously this is a highly significant difference for udt design and feasibility 3 1 2 mg po ratio 1 2 fig 2 presents the mean values of recovery yields achieved with each mg2 source tested under suboptimal conditions mg po4 1 2 there was a significant difference p value 0 050 between the performance of commercial magnesium reactants and both bittern and seasalt with commercial salts always granting less than 60 po4 recovery regardless of ph therefore changing to an alternative mg source granted between 15 and 22 greater po4 recovery in comparison with either of the two commercial reactants when an mg po4 ratio of 1 2 was adopted the recovery yield at ph 9 0 was always slightly above that at ph 8 5 this fact is in agreement with studies supporting the idea that struvite crystallization follows the pathway given by reaction 1 and not reaction 2 as previously assumed 22 the ph increase from 8 5 to 9 0 promoted the amount of po4 existing in hpo4 2 form instead of as h2po4 1 mg 2 nh 4 h po 4 2 6 h 2 o mg nh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o h 2 mg 2 nh 4 po 4 3 6 h 2 o mg nh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o when commercial mg2 salts are used and mg po4 is below 1 1 once the amount of mg2 available to interact with po4 3 or hpo4 2 is depleted the reactions to form new magnesium based po4 components stop 22 at this point any further recovery of po4 is obtained with its reaction with ca2 already present in the urine this explains why the p recovery yield for commercial salts reached a maximum value of 59 1 these data confirm mg2 as the limiting reagent for struvite precipitation under these conditions 22 however when bittern or seasalt is used this effect can be partially mitigated because external additional cations such as ca2 and k can continue to react with po4 ions which then explains the increase in yield over 80 the compositional analysis presented ahead in this paper was performed to answer these doubts over this possible effect these results confirm mg po4 1 1 as unviable for commercial reactants 23 however for alternative mg2 sources this result was not so clear the final answer being dependent on the quality of the particles obtained at this mg po4 ratio for this source 3 2 crystal composition and morphology 3 2 1 mg po4 ratio 1 2 1 fig 3 shows the crystal area distribution obtained using commercial salts bittern and seasalt at mg po4 1 2 1 the first tendency observable in fig 3 is how ph 8 5 forms crystals with higher length and width than at ph 9 0 agreeing with the known tendency for crystals to become thinner as ph increases 24 focusing on crystal dimensions at ph 8 5 where larger crystals were formed there was a distinction between the length and width of the crystals obtained using commercial and alternative mg2 sources the two commercial sources mgcl2 6h2o width 10 4 2 4 μm length 55 4 15 2 μm and mgso4 7h2o width 14 3 3 7 μm length 53 5 19 1 μm produced in general smaller and thinner crystals compared to bittern width 21 8 7 6 μm length 60 2 15 4 μm and seasalt width 18 4 9 1 μm length 53 3 18 8 μm between the two alternative mg2 sources bittern not only produces crystals with higher average width and length than those obtained with seasalt it also tends to have a lower number of crystals with smaller dimensions than those obtained with seasalt despite the lack of data in the literature the results were in line with literature reports regarding the interrelation among ph saturation index si and crystal size liu et al 14 showed that bittern produced larger crystals when used in matrixes with lower si than when higher si matrixes were used here the effect was replicated but at two different ph values with larger crystals forming at ph 8 5 than at ph 9 0 the increase in ph led to a higher si promoting crystal formation over crystal growth 25 this increase in nucleation generated more crystals at the cost of their size in terms of width and length the specific difference as to why alternative sources generate larger crystals may be explained using fig 4 for the commercial salts the crystals were more elongated but thinner with the occasional formation of y shaped crystals between commercial salts the crystals obtained with mgso4 7h2o showed a more laminar aspect than those obtained with mgcl2 6h2o which had a smoother appearance seasalt led to a mixture of elongated crystal structures and the formation of agglomerates explaining why it appears to generate larger and thicker crystals than the commercial salts the crystals formed in this study show a morphology that is different from the trapezoidal form obtained by pinatha et al 11 the composition of these agglomerates through xrd and edx analysis is needed because there is no report of such agglomerates in other studies using seasalt as the mg2 source furthermore these agglomerates seem to be the reason for the higher range of crystal dimensions shown in fig 3 when using seasalt the use of bittern leads to x shaped crystals that are generally thicker and larger than when using commercial sources contrasting with the trapezoidal crystals obtained by bradford hartke et al 15 using a solution with lower concentration of p and without the other main ions present in urine that change the solution s ionic strength and thus the si of the solution the presence of high concentrations of ammonium 26 and or high si as was expected from the addition of a complex source such as bittern are commonly reported as promoting the occurrence of x shaped crystals transiting to rod needle like ones as the si decreases 27 and becoming even thinner and smaller as ph increases 28 those x shaped crystals are also known to have poorer pack tightening than the particles obtained with mgcl2 6h2o 26 explaining the size differences the origin of x shaped crystals is well accepted but there is still no agreement about what causes the 2d or 3d growth of crystals that generates this x shape hypotheses such as the collision of independent crystals or oriented aggregation of smaller particles in specific parts of the forming struvite crystal have been suggested but the reason why this happens is yet to be clarified 29 at mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 the xrd and edx results for both commercial magnesium salts replicated what was found elsewhere for mgcl2 6h2o as a mixture of struvite and its storage degradation form newberyite 19 newberyite is a common mineral found with struvite it is usually considered a degradation product of struvite under humid conditions 30 despite the use of a temperature lower than the instability range pointed out by sarkar et al 20 in this study the value chosen might have favoured the production of newberyite as well the newberyite concentration also increases with decreasing ammonium levels 30 which can occur when nh4 is removed with struvite formation and some nh3 is evolved owing to the basic ph 31 figs 5 and 6 present respectively the xrd diffractograms and edx results obtained for seasalt and bittern at a 1 2 1 mg po4 ratio struvite was detected for both bittern and seasalt not only with the presence of mg o and p peaks in edx data but also as confirmed by the specific struvite peaks in the diffractograms the major fraction of po4 recovered was as struvite formed at both ph levels newberyite peaks were more evident when bittern was used with seasalt though at ph 9 0 some peaks appear around 14 and 16 which are usually found in phosphorroesslerite explaining the presence of k in edx this phase is usually highly unstable and easily transforms into newberyite during storage by dehydration 34 because of this it is not easily captured by edx the presence of phosphorroesslerite may mean either that newberyite would be forming if more storage time was given or that its formation preceded the formation of k struvite mgkpo4 6h2o which tends to form at a higher ph 33 justifying why the diffractogram at ph 9 0 had this mineral and the one at ph 8 5 did not there was ca2 detected in edx but in the absence of an identifiable phase in xrd the only assumption is the incorporation of ca2 in the struvite newberyite crystals lattice when ca2 is present in the reaction media it is known to be present alongside struvite crystals according to hao et al 35 it seems to be easier to detect it at ph higher than 8 5 thus explaining its presence at ph 9 0 and not at ph 8 5 a concerning feature of the diffractograms and edx results for seasalt is the high abundance of na and cl identified as halite by xrd this fact proves that the increased size of seasalt crystals in this study were undoubtedly affected by co precipitation of halite over the struvite crystals the presence of nacl in the precipitation product with seasalt may be problematic some plants can tolerate high levels of nacl but salinity is usually a problem for soil fertility 36 nacl also affects the uptake of other macronutrients such as k and ca2 37 for this reason unless a crystal washing step is added to remove part of the halite formed seasalt is not an appropriate mg2 source to recover po4 if struvite is intended for use as a soil fertiliser when bittern was used both halite and phosphorroesslerite seemed absent at either ph level the diffractogram also showed a peak at 38 that is typical of the mineral mg2kh po4 2 15h2o supported by the presence of k in edx results this mineral was mentioned by lahalle et al 33 as being the immediate precursor of k struvite at intermediate ph levels its appearance at ph 8 5 and not at ph 9 0 is in agreement with this idea k struvite is easier to precipitate at higher ph levels 38 decreasing the concentration of mg2kh po4 2 15h2o and the presence of k struvite is hard to confirm because its peaks are masked by regular struvite ones the presence of ca2 at ph 9 0 follows the same tendency found for seasalt 3 2 2 mg po4 ratio 1 2 the distribution of crystals dimensions width and length at mg po4 1 2 conditions is presented in fig 7 it shows that as ph increases from 8 5 to 9 0 the crystals have a tendency to reduce in width and length following what was already visible at mg po4 ratio 1 2 1 the best source when using a mg po4 ratio of 1 2 was clearly bittern at ph 8 5 width of 17 8 4 3 and length of 39 8 9 0 when compared to seasalt width of 17 6 9 6 and length of 47 1 10 3 but mostly with mgcl2 6h2o width of 14 0 4 9 and length of 36 1 8 8 and mgso4 7h2o width of 10 5 4 1 and length of 28 4 8 2 knowing how higher si affects crystal sizes smaller crystals might have been expected for this source based on the complexity of bittern composition however along with si another factor gains relevance for both commercial reactants once the mg2 ions are depleted the evolution of the reaction is severely affected and with it the growth of the crystals is strongly compromised the larger crystals obtained with bittern must be related to the higher quantity of cations available to react with po4 after the mg2 ions are depleted as such crystal growth could continue for longer and it may compensate the nucleation promoted by higher si 39 when mg po4 was set at 1 2 mgso4 7h2o showed the poorest p recovery yield and formed the smallest crystals from the four mg2 sources tested proving this mg2 source to be the least viable at 1 2 mg po4 therefore it was not considered for further analysis fig 8 presents the edx results for mgcl2 6h2o seasalt and bittern at ph 8 5 the level with larger crystals at mg po4 1 2 the edx results show the existence of a main phase composed of mg o and p regardless of crystal morphology with the co existence of k and ca ions in the matrix for mgcl2 6h2o seasalt and bittern the diffractograms for all three mg2 sources at ph 8 5 are presented in fig 9 the precipitates were a mixture of struvite and newberyite mghpo4 3h2o regardless of the mg2 source used apart from newberyite and struvite the diffractograms showed some irregularities at the baseline and some peaks of lesser phases this pattern fit ammonium phosphate hydrates with structure varying among nh4capo4 h2o powder diffraction file no 20 202 nh4cap3o9 3h2o powder diffraction file no 29 109 and an ammonium potassium phosphate with no known specific formula powder diffraction file no 1 925 matching the presence of ca and k in the sample referred to as nh4k ca in the diffractogram powder diffraction files were taken from gates rector and blanton 40 seasalt once again presented high amounts of na and cl elements present in edx confirmed as nacl through xrd analysis in bittern edx and xrd indicate that ca and k phosphates are likely present not as single formed minerals but as phases developing together with the main struvite phase this is probably the reason why these crystals grow more than the ones obtained with commercial magnesium reactants also despite a small amount of na being in the edx unless hidden by the most abundant phases there is no obvious structure of halite nacl the fact that na is present in such a low concentration and other macronutrients k ca mg po4 and nh4 are present in higher concentrations makes crystals produced with bittern at mg po4 1 2 suitable for application in fertiliser the higher quantities of both ca2 and k in edx data of bittern compared to mgcl2 6h2o and seasalt gives one possible explanation to why bittern at 1 2 mg po4 ratio can increase p recovery yield to higher values than when using commercial mg2 sources 4 conclusions two alternative magnesium sources bittern and seasalt were tested against two conventional sources mgcl2 6h2o and mgso4 7h2o in the framework of a udt approach in wastewater treatment systems the study showed that bittern can be a low cost alternative mg source leading to a high p recovery efficiency at both mg po4 ratio of 1 2 1 and mg po4 ratio of 1 2 furthermore bittern leads to larger crystals than commercial mg sources with a positive effect on product recovery efficiency the obtained crystals include both struvite and newberyite and no sodium a major advantage when compared with seasalt use because of soil salinisation crystallization at ph 8 5 leads to a product with less newberyite and with a fair amount of k mg2kh po4 2 15h2o which can contribute to a higher value fertiliser value owing to the presence of another macronutrient at mg po4 ratio of 1 2 a similar composition is obtained but as k and ca2 phosphates instead of mg2kh po4 2 15h2o maintaining the multi nutrient characteristics of the crystals in conclusion bittern is a strong option as an mg source for precipitation of udt source separated urine increasing the downstream transferability of the process while generating struvite crystals with fertiliser applicability in addition struvite recovery using low cost magnesium sources will mitigate future runoff thanks to the slow release properties of this natural fertiliser product thus mitigating water contamination pressures besides its performance at mg po4 1 2 opens an explorable path to a simultaneous use of alternative mg2 sources as a main reactant and ca2 sources as a ph correction reactant in systems where pure struvite is not an à priori requirement declaration of competing interest the authors

13208,water management is the crucial aspect of every mineral processing plant especially presently with increasing environmental awareness and water scarcity in many mining regions to meet these demands mining companies worldwide begin to implement technological solutions which are concentrated on water reuse in internal water circuits wastewater circuits could be divided into two types short and long which will differ in case of technology used complexity as well as water quality volume and retention time in a system in this paper the description of positive and negative aspects of both circuit types was presented but the main focus was on the water quality characteristics in the system and its impact on mineral processing graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords flotation water chemistry technological waters water reuse mineral processing 1 introduction properties of technological water used in mineral processing operations depend on the quality of water from external sources deposit genesis processing and water management technology mining technology and natural processes occurring within the circuits 1 2 3 currently the main water sources used in global mining are types of water characterized by a high content of soluble compounds 4 implementation of either low quality water or seawater in process circuits is due to the scarcity of fresh water sources in dry regions 5 6 there are also examples of concentrators utilizing either only or partly low quality waters from internal sources obtained during mining activities 2 7 scarcity of water can cause broader development and implementation of water reusing solutions in a technological circuit 8 9 a standard procedure utilized in mineral processing plants is recirculation of water directly from thickening and filtration operations to process as a short circuit 6 10 on the other hand so called long circuits are represented by tailings sedimentary waters recovered in tailings storage facilities tsf 3 11 in recent years more interest is directed to faster water recovery from tailings slurry by implementation of thickening and filtration facilities 12 13 the other advantages of this solution are safety improvement and reduction of area for tailings storage 14 15 16 each system utilized for water recovery from enrichment products might induce both positive and negative impacts in economic environmental and technological aspects 17 18 19 improvement of water recovery in thickening and filtration processes provides faster access to process waters by reducing retention times and losses due to natural phenomena e g infiltration evaporation which are key aspects in dry environments 15 such solutions also allow minimizing external sources of water and areas needed for tailings disposal what enhances the economic efficiency and reduces the environmental impact 20 shorter retention times and direct water recirculation result in the passing of reagents used in previous process stages e g flotation thickening 2 11 21 water recirculated in the process may also contain solid particles due to imperfections in the water recovery processes e g thickening filtration 19 faster reprocessing time and smaller volumes of water in the circuit are spurs for the accumulation of various contaminants 2 long water circuits on the other hand contain either no or less solid particles and flotation reagents e g collectors frothers modifiers 2 11 however they might be exposed to external factors such as precipitation and temperature which affect their quality and the rate of the chemical transformations taking place 11 22 23 due to the retention time however they might contain several products resulting from reagent decomposition tailings leaching and biological transformation e g nitrogen forms 24 25 26 the impact of technological water chemism on flotation of sulphite ores is a widely considered issue 4 5 27 28 29 30 the quality of waters obtained in technological processes is becoming increasingly crucial in enrichment process planning 9 19 23 31 32 despite the confirmed influence of water quality on flotation concentrators are currently still being designed without specific studies on the impact of circular water variability resulting from technologies used for their recovery 40 68 on the other hand there are visible measures aimed at developing solutions focused on both existing and newly designed water management systems 33 34 this work presents an overview of the types of circuits used in sulphide enrichment processing plants together with a review of their impact on the quality of waters entering the process the information obtained led to conclusions on the shortcomings of the currently exploited system and the ongoing studies the knowledge of key parameters of waters affecting the enrichment process circulating and entering technological circuits has also been systematised 2 industrial wastewater circuits process waters derived from landfilled tailings are characterized by poorer quality parameters than the fresh water delivered to the process which results from leaching of soluble ore constituents flotation reagents and the concentration of components in water caused by evaporation and biological transformations occurring in the circuits 18 22 in the circulating waters domain two types of circuits can be distinguished the so called short circuits represented by waters derived from dewatering and thickening of concentrate and tailings as well as the long circuits of tailings sedimentary waters 2 22 23 31 35 the quality parameters of these waters can have both positive and negative effects on the enrichment process e g grinding flotation but due to the mutual impact of the quality parameters of the ore and water used they are not conclusive 18 water sources supplied to the process water circuit from the environment can also have different quality parameters 9 due to the increase in water demand in dry areas water from the oceans and other saline water resources which account for about 97 4 of worldwide water sources is commonly used 36 the standard composition of ocean waters varies by region of occurrence with typical values shown in table 1 the possibility of using freshwater is also limited by environmental and social protection requirements 18 on the other hand research is being carried out and industrial plants are being built for the treatment and improvement of the quality parameters of process waters where the most promising directions seem to be reverse osmosis membrane technology multi stage flash distillation msf multi effect distillation med thermal technology 37 38 in many areas technological water circuits are still supplied by freshwater from either watercourses or groundwater 38 8 water from fresh sources has an increasingly smaller participation in process water due to the growing awareness of the need for its sustainable use 38 34 one of the examples of the former use of this type of water under the conditions of kghm polska miedź s a is described elsewhere 39 40 authors demonstrated the negative impact of dilution of process saline water with fresh water and proposed certain limits on the ratio of fresh to process water to maintain the effective enrichment coefficients water from the drainage of mines is also utilized as process water in the case of hydrated deposits for example those of kghm polska miedź s a 41 its composition depends on the genesis of deposit being exploited and can have a significant impact on the efficiency of flotation process 42 in addition water from mine drainage could be contaminated with substances related to exploitation technologies e g diesel oil and residues of explosives which makes it not to be treated as freshwater sources 43 one can distinguish water sources in the processing plant water circuits by their genesis fig 1 2 1 short circuits in the mining industry the short circuits are becoming more commonly implemented for recovery of process water due to increasing water demand scarcity of fresh waters and other external sources 44 short water circuits in mineral processing are associated with direct recirculation from dewatering processes in a technological line 21 22 these circuits are represented by waters recovered from dewatering from both flotation tailings and concentrates 45 46 as a result of the short retention time recirculating waters may contain reagents used in the preceding processes 2 11 21 the volume of water returned in the short circuit depends mainly on the throughput of the concentrator and the used dewatering technology 47 the use of short circuits can have both positive and negative impacts on the economic efficiency of implemented processes the positive impact on the efficiency is associated with reduction of the energy consumption for pumping from distant reservoirs maintenance and construction of additional retention capacity 19 application of such solutions also reduces water consumption and prevents water loss related to evaporation 2 in addition returning of water containing collectors and frothers might give a positive impact on reduction of flotation reagents 10 18 the negative effects of short circuits can be associated with a reduction of selectivity due to an increased reagent content and therefore a more difficult control of enrichment processes in terms of their technological parameters 22 moreover preceding solid water separation processes may require the addition of flocculants the presence of which in the recirculated process water can result in the depression of hydrophobic particles 21 the technological limitations of dewatering technology cause waters in short circuits vulnerable to the presence of very fine solid particles 19 fine solids in the form of gangue mineral particles might adsorb on the hydrophobic surfaces of valuable mineral particles causing their depression 48 the short circuit in the tailings management is a solution which allows to replace expensive and logistically problematic management of wet tailings 13 15 disposal of moist tailings also requires construction of a high volume tsf complying with environmental and safety respects technologies are currently being developed and used to store tailings either in thickened or in almost dry form filter cake 49 50 the use of such solutions will have an impact on the short retention time of water in the circuit having an adverse impact on water qualitative properties 51 it was shown by le et al 33 that changing long wet disposal of tailings circuits to short dry tailings storage ones significantly alter the properties of water such as conductivity and concentration of sulphate calcium and thiosalts for instance the sulphate concentration increased from 2000 to 3000 mg dm3 to 5000 mg dm3 33 the same impact was observed in case of conductivity which during wet tailings disposal varied between 4000 and 6000 μs cm and increased linearly to reach 10 000 μs cm during the three years of dry tailings disposal 33 2 2 long circuits long circuits in mineral processing are represented by waters recovered from flotation tailings slurries deposited in tailings storage facilities tsf 2 22 water recovery in those facilities proceeds by natural processes of solids decantation and water withdrawal from tailings deposited on the beach 31 52 these waters stored in large scale reservoirs and transferred through complex systems of pipelines are affected by natural factors i e dilution by inflow of fresh water from precipitation thaw compounds concentration by evaporation or leaching of constituents present in deposited tailings 47 48 elements of water management systems in the long circuits and retention of waters provide a convenient environment for microorganisms performing a biological transformation i e nitrification denitrification 43 53 the rate of these processes varies depending on the climate zone and seasons in which the technological processes are conducted 43 the location of tsf has a significant impact on the energy cost of pumping water back into the process 52 it also affects the water retention time in the system which is one of the main factors influencing the variability of their quality characteristics 10 in addition to external factors the load of contaminants fed into the system from individual sources is accumulated in the closed water circulation of the system 33 therefore the amount of substances dissolved in these waters increases if the inflow of contaminates is higher than their outflows loads of contaminants are removed from the circuit by discharging of excess water into watercourses or using water treatment facilities such as either reverse osmosis or electrocoagulation 38 54 55 in contrast to short circuits due to extended retention times water in long circuits has either lower concentration or no presence of solids and reagents utilized in processing technologies 19 41 on the other hand prolonged retention affects the decomposition rate of these reagents which causes the formation of surface active organic compounds of their disintegration 23 3 properties of technological waters the properties of technological waters depend on the genesis of ore as well as the share composition and constancy of the inflows 7 10 the mineralogical lithological characteristic of deposits and surrounding layers determines the ph value of waters 56 57 the constituents contained in tailings and processed ores might be dissolved at acidic ph 19 58 it also impacts the possible growth of bacteria responsible for leaching and chemical transformations i e nitrification denitrification 53 59 this therefore influences the concentration of these components in the process waters 19 23 the water properties affect every aspect of mineral processing from reagent consumption process selectivity to the life of machines and their consumables such as grinding media 9 36 56 necessity of control and understanding of its impact on every stage of the process is indisputable 3 1 ph the ph values in flotation circuits depends on streams directed to a process the ore deposit properties and introduced reagents 28 29 the ph reduction by the ore is a common issue associated to the presence of iron sulphides 56 reaction 1 in table 2 represents the oxidation process of pyrite resulting in the formation of oxidized fe and s as well as hydrogen ions leading to ph reduction 24 the oxygen present in water causes consequent oxidation of fe 2 to fe 3 56 the oxidation of some other sulphides by fe 3 e g galena produces acidity where oxidation by o2 does not table 2 iron is also oxidized by acidic bacteria which are inactive in an alkaline environment 60 modification of ph in flotation of sulphide ores is general worldwide practice to depress gangue minerals 28 29 30 for this purpose differences in the influence of ph on the surface of sulphide minerals and their interaction with collectors are exploited 29 such an application is known inter alia in flotation of zinc lead ores fig 2 where for instance lime is used to selectively float lead and zinc bearing minerals in subsequent stages of flotation and to remove pyrite from the final concentrate 63 the effect of too high ph on the process selectivity arises in the case of enrichment of cu mo ores 61 62 64 the ph modification used in the production of selective copper and molybdenum concentrates together with the pyrite depression results in the precipitation of salts from the aqueous solution 65 66 this problem typically occurs in enrichment plants utilizing seawater in production 5 waters containing significant amounts of dissolved substances i e ca and mg once the ph over 9 10 is reached affects molybdenite floatability 27 67 the deterioration of the floatability of molybdenum minerals e g molybdenite under elevated ph conditions is associated with the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide present in seawaters and its adsorption on the mineral surface in the form of a hydrophilic layer 27 61 62 the ph effect on the floatability of molybdenum minerals was also shown in the presence of kaolin clay minerals where at ph 9 precipitated calcium and magnesium hydrolysed species caused heterocoagulation of molybdenite and kaolin causing depression of both minerals 66 the effect of ph on the recovery of copper and molybdenum minerals depending on the water used in the process was presented elsewhere 61 fig 3 lower ph of processing water leads to leaching of the constituents present in the deposited tailings as well as the ore feed to the flotation circuit 24 the acidity of water also affects the reagents decomposition rate which is described in more detail in chapter 3 3 3 2 inorganic salts the salinity of technological waters in flotation is a complex issue resulting from the specific impact of the individual dissolved constituents on the properties of reagents used electrochemical properties of mineral particles surfaces as well as froth 4 5 27 the electrolyte of inorganic salts in most cases consists of dissolved sodium chloride but other potential salt electrolytes such as kcl cacl2 mgso4 mgcl2 and na2so4 might also be distinguished 68 the electrolyte properties cause that the dissolution of minerals occurs only in a small extent 2 electrolyte solutions exhibit foaming properties and thus form either foam two phase system or froth three phase system 69 70 71 72 however the formation of stable froth is only possible in the presence of hydrophobic particles in the suspension 73 studies conducted by castro et al 57 showed that the high concentration of electrolytes increased foamability described by the so called dynamic foaming index dfi of nonionic commercial frothers e g df 250 mibc the surface tension of frother in an inorganic salt solution can be described by the so called surface tension switch point s t s p defined as the point at which the frother becomes stronger in the presence of electrolytes fig 4 57 inorganic salts and frothers both exhibit foaming properties and may increase and decrease the surface tension of a solution table 3 fig 5 fig 6 4 thus the introduction of both substances into the system results in the prevention of bubble coalescence and the formation of stable foam which creates a complex electrolyte frother system 57 the effect of individual ions on air bubble coalescence was studied by henry and craig 74 table 4 presents the results for which salts can be expected to affect the coalescence of air bubbles sulphide and gangue minerals might have opposite electric charges what causes them to attract each other and deposit fine hydrophilic particles on the hydrophobic surfaces however it can interfere with the formation of mineral air bubble aggregates 77 the phenomenon of overlapping of mineral particles with opposite electric charges is called heterocoagulation 66 in case of particles with identical charges an opposite phenomenon occurs preventing their coagulation 48 the perturbation of this phenomenon was observed during flotation conducted in the presence of electrolytes where the electrical double layer of mineral particles becomes compressed 44 this effect is evident both in reducing of the mechanical entrainment of fine gangue mineral particles and in preventing them from coating hydrophobic surfaces of minerals 48 78 as a result of compression of the electric double layer mineral particles acquire electrically inert properties resulting in a reduction of the repulsive forces of particles with the same charge as well as the absence of attraction between particles with opposite charges 79 the lack of attraction of fine gangue particles positively affects flotation of sulphide bearing minerals leaving their hydrophobic surfaces uncovered and thus enables adsorption of the collectors 5 80 this effect has been confirmed for both nickel and molybdenum bearing sulphides 81 82 as a consequence of compression of the electric double layer and reduced attraction and repulsion effects between mineral particles the main interactions between a particle particle couple in the inorganic electrolytes are associated with van der waals forces 5 these forces attract to coagulate the fine mineral particles preventing their mechanical entrainment 83 both effects occur in the flotation of sulphides carried out in the electrolyte while having a positive effect on the process efficiency 48 3 3 reagents and organic decomposition compounds water recirculated in the process may contain flotation reagents that have not decomposed and thus reduce their consumption in the flotation process 19 84 lin et al 84 have shown that reduction in the reagent consumption could reach even 10 the adverse effects resulting from the flotation reagents remaining in the water circuit include a decrease in process selectivity as a result of surface active products of their oxidation and decomposition as well as the presence of the reagents themselves mainly in short circuits 5 11 19 21 the decomposition of flotation reagents depends mainly on ph retention time exposure to sunlight and seasonal air temperatures with decomposition being inhibited at sub zero temperatures 85 fig 7 shows the behaviour of xanthates concentrations in the return waters muzinda et al 11 explain the decrease in xanthates concentrations by the effect of increased temperature on the decomposition rate and by dilution of the waters as a result of increased inflow of fresh water from precipitates the decomposition of xanthates results in formation of carbon disulphide cs2 and carbonyl sulphide cos 25 the effect of ph on the xanthate s decomposition was confirmed by shen et al 25 the authors showed a decrease in the carbon disulphide generation with an increase in solution alkalinity a significant increase in the concentration of xanthates disintegration products depending on ph and temperature was demonstrated by mustafa et al 85 where the largest increases were recorded at low ph 5 and high temperature approx 27 c waters circulated in short circuits are most expected to be affected by the flotation reagents which do not decompose due to their short retention time 11 22 as these waters are recovered in solid water separation processes one of the main anthropogenic contaminants may be various polymers used to aggregate mineral particles 21 recirculation of flocculants in the technological process is undesirable due to their effect on the wetting properties of hydrophobic minerals 86 3 4 other impurities circulating waters may contain other contaminants associated with tailings management deposit extraction or enrichment technologies 21 43 87 it is important to determine what types of contaminants potentially affecting the process could occur in waters circuits 42 in short circuit waters solid particles that pass to filtrates and thickening overflows are often found 10 this problem mainly concerns plants that process ores of very fine sulphides and with increased content of clay minerals 25 88 either concentrates or final tailings directed to the sedimentation process can be passed to so called overflows and then returned together with the circulating waters to the process 89 this phenomenon occurs mainly under lower temperatures when the efficiency of sedimentation decreases as a result of an increase in the slurry density and viscosity 90 very fine particles also pass into the filtrate in the filtration process due to the imperfection of the filter fabrics used 91 these waters together with the sedimentation waters are recirculated in the process the occurrence of very fine particles in circulating waters overburdens the technological circuit which causes the loss of concentrate and affects the flotation efficiency resulting from the settling of fine particles on surfaces of hydrophobic minerals 77 83 the presence of nitrogen compounds is one of the main anthropogenic impurities of process waters which results from the deposit exploitation technology 26 92 this is due to the use of nitroglycerin based explosives the residues of which remain on the ore transported to enrichment plants and in the waters from the drainage of mining workings 23 26 92 in waters retention in water management system nitrogen transforms into different forms as a result of nitrification and denitrification phenomena executed by bacteria 26 92 dzingai et al 93 demonstrated the impact of nitrites on flotation of a poor ni cu pgm ore at certain concentrations of nitrites it was shown that the copper and nickel contents in the concentrate increased with no impact on the yield mass pull however the higher nitrite content in circulating waters negatively affected the quality of the concentrates obtained 4 water management and quality control the management of process water systems in ore processing plants is designed to supply water in the quantities necessary to sustain uninterrupted performance of the enrichment process 3 8 36 94 the quantity of waters which are delivered to the process depends on the processing throughput of the facility 8 taking it into consideration it should be noted that the quantitative parameter far outweighs the control of the quality parameters of the waters in enrichment plants 31 33 95 this is mainly due to economic considerations where the main objective is to ensure continuity of production 95 given the continuous deterioration of water quality in the technological circuits of enrichment plants and the more difficult access to fresh water there is a need for increased water quality control and its adjustment to technological and environmental requirements 33 38 96 obtaining a water mixture of suitable quality for a given ore can be achieved by purifying the water streams as well as an appropriate mixing ratio of these streams 38 33 le et al 33 showed that changes in water retention caused by implementation of a new method of tailings disposal may have a drastic impact of technological water quality they also proposed a multivariate data analysis and a statistics system to evaluate water quality and control it online the online control would be performed automatically combining thermodynamic calculations with water balance to maintain a proper mix of water added to the system 33 assumption to water management combined with the water quality control was made by chaves et al 38 in case of desalination of seawater which is redirected to environment authors emphasize the necessity of monitoring the impact of disposed desalinated waters on both marine and terrestrial environments in long term operating example utilizing residual reagents monitoring was presented by muzinda et al 11 authors described a monitoring system for residual xanthate concentration exploiting a uv vis method the system can allow to reduce adverse effects of seasonal changes in the xanthates concentration in the circuit by mixing recirculating waters with other waters to maintain preferred flotation conditions it is also mentioned that this system might be used to lower overall reagent consumption in the future 10 reduction of usage of water from external sources and maximization of water reuse in mineral processing circuits are currently the main focus of mining companies in case of water management 8 2 11 21 32 the increased water recirculation is directly associated with short circuit implementation tailings dewatering technology and desalination facilitates 16 38 50 5 summary water quality properties are depended on the genesis of process water sources and the type of circuit utilized in mineral processing system the main focus of this paper was to describe differences in the impact of long and short wastewater circuits on the water properties affecting the flotation process a brief summary of the reviewed information has been presented in table 5 four major quality parameters were distinguished ph salinity presence of reagents and their decomposition products and suspended solids one can see that some of parameters if suitably controlled may be used with the positive impact on flotation e g selectivity reagents consumption however water impurities which result from process imperfection e g suspended solids presence of flocculants have the negative impact on the process performance implementation of short circuits may be a result of increased concentration of such contaminants due to reduction in the retention time and volume of water the quality control in mineral processing circuits is of secondary importance in comparison to its quantity control the reasons for this are purely economic where the production must be continuous and therefore a sufficient amount of process waters must be supplied however the known impact of the water quality on flotation under conditions of declining quality of ore deposits has led the interest of mining companies in more suitable quality water management for these reasons variability and water quality control capabilities should be the basis for currently designed treatment plants and for the adaptation of existing plants to changing quality and quantity conditions in the literature there is no clear classification of waters in terms of the diversity of quality parameters in view of the impact of different water constituents on the technological process such classification should be carried out for each type of water there is insufficient information on the time of retention of water in circulation the possibility of using this type of information could be used to assess the origin of a water molecule according to the source the continuous development of technology for the recovery of process waters from tailings should be the subject of a broader analysis in terms of the quality parameters of the waters obtained in these processes the size of the drainage stream is significant and the use of any reagents that can be returned to the process will affect its efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13208,water management is the crucial aspect of every mineral processing plant especially presently with increasing environmental awareness and water scarcity in many mining regions to meet these demands mining companies worldwide begin to implement technological solutions which are concentrated on water reuse in internal water circuits wastewater circuits could be divided into two types short and long which will differ in case of technology used complexity as well as water quality volume and retention time in a system in this paper the description of positive and negative aspects of both circuit types was presented but the main focus was on the water quality characteristics in the system and its impact on mineral processing graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords flotation water chemistry technological waters water reuse mineral processing 1 introduction properties of technological water used in mineral processing operations depend on the quality of water from external sources deposit genesis processing and water management technology mining technology and natural processes occurring within the circuits 1 2 3 currently the main water sources used in global mining are types of water characterized by a high content of soluble compounds 4 implementation of either low quality water or seawater in process circuits is due to the scarcity of fresh water sources in dry regions 5 6 there are also examples of concentrators utilizing either only or partly low quality waters from internal sources obtained during mining activities 2 7 scarcity of water can cause broader development and implementation of water reusing solutions in a technological circuit 8 9 a standard procedure utilized in mineral processing plants is recirculation of water directly from thickening and filtration operations to process as a short circuit 6 10 on the other hand so called long circuits are represented by tailings sedimentary waters recovered in tailings storage facilities tsf 3 11 in recent years more interest is directed to faster water recovery from tailings slurry by implementation of thickening and filtration facilities 12 13 the other advantages of this solution are safety improvement and reduction of area for tailings storage 14 15 16 each system utilized for water recovery from enrichment products might induce both positive and negative impacts in economic environmental and technological aspects 17 18 19 improvement of water recovery in thickening and filtration processes provides faster access to process waters by reducing retention times and losses due to natural phenomena e g infiltration evaporation which are key aspects in dry environments 15 such solutions also allow minimizing external sources of water and areas needed for tailings disposal what enhances the economic efficiency and reduces the environmental impact 20 shorter retention times and direct water recirculation result in the passing of reagents used in previous process stages e g flotation thickening 2 11 21 water recirculated in the process may also contain solid particles due to imperfections in the water recovery processes e g thickening filtration 19 faster reprocessing time and smaller volumes of water in the circuit are spurs for the accumulation of various contaminants 2 long water circuits on the other hand contain either no or less solid particles and flotation reagents e g collectors frothers modifiers 2 11 however they might be exposed to external factors such as precipitation and temperature which affect their quality and the rate of the chemical transformations taking place 11 22 23 due to the retention time however they might contain several products resulting from reagent decomposition tailings leaching and biological transformation e g nitrogen forms 24 25 26 the impact of technological water chemism on flotation of sulphite ores is a widely considered issue 4 5 27 28 29 30 the quality of waters obtained in technological processes is becoming increasingly crucial in enrichment process planning 9 19 23 31 32 despite the confirmed influence of water quality on flotation concentrators are currently still being designed without specific studies on the impact of circular water variability resulting from technologies used for their recovery 40 68 on the other hand there are visible measures aimed at developing solutions focused on both existing and newly designed water management systems 33 34 this work presents an overview of the types of circuits used in sulphide enrichment processing plants together with a review of their impact on the quality of waters entering the process the information obtained led to conclusions on the shortcomings of the currently exploited system and the ongoing studies the knowledge of key parameters of waters affecting the enrichment process circulating and entering technological circuits has also been systematised 2 industrial wastewater circuits process waters derived from landfilled tailings are characterized by poorer quality parameters than the fresh water delivered to the process which results from leaching of soluble ore constituents flotation reagents and the concentration of components in water caused by evaporation and biological transformations occurring in the circuits 18 22 in the circulating waters domain two types of circuits can be distinguished the so called short circuits represented by waters derived from dewatering and thickening of concentrate and tailings as well as the long circuits of tailings sedimentary waters 2 22 23 31 35 the quality parameters of these waters can have both positive and negative effects on the enrichment process e g grinding flotation but due to the mutual impact of the quality parameters of the ore and water used they are not conclusive 18 water sources supplied to the process water circuit from the environment can also have different quality parameters 9 due to the increase in water demand in dry areas water from the oceans and other saline water resources which account for about 97 4 of worldwide water sources is commonly used 36 the standard composition of ocean waters varies by region of occurrence with typical values shown in table 1 the possibility of using freshwater is also limited by environmental and social protection requirements 18 on the other hand research is being carried out and industrial plants are being built for the treatment and improvement of the quality parameters of process waters where the most promising directions seem to be reverse osmosis membrane technology multi stage flash distillation msf multi effect distillation med thermal technology 37 38 in many areas technological water circuits are still supplied by freshwater from either watercourses or groundwater 38 8 water from fresh sources has an increasingly smaller participation in process water due to the growing awareness of the need for its sustainable use 38 34 one of the examples of the former use of this type of water under the conditions of kghm polska miedź s a is described elsewhere 39 40 authors demonstrated the negative impact of dilution of process saline water with fresh water and proposed certain limits on the ratio of fresh to process water to maintain the effective enrichment coefficients water from the drainage of mines is also utilized as process water in the case of hydrated deposits for example those of kghm polska miedź s a 41 its composition depends on the genesis of deposit being exploited and can have a significant impact on the efficiency of flotation process 42 in addition water from mine drainage could be contaminated with substances related to exploitation technologies e g diesel oil and residues of explosives which makes it not to be treated as freshwater sources 43 one can distinguish water sources in the processing plant water circuits by their genesis fig 1 2 1 short circuits in the mining industry the short circuits are becoming more commonly implemented for recovery of process water due to increasing water demand scarcity of fresh waters and other external sources 44 short water circuits in mineral processing are associated with direct recirculation from dewatering processes in a technological line 21 22 these circuits are represented by waters recovered from dewatering from both flotation tailings and concentrates 45 46 as a result of the short retention time recirculating waters may contain reagents used in the preceding processes 2 11 21 the volume of water returned in the short circuit depends mainly on the throughput of the concentrator and the used dewatering technology 47 the use of short circuits can have both positive and negative impacts on the economic efficiency of implemented processes the positive impact on the efficiency is associated with reduction of the energy consumption for pumping from distant reservoirs maintenance and construction of additional retention capacity 19 application of such solutions also reduces water consumption and prevents water loss related to evaporation 2 in addition returning of water containing collectors and frothers might give a positive impact on reduction of flotation reagents 10 18 the negative effects of short circuits can be associated with a reduction of selectivity due to an increased reagent content and therefore a more difficult control of enrichment processes in terms of their technological parameters 22 moreover preceding solid water separation processes may require the addition of flocculants the presence of which in the recirculated process water can result in the depression of hydrophobic particles 21 the technological limitations of dewatering technology cause waters in short circuits vulnerable to the presence of very fine solid particles 19 fine solids in the form of gangue mineral particles might adsorb on the hydrophobic surfaces of valuable mineral particles causing their depression 48 the short circuit in the tailings management is a solution which allows to replace expensive and logistically problematic management of wet tailings 13 15 disposal of moist tailings also requires construction of a high volume tsf complying with environmental and safety respects technologies are currently being developed and used to store tailings either in thickened or in almost dry form filter cake 49 50 the use of such solutions will have an impact on the short retention time of water in the circuit having an adverse impact on water qualitative properties 51 it was shown by le et al 33 that changing long wet disposal of tailings circuits to short dry tailings storage ones significantly alter the properties of water such as conductivity and concentration of sulphate calcium and thiosalts for instance the sulphate concentration increased from 2000 to 3000 mg dm3 to 5000 mg dm3 33 the same impact was observed in case of conductivity which during wet tailings disposal varied between 4000 and 6000 μs cm and increased linearly to reach 10 000 μs cm during the three years of dry tailings disposal 33 2 2 long circuits long circuits in mineral processing are represented by waters recovered from flotation tailings slurries deposited in tailings storage facilities tsf 2 22 water recovery in those facilities proceeds by natural processes of solids decantation and water withdrawal from tailings deposited on the beach 31 52 these waters stored in large scale reservoirs and transferred through complex systems of pipelines are affected by natural factors i e dilution by inflow of fresh water from precipitation thaw compounds concentration by evaporation or leaching of constituents present in deposited tailings 47 48 elements of water management systems in the long circuits and retention of waters provide a convenient environment for microorganisms performing a biological transformation i e nitrification denitrification 43 53 the rate of these processes varies depending on the climate zone and seasons in which the technological processes are conducted 43 the location of tsf has a significant impact on the energy cost of pumping water back into the process 52 it also affects the water retention time in the system which is one of the main factors influencing the variability of their quality characteristics 10 in addition to external factors the load of contaminants fed into the system from individual sources is accumulated in the closed water circulation of the system 33 therefore the amount of substances dissolved in these waters increases if the inflow of contaminates is higher than their outflows loads of contaminants are removed from the circuit by discharging of excess water into watercourses or using water treatment facilities such as either reverse osmosis or electrocoagulation 38 54 55 in contrast to short circuits due to extended retention times water in long circuits has either lower concentration or no presence of solids and reagents utilized in processing technologies 19 41 on the other hand prolonged retention affects the decomposition rate of these reagents which causes the formation of surface active organic compounds of their disintegration 23 3 properties of technological waters the properties of technological waters depend on the genesis of ore as well as the share composition and constancy of the inflows 7 10 the mineralogical lithological characteristic of deposits and surrounding layers determines the ph value of waters 56 57 the constituents contained in tailings and processed ores might be dissolved at acidic ph 19 58 it also impacts the possible growth of bacteria responsible for leaching and chemical transformations i e nitrification denitrification 53 59 this therefore influences the concentration of these components in the process waters 19 23 the water properties affect every aspect of mineral processing from reagent consumption process selectivity to the life of machines and their consumables such as grinding media 9 36 56 necessity of control and understanding of its impact on every stage of the process is indisputable 3 1 ph the ph values in flotation circuits depends on streams directed to a process the ore deposit properties and introduced reagents 28 29 the ph reduction by the ore is a common issue associated to the presence of iron sulphides 56 reaction 1 in table 2 represents the oxidation process of pyrite resulting in the formation of oxidized fe and s as well as hydrogen ions leading to ph reduction 24 the oxygen present in water causes consequent oxidation of fe 2 to fe 3 56 the oxidation of some other sulphides by fe 3 e g galena produces acidity where oxidation by o2 does not table 2 iron is also oxidized by acidic bacteria which are inactive in an alkaline environment 60 modification of ph in flotation of sulphide ores is general worldwide practice to depress gangue minerals 28 29 30 for this purpose differences in the influence of ph on the surface of sulphide minerals and their interaction with collectors are exploited 29 such an application is known inter alia in flotation of zinc lead ores fig 2 where for instance lime is used to selectively float lead and zinc bearing minerals in subsequent stages of flotation and to remove pyrite from the final concentrate 63 the effect of too high ph on the process selectivity arises in the case of enrichment of cu mo ores 61 62 64 the ph modification used in the production of selective copper and molybdenum concentrates together with the pyrite depression results in the precipitation of salts from the aqueous solution 65 66 this problem typically occurs in enrichment plants utilizing seawater in production 5 waters containing significant amounts of dissolved substances i e ca and mg once the ph over 9 10 is reached affects molybdenite floatability 27 67 the deterioration of the floatability of molybdenum minerals e g molybdenite under elevated ph conditions is associated with the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide present in seawaters and its adsorption on the mineral surface in the form of a hydrophilic layer 27 61 62 the ph effect on the floatability of molybdenum minerals was also shown in the presence of kaolin clay minerals where at ph 9 precipitated calcium and magnesium hydrolysed species caused heterocoagulation of molybdenite and kaolin causing depression of both minerals 66 the effect of ph on the recovery of copper and molybdenum minerals depending on the water used in the process was presented elsewhere 61 fig 3 lower ph of processing water leads to leaching of the constituents present in the deposited tailings as well as the ore feed to the flotation circuit 24 the acidity of water also affects the reagents decomposition rate which is described in more detail in chapter 3 3 3 2 inorganic salts the salinity of technological waters in flotation is a complex issue resulting from the specific impact of the individual dissolved constituents on the properties of reagents used electrochemical properties of mineral particles surfaces as well as froth 4 5 27 the electrolyte of inorganic salts in most cases consists of dissolved sodium chloride but other potential salt electrolytes such as kcl cacl2 mgso4 mgcl2 and na2so4 might also be distinguished 68 the electrolyte properties cause that the dissolution of minerals occurs only in a small extent 2 electrolyte solutions exhibit foaming properties and thus form either foam two phase system or froth three phase system 69 70 71 72 however the formation of stable froth is only possible in the presence of hydrophobic particles in the suspension 73 studies conducted by castro et al 57 showed that the high concentration of electrolytes increased foamability described by the so called dynamic foaming index dfi of nonionic commercial frothers e g df 250 mibc the surface tension of frother in an inorganic salt solution can be described by the so called surface tension switch point s t s p defined as the point at which the frother becomes stronger in the presence of electrolytes fig 4 57 inorganic salts and frothers both exhibit foaming properties and may increase and decrease the surface tension of a solution table 3 fig 5 fig 6 4 thus the introduction of both substances into the system results in the prevention of bubble coalescence and the formation of stable foam which creates a complex electrolyte frother system 57 the effect of individual ions on air bubble coalescence was studied by henry and craig 74 table 4 presents the results for which salts can be expected to affect the coalescence of air bubbles sulphide and gangue minerals might have opposite electric charges what causes them to attract each other and deposit fine hydrophilic particles on the hydrophobic surfaces however it can interfere with the formation of mineral air bubble aggregates 77 the phenomenon of overlapping of mineral particles with opposite electric charges is called heterocoagulation 66 in case of particles with identical charges an opposite phenomenon occurs preventing their coagulation 48 the perturbation of this phenomenon was observed during flotation conducted in the presence of electrolytes where the electrical double layer of mineral particles becomes compressed 44 this effect is evident both in reducing of the mechanical entrainment of fine gangue mineral particles and in preventing them from coating hydrophobic surfaces of minerals 48 78 as a result of compression of the electric double layer mineral particles acquire electrically inert properties resulting in a reduction of the repulsive forces of particles with the same charge as well as the absence of attraction between particles with opposite charges 79 the lack of attraction of fine gangue particles positively affects flotation of sulphide bearing minerals leaving their hydrophobic surfaces uncovered and thus enables adsorption of the collectors 5 80 this effect has been confirmed for both nickel and molybdenum bearing sulphides 81 82 as a consequence of compression of the electric double layer and reduced attraction and repulsion effects between mineral particles the main interactions between a particle particle couple in the inorganic electrolytes are associated with van der waals forces 5 these forces attract to coagulate the fine mineral particles preventing their mechanical entrainment 83 both effects occur in the flotation of sulphides carried out in the electrolyte while having a positive effect on the process efficiency 48 3 3 reagents and organic decomposition compounds water recirculated in the process may contain flotation reagents that have not decomposed and thus reduce their consumption in the flotation process 19 84 lin et al 84 have shown that reduction in the reagent consumption could reach even 10 the adverse effects resulting from the flotation reagents remaining in the water circuit include a decrease in process selectivity as a result of surface active products of their oxidation and decomposition as well as the presence of the reagents themselves mainly in short circuits 5 11 19 21 the decomposition of flotation reagents depends mainly on ph retention time exposure to sunlight and seasonal air temperatures with decomposition being inhibited at sub zero temperatures 85 fig 7 shows the behaviour of xanthates concentrations in the return waters muzinda et al 11 explain the decrease in xanthates concentrations by the effect of increased temperature on the decomposition rate and by dilution of the waters as a result of increased inflow of fresh water from precipitates the decomposition of xanthates results in formation of carbon disulphide cs2 and carbonyl sulphide cos 25 the effect of ph on the xanthate s decomposition was confirmed by shen et al 25 the authors showed a decrease in the carbon disulphide generation with an increase in solution alkalinity a significant increase in the concentration of xanthates disintegration products depending on ph and temperature was demonstrated by mustafa et al 85 where the largest increases were recorded at low ph 5 and high temperature approx 27 c waters circulated in short circuits are most expected to be affected by the flotation reagents which do not decompose due to their short retention time 11 22 as these waters are recovered in solid water separation processes one of the main anthropogenic contaminants may be various polymers used to aggregate mineral particles 21 recirculation of flocculants in the technological process is undesirable due to their effect on the wetting properties of hydrophobic minerals 86 3 4 other impurities circulating waters may contain other contaminants associated with tailings management deposit extraction or enrichment technologies 21 43 87 it is important to determine what types of contaminants potentially affecting the process could occur in waters circuits 42 in short circuit waters solid particles that pass to filtrates and thickening overflows are often found 10 this problem mainly concerns plants that process ores of very fine sulphides and with increased content of clay minerals 25 88 either concentrates or final tailings directed to the sedimentation process can be passed to so called overflows and then returned together with the circulating waters to the process 89 this phenomenon occurs mainly under lower temperatures when the efficiency of sedimentation decreases as a result of an increase in the slurry density and viscosity 90 very fine particles also pass into the filtrate in the filtration process due to the imperfection of the filter fabrics used 91 these waters together with the sedimentation waters are recirculated in the process the occurrence of very fine particles in circulating waters overburdens the technological circuit which causes the loss of concentrate and affects the flotation efficiency resulting from the settling of fine particles on surfaces of hydrophobic minerals 77 83 the presence of nitrogen compounds is one of the main anthropogenic impurities of process waters which results from the deposit exploitation technology 26 92 this is due to the use of nitroglycerin based explosives the residues of which remain on the ore transported to enrichment plants and in the waters from the drainage of mining workings 23 26 92 in waters retention in water management system nitrogen transforms into different forms as a result of nitrification and denitrification phenomena executed by bacteria 26 92 dzingai et al 93 demonstrated the impact of nitrites on flotation of a poor ni cu pgm ore at certain concentrations of nitrites it was shown that the copper and nickel contents in the concentrate increased with no impact on the yield mass pull however the higher nitrite content in circulating waters negatively affected the quality of the concentrates obtained 4 water management and quality control the management of process water systems in ore processing plants is designed to supply water in the quantities necessary to sustain uninterrupted performance of the enrichment process 3 8 36 94 the quantity of waters which are delivered to the process depends on the processing throughput of the facility 8 taking it into consideration it should be noted that the quantitative parameter far outweighs the control of the quality parameters of the waters in enrichment plants 31 33 95 this is mainly due to economic considerations where the main objective is to ensure continuity of production 95 given the continuous deterioration of water quality in the technological circuits of enrichment plants and the more difficult access to fresh water there is a need for increased water quality control and its adjustment to technological and environmental requirements 33 38 96 obtaining a water mixture of suitable quality for a given ore can be achieved by purifying the water streams as well as an appropriate mixing ratio of these streams 38 33 le et al 33 showed that changes in water retention caused by implementation of a new method of tailings disposal may have a drastic impact of technological water quality they also proposed a multivariate data analysis and a statistics system to evaluate water quality and control it online the online control would be performed automatically combining thermodynamic calculations with water balance to maintain a proper mix of water added to the system 33 assumption to water management combined with the water quality control was made by chaves et al 38 in case of desalination of seawater which is redirected to environment authors emphasize the necessity of monitoring the impact of disposed desalinated waters on both marine and terrestrial environments in long term operating example utilizing residual reagents monitoring was presented by muzinda et al 11 authors described a monitoring system for residual xanthate concentration exploiting a uv vis method the system can allow to reduce adverse effects of seasonal changes in the xanthates concentration in the circuit by mixing recirculating waters with other waters to maintain preferred flotation conditions it is also mentioned that this system might be used to lower overall reagent consumption in the future 10 reduction of usage of water from external sources and maximization of water reuse in mineral processing circuits are currently the main focus of mining companies in case of water management 8 2 11 21 32 the increased water recirculation is directly associated with short circuit implementation tailings dewatering technology and desalination facilitates 16 38 50 5 summary water quality properties are depended on the genesis of process water sources and the type of circuit utilized in mineral processing system the main focus of this paper was to describe differences in the impact of long and short wastewater circuits on the water properties affecting the flotation process a brief summary of the reviewed information has been presented in table 5 four major quality parameters were distinguished ph salinity presence of reagents and their decomposition products and suspended solids one can see that some of parameters if suitably controlled may be used with the positive impact on flotation e g selectivity reagents consumption however water impurities which result from process imperfection e g suspended solids presence of flocculants have the negative impact on the process performance implementation of short circuits may be a result of increased concentration of such contaminants due to reduction in the retention time and volume of water the quality control in mineral processing circuits is of secondary importance in comparison to its quantity control the reasons for this are purely economic where the production must be continuous and therefore a sufficient amount of process waters must be supplied however the known impact of the water quality on flotation under conditions of declining quality of ore deposits has led the interest of mining companies in more suitable quality water management for these reasons variability and water quality control capabilities should be the basis for currently designed treatment plants and for the adaptation of existing plants to changing quality and quantity conditions in the literature there is no clear classification of waters in terms of the diversity of quality parameters in view of the impact of different water constituents on the technological process such classification should be carried out for each type of water there is insufficient information on the time of retention of water in circulation the possibility of using this type of information could be used to assess the origin of a water molecule according to the source the continuous development of technology for the recovery of process waters from tailings should be the subject of a broader analysis in terms of the quality parameters of the waters obtained in these processes the size of the drainage stream is significant and the use of any reagents that can be returned to the process will affect its efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

13209,a continuous compact membrane bioreactor consisted of ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane csgom was implemented for the first time for anaerobic biodecolorization of monoazo acid orange 7 ao7 diazo reactive black 5 rb5 and triazo direct blue 71 db71 solutions showing excellent decolorization potential the membrane was prepared by vacuum filtration of various graphene oxide solutions using a uf ceramic flat element the decolorization efficiency of the csgom bioreactor made from 1 mg ml 1 of go solution b csgom 1 was investigated for several structurally distinct azo dyes initial feed concentrations and permeate fluxes maximum color removal was achieved under low feed concentration 50 mg l 1 and permeate flux 0 05 l m 2 h 1 reaching 99 for ao7 96 rb5 and 92 for db71 at this low permeate flux the biodecolorization was stable for all azo dye solutions irrespective of the feed concentration in a subsequent experiment under higher feed concentration and permeate flux 100 mg l 1 and 0 10 l m 2 h 1 the decolorization slightly fell to 93 85 and 81 for monoazo diazo and triazo solutions respectively the existence of anaerobic bacteria geobacter and pseudomonas guangdongensis in the b csgom 1 biofilm confirms that they could perform efficient biodegradation of azo dye molecules in association with the graphene oxide membrane graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide membrane azo dye anaerobic decolorization 1 introduction global water pollution occurred in all sources including canals lakes rivers oceans and underground reservoirs it usually happened when unwanted substances from either humankind or environment mix with water industrial effluents are the primary source of contaminant substances for water pollution for instance every year 0 28 million tons of textile dyes are discharged in the aquatic environment as industrial waste 1 about half of the textile dyes belong to the azo dye group which is also extensively used in leather medical food and personal care products 2 3 the disposal of this untreated dyestuff poses a severe threat to the aquatic ecosystem as well as biodiversity 4 it changes the natural appearance of the water becoming a dark opaque and colored liquid hindering the photosynthesis process due to the deficient transmission of sunlight in such water 5 the dye effluents and their decomposed products are mostly detrimental even at a very low concentration this contaminated water if used for drinking household or agricultural purposes may cause toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity on the human body 6 therefore efficient wastewater treatment is highly required to maintain and control water pollution in this situation several methods for treating dye containing wastewater have been investigated including physicochemical adsorption coagulation flocculation filtration ion exchange biological photocatalysis by uv irradiation advanced oxidation processes and combined process 7 8 still these treatment processes have faced some disadvantages including addition of enormous amounts of chemicals installation and operating costs space requirements secondary treatments and poor process efficiency 9 10 on the other hand membrane based separation processes have attracted tremendous attention in the wastewater treatment over the few decades due to its easy operation low operating cost and energy consumption small carbon footprint and environmental suitability 11 13 besides other eco friendly efficient dye removal processes are those based on biological mechanisms among the various biological methods anaerobic treatments are very simple less expensive azo dye removal processes 14 this also produces less potentially dangerous substances which eliminates the need to treat subsequently the biodegradable byproducts 7 15 however no single process for removing azo dyes from textile effluent is efficiently and economically viable yet 16 therefore the advantages of both anaerobic pathway and membrane separation process can be coupled in a single compact reactor as a successful technique for the intensified biodecolorization of azo dye the key for implementing effectively this alternative is the selection of membrane precursors that can successfully be coupled with the anaerobic process in this sense nowadays graphene oxide go is considered a prospective precursor for the synthesis of membranes because of its unique two dimensional structure that consisted of the functional polar oxidized zone and pristine graphite zone 17 the water molecules accumulate inside the interlayers of the oxidized region and the other zone increases the liquid permeation 18 besides the nanoporous go membrane imparts surface functionality electrical conductivity and mechanical stability making it possible to produce a low cost membrane for a large scale operation such as wastewater treatment and molecular separation 19 pure go single or multilayer graphene and go composite go surface modified stacked graphene graphene mixed matrix membrane are reported to be fabricated by filtration assisted casting spin coating and layer by layer assembly method 20 vacuum assisted filtration is most commonly used to obtain either free standing or supported go membranes of all preparation techniques in recent years go and go composite membranes have demonstrated the ability to retain azo dyes 17 21 still it is under consideration to further improve the go membrane durability longevity and water permeability without losing decolorization performance so it is important to obtain a compact treatment process with stable robust and high azo dye removal potential a nano sized ceramic supported carbon membrane cscm was synthesized in our earlier work 22 this form of the membrane was capable of decolorizing structurally different azo dyes however the effectiveness of the decolorization was limited at higher permeate flux and feed concentration while it is an essential matter to attain the maximum decolorization performance for practical application taking this into account this work is aimed at finding a robust and durable compact anaerobic membrane bioreactor for a better biodecolorization rate the novelty of this study lies on the application of conductive graphene oxide membrane in combination with the anaerobic biofilm process for the successful removal of azo dye from dye containing wastewater it is worth that anaerobic bacteria such as geobacter and pseudomonas can perform extracellular electron transfer in an aqueous solution as a result of the use of microorganisms and go membrane both the bacteria and the go layer provide faster and more efficient electron transfer the dye azo bond nn breaking thus enhancing the decolorization performance under anaerobic conditions additionally the nano sized ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane csgom acts as biofilm support and pollutant immobilizer to improve the azo dye removal rate the optimum concentration of the go solution for the preparation of csgom and its decolorization performance by anaerobic biodegradation were examined ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane bioreactor b csgom was first implemented for the monoazo acid orange 7 ao7 decolorization process afterward variations of critical parameters for b csgom performance for example azo dye with different structures molecular weight and functional groups initial feed concentration and permeate flux were explored to enhance and optimize the bioreduction of azo dyes finally the biofilm was examined to identify microbial species involved in this anaerobic process in order to understand and subsequently improve the biodecolorization by means of csgom 2 experimental 2 1 fabrication of ceramic supported go membrane vacuum assisted deposition of the synthesized graphene oxide layer over the ceramic support zro2 tio2 ultrafiltration flat membrane diameter 47 mm thickness 2 5 mm molecular weight cut off 50 kg mol 1 tami industries france was used to prepare the csgom membrane firstly a modified hummer method 23 was employed to obtain the graphene oxide powder a homogeneous mixture of 2 5 g of graphite powder 20 μm sigma aldrich ref 282863 and 2 g of nano3 honeywell fluka ref 15603430 was made in 70 ml of h2so4 honeywell fluka 95 98 ref 32051 solution the mixture was then placed in an ice bath and mixed with 10 g of kmno4 panreac applichem ref 141527 and followed by stirring overnight at 50 c thereafter 10 g of kmno4 and 70 ml of milli q water millipore milli q system molsheim france were added and stirred for 24 h the mixture was transferred into a beaker containing 400 ml of ice water and 3 ml of h2o2 acros organics ref 411 880 025 were added and kept stirred at room temperature the graphite oxide solution was purified by a 500 ml solution of 0 5 wt h2o2 and 3 wt h2so4 the graphite oxide pellet was centrifuged at 3000 rpm and the supernatant discarded after repeating it five times the solid was exfoliated in water in a sonication bath for 2 h to obtain graphene oxide the go pellets were dried for 48 h at 60 c and then grounded using mortar and pestle to obtain the go powder the schematic diagram of the synthesis of csgom is illustrated in fig 1 the process begins with preparing different concentrations of homogeneous go solution mg ml 1 by dissolving the desired amount of previously synthesized go powder in deionized water which was sonicated by 45 min in an ultrasonic bath then 5 ml of go solution was poured over the ceramic support placed inside the filtration cell inside disram holder tami industries france after 15 min of vacuum filtration a controllable graphene oxide layer was formed on the ceramic support surface the coating was settled by first drying at 80 c for 24 h and then at 100 c for 72 h following the above procedure a total of four go membranes were prepared using a variety of precursor concentrations these were denoted as csgom 0 5 csgom 1 csgom 2 and csgom 4 respectively for the membrane synthesized with 0 5 1 2 and 4 mg ml 1 of exfoliated go solutions 2 2 experimental set up for anaerobic biodegradation fig 2 shows a scheme of the lab scale b csgom system used in this study the compact bioreactor was made of a filtration cell that held the csgom membrane with 5 ml of retentate chamber ao7 acros organics ref 416561000 diazo reactive black 5 rb5 sigma aldrich ref 306452 and triazo direct blue 71 db71 sigma aldrich ref 212407 were selected as model compounds to generate the artificial wastewater as co substrate sodium acetate sa sigma aldrich ref 110 191 was used as a carbon source and electron donor for microorganisms and azo reduction the dye and sa were dissolved in milli q water at a 1 3 mass ratio to make the synthetic feed solution after that 1 ml of each basic medium bm used as a source of microorganism nutrients was added to the feed solution there were six basal media bm 1 contained 0 155 mg l 1 mnso4 h2o 0 285 mg l 1 cuso4 5h2o 0 46 mg l 1 znso4 7 h2o 0 26 mg l 1 cocl2 6h2o and 0 285 mg l 1 nh4 6mo7o24 bm 2 contained 21 75 mg l 1 k2hpo4 33 40 mg l 1 na2hpo4

chemicals used in this bm were analytical grade chemicals sigma aldrich and the solutions of these chemicals were made by dissolution in milli q water the feed solution was kept at 1 c to prevent microbial growth in the feed stream that ensured a stable sodium acetate concentration the reactor was sealed tightly after 5 ml of secondary anaerobic sludge municipal wwtp reus spain was placed over the csgom continuous sparging of nitrogen through the feed solution purity 99 99 linde helped to maintain the negative redox potential needed to favor dye decolorization rate 24 this resulted in the obtained anaerobic conditions throughout the system moreover nitrogen pressure fixed the operation of tmp thus controlling the permeate flux the compact bioreactor was run under dead end filtration mode at a temperature of 37 1 c to boost the efficiency of microbial strains that were capable of decoloring azo dyes 25 26 2 3 ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane characterization the morphology thickness and elemental composition of graphene oxide membranes were characterized by the field emission scanning electron microscope with focused ion beam fesem fib scios 2 dual beam thermo scientific usa atomic force microscopy afm molecular imaging pico plus 2500 bid service usa was used to examine the membrane surface and conductivity raman scattering measurements to characterize the carbon product were carried out at room temperature with a renishaw invia raman confocal microscope system w leica dm 2500 m at 633 nm furthermore to confirm the phase purity and crystallinity of the csgom membrane a siemens d5000 diffractometer bragg brentano parafocusing geometry and vertical θ θ goniometer under the cukα wavelength of 1 54056 å at 40 kv and 30 ma was used for x ray diffraction xrd the data was obtained using a sample rotation 0 05 angular step at 3 s per step and analyzed with the aid of diffrac plus software the filtration performance of csgom was inspected using eqs 1 and 2 as straightforward method to determine the flux and hydraulic resistance 1 j v t 1 a 2 h r δp μ 1 j where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v the volume of permeate l

experimental temperature dye removal was evaluated by measuring the dye concentration using a uv vis4000n spectrophotometer dinko instruments spain at the corresponding maximum absorbance wavelength at 484 nm for ao7 597 nm for rb5 and 585 nm for db71 the decolorization percentage d was calculated using eq 3 3 d a o a a o 100 where a o and a are the absorbance of feed and treated samples for each biodegradation test respectively 2 4 microbial analysis the microbial diversity of the biofilm evolved during the anaerobic bioreduction of dye was examined using dna isolation kits norgen biotek

invitrogen corporation the filtered reads were matched to unique clade specific marker genes using metaphlan 3 to determine the taxonomic profile relative abundances and alpha diversity measures shannon and chao1 indexes were calculated using metaphlan s relative proportions 3 result and discussion 3 1 morphological structure of csgom x ray diffraction of the csgom 1 obtained by vacuum assisted method is presented in fig 3 the go crystal plane 0 0 1 is clearly visible at 2θ 11 5 with the interlayer spacing of 0 76 nm that is larger than graphite atomic spacing 0 33 nm 28 this suggests that the oxygen functional group attached to the edge of each layer raises the spacing between the layers which aids go exfoliation in the aqueous medium 29 there are no graphitic contaminants in the csgom 1 which is confirmed by the lack of peaks at 2θ 26 30 the peaks at 2θ 30 35 50 and 59 are due to the presence of tetragonal zro2 31 whereas the peaks at 2θ 28 43 54 and 69 owns to rutile form of tio2 32 in the ceramic support raman spectra shown in fig 4 can provide additional evidence for the presence of go in the csgom 1 high intensity peaks in the raman spectra of csgom 1 indicate the expected conjugated and carbon carbon double bonds of graphene in general the d peak is caused by sp3 carbon atoms with a disordered or defective carbon structure while the g peak is originated from the vibration of the aromatic structure of sp2 hybrid carbon atoms it also reflects the same characteristics as xrd whereas the tetragonal zro2 is observed at 262 cm 1 eg 33 and for rutile tio2 peaks at 448 cm 1 eg and 611 cm 1 a1g 34 the typical d and g bands for the csgom 1 are found at 1351 cm 1 and 1605 cm 1 respectively the quotient id ig the d and g band s intensity ratio is a common way to express the defect degree of materials it is found to be 1 02 for csgom 1 which is consistent with reported values in the literature 35 this ratio suggests that the go membrane is relatively stable and resistant to environment conditions furthermore the absence of a 2d band at 2700 cm 1 indicates that all the graphite layers were essentially oxidized during the oxide formation step 36 the morphology of both cs and csgom 1 were examined by fesem fig 5 a b demonstrates that both ceramic support and ceramic supported graphene oxide membranes are typical porous surfaces 22 37 part of the of the graphene oxide deposited on the ceramic support appears as an aggregate or was broken down into smaller particles that penetrated into the ceramic support to form a go zro2 composite 23 it seems that once the pores were shrinking or blocked the homogeneous go layer was formed over a first zone of the composite go zro2 and then over the original zro2 section probably interaction on the membrane surface is mainly due to the attraction between zro2 oxygens and either or both hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of graphene oxide 38 39 as expected the go layer deposited reduced the pore size of the virgin cs surface in addition to the visual inspection of the fesem images imagej software was used to analyze the surface pores of cs and csgom 1 compared to the cs it is found that the pore size of the csgom 1 is significantly lowered where more than 80 of the pores being around 25 nm in the range of transition from ultra to nanofiltration the cross sectional images of both cs and csgom 1 fig 5 c d revealed a clear disparity between the support and the membrane the bottom part in both cases is the titanium oxide layer there are then two more layers of zirconium oxide above the titanium oxide layer the smaller active porous layer and the intermediate porous layer however another layer is clearly visible in the csgom 1 which corresponds to the synthesized graphene oxide membrane this configuration is in line with that found by octávia et al 40 who demonstrated the fabrication of a uniform go zirconia composite membrane the 1 55 μm thick go layer is firmly adhered to the ceramic support indicating the success of csgom 1 preparation using the vacuum assisted method table 1 lists the go content and elementary composition of csgom synthesized with various concentrations of go solution as expected the go content 0 8 to 3 9 mg of the top layer of csgom increases in proportion to the initial solution concentration of membrane precursors the fesem edx analysis of the go membrane provided more detailed information about this layer composition as expected the results show that cs is made of zro2 and tio2 although the content of zirconia is higher than titania as the analysis rather falls upon the upper layer of the virgin layer described as a selective zirconia band in turn the csgom have a carbon rich layer on top 13 7 to 66 8 wt of carbon together with zro2 and tio2 the amount of carbon content is greater when increasing the concentration of exfoliated go solution during coating and subsequently the relative content of zro2 and tio2 is decreased obviously the data is in accordance with the fact that the incident beam energy 5 kev for all measurements penetrated a given depth through the csgom surface thus the thicker go layer on the membrane surface allows passing a shorter distance and therefore the analysis was able to quantify fewer elements deeper inside the membrane composite furthermore as the concentration of the precursor solution rises more go particles begin to penetrate the go zro2 composite layer which means deposited deep inside the ceramic support as a result the precursor concentration increases from 2 to 4 mg ml 1 had almost no significant changes in the carbon content measured on the membrane surface the multilayer 3d topography height and current profile of csgom 1 were investigated by using afm at a random area of 500 500 nm2 and csafm current sensing atomic force microscopy the data is shown in fig 6 a b the mean roughness and root mean square rms roughness analysis of the membrane surface yielded 7 5 and 9 4 nm respectively according to a rough estimate based on afm imaging with spip software most of the pores in csgom 1 were in the 17 33 nm range which compares well with estimates made by fesem the csafm images also provide the current distribution profile of the csgom 1 membrane fig 6b the results demonstrate the local conductance on graphene oxide surfaces which should enhance the rate of biodegradation through the electron shuttle mechanism 41 3 2 impact of the go layer on flux resistance a set of tests were conducted to investigate the effect of depositing different amounts of membrane precursor produced by varying the concentration of go solution on filtration characteristics represented by membrane flux and the derived parameters pure water permeability pwp and hydraulic resistance h r as expected the membrane without go cs showed the highest flux 62 3 l m 2 h 1 the pure water flux of the ceramic support zro2 tio2 based ultrafiltration flat membrane is mainly influenced by the membrane properties such as thickness homogeneity and porosity additional single or multilayer go was formed over the ceramic support in csgom resulting in an increment of hydraulic resistance moreover the go particles reduce the pore size of the ceramic support thus a membrane without the go always possessed the highest water flux similar results are shown in fig 7 where the flux decreased linearly with increasing go thickness which correlates with the increasing precursor concentration for csgom preparation 0 5 1 and 2 mg ml 1 go the lowest pure water flux 4 1 l m 2 h 1 was observed for the membrane made of 2 mg ml 1 of go solution csgom 2 in comparison to cs the pure water flux for csgom 0 5 csgom 1 csgom 2 dropped 63 83 and 93 respectively giménez et al 23 also found strong flux drops 47 and 77 for go membranes prepared from 0 05 and 0 5 mg ml 1 of go over a 0 04 μm pore size ceramic support the derived pwp follows these trends so cs exhibits maximum permeance 77 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and it then decreases up to 5 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for csgom 2 fig 7 from the permeances given in fig 7 the total resistance of the cs and csgom were estimated and the specific contribution of the go layer was calculated considering the ceramic support resistance to be constant in the membranes containing go the hydraulic resistance of the ceramic support was estimated to be as 5 2 0 1 1012 m 1 it has been noted that go load during preparation of graphene oxide membranes has a significant impact on permeate flux thus in the hydraulic resistance since permeate flux and hydraulic resistance are interconnected functions higher graphene oxide content membrane must result in more resistance during fabrication the ceramic support pores go zro2 region were first entirely filled and then formed on top the go multilayer it was also observed that the thickness of the deposited go layer grew as the go concentration was increased which in turn decreased the membrane flux 42 43 and increased the hydraulic resistance hence the csgom resistances increased from 1 51 0 04 1013 m 1 to 8 64 0 13 1013 m 1 as the concentration of go solution during coating increased from 0 5 to 2 mg ml 1 therefore the cs gives less than one third of the total resistance in csgom further increase of go concentration up to 4 mg ml 1 in csgom 4 preparation made the membrane essentially impermeable due to the formation of a very thick dense and nonporous go layer on the membrane surface that prevents water molecules from passing across 44 45 on the other hand a low concentration of go solution 0 5 mg ml 1 failed to form a uniform stable go ceramic membrane because of lack of carbon content and non homogeneous layer formation on the membrane surface lou et al 46 found that a membrane prepared from 0 05 0 10 and 0 5 mg ml 1 go solution was not good enough for practical application moreover in a membrane prepared with a high go concentration 4 mg ml 1 the go layer can peel up easily after swelling and detached from the surface therefore it is inferred that the csgom preparation technique must meet two critical requirements go load must be suitable to create a homogeneous and tightly bound go layer and permeate flux should be at the desired level in this study it was found that the csgom 1 with an estimated 1 55 μm go layer thickness showed a permeability of 13 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 this was comparable to other attempts available in the literature such as a polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous mat supported 8 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and an electrospray nanofiltration 11 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 go membrane 47 even though the carbon wall or channel is hydrophobic in nature the slip flow theory indicates that it can assist in transporting the liquid between the go layers 42 as per this principle the water molecules first proceed to the hydrophilic edges and defects of the go layer which act as a gate for water flow the liquids are usually deposited in those gates and then slip through the hydrophobic nanochannel as a result graphene oxide membrane displays acceptable permeate flux despite having a thicker layer based on these facts 0 5 and 1 mg ml 1 of go solution appears to be the optimum concentration for forming the membranes properly combining enough flux and robustness needed for the wastewater treatment process 3 3 role of the graphene oxide layer on anaerobic biodecolorization of azo dyes the capability of the graphene oxide membrane for anaerobic azo dye decolorization was checked out with and without the formation of biofilm four different reactor combinations were used mixed microbial consortium on cs b cs mixed microbial consortium on csgom b csgom no microbial consortium on cs r cs and no microbial consortium on csgom r csgom in all cases initially 50 mg l 1 feed solution of ao7 was used as it falls within the typical range 10 to 50 mg l 1 of dye concentrations in real textile effluents 48 in all the cases a constant flux of 0 05 l m 2 h 1 was maintained in a dead end filtration mode furthermore two graphene oxide membranes produced from 0 5 and 1 mg ml 1 of go solution csgom 0 5 and csgom 1 were used to investigate the impact of graphene oxide content on the decolorization process as above commented the thickness of the go layer on the membrane surface is easily adjusted by changing the precursor concentration since the membrane flux is dependent on the thickness of the deposited graphene oxide layer resistance of the csgom transmembrane pressure from 0 5 to 2 0 bar was adjusted in the experiments to maintain a constant flow irrespective of the different membrane thicknesses fig 8 includes the removal evolution for all the cases during a period of 10 days since the start until a steady operation was reached overall the results confirmed that the presence of the go layer had a significant effect on the decolorization of ao7 the color removal attained was larger at the highest go load b csgom 1 consisting of the membrane made of 1 mg ml 1 of go solution giving a decolorization of 99 all the reactors apparently showed a good efficiency during the first 12 h as they decolorized more than 75 of the azo dye solution actually this initial decolorization was basically due to the adsorption of the dye on the membrane surfaces so it is not a true removal once the membrane became saturated the color removal efficiency dropped suddenly except for b csgom 1 stabilizing rapidly around a mostly steady value the b cs and r cs completely lost any decolorization ability after two days in the case of r cs once saturated the membrane material the only possible mechanism to remove dyes could be the membrane retention which fails since the pore size of the support element uf range is too high in comparison to the dye dimensions nf range although b cs was operated with the mixed microbial consortium the desired biodecolorization did not occur because of the probable absence of an active biofilm or even microorganisms on the ceramic support which can probably be ascribed to the fact that the permeate flow washed out the bacteria before forming a biofilm because of their size relatively smaller than the support pores after four days of operation the decolorization rate stabilized at approximately 22 for r csgom 1 and 10 after six days with r csgom 0 5 in this case the membranes are partially able to retain the dye due to the nano sized pores of the csgom surface created after go layer formation therefore this limited capacity of dye removal can essentially be attributed to molecular sieving mechanism only for b csgoms blue and brown circles in fig 8 there was a true biodegradation of the dye the highest decolorization 98 was observed for the b csgom 1 prepared with a concentration of 1 mg ml 1 of go whereas only 51 of color removal was observed using b csgom 0 5 made from 0 5 mg ml 1 go only dye decomposition caused by the anaerobic action of the microorganisms can account for the high level of decolorization observed in this study however a great difference is observed between the performance of the b csgom 1 and b csgom 0 5 where the load of go seems to favor the biodecomposition to form an efficient biofilm or anaerobic membrane scaffold microorganisms must be selectively attached to the graphene oxide surface the essence of the microbial activity and the consistency of the go layer have a direct impact on adhesion performance thus the improved performance in b csgoms was due to the concurrent occurrence of physical sieving and anaerobic biodegradation as in previous studies using ceramic supported carbon based membrane bioreactors 22 the go layer of b csgom also played a triple role in the anaerobic decolorization of azo dyes since it performs as a pollutant immobilizer support for the biofilm and electron transporter graphene oxide membranes are more conductive than matrimid based carbon membranes 22 thus contributing to a faster electron shuttle mediator mechanism moreover the surface of the nanoporous graphene oxide membrane improves the microbial metabolism and retains the degradation products which globally enhances the decolorization performance 49 compared with previous studies the upflow packed bed reactor filled with biological activated carbon with a similar objective 50 the b csgom 1 was also stabilized in a shorter retention time to achieve the almost complete 99 decolorization of ao7 on the other hand our configuration shows better performance if compared to other attempts based on go shital et al 51 assessed ao7 removal by adsorption with reduced graphene oxide rgo combined rgo photolysis rgo oxidation with h2o2 and rgo oxidation with photo radiation process and found 10 removal by rgo alone and a maximum of 80 by combined rgo oxidation with uv radiation since go plays a critical role in this process it was expected that its load in the go layer impact someway on the dye removal for instance in an oxidation process lee et al 52 investigated go load and discovered that the increase of the load improved the dye removal efficiency as previously noted fesem edx measurements table 1 confirmed the increase of the go concentration in the precursor solution from 0 5 to 1 mg ml 1 improves the go content of csgom from 0 8 to 2 6 mg this latter higher load creates a membrane with smaller pore size responsible of dye adsorption and biofilm immobilization therefore both enhanced 53 moreover the carbon rich csgom enhances the redox mediator role due to the greater availability of sites with redox properties which also contributes to improve the biodegradation performance fig 8 corroborates this trend as raise of carbon content from 13 7 to 49 4 on csgom 1 almost doubled the decolorization from 51 to 98 further application of a csgom 2 and csgom 4 as commented above gave a less or non permeable membrane so the csgom 1 was taken as the most favorable balance between flux and decolorization 3 4 effect of flux and feed concentration on azo dye decolorization the effect of feed concentration and permeate flux on the decolorization process of b csgom 1 was evaluated by varying ao7 concentrations 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 and permeate fluxes 0 05 0 075 and 0 10 l m 2 h 1 all experiments were conducted for 30 days continuous operation with a flow of 0 05 l m 2 h 1 within the first 10 days 0 075 l m 2 h 1 for the second 10 days and finally at 0 10 l m 2 h 1 until the end the transmembrane pressure tmp was adjusted when needed to keep a constant permeate flux though slight accumulated membrane fouling during the process would lower the permeate flux if not corrected fig 9 depicts the change in ao7 decolorization for the three feed concentrations tested during the three periods of different permeate flux as can be seen irrespective of the conditions the decolorization reached over 90 although the expected trends for feed concentration and permeate flux were observed b csgom 1 with a feed concentration of 50 mg l 1 and a permeate flux of 0 05 l m 2 h 1 achieved the maximum ao7 removal 99 at a higher permeate flux 0 10 l m 2 h 1 the decolorization slightly decreased to 97 95 and 93 at the ao7 feed solution concentrations of 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 respectively along with fig 9 table 2 illustrates the amount of dye removed and the percentage of decolorization during the b csgom 1 process it is worth noting that when the feed concentration and permeate flux increase decolorization usually reduces but the amount of decolorized dye is progressively growing in this experiment a maximum equivalent consumption of 9 3 mg m 2 h 1 was obtained for 100 mg l 1 ao7 at a 0 10 l m 2 h 1 flux color removal was thoroughly stable at the low flux region with no significant differences observed for the three different feed concentrations the low permeate flow allowed the dye molecules to interact with bacteria enough time to reach large biodegradation 54 after 30 days of operation even increasing permeate flux the b csgom 1 gave around 99 of azo dye decolorization for the 50 mg l 1 feed solution increasing the flux even the falling decolorization percentage the absolute amount of ao7 removal by the b csgom 1 increased from 2 5 to 4 7 mg m 2 h 1 these decolorization and dye removal findings concluded that the amount of biomass was sufficient to assure almost complete biodegradation of the dye anyway even when the ao7 feed concentration and permeate flux doubled the microorganisms were able to attain high levels of decolorization thus the decolorization for 75 and 100 mg l 1 feed solution at 0 075 and 0 10 l m 2 h 1 flux was only reduced to 98 95 and 97 93 respectively simultaneously the total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod of each dye solution were reduced by more than 85 and 95 respectively in all conditions the effluent properties achieved by b csgom 1 were highly suitable for environmental emissions details are given in table a besides these conditions furnish more absolute dye removal which reach 7 1 and 9 3 mg m 2 h 1 for 75 and 100 mg l 1 feed solutions respectively the results were much better than those obtained using conventional discontinuous biological systems at several ao7 concentrations 50 55 56 in a similar reactor configuration and operations conditions using carbon based membranes instead of go 22 the decolorization attained was 58 45 and 36 for 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 of ao7 solutions respectively while over 93 removal was achieved using the present b csgom 1 in the ranges tested this suggests that the go plays a dominant role during the dye biodegradation being much more efficient than carbon based membrane made using matrimid 5218 as a precursor 22 probably the potential of go as a redox mediator enhanced the transfer of electrons to the azo bond of the dye molecule leading to easier cleavage of the azo bond 57 however regardless of the color removal this compact bioreactor unit is more compatible with higher feed concentration and permeate flux to remove the amount of azo dye as the microorganisms of the b csgom 1 is highly capable of coping with the growing dye loads consequently it might be more productive to operate the b csgom 1 at a greater permeate flux 3 5 comparative decolorization of azo dyes a comparative biodecolorization of three structurally different azo dyes mono azo ao7 diazo rb5 and triazo db71 were investigated in the anaerobic b csgom 1s under various permeate fluxes and feed concentrations the extent of decolorization of azo dye solutions varied depending on the number of azo bonds present in the dye structure fig 10 a c illustrates this fact in general for the three azo dyes the decolorization declined as feed concentration and permeate fluxes increased as expected for all experimental conditions mono azo ao7 dye reported the highest color removal 99 93 which was significantly higher than for diazo 96 85 and triazo 92 81 dyes franciscon et al 58 previously demonstrated that the monoazo dye removal was faster and more efficient than diazo and triazo using a sequential microaerophilic aerobic treatment with klebsiella sp strain vn 3 anyway the absolute quantity of dye removal for all azo dyes as well progresses with increasing feed concentration or permeate flux although it reduces when raising the number of azo bonds and ao7 hence exhibits the highest dye removal of 9 3 mg m 2 h 1 while db71 the lowest 8 1 mg m 2 h 1 it must be considered that the contact time directly related to the permeate flux can affect the removal capacity which is also varied depending on dye properties and microorganism behavior against each specific dye 59 in b csgom 1 as when increasing feed concentration a higher permeate flux adds additional dye load with more chromophores and auxochromes content in the decolorization process additionally the high flux minimizes biomass retention time within the bioreactor thereby declining microbial biodecolorization 60 61 as a result under high feed concentration 100 mg l 1 changing permeate flux from 0 05 to 0 075 l m 2 h 1 and finally to 0 10 l m 2 h 1 the decolorization reduced to 93 for ao7 85 for rb5 and 81 for db71 the corresponding dye removal for ao7 rb5 and db71 was calculated to be 9 3 8 5 and 8 07 mg m 2 h 1 respectively under identical operating conditions the structural properties and nature of the azo dyes for example meta ortho and para position of the electron withdrawing groups no2 cn so3h so2nh2 to azo bond presence of electron releasing groups oh r nh2 and other functional groups ch3 och3 the number of azo bonds and high molecular weight of the dye molecules have been reported to cause variations in decolorization rate 62 64 increase of both permeate flux and feed dye concentration brought more reactive groups into the anaerobic bioreactor it has been reported that an excess amount of so3h groups in the azo dye structure readily reduced microbial growth 65 in addition a rise of toxicity in the degradation process led to inadequate biomass to dye ratio and spoiled the active sites of the biofilm consequently microbial biomass yield at higher feed concentration probably remains lower due to excess dye toxicity to microorganisms compatible trends can be seen in fig 10 a c in which the percentage of decolorization of ao7 declines as the initial feed concentration or permeate flux increases anyway it has been proved that the bioreactor configuration here introduced successfully decolorized the various azo dyes tested in line with results reported elsewhere 22 66 3 6 microbial community analysis since the active biofilm evolved from conventional secondary sludge taken from a municipal wwtp after an acclimation period it is interesting to elucidate which type of microorganism remained prevalent for the dye biodegradation therefore fesem analysis was applied to measure the presence of microorganisms in the b csgom biofilm after the db71 biodegradation fig 11 a b displays the surface and cross sectional view of the biofilm formed over the go layer on the biofilm surface significant quantities of microorganisms with an average size of 1 51 μm were detected cross section analysis revealed a biofilm thickness of about 1 83 μm over the go membrane fig 11c the biofilm specimen of distinct b csgom 1 bioreactors was used to extract the dna of bacteria three dna samples were collected from the csgom 1 bioreactors operated with 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 of db71 solutions and were then compared with the original anaerobic sludge inoculum dna illumina sequencing was used to examine the microbial populations of bacteria archaea viruses and single celled eukaryotes in these four samples the sequencing run produced 32 8 million reads that reduce to 30 6 million reads after quality filtering although raw anaerobic sludge contained both bacteria and archaea no archaea were found after bioreactor operation fig 12 depicts the schematic bar diagram and comparison of bacterial phyla for the four samples according to species richness chao1 indexes show that anaerobic sludge 15 24 was the most diverse and b csgom 1 with 50 mg l 1 db71 7 54 was less overall among the 53 bacterial taxonomic units otus the species pseudomonas guangdongensis was the most prevalent in all samples while geobacter sulfurreducens was abundant in all biofilms but not in the initial anaerobic sludge in all cases bacterial growth solely depended on the concentration of feed solution for example the presence of a significant number of geobacter sulfurreducens 35 was observed in the biofilm that treated 100 mg l 1 db71 solution and the lowest 7 was found for 50 mg l 1 of db71 solution similarly presence of pseudomonas guangdongensis in biofilm was enhanced increasing inflow dye concentration but the highest was still in the original anaerobic sludge the results revealed that activities of both geobacter sulfurreducens and pseudomonas guangdongensis were increased with increasing dye concentration several studies have proven the role of geobacter sulfurreducens in the anaerobic biodegradation of azo dye solution 67 68 moreover the extracellular electron transfer capability of geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter soli might enable them to play an important role during the biodecolorization process 69 in addition geobacter anodireducens which were present in b csgom 1 can exchange more electrons and more rapidly than geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter soli 70 higher content of these bacteria in b csgom 1 operated with 50 mg l 1 of db71 could contribute to get a more stable and better decolorization performance as shown in fig 10a nevertheless other bacterial species such as stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila 71 pseudomonas guangdongensis 72 cupriavidus metallidurans 73 were known as a potential decolorizing organism all they were significantly present in b csgom biofilm and probably took part in the decolorization 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a dead end membrane filtration element with a ceramic supported graphene oxide layer has been used for anaerobic azo dye decolorization different concentrations of go solution were examined to investigate their formation of csgom and subsequent performance over the anaerobic biodecolorization process due to the suitable membrane permeability resistance and maximum decolorization during the azo dye removal process csgom 1 made from 1 mg ml 1 go solution was identified as the optimal for this integrated compact bioreactor that provides a novel robust and effective color removal process the conductive surface of the go membrane enhances faster electron transfer in b csgom if compared to other carbon based processes reported in all operating conditions the dye removal performance for monoazo ao7 was stable and higher than for rb5 and db71 high decolorization rates of structurally distinct azo dyes 99 for ao7 96 for rb5 and 92 for db71 were achieved at the lowest permeate flux 0 05 l m 2 h 1 and feed concentration 50 mg l 1 the microbial community found in the b csgom 1 mainly contained anaerobic geobacter soli anodireducens sulfurreducens and pseudomonas guangdongensis all are

13209,a continuous compact membrane bioreactor consisted of ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane csgom was implemented for the first time for anaerobic biodecolorization of monoazo acid orange 7 ao7 diazo reactive black 5 rb5 and triazo direct blue 71 db71 solutions showing excellent decolorization potential the membrane was prepared by vacuum filtration of various graphene oxide solutions using a uf ceramic flat element the decolorization efficiency of the csgom bioreactor made from 1 mg ml 1 of go solution b csgom 1 was investigated for several structurally distinct azo dyes initial feed concentrations and permeate fluxes maximum color removal was achieved under low feed concentration 50 mg l 1 and permeate flux 0 05 l m 2 h 1 reaching 99 for ao7 96 rb5 and 92 for db71 at this low permeate flux the biodecolorization was stable for all azo dye solutions irrespective of the feed concentration in a subsequent experiment under higher feed concentration and permeate flux 100 mg l 1 and 0 10 l m 2 h 1 the decolorization slightly fell to 93 85 and 81 for monoazo diazo and triazo solutions respectively the existence of anaerobic bacteria geobacter and pseudomonas guangdongensis in the b csgom 1 biofilm confirms that they could perform efficient biodegradation of azo dye molecules in association with the graphene oxide membrane graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide membrane azo dye anaerobic decolorization 1 introduction global water pollution occurred in all sources including canals lakes rivers oceans and underground reservoirs it usually happened when unwanted substances from either humankind or environment mix with water industrial effluents are the primary source of contaminant substances for water pollution for instance every year 0 28 million tons of textile dyes are discharged in the aquatic environment as industrial waste 1 about half of the textile dyes belong to the azo dye group which is also extensively used in leather medical food and personal care products 2 3 the disposal of this untreated dyestuff poses a severe threat to the aquatic ecosystem as well as biodiversity 4 it changes the natural appearance of the water becoming a dark opaque and colored liquid hindering the photosynthesis process due to the deficient transmission of sunlight in such water 5 the dye effluents and their decomposed products are mostly detrimental even at a very low concentration this contaminated water if used for drinking household or agricultural purposes may cause toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity on the human body 6 therefore efficient wastewater treatment is highly required to maintain and control water pollution in this situation several methods for treating dye containing wastewater have been investigated including physicochemical adsorption coagulation flocculation filtration ion exchange biological photocatalysis by uv irradiation advanced oxidation processes and combined process 7 8 still these treatment processes have faced some disadvantages including addition of enormous amounts of chemicals installation and operating costs space requirements secondary treatments and poor process efficiency 9 10 on the other hand membrane based separation processes have attracted tremendous attention in the wastewater treatment over the few decades due to its easy operation low operating cost and energy consumption small carbon footprint and environmental suitability 11 13 besides other eco friendly efficient dye removal processes are those based on biological mechanisms among the various biological methods anaerobic treatments are very simple less expensive azo dye removal processes 14 this also produces less potentially dangerous substances which eliminates the need to treat subsequently the biodegradable byproducts 7 15 however no single process for removing azo dyes from textile effluent is efficiently and economically viable yet 16 therefore the advantages of both anaerobic pathway and membrane separation process can be coupled in a single compact reactor as a successful technique for the intensified biodecolorization of azo dye the key for implementing effectively this alternative is the selection of membrane precursors that can successfully be coupled with the anaerobic process in this sense nowadays graphene oxide go is considered a prospective precursor for the synthesis of membranes because of its unique two dimensional structure that consisted of the functional polar oxidized zone and pristine graphite zone 17 the water molecules accumulate inside the interlayers of the oxidized region and the other zone increases the liquid permeation 18 besides the nanoporous go membrane imparts surface functionality electrical conductivity and mechanical stability making it possible to produce a low cost membrane for a large scale operation such as wastewater treatment and molecular separation 19 pure go single or multilayer graphene and go composite go surface modified stacked graphene graphene mixed matrix membrane are reported to be fabricated by filtration assisted casting spin coating and layer by layer assembly method 20 vacuum assisted filtration is most commonly used to obtain either free standing or supported go membranes of all preparation techniques in recent years go and go composite membranes have demonstrated the ability to retain azo dyes 17 21 still it is under consideration to further improve the go membrane durability longevity and water permeability without losing decolorization performance so it is important to obtain a compact treatment process with stable robust and high azo dye removal potential a nano sized ceramic supported carbon membrane cscm was synthesized in our earlier work 22 this form of the membrane was capable of decolorizing structurally different azo dyes however the effectiveness of the decolorization was limited at higher permeate flux and feed concentration while it is an essential matter to attain the maximum decolorization performance for practical application taking this into account this work is aimed at finding a robust and durable compact anaerobic membrane bioreactor for a better biodecolorization rate the novelty of this study lies on the application of conductive graphene oxide membrane in combination with the anaerobic biofilm process for the successful removal of azo dye from dye containing wastewater it is worth that anaerobic bacteria such as geobacter and pseudomonas can perform extracellular electron transfer in an aqueous solution as a result of the use of microorganisms and go membrane both the bacteria and the go layer provide faster and more efficient electron transfer the dye azo bond nn breaking thus enhancing the decolorization performance under anaerobic conditions additionally the nano sized ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane csgom acts as biofilm support and pollutant immobilizer to improve the azo dye removal rate the optimum concentration of the go solution for the preparation of csgom and its decolorization performance by anaerobic biodegradation were examined ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane bioreactor b csgom was first implemented for the monoazo acid orange 7 ao7 decolorization process afterward variations of critical parameters for b csgom performance for example azo dye with different structures molecular weight and functional groups initial feed concentration and permeate flux were explored to enhance and optimize the bioreduction of azo dyes finally the biofilm was examined to identify microbial species involved in this anaerobic process in order to understand and subsequently improve the biodecolorization by means of csgom 2 experimental 2 1 fabrication of ceramic supported go membrane vacuum assisted deposition of the synthesized graphene oxide layer over the ceramic support zro2 tio2 ultrafiltration flat membrane diameter 47 mm thickness 2 5 mm molecular weight cut off 50 kg mol 1 tami industries france was used to prepare the csgom membrane firstly a modified hummer method 23 was employed to obtain the graphene oxide powder a homogeneous mixture of 2 5 g of graphite powder 20 μm sigma aldrich ref 282863 and 2 g of nano3 honeywell fluka ref 15603430 was made in 70 ml of h2so4 honeywell fluka 95 98 ref 32051 solution the mixture was then placed in an ice bath and mixed with 10 g of kmno4 panreac applichem ref 141527 and followed by stirring overnight at 50 c thereafter 10 g of kmno4 and 70 ml of milli q water millipore milli q system molsheim france were added and stirred for 24 h the mixture was transferred into a beaker containing 400 ml of ice water and 3 ml of h2o2 acros organics ref 411 880 025 were added and kept stirred at room temperature the graphite oxide solution was purified by a 500 ml solution of 0 5 wt h2o2 and 3 wt h2so4 the graphite oxide pellet was centrifuged at 3000 rpm and the supernatant discarded after repeating it five times the solid was exfoliated in water in a sonication bath for 2 h to obtain graphene oxide the go pellets were dried for 48 h at 60 c and then grounded using mortar and pestle to obtain the go powder the schematic diagram of the synthesis of csgom is illustrated in fig 1 the process begins with preparing different concentrations of homogeneous go solution mg ml 1 by dissolving the desired amount of previously synthesized go powder in deionized water which was sonicated by 45 min in an ultrasonic bath then 5 ml of go solution was poured over the ceramic support placed inside the filtration cell inside disram holder tami industries france after 15 min of vacuum filtration a controllable graphene oxide layer was formed on the ceramic support surface the coating was settled by first drying at 80 c for 24 h and then at 100 c for 72 h following the above procedure a total of four go membranes were prepared using a variety of precursor concentrations these were denoted as csgom 0 5 csgom 1 csgom 2 and csgom 4 respectively for the membrane synthesized with 0 5 1 2 and 4 mg ml 1 of exfoliated go solutions 2 2 experimental set up for anaerobic biodegradation fig 2 shows a scheme of the lab scale b csgom system used in this study the compact bioreactor was made of a filtration cell that held the csgom membrane with 5 ml of retentate chamber ao7 acros organics ref 416561000 diazo reactive black 5 rb5 sigma aldrich ref 306452 and triazo direct blue 71 db71 sigma aldrich ref 212407 were selected as model compounds to generate the artificial wastewater as co substrate sodium acetate sa sigma aldrich ref 110 191 was used as a carbon source and electron donor for microorganisms and azo reduction the dye and sa were dissolved in milli q water at a 1 3 mass ratio to make the synthetic feed solution after that 1 ml of each basic medium bm used as a source of microorganism nutrients was added to the feed solution there were six basal

chemicals used in this bm were analytical grade chemicals sigma aldrich and the solutions of these chemicals were made by dissolution in milli q water the feed solution was kept at 1 c to prevent microbial growth in the feed stream that ensured a stable sodium acetate concentration the reactor was sealed tightly after 5 ml of secondary anaerobic sludge municipal wwtp reus spain was placed over the csgom continuous sparging of nitrogen through the feed solution purity 99 99 linde helped to maintain the negative redox potential needed to favor dye decolorization rate 24 this resulted in the obtained anaerobic conditions throughout the system moreover nitrogen pressure fixed the operation of tmp thus controlling the permeate flux the compact bioreactor was run under dead end filtration mode at a temperature of 37 1 c to boost the efficiency of microbial strains that were capable of decoloring azo dyes 25 26 2 3 ceramic supported graphene oxide membrane characterization the morphology thickness and elemental composition of graphene oxide membranes were characterized by the field emission scanning electron microscope with focused ion beam fesem fib scios 2 dual beam thermo scientific usa atomic force microscopy afm molecular imaging pico plus 2500 bid service usa was used to examine the membrane surface and conductivity raman scattering measurements to characterize the carbon product were carried out at room temperature with a renishaw invia raman confocal microscope system w leica dm 2500 m at 633 nm furthermore to confirm the phase purity and crystallinity of the csgom membrane a siemens d5000 diffractometer bragg brentano parafocusing geometry and vertical θ θ goniometer under the cukα wavelength of 1 54056 å at 40 kv and 30 ma was used for x ray diffraction xrd the data was obtained using a sample rotation 0 05 angular step at 3 s per step and analyzed with the aid of diffrac plus software the filtration performance of csgom was inspected using eqs 1 and 2 as straightforward method to determine the flux and hydraulic resistance 1 j v t 1 a 2 h r δp μ 1 j where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v the volume of permeate l

experimental temperature dye removal was evaluated by measuring the dye concentration using a uv vis4000n spectrophotometer dinko instruments spain at the corresponding maximum absorbance wavelength at 484 nm for ao7 597 nm for rb5 and 585 nm for db71 the decolorization percentage d was calculated using eq 3 3 d a o a a o 100 where a o and a are the absorbance of feed and treated samples for each biodegradation test respectively 2 4 microbial analysis the microbial diversity of the biofilm evolved during the anaerobic bioreduction of dye was examined using dna isolation kits norgen biotek corporation ref 64000 in this extraction technique the bio samples were collected from the membrane surface and its dna extracted 27 500 ng of extracted dna were used for library preparation to apply dna illumina sequencing employing illumina dna prep kit illumina inc all libraries were evaluated with the tapestation high sensitivity dna kit agilent technologies and quantified with qubit invitrogen corporation the filtered reads were matched to unique clade specific marker genes using metaphlan 3 to determine the taxonomic profile relative abundances and alpha diversity measures shannon and chao1 indexes were calculated using metaphlan s relative proportions 3 result and discussion 3 1 morphological structure of csgom x ray diffraction of the csgom 1 obtained by vacuum assisted method is presented in fig 3 the go crystal plane 0 0 1 is clearly visible at 2θ 11 5 with the interlayer spacing of 0 76 nm that is larger than graphite atomic spacing 0 33 nm 28 this suggests that the oxygen functional group attached to the edge of each layer raises the spacing between the layers which aids go exfoliation in the aqueous medium 29 there are no graphitic contaminants in the csgom 1 which is confirmed by the lack of peaks at 2θ 26 30 the peaks at 2θ 30 35 50 and 59 are due to the presence of tetragonal zro2 31 whereas the peaks at 2θ 28 43 54 and 69 owns to rutile form of tio2 32 in the ceramic support raman spectra shown in fig 4 can provide additional evidence for the presence of go in the csgom 1 high intensity peaks in the raman spectra of csgom 1 indicate the expected conjugated and carbon carbon double bonds of graphene in general the d peak is caused by sp3 carbon atoms with a disordered or defective carbon structure while the g peak is originated from the vibration of the aromatic structure of sp2 hybrid carbon atoms it also reflects the same characteristics as xrd whereas the tetragonal zro2 is observed at 262 cm 1 eg 33 and for rutile tio2 peaks at 448 cm 1 eg and 611 cm 1 a1g 34 the typical d and g bands for the csgom 1 are found at 1351 cm 1 and 1605 cm 1 respectively the quotient id ig the d and g band s intensity ratio is a common way to express the defect degree of materials it is found to be 1 02 for csgom 1 which is consistent with reported values in the literature 35 this ratio suggests that the go membrane is relatively stable and resistant to environment conditions furthermore the absence of a 2d band at 2700 cm 1 indicates that all the graphite layers were essentially oxidized during the oxide formation step 36 the morphology of both cs and csgom 1 were examined by fesem fig 5 a b demonstrates that both ceramic support and ceramic supported graphene oxide membranes are typical porous surfaces 22 37 part of the of the graphene oxide deposited on the ceramic support appears as an aggregate or was broken down into smaller particles that penetrated into the ceramic support to form a go zro2 composite 23 it seems that once the pores were shrinking or blocked the homogeneous go layer was formed over a first zone of the composite go zro2 and then over the original zro2 section probably interaction on the membrane surface is mainly due to the attraction between zro2 oxygens and either or both hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of graphene oxide 38 39 as expected the go layer deposited reduced the pore size of the virgin cs surface in addition to the visual inspection of the fesem images imagej software was used to analyze the surface pores of cs and csgom 1 compared to the cs it is found that the pore size of the csgom 1 is significantly lowered where more than 80 of the pores being around 25 nm in the range of transition from ultra to nanofiltration the cross sectional images of both cs and csgom 1 fig 5 c d revealed a clear disparity between the support and the membrane the bottom part in both cases is the titanium oxide layer there are then two more layers of zirconium oxide above the titanium oxide layer the smaller active porous layer and the intermediate porous layer however another layer is clearly visible in the csgom 1 which corresponds to the synthesized graphene oxide membrane this configuration is in line with that found by octávia et al 40 who demonstrated the fabrication of a uniform go zirconia composite membrane the 1 55 μm thick go layer is firmly adhered to the ceramic support indicating the success of csgom 1 preparation using the vacuum assisted method table 1 lists the go content and elementary composition of csgom synthesized with various concentrations of go solution as expected the go content 0 8 to 3 9 mg of the top layer of csgom increases in proportion to the initial solution concentration of membrane precursors the fesem edx analysis of the go membrane provided more detailed information about this layer composition as expected the results show that cs is made of zro2 and tio2 although the content of zirconia is higher than titania as the analysis rather falls upon the upper layer of the virgin layer described as a selective zirconia band in turn the csgom have a carbon rich layer on top 13 7 to 66 8 wt of carbon together with zro2 and tio2 the amount of carbon content is greater when increasing the concentration of exfoliated go solution during coating and subsequently the relative content of zro2 and tio2 is decreased obviously the data is in accordance with the fact that the incident beam energy 5 kev for all measurements penetrated a given depth through the csgom surface thus the thicker go layer on the membrane surface allows passing a shorter distance and therefore the analysis was able to quantify fewer elements deeper inside the membrane composite furthermore as the concentration of the precursor solution rises more go particles begin to penetrate the go zro2 composite layer which means deposited deep inside the ceramic support as a result the precursor concentration increases from 2 to 4 mg ml 1 had almost no significant changes in the carbon content measured on the membrane surface the multilayer 3d topography height and current profile of csgom 1 were investigated by using afm at a random area of 500 500 nm2 and csafm current sensing atomic force microscopy the data is shown in fig 6 a b the mean roughness and root mean square rms roughness analysis of the membrane surface yielded 7 5 and 9 4 nm respectively according to a rough estimate based on afm imaging with spip software most of the pores in csgom 1 were in the 17 33 nm range which compares well with estimates made by fesem the csafm images also provide the current distribution profile of the csgom 1 membrane fig 6b the results demonstrate the local conductance on graphene oxide surfaces which should enhance the rate of biodegradation through the electron shuttle mechanism 41 3 2 impact of the go layer on flux resistance a set of tests were conducted to investigate the effect of depositing different amounts of membrane precursor produced by varying the concentration of go solution on filtration characteristics represented by membrane flux and the derived parameters pure water permeability pwp and hydraulic resistance h r as expected the membrane without go cs showed the highest flux 62 3 l m 2 h 1 the pure water flux of the ceramic support zro2 tio2 based ultrafiltration flat membrane is mainly influenced by the membrane properties such as thickness homogeneity and porosity additional single or multilayer go was formed over the ceramic support in csgom resulting in an increment of hydraulic resistance moreover the go particles reduce the pore size of the ceramic support thus a membrane without the go always possessed the highest water flux similar results are shown in fig 7 where the flux decreased linearly with increasing go thickness which correlates with the increasing precursor concentration for csgom preparation 0 5 1 and 2 mg ml 1 go the lowest pure water flux 4 1 l m 2 h 1 was observed for the membrane made of 2 mg ml 1 of go solution csgom 2 in comparison to cs the pure water flux for csgom 0 5 csgom 1 csgom 2 dropped 63 83 and 93 respectively giménez et al 23 also found strong flux drops 47 and 77 for go membranes prepared from 0 05 and 0 5 mg ml 1 of go over a 0 04 μm pore size ceramic support the derived pwp follows these trends so cs exhibits maximum permeance 77 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and it then decreases up to 5 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for csgom 2 fig 7 from the permeances given in fig 7 the total resistance of the cs and csgom were estimated and the specific contribution of the go layer was calculated considering the ceramic support resistance to be constant in the membranes containing go the hydraulic resistance of the ceramic support was estimated to be as 5 2 0 1 1012 m 1 it has been noted that go load during preparation of graphene oxide membranes has a significant impact on permeate flux thus in the hydraulic resistance since permeate flux and hydraulic resistance are interconnected functions higher graphene oxide content membrane must result in more resistance during fabrication the ceramic support pores go zro2 region were first entirely filled and then formed on top the go multilayer it was also observed that the thickness of the deposited go layer grew as the go concentration was increased which in turn decreased the membrane flux 42 43 and increased the hydraulic resistance hence the csgom resistances increased from 1 51 0 04 1013 m 1 to 8 64 0 13 1013 m 1 as the concentration of go solution during coating increased from 0 5 to 2 mg ml 1 therefore the cs gives less than one third of the total resistance in csgom further increase of go concentration up to 4 mg ml 1 in csgom 4 preparation made the membrane essentially impermeable due to the formation of a very thick dense and nonporous go layer on the membrane surface that prevents water molecules from passing across 44 45 on the other hand a low concentration of go solution 0 5 mg ml 1 failed to form a uniform stable go ceramic membrane because of lack of carbon content and non homogeneous layer formation on the membrane surface lou et al 46 found that a membrane prepared from 0 05 0 10 and 0 5 mg ml 1 go solution was not good enough for practical application moreover in a membrane prepared with a high go concentration 4 mg ml 1 the go layer can peel up easily after swelling and detached from the surface therefore it is inferred that the csgom preparation technique must meet two critical requirements go load must be suitable to create a homogeneous and tightly bound go layer and permeate flux should be at the desired level in this study it was found that the csgom 1 with an estimated 1 55 μm go layer thickness showed a permeability of 13 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 this was comparable to other attempts available in the literature such as a polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous mat supported 8 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and an electrospray nanofiltration 11 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 go membrane 47 even though the carbon wall or channel is hydrophobic in nature the slip flow theory indicates that it can assist in transporting the liquid between the go layers 42 as per this principle the water molecules first proceed to the hydrophilic edges and defects of the go layer which act as a gate for water flow the liquids are usually deposited in those gates and then slip through the hydrophobic nanochannel as a result graphene oxide membrane displays acceptable permeate flux despite having a thicker layer based on these facts 0 5 and 1 mg ml 1 of go solution appears to be the optimum concentration for forming the membranes properly combining enough flux and robustness needed for the wastewater treatment process 3 3 role of the graphene oxide layer on anaerobic biodecolorization of azo dyes the capability of the graphene oxide membrane for anaerobic azo dye decolorization was checked out with and without the formation of biofilm four different reactor combinations were used mixed microbial consortium on cs b cs mixed microbial consortium on csgom b csgom no microbial consortium on cs r cs and no microbial consortium on csgom r csgom in all cases initially 50 mg l 1 feed solution of ao7 was used as it falls within the typical range 10 to 50 mg l 1 of dye concentrations in real textile effluents 48 in all the cases a constant flux of 0 05 l m 2 h 1 was maintained in a dead end filtration mode furthermore two graphene oxide membranes produced from 0 5 and 1 mg ml 1 of go solution csgom 0 5 and csgom 1 were used to investigate the impact of graphene oxide content on the decolorization process as above commented the thickness of the go layer on the membrane surface is easily adjusted by changing the precursor concentration since the membrane flux is dependent on the thickness of the deposited graphene oxide layer resistance of the csgom transmembrane pressure from 0 5 to 2 0 bar was adjusted in the experiments to maintain a constant flow irrespective of the different membrane thicknesses fig 8 includes the removal evolution for all the cases during a period of 10 days since the start until a steady operation was reached overall the results confirmed that the presence of the go layer had a significant effect on the decolorization of ao7 the color removal attained was larger at the highest go load b csgom 1 consisting of the membrane made of 1 mg ml 1 of go solution giving a decolorization of 99 all the reactors apparently showed a good efficiency during the first 12 h as they decolorized more than 75 of the azo dye solution actually this initial decolorization was basically due to the adsorption of the dye on the membrane surfaces so it is not a true removal once the membrane became saturated the color removal efficiency dropped suddenly except for b csgom 1 stabilizing rapidly around a mostly steady value the b cs and r cs completely lost any decolorization ability after two days in the case of r cs once saturated the membrane material the only possible mechanism to remove dyes could be the membrane retention which fails since the pore size of the support element uf range is too high in comparison to the dye dimensions nf range although b cs was operated with the mixed microbial consortium the desired biodecolorization did not occur because of the probable absence of an active biofilm or even microorganisms on the ceramic support which can probably be ascribed to the fact that the permeate flow washed out the bacteria before forming a biofilm because of their size relatively smaller than the support pores after four days of operation the decolorization rate stabilized at approximately 22 for r csgom 1 and 10 after six days with r csgom 0 5 in this case the membranes are partially able to retain the dye due to the nano sized pores of the csgom surface created after go layer formation therefore this limited capacity of dye removal can essentially be attributed to molecular sieving mechanism only for b csgoms blue and brown circles in fig 8 there was a true biodegradation of the dye the highest decolorization 98 was observed for the b csgom 1 prepared with a concentration of 1 mg ml 1 of go whereas only 51 of color removal was observed using b csgom 0 5 made from 0 5 mg ml 1 go only dye decomposition caused by the anaerobic action of the microorganisms can account for the high level of decolorization observed in this study however a great difference is observed between the performance of the b csgom 1 and b csgom 0 5 where the load of go seems to favor the biodecomposition to form an efficient biofilm or anaerobic membrane scaffold microorganisms must be selectively attached to the graphene oxide surface the essence of the microbial activity and the consistency of the go layer have a direct impact on adhesion performance thus the improved performance in b csgoms was due to the concurrent occurrence of physical sieving and anaerobic biodegradation as in previous studies using ceramic supported carbon based membrane bioreactors 22 the go layer of b csgom also played a triple role in the anaerobic decolorization of azo dyes since it performs as a pollutant immobilizer support for the biofilm and electron transporter graphene oxide membranes are more conductive than matrimid based carbon membranes 22 thus contributing to a faster electron shuttle mediator mechanism moreover the surface of the nanoporous graphene oxide membrane improves the microbial metabolism and retains the degradation products which globally enhances the decolorization performance 49 compared with previous studies the upflow packed bed reactor filled with biological activated carbon with a similar objective 50 the b csgom 1 was also stabilized in a shorter retention time to achieve the almost complete 99 decolorization of ao7 on the other hand our configuration shows better performance if compared to other attempts based on go shital et al 51 assessed ao7 removal by adsorption with reduced graphene oxide rgo combined rgo photolysis rgo oxidation with h2o2 and rgo oxidation with photo radiation process and found 10 removal by rgo alone and a maximum of 80 by combined rgo oxidation with uv radiation since go plays a critical role in this process it was expected that its load in the go layer impact someway on the dye removal for instance in an oxidation process lee et al 52 investigated go load and discovered that the increase of the load improved the dye removal efficiency as previously noted fesem edx measurements table 1 confirmed the increase of the go concentration in the precursor solution from 0 5 to 1 mg ml 1 improves the go content of csgom from 0 8 to 2 6 mg this latter higher load creates a membrane with smaller pore size responsible of dye adsorption and biofilm immobilization therefore both enhanced 53 moreover the carbon rich csgom enhances the redox mediator role due to the greater availability of sites with redox properties which also contributes to improve the biodegradation performance fig 8 corroborates this trend as raise of carbon content from 13 7 to 49 4 on csgom 1 almost doubled the decolorization from 51 to 98 further application of a csgom 2 and csgom 4 as commented above gave a less or non permeable membrane so the csgom 1 was taken as the most favorable balance between flux and decolorization 3 4 effect of flux and feed concentration on azo dye decolorization the effect of feed concentration and permeate flux on the decolorization process of b csgom 1 was evaluated by varying ao7 concentrations 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 and permeate fluxes 0 05 0 075 and 0 10 l m 2 h 1 all experiments were conducted for 30 days continuous operation with a flow of 0 05 l m 2 h 1 within the first 10 days 0 075 l m 2 h 1 for the second 10 days and finally at 0 10 l m 2 h 1 until the end the transmembrane pressure tmp was adjusted when needed to keep a constant permeate flux though slight accumulated membrane fouling during the process would lower the permeate flux if not corrected fig 9 depicts the change in ao7 decolorization for the three feed concentrations tested during the three periods of different permeate flux as can be seen irrespective of the conditions the decolorization reached over 90 although the expected trends for feed concentration and permeate flux were observed b csgom 1 with a feed concentration of 50 mg l 1 and a permeate flux of 0 05 l m 2 h 1 achieved the maximum ao7 removal 99 at a higher permeate flux 0 10 l m 2 h 1 the decolorization slightly decreased to 97 95 and 93 at the ao7 feed solution concentrations of 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 respectively along with fig 9 table 2 illustrates the amount of dye removed and the percentage of decolorization during the b csgom 1 process it is worth noting that when the feed concentration and permeate flux increase decolorization usually reduces but the amount of decolorized dye is progressively growing in this experiment a maximum equivalent consumption of 9 3 mg m 2 h 1 was obtained for 100 mg l 1 ao7 at a 0 10 l m 2 h 1 flux color removal was thoroughly stable at the low flux region with no significant differences observed for the three different feed concentrations the low permeate flow allowed the dye molecules to interact with bacteria enough time to reach large biodegradation 54 after 30 days of operation even increasing permeate flux the b csgom 1 gave around 99 of azo dye decolorization for the 50 mg l 1 feed solution increasing the flux even the falling decolorization percentage the absolute amount of ao7 removal by the b csgom 1 increased from 2 5 to 4 7 mg m 2 h 1 these decolorization and dye removal findings concluded that the amount of biomass was sufficient to assure almost complete biodegradation of the dye anyway even when the ao7 feed concentration and permeate flux doubled the microorganisms were able to attain high levels of decolorization thus the decolorization for 75 and 100 mg l 1 feed solution at 0 075 and 0 10 l m 2 h 1 flux was only reduced to 98 95 and 97 93 respectively simultaneously the total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod of each dye solution were reduced by more than 85 and 95 respectively in all conditions the effluent properties achieved by b csgom 1 were highly suitable for environmental emissions details are given in table a besides these conditions furnish more absolute dye removal which reach 7 1 and 9 3 mg m 2 h 1 for 75 and 100 mg l 1 feed solutions respectively the results were much better than those obtained using conventional discontinuous biological systems at several ao7 concentrations 50 55 56 in a similar reactor configuration and operations conditions using carbon based membranes instead of go 22 the decolorization attained was 58 45 and 36 for 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 of ao7 solutions respectively while over 93 removal was achieved using the present b csgom 1 in the ranges tested this suggests that the go plays a dominant role during the dye biodegradation being much more efficient than carbon based membrane made using matrimid 5218 as a precursor 22 probably the potential of go as a redox mediator enhanced the transfer of electrons to the azo bond of the dye molecule leading to easier cleavage of the azo bond 57 however regardless of the color removal this compact bioreactor unit is more compatible with higher feed concentration and permeate flux to remove the amount of azo dye as the microorganisms of the b csgom 1 is highly capable of coping with the growing dye loads consequently it might be more productive to operate the b csgom 1 at a greater permeate flux 3 5 comparative decolorization of azo dyes a comparative biodecolorization of three structurally different azo dyes mono azo ao7 diazo rb5 and triazo db71 were investigated in the anaerobic b csgom 1s under various permeate fluxes and feed concentrations the extent of decolorization of azo dye solutions varied depending on the number of azo bonds present in the dye structure fig 10 a c illustrates this fact in general for the three azo dyes the decolorization declined as feed concentration and permeate fluxes increased as expected for all experimental conditions mono azo ao7 dye reported the highest color removal 99 93 which was significantly higher than for diazo 96 85 and triazo 92 81 dyes franciscon et al 58 previously demonstrated that the monoazo dye removal was faster and more efficient than diazo and triazo using a sequential microaerophilic aerobic treatment with klebsiella sp strain vn 3 anyway the absolute quantity of dye removal for all azo dyes as well progresses with increasing feed concentration or permeate flux although it reduces when raising the number of azo bonds and ao7 hence exhibits the highest dye removal of 9 3 mg m 2 h 1 while db71 the lowest 8 1 mg m 2 h 1 it must be considered that the contact time directly related to the permeate flux can affect the removal capacity which is also varied depending on dye properties and microorganism behavior against each specific dye 59 in b csgom 1 as when increasing feed concentration a higher permeate flux adds additional dye load with more chromophores and auxochromes content in the decolorization process additionally the high flux minimizes biomass retention time within the bioreactor thereby declining microbial biodecolorization 60 61 as a result under high feed concentration 100 mg l 1 changing permeate flux from 0 05 to 0 075 l m 2 h 1 and finally to 0 10 l m 2 h 1 the decolorization reduced to 93 for ao7 85 for rb5 and 81 for db71 the corresponding dye removal for ao7 rb5 and db71 was calculated to be 9 3 8 5 and 8 07 mg m 2 h 1 respectively under identical operating conditions the structural properties and nature of the azo dyes for example meta ortho and para position of the electron withdrawing groups no2 cn so3h so2nh2 to azo bond presence of electron releasing groups oh r nh2 and other functional groups ch3 och3 the number of azo bonds and high molecular weight of the dye molecules have been reported to cause variations in decolorization rate 62 64 increase of both permeate flux and feed dye concentration brought more reactive groups into the anaerobic bioreactor it has been reported that an excess amount of so3h groups in the azo dye structure readily reduced microbial growth 65 in addition a rise of toxicity in the degradation process led to inadequate biomass to dye ratio and spoiled the active sites of the biofilm consequently microbial biomass yield at higher feed concentration probably remains lower due to excess dye toxicity to microorganisms compatible trends can be seen in fig 10 a c in which the percentage of decolorization of ao7 declines as the initial feed concentration or permeate flux increases anyway it has been proved that the bioreactor configuration here introduced successfully decolorized the various azo dyes tested in line with results reported elsewhere 22 66 3 6 microbial community analysis since the active biofilm evolved from conventional secondary sludge taken from a municipal wwtp after an acclimation period it is interesting to elucidate which type of microorganism remained prevalent for the dye biodegradation therefore fesem analysis was applied to measure the presence of microorganisms in the b csgom biofilm after the db71 biodegradation fig 11 a b displays the surface and cross sectional view of the biofilm formed over the go layer on the biofilm surface significant quantities of microorganisms with an average size of 1 51 μm were detected cross section analysis revealed a biofilm thickness of about 1 83 μm over the go membrane fig 11c the biofilm specimen of distinct b csgom 1 bioreactors was used to extract the dna of bacteria three dna samples were collected from the csgom 1 bioreactors operated with 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 of db71 solutions and were then compared with the original anaerobic sludge inoculum dna illumina sequencing was used to examine the microbial populations of bacteria archaea viruses and single celled eukaryotes in these four samples the sequencing run produced 32 8 million reads that reduce to 30 6 million reads after quality filtering although raw anaerobic sludge contained both bacteria and archaea no archaea were found after bioreactor operation fig 12 depicts the schematic bar diagram and comparison of bacterial phyla for the four samples according to species richness chao1 indexes show that anaerobic sludge 15 24 was the most diverse and b csgom 1 with 50 mg l 1 db71 7 54 was less overall among the 53 bacterial taxonomic units otus the species pseudomonas guangdongensis was the most prevalent in all samples while geobacter sulfurreducens was abundant in all biofilms but not in the initial anaerobic sludge in all cases bacterial growth solely depended on the concentration of feed solution for example the presence of a significant number of geobacter sulfurreducens 35 was observed in the biofilm that treated 100 mg l 1 db71 solution and the lowest 7 was found for 50 mg l 1 of db71 solution similarly presence of pseudomonas guangdongensis in biofilm was enhanced increasing inflow dye concentration but the highest was still in the original anaerobic sludge the results revealed that activities of both geobacter sulfurreducens and pseudomonas guangdongensis were increased with increasing dye concentration several studies have proven the role of geobacter sulfurreducens in the anaerobic biodegradation of azo dye solution 67 68 moreover the extracellular electron transfer capability of geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter soli might enable them to play an important role during the biodecolorization process 69 in addition geobacter anodireducens which were present in b csgom 1 can exchange more electrons and more rapidly than geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter soli 70 higher content of these bacteria in b csgom 1 operated with 50 mg l 1 of db71 could contribute to get a more stable and better decolorization performance as shown in fig 10a nevertheless other bacterial species such as stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila 71 pseudomonas guangdongensis 72 cupriavidus metallidurans 73 were known as a potential decolorizing organism all they were significantly present in b csgom biofilm and probably took part in the decolorization 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a dead end membrane filtration element with a ceramic supported graphene oxide layer has been used for anaerobic azo dye decolorization different concentrations of go solution were examined to investigate their formation of csgom and subsequent performance over the anaerobic biodecolorization process due to the suitable membrane permeability resistance and maximum decolorization during the azo dye removal process csgom 1 made from 1 mg ml 1 go solution was identified as the optimal for this integrated compact bioreactor that provides a novel robust and effective color removal process the conductive surface of the go membrane enhances faster electron transfer in b csgom if compared to other carbon based processes reported in all operating conditions the dye removal performance for monoazo ao7 was stable and higher than for rb5 and db71 high decolorization rates of structurally distinct azo dyes 99 for ao7 96 for rb5 and 92 for db71 were achieved at the lowest permeate flux 0 05 l m 2 h 1 and feed concentration 50 mg l 1 the microbial community found in the b csgom 1 mainly contained anaerobic geobacter soli anodireducens sulfurreducens and pseudomonas guangdongensis all are
