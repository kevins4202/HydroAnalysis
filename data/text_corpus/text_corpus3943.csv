19715,treatment of wastewater for potable reuse requires the reduction of enteric viruses to levels that pose no significant risk to human health advanced water treatment trains e g chemical clarification reverse osmosis ultrafiltration advanced oxidation have been developed to provide reductions of viruses to differing levels of regulatory control depending upon the levels of human exposure and associated health risks importance in any assessment is information on the concentration and types of viruses in the untreated wastewater as well as the degree of removal by each treatment process however it is critical that the uncertainty associated with virus concentration and removal or inactivation by wastewater treatment be understood to improve these estimates and identifying research needs we reviewed the critically literature to assess to identify uncertainty in these estimates biological diversity within families and genera of viruses e g enteroviruses rotaviruses adenoviruses reoviruses noroviruses and specific virus types e g serotypes or genotypes creates the greatest uncertainty these aspects affect the methods for detection and quantification of viruses and anticipated removal efficiency by treatment processes approaches to reduce uncertainty may include 1 inclusion of a virus indicator for assessing efficiency of virus concentration and detection by molecular methods for each sample 2 use of viruses most resistant to individual treatment processes e g adenoviruses for uv light disinfection and reoviruses for chlorination 3 data on ratio of virion or genome copies to infectivity in untreated wastewater and 4 assessment of virus removal at field scale treatment systems to verify laboratory and pilot plant data for virus removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords virus reduction recycled water reuse risk assessment 1 introduction since domestic wastewater will always contain microbial pathogens it is important that when intended for reuse applications pathogens must be reduced to levels that do not have an impact on public health microbial risk assessments are useful to provide guidance for the needed reductions for treatment process to minimize risks of infection nrc 2012 among the pathogen groups found in wastewater viruses present the greatest risk because they generally occur in much greater concentrations and have a much greater infectivity i e higher probability of infection with a given exposure than bacteria and parasitic protozoa with close to 200 species of enteric viruses which can occur in wastewater they represent the greatest number of different species of enteric pathogens gerba et al 2017 minimum log reduction values of viruses by treatment trains designed for recycling of wastewater has been suggested recycled water intended for irrigation of edible crops requires a 6 7 log reduction who 2006 and for potable reuse applications i e groundwater recharge and augmentation of surface water supply reservoirs a 12 log reduction has been suggested title 22 and 17 california code of regulations 2015 these reductions are based on assuming infective virus concentrations of 105 to 106 per liter in raw wastewater based on datasets collected in previous studies harwood et al 2005 rose et al 2005 recent application of molecular methods in wastewater and recycled water settings suggests that some pathogenic viruses may be occurring in concentrations of upwards of 107 to 109 genome copies per liter gerba et al 2017 eftim et al 2017 however it is still unknown the relative proportions of infectious to non infectious virus in these sample types viruses in raw sewage are more likely to be infectious due to direct excretion with feces moreover their survival in sewage is facilitated by organic debris of the clinical matrix in which the virus is shed e g feces or vomit and virus aggregation formation offering protection in the route to new human hosts rusiñol and girones 2017 several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of risk reduction by different treatment processes for pathogens present in untreated wastewater and at the same time quantifying the risks from viruses nrc 2012 olivieri et al 2014 who 2017 soller et al 2018 however most have not addressed the uncertainty in these estimates associated with the factors listed in table 1 exposure usually presents the greatest amount of uncertainty in risk estimation haas et al 2014 here we review those factors which exert the greatest influence on uncertainty in risk assessment for viruses in recycled treatment systems 2 factors influencing uncertainty in risk assessment for viruses in recycled water 2 1 estimating virus concentrations in water knowing the concentration of infectious viruses in raw sewage entering a treatment facility is critical in assessing the needed efficacy of the entire processes in reducing viruses to acceptable levels recent advances in molecular biological methods have revealed that levels of viruses in untreated raw sewage are much greater than previously thought gerba et al 2017 applications of these advanced molecular based methods to raw sewage indicate that enteric virus levels can reach levels of 9 800 000 000 per liter it has been documented that some viruses such as adenoviruses are much more abundant in wastewater and occur at higher concentration 1000 fold or more than other common enteric viruses kitajima et al 2014 in addition real world data on the removal of naturally occurring viruses through wastewater treatment needs further assessment however determining the number of infectious viruses in water is challenging because no single method can detect all of the infectious viruses that may be present molecular methods which detect the nucleic acids of viruses do not inform us as to their infectivity methods for determining the infectivity of human viruses depend on documenting their replication in cell culture enteroviruses e g poliovirus were among the first viruses grown in animal cell culture and have been the most studied in water wastewater numerous methods for detecting virus replication in cell culture have been developed payment and trudel 1993 however no single cell culture system can be used for all enteric viruses the propagation of viruses in cell culture followed by detection by the polymerase chain reaction pcr assay termed integrated cell culture icc pcr provides a new procedure for monitoring infectious viruses that do not induce cytopathic effect or plaques in cell culture reynolds et al 1996 chapron et al 2000 this method also has the advantage of reducing the time for virus detection and increasing detection sensitivity unfortunately only small number of the enteric virus types found in wastewater can replicate in routine cell culture even then different virus types require different cell culture lines and the susceptibility of the cell line to a particular virus may change over time in the laboratory payment and trudel 1993 chapron et al 2000 condit 2013 in addition the cultivation of naturally occurring viruses in wastewater may be less efficient than cultivation of laboratory adapted strains which have been selected for rapid growth for example ward et al 1984 found that only one virion of rotavirus in 46 000 in stool resulted in observable growth in cell culture adaptation of the virus by two passages in cell culture resulted in a decrease in that ratio to 1 6600 in addition one virus may mask the presence of other viruses in cell culture because of different growth rates or other factors calgua et al 2002 carducci et al 2002 the method selected for assay can also affect the results i e suspended cell culture methods usually give a greater number of isolates versus the commonly used monolayer method slade et al 1984 given the variety of factors influencing viruses known to grow in cell culture the efficiency may range from 0 01 to perhaps 50 ikner et al 2012 to overcome the limitations encountered with cell culture methods intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide pma in conjunction with real time pcr rt qpcr or qpcr for rna or dna viruses respectively pma rt qpcr qpcr have been used to determine the potential infectivity of enteric rna and dna viruses in water and other environmental matrices parshionikar et al 2010 karim et al 2015 leifels et al 2015 fongaro et al 2016 however current methods are still limited in this assessment rodriguez et al 2009 success of such methods depends on knowledge of the mechanism of inactivation of a particular virus and the site of action of a particular disinfectant rodriguez et al 2009 coudray meunier et al 2013 gall et al 2015 prevost et al 2016 in addition complicating this approach is that some viruses such as adenoviruses rendered non infectious by ultraviolet light can use host cell enzymes to repair dna damages on their genome day et al 1975 inactivated viruses can still cause infection in cells through multiplicity reactivation mcclain and spendlove 1966 this occurs when two viruses with their nucleic acids damaged in different regions of their genomes infect the same host cell resulting in a complete genome capable of replication multiplicity reactivation mr involves the infection of a cell by the cooperative effort of two or more uv and gamma irradiated damaged viruses none of which is completely functional alone luria 1947 sharp and dunlap 1966 barry 1961 compliment reactivation was first described by luria to account for infection of escherichia coli by two or more bacteriophages exposed to ultraviolet light which resulted in increased titer compared to infection by a single phage mr has been demonstrated in cells of an organized host including vaccinia virus influenza virus poliovirus adenovirus and reovirus yamamoto and shimojo 1971 mcclain and spendlove 1966 the different reovirus types t1l t2j t3d have been demonstrated to undergo compliment reactivation among each other after exposure to uv light mcclain and spendlove 1966 mr was also observed in hydrogen peroxide damages to the dna of phage t4 thus mr may occur with chemical disinfectants as well as irradiation chen and berstein 1987 2 2 molecular methods for virus detection methods based on qpcr have become the standard for the detection and quantification of viruses in water especially difficult to culture ones such as human noroviruses girones et al 2010 rodríguez lázaro et al 2012 nevertheless it is also true that the results obtained from qpcr are somewhat considered limited due to uncertainties introduced by a variety of environmental factors and method variability wu et al 2013 data on concentration of viruses in water based on molecular detection methods are influenced by a number of factors variability and uncertainty in virus concentration efficiency and qpcr quantification needs to be taken into account when estimating virus occurrence and concentration in aquatic environments girones et al 2010 rajal et al 2007 there are several major causes of variability in qpcr quantification of viral genomes and they are summarized in table 1 virus detection results for a specific sample can vary according to the following factors 1 sample matrix environmental samples contain variable amounts of inhibitory substances e g humic and fulvic acids heavy metals target dna rna and non target dna rna which largely depends on the type of sample matrix sewage surface water groundwater etc 2 sample processing a variety of virus concentration methods size exclusion adsorption elution flocculation or combination of methods have been used ikner et al 2012 pang et al 2012 gentry shields et al 2013 la rosa and muscillo 2013 hata et al 2015 gibson and borchardt 2016 which introduces substantial variability in virus recovery efficiencies and amount of inhibitory substances in the virus concentrate additionally some virus concentration methods require the use of elution buffers such as beef extract that exhibit inhibitory effects on downstream molecular detection rock et al 2010 nucleic acid extraction is considered a critical step in accurate detection and quantification of viral genomes by qpcr burgener et al 2003 iker et al 2013 different nucleic acid extraction methods kits result in various amounts and purity of the extracted nucleic acid burgener et al 2003 iker et al 2013 sidhu et al 2013 3 molecular detection this can also be referred as measurement error or variability due to pcr inhibition the factors introducing variability include number of replicates qpcr assay design primer probe design thermal cycling conditions and pcr amplification efficiency different qpcr assays may not be equally susceptible to inhibitory effects by substances co extracted with viral nucleic acids in addition each investigator has a choice of distinct qpcr instruments based on slightly different technologies as well as a wide range of commercial enzymes that are refined by unique reaction buffer components depending on manufacturer viral rna detection requires cdna synthesis process prior to qpcr which introduces additional factors affecting variability in an rt qpcr assay e g one two step rt qpcr rt primers enzyme temperature profile the investigator can choose and mix the components mentioned above but overall details of their performance remain dependent on the instrument reagent manufacturer nonetheless it is also true that noise introduced into the assay can be inherent in any qpcr experiment in order to address these issues and problems with the resulting body of literature a set of guidelines have been published that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qpcr experiments bustin et al 2009 2 3 methods for virus concentration from water wastewater the detection of viruses usually requires their concentration from large volumes of water wastewater in the case of untreated wastewater only a liter is often needed but when assessing water wastewater treatment processes volumes of 10 to 1000 l are often processed to reach appropriate equivalent sample volumes again the type of virus and its physicochemical properties play a role in the efficiency of the concentration process manipulation involved in the process such as changes in ph addition of adsorbents and eluents have differing effects on different viruses ikner et al 2012 pang et al 2012 gibson and borchardt 2016 most methods were originally developed for the concentration of enteroviruses with the vaccine strains of poliovirus more commonly used as a model gerba and goyal 1982 berg 1987 more recently the efficiency of other groups of viruses have also been assessed haramoto et al 2009 dong et al 2010 ikner et al 2012 cashdollar et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 water quality properties such as turbidity ph dissolved organic matter inorganic compounds harness presence of divalent cations and other physicochemical properties such as salinity can affect the recovery of viruses rajal et al 2007 lukasik et al 2000 gibson and borchardt 2016 alum et al 2014 with the advent of molecular methods there has been an increase in the use of non target animal viruses added to samples during processing to measure the efficiency of detection for every sample rajal et al 2007 such an approach to assess the efficiency of concentration for samples in which infectivity is to be determined by cell culture assays would be useful but currently is seldom conducted 2 4 virus aggregation virus aggregation plays a role in both the survival of viruses in the environment and resistance to disinfectants gerba and betancourt 2017 the number of aggregated viruses may be as much as 90 of the total virus population narang and codd 1981 depending upon how they are formed viral aggregates form within living cells during infection but may also form due to changes in water quality the presence of particulates or induced by residual disinfectants aggregates may range from simple pairs to up to thousands of virions aggregates may be permanently stable or disaggregate upon changes in water quality i e lower or increase in ionic strength gerba and betancourt 2017 thus the potential exists that disaggregation may significantly increase the number of infectious virions in solution after a treatment process that effects ph or the types and concentrations of inorganic salts in solution in addition aggregated viruses in cell culture are often only counted as one infectious virus i e results in only one countable plaque in a cell monolayer galasso et al 1964 however they may represent thousands of potentially infectious viruses and have a greater probability of infection when ingested and may affect probability of infection gerba and betancourt 2017 2 5 disinfection in addition to the type of disinfectant and its concentration dose numerous factors intrinsic to the nature and behavior of viruses affect the efficacy of disinfection processes gall et al 2015 disinfectants may have different sites of action on the target virus capsid vs nucleic acid specific sites of the proteins in the capsid or nucleic acid may also be involved wigginton and kohn 2012 in the disinfection efficiency in addition various doses of the same disinfectant may have different modes of action against viruses as in the case of chlorine on poliovirus o brien and newman 1979 the resistance of viruses to a disinfectant may also vary among the same type of virus payment et al 1985 reported isolation of coxsackievirus from chlorinated drinking water that had ct values more than 10 times greater than laboratory strains of the same virus type zhong et al 2017 has shown that changes in the protein responsible for inactivation of echovirus 11 can result in increased resistance to chlorine dioxide much of our knowledge on concentration dose of disinfectants to inactivate viruses is based on laboratory studies under highly controlled conditions with monodispersed viruses often suspended in demand free containers and solutions sobsey 1989 gerba et al 2003 this is very much unlike full scale treatment plants where aggregates and particulate associated viruses may be present hejkal et al 1981 in addition the presence of soluble organic matter and other chemicals may exert a demand on the disinfectant gerba 2015 there is also uncertainty on how well laboratory data reflects removal by a full scale treatment process laboratory studies indicate that reoviruses are the most sensitive viruses to chlorine disinfection liu et al 1971 yet they are among the most common viruses detected in chlorinated wastewater betancourt and gerba 2016 questions remain on what information is needed to extrapolate laboratory studies to plant operations with respect to virus inactivation by disinfection processes 2 6 physical removal by filtration processes membranes such as microfiltration or ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis are often used in advanced treatment processes to further reduce particulates including microorganisms and chemical constituents studies have shown that while effective neither filtration method are absolute barriers to all viruses although the size of the majority of pores i e nominal pore size is much smaller than most viruses there can still remain pathways by which viruses can pass through these membranes including o ring breakages membrane perforations etc california reuse criteria currently do not give credit for virus removal for ultrafiltration and allow 1 2 log removal credit for reverse osmosis nrc 2012 virus removal appears not to be affected as much by size of the virus as by its hydrophobicity and electrostatic surface properties including those of the membrane for example ms2 bacteriophage is removed to a greater degree than phix 174 by reverse osmosis wu et al 2016 this may be due the greater hydrophobicity of ms2 over phix 174 ms2 is the most hydrophobic non lipid virus known shields and farrah 2002 jin et al 2000 used this phenomenon to explain the difference in the greater removal of ms2 by unsaturated soil columns with much greater retention of the ms2 at the air interface than phix 174 virus retention by reverse osmosis membranes may vary significantly based on the type of membrane and virus type wu et al 2016 3 reducing uncertainty since regulations for the reduction of viruses are required in california to ensure the safety of recycled water destined for potable reuse is important that the uncertainty in any calculations involving log reductions be taken into consideration to ensure these objectives are met title 22 and 17 california code of regulations 2015 goals for virus reduction or inactivation depends upon the concentration of the virus in the wastewater and the effectiveness of each treatment process ito et al 2016 table 2 attempts to quantify the range of uncertainty that may be associated with some of the important factors in assessing virus reduction by treatment processes as can be seen the range in estimates may vary by orders of magnitude however approaches are available to reduce this uncertainty table 3 while unable to be completely resolved it is suggested that uncertainty can be reduced by using positive controls to assess the efficiency of concentration and assay methods for every sample that is processed such controls internal amplification controls iac have been developed for molecular methods such as qpcr that take into consideration both concentration method and detection by qpcr rajal et al 2007 hata et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014 while more challenging for cell culture methods attempts should be better made by combining both molecular and cell culture methods such as icc pcr reynolds et al 1996 to better understand the impact of the matrix on the viral target as well as the method performance itself and the relationship between both culture and molecular based methods information on the concentration s and variability of emerging enteric pathogens in relation to known viral pathogens in untreated raw wastewater is needed to ensure that levels of viruses in the treated water meet an acceptable risk of infection for its intended purpose additionally more comprehensive data are needed on the resistance of naturally occurring viruses to treatment processes in full scale or pilot plant settings this is especially needed for disinfection processes since laboratory data with limited number of virus types in demand free buffers may not always reflect the resistance of naturally occurring virus types or their physical state e g aggregation consideration should also be given to developing indicators or surrogates for virus removal inactivation for the various processes in an advanced treatment train based on the most difficult to remove based on size hydrophobicity isoelectric point or most resistant virus to the specific treatment process for example adenoviruses are the most resistant known viruses to ultraviolet light and could be considered an indicator of performance for this process eischeid et al 2011 gerba et al 2002 while reovirus may be considered for disinfection processes due to its resistance to chlorine betancourt and gerba 2016 still yet other viruses could be considered for assessing the performance of ultrafiltration reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation processes based on their retention or resistance to these processes 4 conclusions in conclusion enhanced efforts are needed to better quantify and account for uncertainties with the removal inactivation of viruses by treatment processes designed for producing purified water this is essential to better ensure public confidence that risk targets are met and human health is protected until we fully address these uncertainties related to viral detection removal it is prudent to uses rt qpcr viral data in microbial risk assessments as documented for norovirus van abel et al 2017 dose response models that account for virus aggregation and non aggregation are also

virus aggregation virus aggregation plays a role in both the survival of viruses in the environment and resistance to disinfectants gerba and betancourt 2017 the number of aggregated viruses may be as much as 90 of the total virus population narang and codd 1981 depending upon how they are formed viral aggregates form within living cells during infection but may also form due to changes in water quality the presence of particulates or induced by residual disinfectants aggregates may range from simple pairs to up to thousands of virions aggregates may be permanently stable or disaggregate upon changes in water quality i e lower or increase in ionic strength gerba and betancourt 2017 thus the potential exists that disaggregation may significantly increase the number of infectious virions in solution after a treatment process that effects ph or the types and concentrations of inorganic salts in solution in addition aggregated viruses in cell culture are often only counted as one infectious virus i e results in only one countable plaque in a cell monolayer galasso et al 1964 however they may represent thousands of potentially infectious viruses and have a greater probability of infection when ingested and may affect probability of infection gerba and betancourt 2017 2 5 disinfection in addition to the type of disinfectant and its concentration dose numerous factors intrinsic to the nature and behavior of viruses affect the efficacy of disinfection processes gall et al 2015 disinfectants may have different sites of action on the target virus capsid vs nucleic acid specific sites of the proteins in the capsid or nucleic acid may also be involved wigginton and kohn 2012 in the disinfection efficiency in addition various doses of the same disinfectant may have different modes of action against viruses as in the case of chlorine on poliovirus o brien and newman 1979 the resistance of viruses to a disinfectant may also vary among the same type of virus payment et al 1985 reported isolation of coxsackievirus from chlorinated drinking water that had ct values more than 10 times greater than laboratory strains of the same virus type zhong et al 2017 has shown that changes in the protein responsible for inactivation of echovirus 11 can result in increased resistance to chlorine dioxide much of our knowledge on concentration dose of disinfectants to inactivate viruses is based on laboratory studies under highly controlled conditions with monodispersed viruses often suspended in demand free containers and solutions sobsey 1989 gerba et al 2003 this is very much unlike full scale treatment plants where aggregates and particulate associated viruses may be present hejkal et al 1981 in addition the presence of soluble organic matter and other chemicals may exert a demand on the disinfectant gerba 2015 there is also uncertainty on how well laboratory data reflects removal by a full scale treatment process laboratory studies indicate that reoviruses are the most sensitive viruses to chlorine disinfection liu et al 1971 yet they are among the most common viruses detected in chlorinated wastewater betancourt and gerba 2016 questions remain on what information is needed to extrapolate laboratory studies to plant operations with respect to virus inactivation by disinfection processes 2 6 physical removal by filtration processes membranes such as microfiltration or ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis are often used in advanced treatment processes to further reduce particulates including microorganisms and chemical constituents studies have shown that while effective neither filtration method are absolute barriers to all viruses although the size of the majority of pores i e nominal pore size is much smaller than most viruses there can still remain pathways by which viruses can pass through these membranes including o ring breakages membrane perforations etc california reuse criteria currently do not give credit for virus removal for ultrafiltration and allow 1 2 log removal credit for reverse osmosis nrc 2012 virus removal appears not to be affected as much by size of the virus as by its hydrophobicity and electrostatic surface properties including those of the membrane for example ms2 bacteriophage is removed to a greater degree than phix 174 by reverse osmosis wu et al 2016 this may be due the greater hydrophobicity of ms2 over phix 174 ms2 is the most hydrophobic non lipid virus known shields and farrah 2002 jin et al 2000 used this phenomenon to explain the difference in the greater removal of ms2 by unsaturated soil columns with much greater retention of the ms2 at the air interface than phix 174 virus retention by reverse osmosis membranes may vary significantly based on the type of membrane and virus type wu et al 2016 3 reducing uncertainty since regulations for the reduction of viruses are required in california to ensure the safety of recycled water destined for potable reuse is important that the uncertainty in any calculations involving log reductions be taken into consideration to ensure these objectives are met title 22 and 17 california code of regulations 2015 goals for virus reduction or inactivation depends upon the concentration of the virus in the wastewater and the effectiveness of each treatment process ito et al 2016 table 2 attempts to quantify the range of uncertainty that may be associated with some of the important factors in assessing virus reduction by treatment processes as can be seen the range in estimates may vary by orders of magnitude however approaches are available to reduce this uncertainty table 3 while unable to be completely resolved it is suggested that uncertainty can be reduced by using positive controls to assess the efficiency of concentration and assay methods for every sample that is processed such controls internal amplification controls iac have been developed for molecular methods such as qpcr that take into consideration both concentration method and detection by qpcr rajal et al 2007 hata et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014 while more challenging for cell culture methods attempts should be better made by combining both molecular and cell culture methods such as icc pcr reynolds et al 1996 to better understand the impact of the matrix on the viral target as well as the method performance itself and the relationship between both culture and molecular based methods information on the concentration s and variability of emerging enteric pathogens in relation to known viral pathogens in untreated raw wastewater is needed to ensure that levels of viruses in the treated water meet an acceptable risk of infection for its intended purpose additionally more comprehensive data are needed on the resistance of naturally occurring viruses to treatment processes in full scale or pilot plant settings this is especially needed for disinfection processes since laboratory data with limited number of virus types in demand free buffers may not always reflect the resistance of naturally occurring virus types or their physical state e g aggregation consideration should also be given to developing indicators or surrogates for virus removal inactivation for the various processes in an advanced treatment train based on the most difficult to remove based on size hydrophobicity isoelectric point or most resistant virus to the specific treatment process for example adenoviruses are the most resistant known viruses to ultraviolet light and could be considered an indicator of performance for this process eischeid et al 2011 gerba et al 2002 while reovirus may be considered for disinfection processes due to its resistance to chlorine betancourt and gerba 2016 still yet other viruses could be considered for assessing the performance of ultrafiltration reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation processes based on their retention or resistance to these processes 4 conclusions in conclusion enhanced efforts are needed to better quantify and account for uncertainties with the removal inactivation of viruses by treatment processes designed for producing purified water this is essential to better ensure public confidence that risk targets are met and human health is protected until we fully address these uncertainties related to viral detection removal it is prudent to uses rt qpcr viral data in microbial risk assessments as documented for norovirus van abel et al 2017 dose response models that account for virus aggregation and non aggregation are also

19716,salinization of freshwaters by human activities is of growing concern globally consequences of salt pollution include adverse effects to aquatic biodiversity ecosystem function human health and ecosystem services in headwater streams of the temperate forests of eastern usa elevated specific conductance sc a surrogate measurement for the major dissolved ions composing salinity has been linked to decreased diversity of aquatic insects however such linkages have typically been based on limited numbers of sc measurements that do not quantify intra annual variation effective management of salinization requires tools to accurately monitor and predict salinity while accounting for temporal variability toward that end high frequency sc data were collected within the central appalachian coalfield over 4 years at 25 forested headwater streams spanning a gradient of salinity a sinusoidal periodic function was used to model the annual cycle of sc averaged across years and streams the resultant model revealed that on average salinity deviated approximately 20 from annual mean levels across all years and streams with minimum sc occurring in late winter and peak sc occurring in late summer the pattern was evident in headwater streams influenced by surface coal mining unmined headwater reference streams with low salinity and larger order salinized rivers draining the study area the pattern was strongly responsive to varying seasonal dilution as driven by catchment evapotranspiration an effect that was amplified slightly in unmined catchments with greater relative forest cover evaluation of alternative sampling intervals indicated that discrete sampling can approximate the model performance afforded by high frequency data but model error increases rapidly as discrete sampling intervals exceed 30 days this study demonstrates that intra annual variation of salinity in temperate forested headwater streams of appalachia usa follows a natural seasonal pattern driven by interactive influences on water quantity and quality of climate geology and terrestrial vegetation because climatic and vegetation dynamics vary annually in a seasonal cyclic manner a periodic function can be used to fit a sinusoidal model to the salinity pattern the model framework used here is broadly applicable in systems with streamflow dependent chronic salinity stress graphical

mining schreck 1995 goetsch and palmer 1997 hancock et al 2005 pond et al 2008 cañedo argüelles et al 2013 in headwater streams of the temperate eastern deciduous forests in usa salinity is identified as a biotic stressor and threat to aquatic insect diversity where naturally dilute streams griffith 2014 are affected by major ions released from geologic materials that have been disturbed by mining griffith et al 2012 cormier et al 2013 coal surface mining disturbs geologic materials that occur naturally deep below the land surface exposing minerals to ambient environmental conditions and causing accelerated weathering environmental waters solubilize weathering reaction products primarily mineral origin salts daniels et al 2016 often causing salinity of mine water discharges to be elevated relative to the region s natural waters pond et al 2008 2014 griffith et al 2012 evans et al 2014 timpano et al 2015 elevated specific conductance sc a surrogate measurement for the major dissolved ions composing salinity has been linked to decreased richness and evenness of aquatic insect communities pond et al 2008 with generally sensitive taxa from the orders ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera most strongly affected pond 2010 2012 timpano et al 2015 however such linkages have been based on sc measured infrequently even as rarely as with a single measurement per study stream e g bernhardt et al 2012 discrete one time measurements of sc may not be sufficient to quantify accurately the intra annual variation affecting organismal life cycle exposure it has long been recognized that surface water solutes are influenced strongly by geology hydrology precipitation and evapotranspiration et gibbs 1970 as well as the interaction of climate and geology with terrestrial flora and soils hem 1985 it has also been observed that in temperate streams with forested catchments surface water solutes often exhibit strong seasonal variability e g likens and bormann 1995 which is driven largely by land use and rates of precipitation and et helsel and hirsch 2002 therefore it is reasonable to expect salinity to vary seasonally as a function of one or more of these factors if precipitation and geologic influence in headwater streams in the study region are relatively constant stream water yield and therefore stream salinity should be influenced by et and therefore exhibit a cyclic annual pattern roughly concurrent with the water cycle further because et is a natural influence on streamflow we expect salinity patterns to be similar in both reference and test streams with partially forested catchments despite the anthropogenic alterations of geology and weathering rates resultant from coal mining in the latter our first objective was to model the annual pattern of salinity as measured by sc in freshwater streams of appalachia usa using a periodic function to characterize the cyclic nature of the pattern recognizing the practical hurdles to obtaining high frequency sc data our second objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative sampling intervals for describing the sc pattern where salinity does vary in a regular seasonal way characterization of the annual pattern could enhance capability to quantify salt exposures to biota as well as to mitigate salinization effects 2 methods 2 1 stream selection we selected headwater streams within the u s environmental protection agency usepa level iv central appalachian ecoregion 69d omernik and griffith 2014 of virginia and west virginia with varied degrees of salinization by surface coal mining this region was an ideal study system because coal mining land use in the region is a common reliable source of salinization and the headwater stream segments allowed us to model salinity patterns free from excessive confounding influences we visited more than 260 streams to select 25 streams fig 1 that spanned a gradient of sc yet were comparable to un mined reference streams with respect to riparian and instream habitat quality sample reaches were designated first order per the usepa national hydrography dataset plus usepa 2012 and had mean catchment area sd of 331 226 ha five streams free of salinization from mining and representing best available habitat and water quality in the region were considered reference streams mean sc range 24 130 μs cm and 20 test streams spanned a gradient of salinity mean sc range 220 1438 μs cm while maintaining reference quality habitat see timpano et al 2015 for further detail of stream selection methods the source of saline leachate for test streams was weathering of mine spoil which was either consolidated in stream channels in what are known as valley fills or left unconsolidated on the hillslope after contour mining forest coverage in each catchment was estimated in a gis by first delineating watersheds upstream of the sample reach then proportions of forest land cover were calculated by geospatial analysis of existing databases li et al 2015 mrlc 2017 followed by analysis of available high resolution aerial imagery for assessment of recent forest cover changes resulting from subsequent mining that occurred during the study period in a small number of test stream watersheds 2 2 regional climate and streamflow the central appalachian ecoregion is characterized by mixed mesophytic forest omernik 1987 with temperate climate and relatively uniform precipitation throughout the year bailey 1995 precipitation and temperature for the study region were estimated using data from four weather stations that span the extent of study stream locations usnoaa 2017 the 30 year mean annual precipitation for those stations was 1179 mm and the mean monthly temperature ranged from 0 6 c to 22 8 c precipitation averaged 1227 mm per year for the period 2011 2015 with mean monthly precipitation ranging from 70 mm in november to 152 mm in july fig 2 streamflow followed a seasonal pattern in the study region

sites ky22 va13 and wv04 2 3 data collection long term high frequency measurement of sc and water temperature was achieved using automated dataloggers hobo freshwater conductivity data logger model u24 001 onset computer corp bourne massachusetts usa dataloggers were installed upon completion of stream selection between july and october 2011 and continued recording measurements at 30 min intervals through october 2015 all dataloggers were installed within stream reaches that were free from immediate upstream anthropogenic influence other than coal mining to assess ionic composition of stream water grab samples were collected approximately monthly at each stream during baseflow i e flow not influenced by storm flow from may 2011 through april 2013 stream water samples were filtered immediately using polyvinylidene difluoride syringe filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm and stored in sterile polyethylene sample bags aliquots for analysis of cations were preserved to ph 2 with 1 1

2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 ion matrix characterization molar proportions of each of the eight major ions were calculated for each sample as molar concentration of each ion divided by the sum of the eight major ions mean molar proportions were then computed for each stream for the period spring 2011 spring 2013 and aggregate mean proportions were calculated by stream type 2 4 2 high frequency specific conductance data preparation we used hoboware software onset computer corp bourne massachusetts usa to compute sc as a linear function of electrical conductivity and temperature in each study stream as recorded concurrently by the dataloggers the dataset was then censored to exclude false sc readings observed as a result of datalogger burial by sediment or datalogger malfunction e g missing data or sc 0 μs cm the corrected dataset was then constrained to the period 15 oct 2011 through 14 oct 2015 to simulate an sc sampling scheme comparable to daily grab sampling data were further constrained to sc observed at 12 00 p m each day to represent daily sc to facilitate comparison of sc patterns among streams that span a wide range of salinity a standardized sc metric was calculated for each stream we computed the sc relative deviation from mean scrdm for each daily observation sc at 12 00 p m 1 s c r d m d s c d s c s c where d date and s c mean of daily sc for the four year study period n 1461 we then computed the mean daily scrdm across streams n 25 and years n 4 to yield a single scrdm value for each day that represents deviation from long term mean sc that is expected on a given julian day 2 4 3 model specification periodic functions can be effective for describing cyclic seasonal patterns including those observed in water quality dewalle and davies 1997 helsel and hirsch 2002 halliday et al 2012 and epidemiology stolwijk et al 1999 because we expected sc to vary with annual cycle of streamflow we fit a first harmonic sinusoidal linear model describing scrdm as a function of julian day 2 s c r d m t β 0 β 1 sin 2 π t t β 2 cos 2 π t t ε where t julian day and t length of period in days in this case we used a period of t 366 days because 2012 was a leap year we evaluated the model for error and goodness of fit and for explanatory and predictive power in addition we used the model to estimate scrdm extrema and associated error to gauge ability of the model to predict timing and magnitude of salinity extremes during the year timing of minimum and maximum values of scrdm was calculated as 3 t m i n tan 1 β 1 β 2 t 2 π and 4 t m a x t m i n t 2 where tmin tmax julian day of minimum maximum scrdm and t length of period in days the expected scrdm value for any julian day scrdm t was calculated as 5 s c r d m t a cos 2 π t t θ where a β 1 2 β 2 2 the amplitude of the sinusoidal function t julian day t length of period in days 366 and θ 2 π t m a x t the phase shift of the cosine function in radians 2 4 4 model validation to evaluate how the sinusoidal model might perform on novel data from other streams in the population of appalachian headwater streams both reference and those salinized by coal mining we conducted model validation using a modified leave one out cross validation loocv procedure cross validation evaluates the power of a model to predict novel independent observations in the population of interest arlot and celisse 2010 and the population of interest is that of temperate forested headwater streams therefore we modified the loocv procedure to leave streams out of the aggregate scrdm calculation in order to estimate model performance on a novel stream we performed cross validation by leaving out one of the 25 streams test dataset from the full dataset and conducted the same data processing and modeling as described above on the remaining 24 streams training dataset we then compared predicted daily scrdm values from the training model to observed daily scrdm values from the test dataset to calculate cross validation error cve of the training model we calculated cve similarly to root mean squared error rmse but instead of comparing the model predictions with data used to fit the model model predictions are compared to observations of the single stream in the test dataset 6 c v e t r a i n i n g t 1 t s c r d m ˆ t t r a i n i n g s c r d m t t e s t 2 t where t julian day and t length of period in days 366 we repeated this procedure 25 times leaving out a different stream each time to arrive at the mean cve n 25 2 4 5 model validation using larger order rivers to test spatial scalability of the modeling approach to non headwater streams we fit sinusoidal models to daily sc data for five larger order rivers order 4 6 in our study region for which high frequency sc data were available fig 1 we obtained sc data from a public database of stream gages maintained by the u s geological survey usgs we used data from the same time period as for headwater streams 15 oct 2011 14 oct 2015 which yielded records of two to four years per stream following the same approach as for headwater streams we selected the 12 00 p m value to represent a single daily sample then relativized the raw sc to scrdm using site specific long term mean sc and aggregated across sites to arrive at a single mean scrdm value per julian day we fit a sinusoidal model to mean scrdm for the larger order rivers and computed the same model summary statistics as for the headwater stream model the larger river model was evaluated for comparability to the headwater stream model using model error fit statistics and extrema magnitude and timing this analysis can be replicated by running the r script usgs streams r available in the online supplement to this article 2 4 6 alternatives to high frequency sampling recognizing the challenges of daily sc measurement for practitioners who may want to characterize sc variation in streams of interest we evaluated the feasibility of modeling annual sc using discrete sampling data gathered at longer intervals we simulated sampling at intervals i 7 14 30 60 and 90 days to complement the full model which used data of i 1 day for each interval we subsampled each stream exactly every i days because there are i ways to sample every i days i e for i 7 sample all mondays in a year all tuesdays in a year etc for each interval we repeated the subsampling process i times shifting the subset of data by one day each time thus yielding i subsets of data to illustrate in the case of i 7 seven subsets were constructed composed of 52 days of sc observations the first containing data for julian days 1 8 15 358 365 and the seventh containing data for julian days 7 14 21 357 364 for each interval i sub models were constructed one with each data subset using the same model fitting procedure as was used for the full model we then performed the loocv procedure as above recording the prediction error of each cv training sub model n 25i finally we compared prediction errors among alternative intervals using the games howell post hoc multiple comparison test which is robust to unequal sample sizes and heterogeneous variance among groups day and quinn 1989 2 4 7 evaluation of mining influence on seasonal salinity pattern we modeled reference and test streams separately to determine if a seasonal sc pattern exists in the absence of mining influence we aggregated and modeled daily scrdm data across streams and years for test n 20 and reference n 5 streams as above for the full i 1 day model and we compared amplitude scrdm extrema timing and prediction errors to quantify differences between reference and test stream sc patterns all analyses were conducted using r r core team 2017 with test α 0 05 all model fitting was performed using function stats lm included with base r r core team 2017 we used userfriendlyscience posthoctgh peters 2017 for the games howell multiple comparison procedure we used the package dataretrieval hirsch and de cicco 2015 for obtaining data on larger order streams from the u s geological survey the package lubridate grolemund and wickham 2011 was used for working with date values 3 results 3 1 ionic composition the dominant aqueous cation was ca2 in both stream types but so4 2 was the dominant anion in salinized test streams whereas hco3 was the primary anion in reference streams table 1 proportions of mg2 were also elevated in test streams relative to reference streams sodium and cl were not major components of salinized streams accounting for 13 of molarity combined table 1 3 2 salinity pattern model the full model identified a significant seasonal pattern of salinity with minimum sc in spring and maximum sc in fall fig 4 as expected the model was centered on mean sc i e scrdm 0 β0 p 0 05 with strong fit r2 0 82 and a narrow confidence interval of 1 25 table 2 model rmse was approximately 7 scrdm and prediction error was approximately 14 scrdm table 2 peak annual variation of salinity was approximately 21 of mean sc table 3 the model predicted annual minimum sc within two weeks of the observed minimum tmin error 12 days whereas annual maximum sc was predicted almost four weeks earlier than actual tmax error 25 days table 3 3 3 model validation the modified loocv procedure yielded a cve se of 0 1384 0 0119 scrdm indicating that the full model can be expected to estimate mean sc patterns of novel individual streams with an upper 95 confidence limit of approximately 16 scrdm error mean se rmse was lower for the full model 0 0699 0 0003 scrdm than was observed when sinusoidal models were fit on a site specific basis to each of the 25 streams 0 1064 0 008 scrdm however much of the variance in error among streams was reflected in the mean cve of the full model 0 1384 0 0116 scrdm fig 5 this analysis revealed that individual streams can vary in their conformance to a sinusoidal pattern but aggregation across streams creates a regional model that reveals the underlying pattern of annual periodic variation in salinity validation of spatial scaling indicated that larger order rivers exhibited seasonal patterns of sc similar to those of headwater streams the overall model and individual sinusoidal coefficients were strongly significant p 0 0001 with overall r2 of 0 80 fig s1 the sinusoidal pattern had a minimum in spring tmin julian day 59 and maximum in fall tmax julian day 242 with an amplitude of 0 2213 scrdm table s1 values that are similar to those of the headwater stream model table 2 3 4 alternatives to high frequency sampling simulating alternative sampling intervals indicated a significant increase in prediction error with increasing sample interval fig 6 at intervals of 7 14 and 30 days models reliably explained sc patterns with predictive power comparable to the 1 day model with 95 prediction intervals increasing slightly with sampling interval but not exceeding 18 table 4 at 60 days the mean prediction interval increased to approximately 29 more than twice as wide as that of the 1 day model if sampling interval increased to 90 days sub models often failed to explain sc patterns overall model p 0 05 and prediction intervals were over five times wider than with the 1 day model table 4 3 5 evaluation of mining influence on seasonal sc pattern both reference and test streams exhibited significant seasonal sc patterns with spring minima and fall maxima fig 7 reference and test models were comparable with the reference model exhibiting an amplitude approximately 12 5 larger and later occurrence of extrema 8 5 days as compared to the test stream model prediction error was also comparable between reference 0 1350 scrdm and test 0 1454 scrdm models model fit and coefficients were comparable for reference and test stream sinusoidal models with only the sine term significantly different between models table 5 4 discussion 4 1 drivers of the salinity pattern the annual pattern of salinity observed in these headwater streams appears to be the product of interactions among the geology and climate of the central appalachian ecoregion as well as the land cover vegetation of the catchments studied geology governs the character of major ions and climate influences precipitation available for weathering of geologic sources of salt evapotranspiration of terrestrial vegetation influences stream water yield which in turn causes seasonal dilution or concentration of in stream salts in addition respiration processes in catchment soils influence in stream bicarbonate concentrations geology influences the type of major ions that occur in freshwaters gibbs 1970 and weathering by water contact dissolves and transports those ions to groundwater and surface water griffith 2014 in the case of mining influenced streams the geologic signature is altered and amplified relative to that of unmined reference streams causing concentrations of salts downstream of valley fills and other mining origin influences to be elevated above background levels griffith et al 2012 geologic disturbance also influences character of the salinity produced by these watersheds where sulfate is the dominant anion whereas bicarbonate dominates anionic composition of reference stream water others have observed that appalachian mine rocks when freshly disturbed produce waters with elevated proportions of sulfates relative to reference levels pond et al 2008 2014 griffith et al 2012 daniels et al 2016 our data also show that mg is elevated both proportionately as an ionic component and as a ratio to ca in mining influenced streams relative to reference streams a result that is consistent with other studies pond et al 2008 2014 prior research indicates that reduced sulfur oxidation and carbonate dissolution within the sedimentary rocks cementing materials are among the mineral weathering reactions responsible for geologic releases daniels et al 2016 but the specific mechanisms responsible for these ions releases remain under study regional climate dictates precipitation amounts and timing which influences quantity of water available to weather and leach soluble ions from mine spoils with relatively consistent precipitation levels throughout the year bailey 1995 fig 2 mine spoil fills located in the test stream catchments studied here have a consistent source of water for mineral weathering and dissolution reactions that are responsible for soluble ion release those spoil fills discharge saline leachate that is elevated consistently over reference levels agouridis et al 2012 evans et al 2014 sena et al 2014 clark et al 2016 other studies have found that saline base flow is then maintained from appalachian coal mine valley fills as a result of water storage and release effects of fill materials wiley et al 2001 griffith et al 2012 nippgen et al 2017 combined geologic and climatic factors establish a relatively consistent mean salinity potential for each stream because geologic materials influencing that character are fixed within those catchments baseflow sc levels of waters emerging from valley fills vary seasonally clark et al 2016 however variations in salinity are also influenced by variable dilution of saline discharge from valley fills the sinusoidal pattern modeled here uses data that have been relativized to the mean sc so the pattern observed describes only annual variation resultant from dilution not absolute sc levels dilution is governed by seasonal changes in amount of water reaching the stream channel which is driven by both precipitation and et in the catchment stream flow is inversely proportional to et croft 1948 and increased forest cover increases et thus reducing stream flow during the growing season hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 in this study all streams had intact forest in the riparian zone and most stream catchments were well forested overall mean forest cover was 76 with reference streams averaging 94 3 range 87 4 100 and test streams averaging 71 2 forest range 29 6 97 8 test stream catchment forest cover 25th percentile was 59 5 with only three catchments having 50 forest if the sinusoidal shape of the annual sc pattern is influenced strongly by et the pattern should correspond closely with annual temperature and tree leaf phenology minimum sc occurs in late february to early march fig 4 when deciduous trees lack leaves catchment et is at a minimum and salinity dilution is at a maximum evapotranspiration and in turn sc begin to increase after leaf out polgar and primack 2011 which occurs typically in april in the southern and central appalachians lopez et al 2008 water yield continues to decline steadily through spring and summer fig 3 as increased temperatures fig 2 and growing trees with full canopy increase et further increasing sc which peaks during late august to early september fig 4 the observed downturn of sc during july and august may be a consequence of the above average rainfall for july during the study period which if delivered in the form of heavy storms would likely both infiltrate mine spoil fills causing internal dilution and raise peak flows in streams receiving those fill waters messinger and paybins 2003 wiley and brogan 2003 salinity begins to decline by the end of september the point of 50 leaf fall lopez et al 2008 and continues to decrease rapidly as lower temperatures and loss of leaves reduce et which increases streamflow terrestrial vegetation may also have some influence on seasonal salinity concentration via contributions of hco3 produced by root respiration and other soil respiration processes some of which likely becomes dissolved in subsurface waters and is carried to streams castelle and galloway 1990 others have shown that such effects vary seasonally in a manner that is complementary to the seasonal pattern observed here jones and mulholland 1998 because reference streams are less saline than test streams the low level hco3 contributions by terrestrial root respiration would be expected to have greater proportionate influence in reference streams in contrast test stream hco3 is predominantly of geologic origin thus minimizing the seasonal influence of root respiration on salinity in mining influenced streams the case for et rather than precipitation as the primary driver of the observed salinity pattern is strengthened by observation that sc extremes do not correspond to rainfall extremes peak monthly rainfall occurs on average in july fig 2 which would be a time of maximum dilution if salinity responded primarily to rainfall by similar reasoning minimum dilution should occur during november the period of minimum monthly rainfall for the study period however sc was greater than its annual mean during july and had declined substantially from its annual peak by november fig 4 further sc extrema occur at times when monthly rainfall is similar to the annual mean therefore the evidence supports the conclusion that et through its influence on streamflow is a primary driver of the sinusoidal pattern of salinity observed in this study our analysis of larger order rivers draining the study area revealed salinity patterns similar to those exhibited by headwater streams fig s1 table s1 demonstrating that the pattern is not confined to our study streams 4 2 evaluation of mining influence on seasonal salinity pattern reference streams exhibited a strong annual cycle of sc indicating that such a pattern is natural and not a phenomenon unique to mining influenced streams although annual sc patterns were comparable between reference and test streams there were minor but notable discrepancies between the two stream types in particular reference streams had greater amplitude of annual deviation from mean sc than did test streams as well as later onset of annual extrema fig 7 both of these discrepancies may be attributable to differences in et and or base flow between stream types greater amplitude of scrdm in reference streams may be a result of greater dilution at minimum scrdm in late winter february march and lower dilution at maximum scrdm in late summer august september as compared to salinized test streams during late winter scrdm was more negative for reference streams than for test streams indicating that salinity was relatively more dilute in the former the higher scrdm in test streams at that time may be the result of the storage and release effect of mine spoil fills which maintains relatively higher base flows in filled streams as compared to reference streams wiley et al 2001 griffith et al 2012 nippgen et al 2017 if higher base flow is maintained in test streams the dilution effect of runoff in those streams may be reduced relative to reference streams conversely in late summer salts become relatively more concentrated in reference streams than in test streams in part because of the higher base flow in test streams as well as reduced dilution from runoff in reference streams owing to greater forest cover and et of the latter later onset of scrdm extrema in reference streams is likely a result of differential strength of precipitation dilution effects among stream types in late february as sc minimum is reached in test streams reference streams maintain slightly higher sc levels fig 7 upon increased precipitation in march fig 2 reference streams respond in the form of greater dilution of sc and thus more negative scrdm than test streams differences of scrdm amplitude and extrema timing between stream types are slight which suggests that reference and test streams are highly comparable such was the intent of this study design to isolate salinity as the primary factor that varied among streams while keeping all other attributes as comparable as possible to reference condition greater differences from reference salinity patterns may be expected where catchment forest cover is substantially lower than was observed in the test stream catchments studied here 4 3 alternatives to high frequency sampling daily measurements of sc yielded the greatest predictive power among sampling intervals but such high frequency data are not available or practical to collect for all streams where salinization is a concern after evaluating model performance for several sampling scenarios we found that sampling at least monthly increased mean model prediction error by 28 relative to sampling daily bimonthly and quarterly sampling increased mean prediction error by 211 and 544 respectively error for 60 and 90 day models was also more variable than for models with shorter sampling intervals fig 6 more critically models based on 60 and 90 day sampling intervals were often insignificant and or had prediction intervals that exceeded model amplitude table 4 which translates to an scrdm indistinguishable from zero results varied in other studies investigating optimum sampling frequency for water quality monitoring of dissolved constituents analysis of one year of daily samples from a surface water monitoring network in illinois usa found that monthly sampling was adequate for measurement of total dissolved solids but more frequent sampling was necessary for nutrients harmeson and barcelona 1981 and that 30 day intervals were adequate for describing seasonal variation for a suite of five parameters that included total dissolved solids loftis and ward 1980 in south korea analysis of high frequency water quality data from small streams draining mountainous forested watersheds indicated that weekly to monthly sampling was adequate for characterizing seasonal patterns of solutes lee et al 2015 4 4 transferability of salinity model the exact model defined here is not broadly transferrable as is because specifics of salinity patterns observed in this study are influenced by regional geology climate and catchment land cover as discussed above however because the sinusoidal pattern fundamentally describes seasonal dilution effects the model framework may be adaptable to other streams in which salinity responds to seasonal patterns of dilution such a water cycle would be expected in other temperate forests of the world but models may also be developed for streams in arid regions where precipitation patterns rather than et drive dilution of salinity we demonstrated that the seasonal pattern has similar timing and amplitude in larger order rivers in the region suggesting that the modeling approach should scale well spatially incorporating precipitation and or stream discharge into the model could improve broad scale model performance seasonal inverse relationships between stream flow and salinity appear common in systems where chronic non point sources of salt create chronically elevated salinity as have been observed in spain olıas et al 2004 canada bhangu and whitfield 1997 and uzbekistan crosa et al 2006 however such predictable salinity streamflow relationships are unlikely in salinized streams that do not have chronic salt stress or where salinity does not vary with natural water cycles for example the sinusoidal model may not be appropriate in streams with managed mining discharge sporadic pulsed inputs from road de icing salts agricultural runoff or industrial point sources 5 conclusions as salinization increasingly threatens integrity of freshwaters globally tools for describing and estimating patterns of major ion concentration in lotic systems will likely become increasingly critical for water resource managers seeking to mitigate salinization effects high frequency monitoring can reveal the annual pattern of salinity while also providing the detail necessary to infer mechanisms influencing such variation despite anthropogenic influence intra annual variation of salinity in temperate forested headwater streams of central appalachia follows a natural pattern driven by interactive influences of climate geology and terrestrial vegetation on water quantity and quality because climatic and vegetation dynamics vary annually in a seasonal cyclic manner a sinusoidal periodic function can be used to fit a model to the salinity pattern in lieu of high frequency data discrete samples collected at longer intervals may be adequate to characterize annual salinity patterns but model prediction error increases rapidly as sampling interval exceeds 30 days the modeling approach is adaptable to other systems with streamflow dependent chronic salinity stress and can be scaled spatially and temporally

19716,salinization of freshwaters by human activities is of growing concern globally consequences of salt pollution include adverse effects to aquatic biodiversity ecosystem function human health and ecosystem services in headwater streams of the temperate forests of eastern usa elevated specific conductance sc a surrogate measurement for the major dissolved ions composing salinity has been linked to decreased diversity of aquatic insects however such linkages have typically been based on limited numbers of sc measurements that do not quantify intra annual variation effective management of salinization requires tools to accurately monitor and predict salinity while accounting for temporal variability toward that end high frequency sc data were collected within the central appalachian coalfield over 4 years at 25 forested headwater streams spanning a gradient of salinity a sinusoidal periodic function was used to model the annual cycle of sc averaged across years and streams the resultant model revealed that on average salinity deviated approximately 20 from annual mean levels across all years and streams with minimum sc occurring in late winter and peak sc occurring in late summer the pattern was evident in headwater streams influenced by surface coal mining unmined headwater reference streams with low salinity and larger order salinized rivers draining the study area the pattern was strongly responsive to varying seasonal dilution as driven by catchment evapotranspiration an effect that was amplified slightly in unmined catchments with greater relative forest cover evaluation of alternative sampling intervals indicated that discrete sampling can approximate the model performance afforded by high frequency data but model error increases rapidly as discrete sampling intervals exceed 30 days this study demonstrates that intra annual variation of salinity in temperate forested headwater streams of appalachia usa follows a natural seasonal pattern driven by interactive influences on water quantity and quality of climate geology and terrestrial vegetation because climatic and vegetation dynamics vary annually in a seasonal cyclic manner a periodic function can be used to fit a sinusoidal model to the salinity pattern the model framework used here is broadly applicable in systems with streamflow dependent chronic salinity stress graphical

as a biotic stressor and threat to aquatic insect diversity where naturally dilute streams griffith 2014 are affected by major ions released from geologic materials that have been disturbed by mining griffith et al 2012 cormier et al 2013 coal surface mining disturbs geologic materials that occur naturally deep below the land surface exposing minerals to ambient environmental conditions and causing accelerated weathering environmental waters solubilize weathering reaction products primarily mineral origin salts daniels et al 2016 often causing salinity of mine water discharges to be

plecoptera and trichoptera most strongly affected pond 2010 2012 timpano et al 2015 however such linkages have been based on sc measured infrequently even as rarely as with a single measurement per study stream e g bernhardt et al 2012 discrete one time measurements of sc may not be sufficient to quantify accurately the intra annual variation affecting organismal life cycle exposure it has long been recognized that surface water solutes are influenced strongly by geology hydrology precipitation and evapotranspiration et gibbs 1970 as well as the interaction of climate and geology with terrestrial flora and soils hem 1985 it has also been observed that in temperate streams with forested catchments surface water solutes often exhibit strong seasonal variability e g likens and bormann 1995 which is driven largely by land use and rates of precipitation and et helsel and hirsch 2002 therefore it is reasonable to expect salinity to vary seasonally as a function of one or more of these factors if precipitation and geologic influence in headwater streams in the study region are relatively constant stream water yield and therefore stream salinity should be influenced by et and therefore exhibit a cyclic annual pattern roughly concurrent with the water cycle further because et is a natural influence on streamflow we expect salinity patterns to be similar in both reference and test streams with partially forested catchments despite the anthropogenic alterations of geology and weathering rates resultant from coal mining in the latter our first objective was to model the annual pattern of salinity as measured by sc in freshwater streams of appalachia usa using a periodic function to characterize the cyclic nature of the pattern recognizing the practical hurdles to obtaining high frequency sc data our second objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative sampling intervals for describing the sc pattern where salinity does vary in a regular seasonal way characterization of the annual pattern could enhance capability to quantify salt exposures to biota as well as to mitigate salinization effects 2 methods 2 1 stream selection we selected headwater streams within the u s environmental protection agency usepa level iv central appalachian ecoregion 69d omernik and griffith 2014 of virginia and west virginia with varied degrees of salinization by surface coal mining this region was an ideal study system because coal mining land use in the region is a common reliable source of salinization and the headwater stream segments allowed us to model salinity patterns free from excessive confounding influences we visited more than 260 streams to select 25 streams fig 1 that spanned a gradient of sc yet were comparable to un mined reference streams with respect to riparian and instream habitat quality sample reaches were designated first order per the usepa national hydrography dataset plus usepa 2012 and had mean catchment area sd of 331 226 ha five streams free of salinization from mining and representing best available habitat and water quality in the region were considered reference streams mean sc range 24 130 μs cm and 20 test streams spanned a gradient of salinity mean sc range 220 1438 μs cm while maintaining reference quality habitat see timpano et al 2015 for further detail of stream selection methods the source of saline leachate for test streams was weathering of mine spoil which was either consolidated in stream channels in what are known as valley fills or left unconsolidated on the hillslope after contour mining forest coverage in each catchment was estimated in a gis by first delineating watersheds upstream of the sample reach then proportions of forest land cover were calculated by geospatial analysis of existing databases li et al 2015 mrlc 2017 followed by analysis of available high resolution aerial imagery for assessment of recent forest cover changes resulting from subsequent mining that occurred during the study period in a small number of test stream watersheds 2 2 regional climate and streamflow the central appalachian ecoregion is characterized by mixed mesophytic forest omernik 1987 with temperate climate and relatively uniform precipitation throughout the year bailey 1995 precipitation and temperature for the study region were estimated using data from four weather stations that span the extent of study stream locations usnoaa 2017 the 30 year mean annual precipitation for those stations was 1179 mm and the mean monthly temperature ranged from 0 6 c to 22 8 c precipitation

major ions mean molar proportions were then computed for each stream for the period spring 2011 spring 2013 and aggregate mean proportions were calculated by stream type 2 4 2 high frequency specific conductance data preparation we used hoboware software onset computer corp bourne massachusetts usa to compute sc as a linear function of electrical conductivity and temperature in each study stream

or sc 0 μs cm the corrected dataset was then constrained to the period 15 oct 2011 through 14 oct 2015 to simulate an sc sampling scheme comparable to daily grab sampling data were further constrained to sc observed at 12 00 p m each day to represent daily sc to facilitate comparison of sc patterns among streams that span a wide range of salinity a standardized sc metric was calculated for each

n 1461 we then computed the mean daily scrdm across streams n 25 and years n 4 to yield a single scrdm value for each day that represents deviation from long term mean sc that is expected on a given

2002 halliday et al 2012 and epidemiology stolwijk et al 1999 because we expected sc to vary with annual cycle of streamflow we fit a first harmonic sinusoidal linear model describing scrdm as a function of julian day 2 s c r d m t β 0 β 1 sin 2 π t t β 2 cos 2 π t t ε where t julian day and t length of period in days in this case we used a period of t 366 days because 2012 was a leap year we evaluated the model for error and goodness of fit and for explanatory and predictive power in addition we used the model to estimate scrdm extrema and associated error to gauge ability of the model to predict timing and magnitude of salinity extremes during the year timing of minimum and maximum values of scrdm was calculated as 3 t m i n tan 1 β 1 β 2 t 2 π and 4 t m a x t m i n t 2 where tmin

sinusoidal model might perform on novel data from other streams in the population of appalachian headwater streams both reference and those salinized by coal mining we conducted model validation using a modified leave one out cross validation loocv procedure cross validation evaluates the power of a model to predict novel independent observations in the population of interest arlot and celisse 2010 and the population of interest is that of temperate forested headwater streams therefore we modified the loocv procedure to leave streams out of the aggregate scrdm calculation in order to estimate model performance on a novel stream we performed cross validation by leaving out one of the 25 streams test dataset from the full dataset and conducted the same data processing and modeling as described above on the remaining 24 streams training dataset we then compared predicted daily scrdm values from the training model to observed daily scrdm values from the test dataset to calculate cross validation error cve of the training model we calculated cve similarly to root mean squared error rmse but instead of comparing the model predictions with data used to fit the model model predictions are compared to observations of the single stream in the test dataset 6 c v e t r a i n i n g t 1 t s c r d m ˆ t t r a i n i n g s c r d m t t e s t 2 t where t julian day and t length of

scalability of the modeling approach to non headwater streams we fit sinusoidal models to daily sc data for five larger order rivers order 4 6 in our study region for which high frequency sc data were available fig 1 we obtained sc data from a public database of stream gages maintained by the u s geological survey usgs we used data from the same time period as for headwater streams 15 oct 2011 14 oct 2015 which yielded records of two to four years per stream following the same approach as for headwater streams we selected the 12 00 p m value to represent a single daily sample then relativized the raw sc to scrdm using site specific long term mean sc and aggregated across sites to arrive at a single mean scrdm value per julian day we fit a sinusoidal model to mean scrdm for the larger order rivers and computed the same model summary statistics as for the headwater stream model the larger river model was evaluated for comparability to the headwater stream model using model error fit statistics and extrema magnitude and timing this analysis can be replicated by running the r script usgs streams r available in the online supplement to this article 2 4 6 alternatives to high frequency sampling recognizing the challenges of daily sc measurement for practitioners who may want to characterize sc variation in streams of interest we evaluated the feasibility of modeling annual sc using discrete sampling data gathered at longer intervals we simulated sampling at intervals i 7 14 30 60 and 90 days to complement the full model which used data of i 1 day for each interval we subsampled each stream exactly every i days because there are i ways to sample every i days i e for i 7 sample all mondays in a year all tuesdays in a year etc for each interval we repeated the subsampling process i times shifting the subset of data by one day each time thus yielding i subsets of data to illustrate in the case of i 7 seven subsets were constructed composed of 52 days of sc observations the first containing data for julian days 1 8 15 358 365 and the seventh containing data for julian days 7 14 21 357 364 for each interval i sub models were constructed one with each data subset using the same model fitting procedure as was used for the full model we then performed the loocv procedure as above recording the prediction error of each cv training sub model n 25i finally we compared prediction errors among alternative intervals using the games howell post hoc multiple comparison test which is robust to unequal sample sizes and heterogeneous variance among groups day and quinn 1989 2 4 7 evaluation of mining influence on seasonal salinity pattern we modeled reference and test streams separately to determine if a seasonal sc pattern exists in the absence of mining influence we aggregated and modeled daily scrdm data across streams and years for test n 20 and reference n 5 streams as above for the full i 1 day model and we compared amplitude scrdm extrema timing and prediction errors to quantify differences between reference and test stream sc patterns all analyses were conducted using r r core team 2017 with test α 0 05 all model fitting was performed using function stats lm included with base r r core team 2017 we used userfriendlyscience posthoctgh peters 2017 for the games howell multiple comparison procedure we used the package dataretrieval hirsch and de cicco 2015 for obtaining data on larger order streams from the u s geological survey the package lubridate grolemund and wickham 2011 was used for working with date values 3 results 3 1 ionic composition the dominant aqueous cation was ca2 in both stream types but so4 2 was the dominant anion in salinized test streams whereas hco3 was the primary anion in reference streams table 1 proportions of mg2 were also elevated in test streams relative to reference streams sodium and cl were not major components of salinized streams accounting for 13 of molarity combined table 1 3 2 salinity pattern model the full model identified a significant seasonal pattern of salinity with minimum sc in spring and maximum sc in fall fig 4 as expected the model was centered on mean sc i e scrdm 0 β0 p 0 05 with strong fit r2 0 82 and a narrow confidence interval of 1 25 table 2 model rmse was approximately 7 scrdm and prediction error was approximately 14 scrdm table 2 peak annual variation of salinity was approximately 21 of mean sc table 3 the model predicted annual minimum sc within two weeks of the observed minimum tmin error 12 days whereas annual maximum sc was predicted almost four weeks earlier than actual tmax error 25 days table 3 3 3 model validation the modified loocv procedure yielded a cve se of 0 1384 0 0119 scrdm indicating that the full model can be expected to estimate mean sc patterns of novel individual streams with an upper 95 confidence limit of approximately 16 scrdm error mean se rmse was lower for the full model 0 0699 0 0003 scrdm than was observed when sinusoidal models were fit on a site specific basis to each of the 25 streams 0 1064 0 008 scrdm however much of the variance in error among streams was reflected in the mean cve of the full model 0 1384 0 0116 scrdm fig 5 this analysis revealed that individual streams can vary in their conformance to a sinusoidal pattern but aggregation across streams creates a regional model that reveals the underlying pattern of annual periodic variation in salinity validation of spatial scaling indicated that larger order rivers exhibited seasonal patterns of sc similar to those of headwater streams the overall model and individual sinusoidal coefficients were strongly significant p 0 0001 with overall r2 of 0 80 fig s1 the sinusoidal pattern had a minimum in spring tmin julian day 59 and maximum in fall tmax julian day 242 with an amplitude of 0 2213 scrdm table s1 values that are similar to those of the headwater stream model table 2 3 4 alternatives to high frequency sampling simulating alternative sampling intervals indicated a significant increase in prediction error with increasing sample interval fig 6 at intervals of 7 14 and 30 days models reliably explained sc patterns with predictive power comparable to the 1 day model with 95 prediction intervals increasing slightly with sampling interval but not exceeding 18 table 4 at 60 days the mean prediction interval increased to approximately 29 more than twice as wide as that of the 1 day model if sampling interval increased to 90 days sub models often failed to explain sc patterns overall model p 0 05 and prediction intervals were over five times wider than with the 1 day model table 4 3 5 evaluation of mining influence on seasonal sc pattern both reference and test streams exhibited significant seasonal sc patterns with spring minima and fall maxima fig 7 reference and test models were comparable with the reference model exhibiting an amplitude approximately 12 5 larger and later occurrence of extrema 8 5 days as compared to the test stream model prediction error was also comparable between reference 0 1350 scrdm and test 0 1454 scrdm models model fit and coefficients were comparable for reference and test stream sinusoidal models with only the sine term significantly different between models table 5 4 discussion 4 1 drivers of the salinity pattern the annual pattern of salinity observed in these headwater streams appears to be the product of interactions among the geology and climate of the central appalachian ecoregion as well as the land cover vegetation of the catchments studied geology governs the character of major ions and climate influences precipitation available for weathering of geologic sources of salt evapotranspiration of terrestrial vegetation influences stream water yield which in turn causes seasonal dilution or concentration of in stream salts in addition respiration processes in catchment soils influence in stream bicarbonate concentrations geology influences the type of major ions that occur in freshwaters gibbs 1970 and weathering by water contact dissolves and transports those ions to groundwater and surface water griffith 2014 in the case of mining influenced streams the geologic signature is altered and amplified relative to that of unmined reference streams causing concentrations of salts downstream of valley fills and other mining origin influences to be elevated above background levels griffith et al 2012 geologic disturbance also influences character of the salinity produced by these watersheds where sulfate is the dominant anion whereas bicarbonate dominates anionic composition of reference stream water others have observed that appalachian mine rocks when freshly disturbed produce waters with elevated proportions of sulfates relative to reference levels pond et al 2008 2014 griffith et al 2012 daniels et al 2016 our data also show that mg is elevated both proportionately as an ionic component and as a ratio to ca in mining influenced streams relative to reference streams a result that is consistent with other studies pond et al 2008 2014 prior research indicates that reduced sulfur oxidation and carbonate dissolution within the sedimentary rocks cementing materials are among the mineral weathering reactions responsible for geologic releases daniels et al 2016 but the specific mechanisms responsible for these ions releases remain under study regional climate dictates precipitation amounts and timing which influences quantity of water available to weather and leach soluble ions from mine spoils with relatively consistent precipitation levels throughout the year bailey 1995 fig 2 mine spoil fills located in the test stream catchments studied here have a consistent source of water for mineral weathering and dissolution reactions that are responsible for soluble ion release those spoil fills discharge saline leachate that is elevated consistently over reference levels agouridis et al 2012 evans et al 2014 sena et al 2014 clark et al 2016 other studies have found that saline base flow is then maintained from appalachian coal mine valley fills as a result of water storage and release effects of fill materials wiley et al 2001 griffith et al 2012 nippgen et al 2017 combined geologic and climatic factors establish a relatively consistent mean salinity potential for each stream because geologic materials influencing that character are fixed within those catchments baseflow sc levels of waters emerging from valley fills vary seasonally clark et al 2016 however variations in salinity are also influenced by variable dilution of saline discharge from valley fills the sinusoidal pattern modeled here uses data that have been relativized to the mean sc so the pattern observed describes only annual variation resultant from dilution not absolute sc levels dilution is governed by seasonal changes in amount of water reaching the stream channel which is driven by both precipitation and et in the catchment stream flow is inversely proportional to et croft 1948 and increased forest cover increases et thus reducing stream flow during the growing season hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 in this study all streams had intact forest in the riparian zone and most stream catchments were well forested overall mean forest cover was 76 with reference streams averaging 94 3 range 87 4 100 and test streams averaging 71 2 forest range 29 6 97 8 test stream catchment forest cover 25th percentile was 59 5 with only three catchments having 50 forest if the sinusoidal shape of the annual sc pattern is influenced strongly by et the pattern should correspond closely with annual temperature and tree leaf phenology minimum sc occurs in late february to early march fig 4 when deciduous trees lack leaves catchment et is at a minimum and salinity dilution is at a maximum evapotranspiration and in turn sc begin to increase after leaf out polgar and primack 2011 which occurs typically in april in the southern and central appalachians lopez et al 2008 water yield continues to decline steadily through spring and summer fig 3 as increased temperatures fig 2 and growing trees with full canopy increase et further increasing sc which peaks during late august to early september fig 4 the observed downturn of sc during july and august may be a consequence of the above average rainfall for july during the study period which if delivered in the form of heavy storms would likely both infiltrate mine spoil fills causing internal dilution and raise peak flows in streams receiving those fill waters messinger and paybins 2003 wiley and brogan 2003 salinity begins to decline by the end of september the point of 50 leaf fall lopez et al 2008 and continues to decrease rapidly as lower temperatures and loss of leaves reduce et which increases streamflow terrestrial vegetation may also have some influence on seasonal salinity concentration via contributions of hco3 produced by root respiration and other soil respiration processes some of which likely becomes dissolved in subsurface waters and is carried to streams castelle and galloway 1990 others have shown that such effects vary seasonally in a manner that is complementary to the seasonal pattern observed here jones and mulholland 1998 because reference streams are less saline than test streams the low level hco3 contributions by terrestrial root respiration would be expected to have greater proportionate influence in reference streams in contrast test stream hco3 is predominantly of geologic origin thus minimizing the seasonal influence of root respiration on salinity in mining influenced streams the case for et rather than precipitation as the primary driver of the observed salinity pattern is strengthened by observation that sc extremes do not correspond to rainfall extremes peak monthly rainfall occurs on average in july fig 2 which would be a time of maximum dilution if salinity responded primarily to rainfall by similar reasoning minimum dilution should occur during november the period of minimum monthly rainfall for the study period however sc was greater than its annual mean during july and had declined substantially from its annual peak by november fig 4 further sc extrema occur at times when monthly rainfall is similar to the annual mean therefore the evidence supports the conclusion that et through its influence on streamflow is a primary driver of the sinusoidal pattern of salinity observed in this study our analysis of larger order rivers draining the study area revealed salinity patterns similar to those exhibited by headwater streams fig s1 table s1 demonstrating that the pattern is not confined to our study streams 4 2 evaluation of mining influence on seasonal salinity pattern reference streams exhibited a strong annual cycle of sc indicating that such a pattern is natural and not a phenomenon unique to mining influenced streams although annual sc patterns were comparable between reference and test streams there were minor but notable discrepancies between the two stream types in particular reference streams had greater amplitude of annual deviation from mean sc than did test streams as well as later onset of annual extrema fig 7 both of these discrepancies may be attributable to differences in et and or base flow between stream types greater amplitude of scrdm in reference streams may be a result of greater dilution at minimum scrdm in late winter february march and lower dilution at maximum scrdm in late summer august september as compared to salinized test streams during late winter scrdm was more negative for reference streams than for test streams indicating that salinity was relatively more dilute in the former the higher scrdm in test streams at that time may be the result of the storage and release effect of mine spoil fills which maintains relatively higher base flows in filled streams as compared to reference streams wiley et al 2001 griffith et al 2012 nippgen et al 2017 if higher base flow is maintained in test streams the dilution effect of runoff in those streams may be reduced relative to reference streams conversely in late summer salts become relatively more concentrated in reference streams than in test streams in part because of the higher base flow in test streams as well as reduced dilution from runoff in reference streams owing to greater forest cover and et of the latter later onset of scrdm extrema in reference streams is likely a result of differential strength of precipitation dilution effects among stream types in late february as sc minimum is reached in test streams reference streams maintain slightly higher sc levels fig 7 upon increased precipitation in march fig 2 reference streams respond in the form of greater dilution of sc and thus more negative scrdm than test streams differences of scrdm amplitude and extrema timing between stream types are slight which suggests that reference and test streams are highly comparable such was the intent of this study design to isolate salinity as the primary factor that varied among streams while keeping all other attributes as comparable as possible to reference condition greater differences from reference salinity patterns may be expected where catchment forest cover is substantially lower than was observed in the test stream catchments studied here 4 3 alternatives to high frequency sampling daily measurements of sc yielded the greatest predictive power among sampling intervals but such high frequency data are not available or practical to collect for all streams where salinization is a concern after evaluating model performance for several sampling scenarios we found that sampling at least monthly increased mean model prediction error by 28 relative to sampling daily bimonthly and quarterly sampling increased mean prediction error by 211 and 544 respectively error for 60 and 90 day models was also more variable than for models with shorter sampling intervals fig 6 more critically models based on 60 and 90 day sampling intervals were often insignificant and or had prediction intervals that exceeded model amplitude table 4 which translates to an scrdm indistinguishable from zero results varied in other studies investigating optimum sampling frequency for water quality monitoring of dissolved constituents analysis of one year of daily samples from a surface water monitoring network in illinois usa found that monthly sampling was adequate for measurement of total dissolved solids but more frequent sampling was necessary for nutrients harmeson and barcelona 1981 and that 30 day intervals were adequate for describing seasonal variation for a suite of five parameters that included total dissolved solids loftis and ward 1980 in south korea analysis of high frequency water quality data from small streams draining mountainous forested watersheds indicated that weekly to monthly sampling was adequate for characterizing seasonal patterns of solutes lee et al 2015 4 4 transferability of salinity model the exact model defined here is not broadly transferrable as is because specifics of salinity patterns observed in this study are influenced by regional geology climate and catchment land cover as discussed above however because the sinusoidal pattern fundamentally describes seasonal dilution effects the model framework may be adaptable to other streams in which salinity responds to seasonal patterns of dilution such a water cycle would be expected in other temperate forests of the world but models may also be developed for streams in arid regions where precipitation patterns rather than et drive dilution of salinity we demonstrated that the seasonal pattern has similar timing and amplitude in larger order rivers in the region suggesting that the modeling approach should scale well spatially incorporating precipitation and or stream discharge into the model could improve broad scale model performance seasonal inverse relationships between stream flow and salinity appear common in systems where chronic non point sources of salt create chronically elevated salinity as have been observed in spain olıas et al 2004 canada bhangu and whitfield 1997 and uzbekistan crosa et al 2006 however such predictable salinity streamflow relationships are unlikely in salinized streams that do not have chronic salt stress or where salinity does not vary with natural water cycles for example the sinusoidal model may not be appropriate in streams with managed mining discharge sporadic pulsed inputs from road de icing salts agricultural runoff or industrial point sources 5 conclusions as salinization increasingly threatens integrity of freshwaters globally tools for describing and estimating patterns of major ion concentration in lotic systems will likely become increasingly critical for water resource managers seeking to mitigate salinization effects high frequency monitoring can reveal the annual pattern of salinity while also providing the detail necessary to infer mechanisms influencing such variation despite anthropogenic influence intra annual variation of salinity in temperate forested headwater streams of central appalachia follows a natural pattern driven by interactive influences of climate geology and terrestrial vegetation on water quantity and quality because climatic and vegetation dynamics vary annually in a seasonal cyclic manner a sinusoidal periodic function can be used to fit a model to the salinity pattern in lieu of high frequency data discrete samples collected at longer intervals may be adequate to characterize annual salinity patterns but model prediction error increases rapidly as sampling interval exceeds 30 days the modeling approach is adaptable to other systems with streamflow dependent chronic salinity stress and can be scaled spatially and temporally

19717,struvite precipitation is a well documented method for recovering up to 98 of phosphorus from urine which is one of the main nutrients in fertilizers besides nitrogen and potassium shortcomings of this process however are the low nitrogen recovery ratio and the possible uptake of pharmaceuticals from urine in this work the nh4 adsorbent materials biochar and zeolite are coupled with struvite precipitation to increase the n recovery of struvite from 5 7 to 9 8 since nitrogen is one of the main nutrients in fertilisers this increase is of significance for its potential commercial use in addition urine is spiked with pharmaceuticals to measure the consequential uptake in struvite based fertilisers and crops afterwards five fertilisers are prepared by nutrient recovery from spiked urine using 1 struvite crystallisation 2 struvite crystallisation combined with n adsorption on zeolite 3 struvite crystallisation combined with n adsorption on biochar 4 n adsorption on zeolite without struvite crystallisation and 5 n adsorption on biochar without struvite crystallisation the fertiliser with the highest purity product and the lowest uptake of pharmaceuticals was struvite combined with zeolite next the contaminated struvite sorbent fertilisers are tested in a crop trial in which the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in edible plant tissue tomatoes is measured this bioaccumulation in tomato fruit biomass from each of the spiked fertilisers in the crop trial was found to be lower than 0 0003 in all cases far below the acceptable daily intake adi levels 750 kg of dry tomatoes should be consumed per day to reach the adi limit consequently the subsequent risk to human health from tomato fruit grown using urine derived struvite sorbent fertilisers is found to be insignificant keywords struvite nutrient recovery pharmaceutical micro pollutant biochar zeolite bioaccumulation 1 introduction eu stakeholders identified efficient nutrient recycling from wastewater as an important step towards creating a circular phosphorus economy ec 2014 to date phosphorus p is still a critical irreplaceable raw material for soil fertilization that is not widely recovered egle et al 2016 in addition the agricultural industry relies heavily on nitrogen n in the form of ammonia that is currently produced via the energy intensive haber bosch process and is not recycled either recently wastewater treatment plants are increasingly implementing p n recovery technologies primarily the struvite precipitation technology which show great promise egle et al 2016 two challenges remain namely increasing the efficiency of nutrient recycling and securing the quality and safety of the recovered nutrients for subsequent reuse in food production in order to advance the efficiency of nutrient recovery new technologies need to be developed to increase the recycling of nutrients from wastewater the current implemented struvite recovery technologies only recover less than 3 percent of the n and up to 15 percent of the p found in wastewater since more than 90 of the n and more than 50 of the p found in domestic wastewater originates from urine source separation of urine is considered an interesting method for simplifying nutrient recovery larsen et al 2001 even though the concentration of n in urine is significantly higher than that of p struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation only removes n and p in a 1 1 molar ratio necessitating the combination with adsorbent materials to increase the n recovery in hydrolysed urine n is largely present in the form of ammonium nh4 which can undergo adsorption to negatively charged surfaces by ion exchange jorgensen and weatherley 2003 for example natural clinoptilolite zeolites which are composed of al3 substituted silica oxides form a net negative surface charge and a microporous framework of nanotube ion channels that result in a wide range of cation exchange capacities wang and peng 2010 ban and dave 2004 showed that it was possible to recover 90 n and 98 p by combining struvite precipitation with ammonium adsorption to clinoptilolite zeolite 15 g l over a 72 h period the resulting nutrient enriched zeolite can be added directly to agricultural soil as a fertiliser also improving water retention and reducing nutrient leaching hina et al 2015 another ion exchange material that can be used in combination with struvite precipitation is biochar as it also meets several sustainability goals such as energy production carbon sequestration soil enrichment and improvement of plant growth marris 2006 during biochar production via pyrolysis useful by products such as syngas and bio oils are released which could make the process self sustainable xu et al 2011 biochar has a broad range of adsorption rates due to the variety of chemical compositions of biochar depending on the feedstock hina et al 2015 biochars with a negative surface charge have a higher affinity for nh4 whereas high intrinsic n or p levels can cause net release of these nutrients nutrient recovery by struvite precipitation combined with biochar adsorption increases the n uptake from 14 to 40 indicating a promising n adsorption capacity xie and reddy 2013 biochar is also a known adsorbent of micro pollutants zhang et al 2013 that can adsorb a broad range of organic chemicals such as pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and steroid hormones kookana et al 2011 conversely the surface of zeolite is hydrophilic limiting the affinity for organic micro pollutants although zeolite is an effective adsorbent of phenol yousef et al 2011 the combination of sorbent materials with struvite clearly increases the nutrient uptake but the possible uptake of micro pollutants found in human waste poses a barrier to the reuse of both phosphorus and nitrogen via urine derived fertilisers lienert et al 2007 but has never been quantified pharmaceutical residues are also predominantly excreted via urine 64 on average with a maximum deviation of 27 and the risk to human health from these contaminants must be assessed in order to unlock the commercial potential of urinary p and n lienert et al 2007 previous research on contamination of nutrients recovered from urine has focused on chemical precipitation of struvite as an efficient 100 p recovery technique liu et al 2014 ronteltap et al 2010 which produces high purity crystalline material that is well within regulatory limits furthermore struvite precipitation from urine that is spiked with pharmaceutical residues resulted in a product that excluded 98 99 of the organic micro pollutants that were tested escher et al 2006 ronteltap et al 2007 struvite precipitation from urine that contains pharmaceutical residues in combination with adsorbent materials however has not been investigated as well as the possible health risks of using these recovered nutrients for food production besides analysing the uptake of micro pollutants into struvite when combined with adsorbent materials it is also important to measure the uptake into edible parts of the crops since this might entail a risk to human health however there have been no previous studies that have examined the possible uptake of pharmaceutical micro pollutants from struvite into edible parts of the crops the fruits the objective of this research is twofold firstly to determine the uptake of pharmaceutical micro pollutants by struvite recovered from contaminated human urine in combination with adsorbent materials and secondly to determine the subsequent uptake of these micro pollutants into edible parts of crops 2 material and methods 2 1 urine reagents adsorbent materials cuvettes and stock solutions pure urine with an average ph of 9 5 9 7 fig s1 in the supplementary information was collected from a waterless men s urinal at café de ceuvel amsterdam netherlands in two 100 l buffer tanks and pumped from the second tank to the struvite reactor magnesium chloride and all pharmaceuticals 98 purity were obtained from sigma aldrich netherlands and used as received clinoptilolite zeolite and wheat husk biochar ph 8 78 8 97 were purchased from zeolite products netherlands and sonnenerde austria respectively and their properties are listed in the supplementary information table s2 ortho and total p cuvette tests lck350 2 0 20 0 mg l po4 p total n cuvette tests lck338 20 100 mg l n and nh4 cuvette tests lck302 47 130 mg l nh4 n were obtained from hach lange netherlands aqueous stock solutions of pharmaceuticals carbamazepine propranolol diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen were prepared using distilled water and ethanol 96 purity obtained from vwr the five pharmaceuticals have been selected on the basis of their common occurrence in urine their wide range of physiochemical properties table s1 in the supplementary information different biological activities and previous appearance in literature the pharmaceutical concentrations in urine were based on toxic potency and molar predicted urine concentrations puc calculated according to escher et al 2006 to simulate an average population nutrients were recovered using struvite precipitation and adsorption of n onto zeolite and biochar the change in nutrient and micro pollutant concentration in the input and effluent urine was measured to determine the uptake using chemical analysis the five fertilisers were then tested in a small crop trial using dwarf tomato plants and the resulting tomato fruit biomass was tested for micro pollutant content the biomass concentrations were then used to assess the risk to human health using toxicity data solution concentrations and ethanol water ratios are listed in table 1 the relative molecular mass rmm acidity pk a and hydrophobicity logk ow values for each pharmaceutical are shown in the supplementary information table s1 as these properties may influence the adsorption onto zeolite and biochar surfaces 2 2 nutrient recovery pharmaceutical solutions were added to human urine in final concentrations calculated according to escher et al 2006 as shown in table 1 the spiked urine was used to generate fertilisers in an air agitated batch reactor using five different nutrient recovery techniques listed in table 2 the desired volume of the mgcl2 solution added in order to precipitate struvite was based on the total p concentration of the influent urine and calculated using equation s 1 in the supplementary information the reactor was filled with urine to 25 l a sample of urine was removed for p content analysis pharmaceutical stock solutions were added and aeration was switched on an aqueous 32 mgcl2 solution was added to the struvite crystallisation experiments in the mg p ratio indicated in table 2 and sorbent materials 300 g were added to the n adsorption experiments either subsequent to or instead of mgcl2 addition the resulting mixture was agitated by aeration for 2 h during which nutrient recovery by struvite crystallisation and or adsorption occurred the reactor was drained through a food grade micron filter mesh 110 μm to collect the sorbents and through a smaller mesh filter 20 μm to collect the precipitated struvite a sample of the urine effluent was removed for analysis and the remaining supernatant was directed to the sewer the filter cake was washed with tap water and left to air dry over several days five batches of each nutrient recovery technique were carried out 2 3 crop trial the urine fertilisers were used to grow dwarf tomato plants from seedlings in a crop trial over a 2 month period the p content of urine derived fertilisers was measured in order to accurately balance the mass of each struvite based fertiliser by p 5 3 g see the supplementary information table s3 the mass of the zeolite and biochar fertilisers 350 g was equal to the mass used for the szm and sb fertilisers 400 g subtracting the approximate mass of struvite 50 g the plant growth experiments were set up by planting a seedling in a mixture of sand potting soil 500 ml and the pre weighed urine derived fertilisers using the approximate volume ratios shown in table s3 in a 6 l pot a cotton wick was placed from each pot to a water reservoir below in order to maintain moisture levels by capillary action after 63 days of growth all tomato fruits were harvested and dried at 75 c for 24 h in a drying oven 2 4 analytical methods the influent and effluent urine were characterised for n and p content using colorimetric analysis in order to determine the n and p uptake into each fertiliser when necessary urine samples were first diluted with deionised water to an appropriate concentration for analysis using a hach lange dr laboratory vis spectrophotometer following the working procedures described in the hach lange dr 3900 user manual and using the total n and total p test cuvettes see table 3 the struvite fertiliser was characterised by x ray powder diffraction xrpd and for p content by a colorimetric analysis in order to determine the crystallinity and purity of the generated material respectively xrpd analysis of the solid dry filter cake material was carried out with a rigaku miniflex ii diffractometer using ni filtered cu kα radiation universiteit van amsterdam netherlands the solid material was also observed through a leica dmls polarising light microscope plm with 10x 0 22 ph1 magnification waternet amsterdam the purity of the struvite was tested further by dissolving 10 mg material in 500 ml deionised water and measuring the p concentration using colorimetric analysis as described above the purity was then calculated as a percentage of the theoretical p concentration based on the sample mass micro pollutant uptake from urine was tested by measuring the final concentrations of spiked pharmaceuticals in the effluent of each nutrient recovery experiment because pure human urine was used for these experiments it was expected that there could be low level concentrations of pharmaceutical micro pollutants already present in the influent urine therefore the measured influent urine concentrations before spiking with pharmaceuticals and the spiked concentrations were added together to give the total input urine concentration shown in table 4 samples from each batch 20 ml were combined so that a 100 ml mixed sample of each of the fertiliser effluents was submitted for micro pollutant concentration analysis at eurofins omegam b v netherlands samples were diluted in several dilutions x10 and x100 and analysed with hplc ms ms with an agilent 1260 infinity hplc and an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with jet stream technology by direct injection the percentage uptake of pharmaceuticals into the fertilisers was then calculated from the difference in concentration in the urine effluent and input concentration since pharmaceuticals tend to be poorly degradable in urine richter 2003 we believe that there is no significant degradation of the studied micropollutants in urine escher et al 2006 confirm this as they reported that there is no degradation of ibuprofen and propranolol in urine over time dried tomato biomass samples were also submitted for analysis at eurofins omegam b v netherlands to determine the micro pollutant accumulation in the tomato fruits samples were extracted and analysed with hplc ms ms by direct injection the mass uptake of pharmaceuticals into the tomato biomass from urine derived fertilisers was then calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 struvite characterisation higher purity struvite is less prone to the uptake of contaminants since the main goal of this research was the possible detection of pharmaceuticals in crops using struvite in combination with sorbent materials we wanted to set an upper limit by using low purity struvite 84 wt to maximise the possible uptake of contaminants in the fertilizers this will provide an upper boundary for the quality and safety of the recovered nutrients for subsequent reuse in food production the obtained struvite by struvite precipitation of the pure urine from the urinary of restaurant de ceuvel amsterdam was observed to be greyish white and powdery with little odour a crystallinity analysis by x ray powder diffraction xrpd fig 1 indicated that the material was crystalline and comparable to literature values sinha et al 2014 there were no extra peaks qualitatively indicating just one polymorphic form and no trace crystalline impurities the crystal size observed by polarised light microscopy plm was very small between 20 and 120 μm with an x shaped morphology which supports literature kemacheevakul et al 2015 crystallised material from struvite zeolite mineral with n adsorption from urine szm and struvite biochar with n adsorption from urine sb experiments were also analysed by plm and the morphology observed was more rod shaped crystals in nature likely caused by the presence of solid zeolite and biochar material during the crystallisation process 3 2 phosphorus recovery the p recovery for struvite struvite in combination with zeolite szm and in combination with biochar sb fertilisers was in all cases high 96 98 as confirmed in literature liu et al 2014 ronteltap et al 2010 whereas the p recovery for zeolite and biochar without struvite precipitation was substantially lower 5 which indicates that p recovery for szm and sb was predominantly controlled by struvite precipitation rather than adsorption into the sorbent materials the mean measured p uptake of the solely zeolite fertiliser of 4 9 is in line with previous findings that report between 2 8 and 12 9 uptake from an average urine concentration 200 mg p l urine the p po4 3 adsorption capacity of zeolite is low due to unfavourable electrostatic interaction and was found to be 0 93 mg p g zeolite this is consistent with the previous reported findings which varies from 0 46 mg p g zeolite drizo et al 1999 to 2 15 mg p g zeolite sakadevan and bavor 1998 zeolite p adsorption is known to be driven by the presence of hydrous metal oxides such as al oh on the surface where phosphate anions replace oh and h2o groups rajan 1976 phosphate adsorption onto zeolite can also occur via precipitation with native exchangeable zeolite cations ca2 na or k which are free to move in the channels of the zeolite framework wang and peng 2010 however the average concentration of these cations in zeolite is low table s2 in the supplementary information a combination of these mechanisms and varying availability of these metals accounted for the low p recovery from urine into zeolite we believe that the uptake for batch 3 and 4 2 5 and 7 7 respectively is a result of the intrinsic p content of biochar 1 8 table s2 of the supplementary information which could have released water soluble p the soluble p content of biochar 500 mg p kg described in the supplementary information could release 150 mg p batch on average due to the irregular nature of biochar this value may not be representative of the total amount of water soluble p in every batch resulting in a positive uptake for batches 1 2 and 5 and net release in 3 and 4 zheng et al 2010 showed that p adsorption by biochar is controlled by a precipitation reaction with ca2 producing ca3 po4 2 xh2o and is therefore dependent on the intrinsic ca2 content of the biochar 3 3 nitrogen recovery besides p recovery also the n recovery of each of the fertiliser streams has been analysed the n recovery of struvite without the sorbent materials zeolite or biochar was on average 6 0 and almost doubled when combined with addition of the sorbent materials in both szm and sb reaching 10 total n recovery the n recovery into struvite was found to be 6 0 gn per 25 l batch this is greater than the n recovery by a 1 1 n p molar ratio with recovered p which would be 4 9 gn this indicates an excess n of 1 1 gn per batch table s4 of the supplementary information which is possibly adsorbed to the 16 amorphous struvite content the n recovery into zeolite 1 52 mol nh4 kg zeolite was equal to the cation exchange capacity cec of the zeolite table s2 in the supplementary information indicating that the main uptake mechanism was cation exchange hina et al 2015 the szm fertiliser did not contain the n impurity observed in the struvite experiments this is because zeolite seeding enhances crystal growth allowing agglomeration of struvite fines on the zeolite surface which do not otherwise agglomerate in hydrolysed urine due to high struvite zeta potentials at high ph le corre et al 2007 urine contains naturally competing cations such as mg2 and ca2 which are most likely the reason for the high variability of n uptake since mg2 can compete with nh4 for adsorption sites a high 5 1 ratio of mg p is used in our sb experiments the chemical composition and surface functionality of biochar is known to vary widely which results in a number of different adsorption mechanisms these account for the higher n uptake variability relative to zeolite based fertilisers spokas et al 2012 where some of these uptake mechanisms such as ammonium sulphate or amine formation in the biochar carbon lattice can be irreversible hina et al 2015 spokas et al 2012 the n uptake of biochar was therefore higher than zeolite but the availability of n to plants may be lower 3 4 micro pollutant uptake into fertilisers a significant uptake of pharmaceuticals into the five fertilizers was found as the micro pollutant concentration in the effluent streams was reduced compared to the total input concentrations fig 2 the pharmaceutical uptake is dependent on the type of fertilisers and pharmaceuticals table 4 the highest average uptake during the conditions and concentrations of this experiment was for propranolol with an average uptake ranging between 34 and 87 and an average of 66 8 on average 92 of the diclofenac of the input urine concentrations was found in the effluent which means that only 8 of the diclofenac was taken up in the fertilizers the fertiliser with on average the highest uptake was zeolite with an uptake of 50 of the micro pollutants in the input stream the lowest uptake was in the struvite and szm fertilizers both on average 26 6 uptake a more extensive study with different concentrations of pharmaceuticals and amounts of struvite and sorbent materials is necessary to understand fully the sorption processes the ibuprofen concentration in the struvite effluent and diclofenac concentration in sb and biochar effluent streams have a slightly higher concentration than in the influent streams which compares well with a study on pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of several wastewater treatment plants where also a slight increase of diclofenac in the effluent stream was found kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 this increase can be a result of hydrolysis of pharmaceutical conjugates or other factors since human urine has been used instead of synthetic urine in this study there were no trends linking uptake to pharmaceutical properties such as logk ow or pk a table s1 in the supplementary information kemacheevakul et al 2015 indicates that the mg p ratio has a direct influence on pharmaceuticals in struvite via using a low mg p ratio 1 2 1 for the precipitation of the struvite fertilisers we succeeded in a high pharmaceutical uptake in the struvite based streams by using a low mg p ratio the micro pollutants had the opportunity to be adsorbed to the 16 amorphous impurity content in the struvite consequently if the purity is improved via increasing the mg p ratio the micro pollutant uptake will be lower in combination with zeolite in szm the crystallisation of struvite improved resulting in the lowest uptake of 4 out of 5 micro pollutants table 4 the uptake of all the micro pollutants except diclofenac into sb and biochar fertilisers was relatively high ranging between 30 and 90 uptake this is due to the organic composition of the biochar as the hydrocarbon micro pollutant molecules are able to form hydrophobic interactions that are not possible with inorganic zeolite and struvite spokas et al 2012 the high logk ow values table s1 indicate high hydrophobicity for the majority of the pharmaceuticals with the exception of sulfamethoxazole logk ow 0 89 however the uptake of sulfamethoxazole into biochar based fertilisers was the second highest since there was no direct correlation between hydrophobicity and uptake therefore in addition to hydrophobic interactions pharmaceutical adsorption may also be controlled by the high amount of functional groups on the biochar s surface allowing interaction with pharmaceuticals via several different mechanisms zhang et al 2013 the pharmaceutical uptake was not affected by the addition of magnesium used in sb experiments compared to biochar indicating that the additional mg content was indeed sequestered by the biochar and not available to chelate with pharmaceutical molecules xie and reddy 2013 kemacheevakul et al 2015 unlike the similarity between sb and biochar the uptake of micro pollutants into zeolite was 30 higher than szm on average with the exception of ibuprofen uptake the sorption characteristics of zeolite are largely controlled by surface area pore size and electrostatic interaction with the surface charge anderson 2000 in the basic environment of the urine ph 9 4 9 8 the micro pollutants with higher pk a than nh4 pk a 9 24 table s1 in the supplementary information carbamazepine pk a 13 9 and propranolol pk a 9 24 are more basic and could compete with nh4 the remaining micro pollutants with lower pk a values are more likely to be deprotonated by the more basic species in solution the uptake of the remaining micro pollutants is therefore more likely to be due to a different mechanism yousef et al 2011 found that phenol adsorption onto zeolite was enthalpy driven and physical in nature zeolites with less al3 substation of si4 have a lower capacity for nh4 uptake but are more hydrophobic and could thus sorb the uncharged organic micro pollutants anderson 2000 the pharmaceutical micro pollutants are also slightly polar which strengthens dipole interactions with the zeolite surface however selectivity could arise from size exclusion by the zeolite micro pore which reduces the effective surface area for adsorption onto zeolite the comparatively reduced uptake to szm may be partially due the presence of struvite crystals blocking the zeolite pores and reducing the number of adsorption sites finally the spiked micro pollutant concentrations were based on predicted urine concentration puc values calculated by escher et al 2006 which were representative for the selected pharmaceutical micro pollutants additional micro pollutants are also often present in human urine such as hormones and other pharmaceuticals indeed the following chemicals which were not spiked to urine were detected by hplc ms ms in trace amounts salicylic acid atenolol caffeine gabapentin and paracetamol which can therefore have only a minor influence on the sorption results 3 5 micro pollutant bioaccumulation in tomato fruit next the bioaccumulation of five common pharmaceuticals propranolol diclofenac sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and carbamazepine was determined by harvesting the tomatoes fertilized with the various fertiliser streams and analyzing these with hplc ms ms no pharmaceuticals were detected in the tomatoes produced with the struvite sb szm and biochar fertilizers detection limit 0 001 mg kg in the tomatoes fertilized with zeolite only a minimal amount of carbamazepine 0 003 mg per kg tomato fruit was detected therefore we can conclude that the bioaccumulation was at most 0 0003 for the micro pollutant carbamazepine and for the others below 0 0001 under the circumstances of this study which is the detection limit the harm to human health that could be caused by this micro concentration of carbamazepine is assessed using toxicology data fig 3 several different limits are available in the literature 3 mg kg day is the lowest dose of carbamazepine at which an adverse effect is observed loael from which a toxicological reference value trv or tolerable daily intake of 0 033 mg kg day can be derived houeto et al 2012 with a mean uptake of 0 003 mg carbamazepine kg dw tomato biomass an adult weighing 67 kg would need to consume 220 000 kg of dried tomatoes per day in order to reach the loael limit which is 10 million times more than the average daily intake of a citizen of the united states fig 3 an alternative to using loael and trv values is to calculate an acceptable daily intake adi value by applying a safety factor of 100 to the minimum therapeutic dose carter et al 2014 shown in the supporting information since none of the other pharmaceuticals has been detected the acceptable daily intake is based on the margin of error of the instrument 0 001 mg kg tomato dw table 5 the total dry tomato biomass calculated in each case of taking the detection limit as the value is at least a million times higher than what would reasonably be consumed per day for each pharmaceutical it can therefore be concluded that levels of micro pollutants detected in the tomatoes are not harmful to human health and the tomato fruit are safe for human consumption from a health safety point of view the struvite sorbent fertilisers derived from spiked human urine are hence acceptable for use in tomato production the uptake of pharmaceutical micro pollutants in the struvite is high due to the amorphous impurities and the low mg p ratio for the precipitation when the crystallisation process is optimized the amount of taken up pharmaceuticals will be reduced resulting in an even lower bioaccumulation in the fruits in addition to the uptake of pharmaceuticals in fruits and the roots the accumulation of the pharmaceuticals in the soil and ground water has previously been studied the uptake into plants could increase over time if there is an accumulation of micro pollutants in soils or that pharmaceutical concentrations could affect bacterial or mycorrhizal organisms in the soil hillis et al 2008 a complex but important task for further research would be to carry out an analysis of the accumulation of the pharmaceuticals in other parts of the plant roots and leaves and the soil and aqueous environment in this case human urine is used but struvite is currently mainly precipitated out of waste streams such as wastewater these sources increase the risk of contaminations with several types of micro pollutants as other pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones pesticides and industrial chemicals 4 concluding remarks struvite based fertilisers resulted in effective p recovery and combination with sorbent materials zeolite and biochar allowed the n recovery to increase which is related to the presence of competing ions the bioaccumulation in tomato fruit biomass from each of the contaminated fertilisers in a crop trial was at most 0 0003 and far below the acceptable daily intake adi levels calculated from the literature with an uptake of 0 003 mg carbamazepine kg dw tomato biomass an adult weighing 67 kg would need to consume 73 kg of dried tomatoes per day in order to reach the trv limit table 5 which is 10 thousand times more than the average daily intake of a citizen of the united states to reach the lowest toxicity limit loael2 over 220 000 kg dried tomatoes would need to be consumed in one day nutrient recovery into struvite sorbent fertilisers therefore has potential as a safe method to re use n and p from human urine as tomato plant leaves and roots are not consumed by humans this is unlikely to affect human health however it is advisable to carry out further research in order to determine the risk of using contaminated plant biomass for other purposes such as compost or animal feed therefore besides the uptake of pharmaceuticals in fruits the accumulation of the pharmaceuticals in the roots the soil and ground water should be investigated this study has shown that the health risk from pharmaceutical micro pollutants transferred from human urine to struvite and sorbent based fertilisers into tomato crop fruit is insignificant acknowledgement we would like to thank waternet netherlands for lending their

19717,struvite precipitation is a well documented method for recovering up to 98 of phosphorus from urine which is one of the main nutrients in fertilizers besides nitrogen and potassium shortcomings of this process however are the low nitrogen recovery ratio and the possible uptake of pharmaceuticals from urine in this work the nh4 adsorbent materials biochar and zeolite are coupled with struvite precipitation to increase the n recovery of struvite from 5 7 to 9 8 since nitrogen is one of the main nutrients in fertilisers this increase is of significance for its potential commercial use in addition urine is spiked with pharmaceuticals to measure the consequential uptake in struvite based fertilisers and crops afterwards five fertilisers are prepared by nutrient recovery from spiked urine using 1 struvite crystallisation 2 struvite crystallisation combined with n adsorption on zeolite 3 struvite crystallisation combined with n adsorption on biochar 4 n adsorption on zeolite without struvite crystallisation and 5 n adsorption on biochar without struvite crystallisation the fertiliser with the highest purity product and the lowest uptake of pharmaceuticals was struvite combined with zeolite next the contaminated struvite sorbent fertilisers are tested in a crop trial in which the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in edible plant tissue tomatoes is measured this bioaccumulation in tomato fruit biomass from each of the spiked fertilisers in the crop trial was found to be lower than 0 0003 in all cases far below the acceptable daily intake adi levels 750 kg of dry tomatoes should be consumed per day to reach the adi limit consequently the subsequent risk to human health from tomato fruit grown using urine derived struvite sorbent fertilisers is found to be insignificant keywords struvite nutrient recovery pharmaceutical micro pollutant biochar zeolite bioaccumulation 1 introduction eu stakeholders identified efficient nutrient recycling from wastewater as an important step towards creating a circular phosphorus economy ec 2014 to date phosphorus p is still a critical irreplaceable raw material for soil fertilization that is not widely recovered egle et al 2016 in addition the agricultural industry relies heavily on nitrogen n in the form of ammonia that is currently produced via the energy intensive haber bosch process and is not recycled either recently wastewater treatment plants are increasingly implementing p n recovery technologies primarily the struvite precipitation technology which show great promise egle et al 2016 two challenges remain namely increasing the efficiency of nutrient recycling and securing the quality and safety of the recovered nutrients for subsequent reuse in food production in order to advance the efficiency of nutrient recovery new technologies need to be developed to increase the recycling of nutrients from wastewater the current implemented struvite recovery technologies only recover less than 3 percent of the n and up to 15 percent of the p found in wastewater since more than 90 of the n and more than 50 of the p found in domestic wastewater originates from urine source separation of urine is considered an interesting method for simplifying nutrient recovery larsen et al 2001 even though the concentration of n in urine is significantly higher than that of p struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation only removes n and p in a 1 1 molar ratio necessitating the combination with adsorbent materials to increase the n recovery in hydrolysed urine n is largely present in the form of ammonium nh4 which can undergo adsorption to negatively charged surfaces by ion exchange jorgensen and weatherley 2003 for example natural clinoptilolite zeolites which are composed of al3 substituted silica oxides form a net negative surface charge and a microporous framework of nanotube ion channels that result in a wide range of cation exchange capacities wang and peng 2010 ban and dave 2004 showed that it was possible to recover 90 n and 98 p by combining struvite precipitation with ammonium adsorption to clinoptilolite zeolite 15 g l over a 72 h period the resulting nutrient enriched zeolite can be added directly to agricultural soil as a fertiliser also improving water retention and reducing nutrient leaching hina et al 2015 another ion exchange material that can be used in combination with struvite precipitation is biochar as it also meets several sustainability goals such as energy production carbon sequestration soil enrichment and improvement of plant growth marris 2006 during biochar production via pyrolysis useful by products such as syngas and bio oils are released which could make the process self sustainable xu et al 2011 biochar has a broad range of adsorption rates due to the variety of chemical compositions of biochar depending on the feedstock hina et al 2015 biochars with a negative surface charge have a higher affinity for nh4 whereas high intrinsic n or p levels can cause net release of these nutrients nutrient recovery by struvite precipitation combined with biochar adsorption increases the n uptake from 14 to 40 indicating a promising n adsorption capacity xie and reddy 2013 biochar is also a known adsorbent of micro pollutants zhang et al 2013 that can adsorb a broad range of organic chemicals such as pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and steroid hormones kookana et al 2011 conversely the surface of zeolite is hydrophilic limiting the affinity for organic micro pollutants although zeolite is an effective adsorbent of phenol yousef et al 2011 the combination of sorbent materials with struvite clearly increases the nutrient uptake but the possible uptake of micro pollutants found in human waste poses a barrier to the reuse of both phosphorus and nitrogen via urine derived fertilisers lienert et al 2007 but has never been quantified pharmaceutical residues are also predominantly excreted via urine 64 on average with a maximum deviation of 27 and the risk to human health from these contaminants must be assessed in order to unlock the commercial potential of urinary p and n lienert et al 2007 previous research on contamination of nutrients recovered from urine has focused on chemical precipitation of struvite as an efficient 100 p recovery technique liu et al 2014 ronteltap et al 2010 which produces high purity crystalline material that is well within regulatory limits furthermore struvite precipitation from urine that is spiked with pharmaceutical residues resulted in a product that excluded 98 99 of the organic micro pollutants that were tested escher et al 2006 ronteltap et al 2007 struvite precipitation from urine that contains pharmaceutical residues in combination with adsorbent materials however has not been investigated as well as the possible health risks of using these recovered nutrients for food production besides analysing the uptake of micro pollutants into struvite when combined with adsorbent materials it is also important to measure the uptake into edible parts of the crops since this might entail a risk to human health however there have been no previous studies that have examined the possible uptake of pharmaceutical micro pollutants from struvite into edible parts of the crops the fruits the objective of this research is twofold firstly to determine the uptake of pharmaceutical micro pollutants by struvite recovered from contaminated human urine in combination with adsorbent materials and secondly to determine the subsequent uptake of these micro pollutants into edible parts of crops 2 material and methods 2 1 urine reagents adsorbent materials cuvettes and stock solutions pure urine with an average ph of 9 5 9 7 fig s1 in the supplementary information was collected from a waterless men s urinal at café de ceuvel amsterdam netherlands in two 100 l buffer tanks and pumped from the second tank to the struvite reactor magnesium chloride and all pharmaceuticals 98 purity were obtained from sigma aldrich netherlands and used as received clinoptilolite zeolite and wheat husk biochar ph 8 78 8 97 were purchased from zeolite products netherlands and sonnenerde austria respectively and their properties are listed in the supplementary information table s2 ortho and total p cuvette tests lck350 2 0 20 0 mg l po4 p total n cuvette tests lck338 20 100 mg l n and nh4 cuvette tests lck302 47 130 mg l nh4 n were obtained from hach lange netherlands aqueous stock solutions of pharmaceuticals carbamazepine propranolol diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen were prepared using distilled water and ethanol 96 purity obtained from vwr the five pharmaceuticals have been selected on the basis of their common occurrence in urine their wide range of physiochemical properties table s1 in the supplementary information different biological activities and previous appearance in literature the pharmaceutical concentrations in urine were based on toxic potency and molar predicted urine concentrations puc calculated according to escher et al 2006 to simulate an average population nutrients were recovered using struvite precipitation and adsorption of n onto zeolite and biochar the change in nutrient and micro pollutant concentration in the input and effluent urine was measured to determine the uptake using chemical analysis the five fertilisers were then tested in a small crop trial using dwarf tomato plants and the resulting tomato fruit biomass was tested for micro pollutant content the biomass concentrations were then used to assess the risk to human health using toxicity data solution concentrations and ethanol water ratios are listed in table 1 the relative molecular mass rmm acidity pk a and hydrophobicity logk ow values for each pharmaceutical are shown in the supplementary information table s1 as these properties may influence the adsorption onto zeolite and biochar surfaces 2 2 nutrient recovery pharmaceutical solutions were added to human urine in final concentrations calculated according to escher et al 2006 as shown in table 1 the spiked urine was used to generate fertilisers in an air agitated batch reactor using five different nutrient recovery techniques listed in table 2 the desired volume of the mgcl2 solution added in order to precipitate struvite was based on the total p concentration of the influent urine and calculated using equation s 1 in the supplementary information the reactor was filled with urine to 25 l a sample of urine was removed for p content analysis pharmaceutical stock solutions were added and aeration was switched on an aqueous 32 mgcl2 solution was added to the struvite crystallisation experiments in the mg p ratio indicated in table 2 and sorbent materials 300 g were added to the n adsorption experiments either subsequent to or instead of mgcl2 addition the resulting mixture was agitated by aeration for 2 h during which nutrient recovery by struvite crystallisation and or adsorption occurred the reactor was drained through a food grade micron filter mesh 110 μm to collect the sorbents and through a smaller mesh filter 20 μm to collect the precipitated struvite a sample of the urine effluent was removed for analysis and the remaining supernatant was directed to the sewer the filter cake was washed with tap water and left to air dry over several days five batches of each nutrient recovery technique were carried out 2 3 crop trial the urine fertilisers were used to grow dwarf tomato plants from seedlings in a crop trial over a 2 month period the p content of urine derived fertilisers was measured in order to accurately balance the mass of each struvite based fertiliser by p 5 3 g see the supplementary information table s3 the mass of the zeolite and biochar fertilisers 350 g was equal to the mass used for the szm and sb fertilisers 400 g subtracting the approximate mass of struvite 50 g the plant growth experiments were set up by planting a seedling in a mixture of sand potting soil 500 ml and the pre weighed urine derived fertilisers using the approximate volume ratios shown in table s3 in a 6 l pot a cotton wick was placed from each pot to a water reservoir below in order to maintain moisture levels by capillary action after 63 days of growth all tomato fruits were harvested and dried at 75 c for 24 h in a drying oven 2 4 analytical methods the influent and effluent urine were characterised for n and p content using colorimetric analysis in order to determine the n and p uptake into each fertiliser when necessary urine samples were first diluted with deionised water to an appropriate concentration for analysis using a hach lange dr laboratory vis spectrophotometer following the working procedures described in the hach lange dr 3900 user manual and using the total n and total p test cuvettes see table 3 the struvite fertiliser was characterised by x ray powder diffraction xrpd and for p content by a colorimetric analysis in order to determine the crystallinity and purity of the generated material respectively xrpd analysis of the solid dry filter cake material was carried out with a rigaku miniflex ii diffractometer using ni filtered cu kα radiation universiteit van amsterdam netherlands the solid material was also observed through a leica dmls polarising light microscope plm with 10x 0 22 ph1 magnification waternet amsterdam the purity of the struvite was tested further by dissolving 10 mg material in 500 ml deionised water and measuring the p concentration using colorimetric analysis as described above the purity was then calculated as a percentage of the theoretical p concentration based on the sample mass micro pollutant uptake from urine was tested by measuring the final concentrations of spiked pharmaceuticals in the effluent of each nutrient recovery experiment because pure human urine was used for these experiments it was expected that there could be low level concentrations of pharmaceutical micro pollutants already present in the influent urine therefore the measured influent urine concentrations before spiking with pharmaceuticals and the spiked concentrations were added together to give the total input urine concentration shown in table 4 samples from each batch 20 ml were combined so that a 100 ml mixed sample of each of the fertiliser effluents was submitted for micro pollutant concentration analysis at eurofins omegam b v netherlands samples were diluted in several dilutions x10 and x100 and analysed with hplc ms ms with an agilent 1260 infinity hplc and an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with jet stream technology by direct injection the percentage uptake of pharmaceuticals into the fertilisers was then calculated from the difference in concentration in the urine effluent and input concentration since pharmaceuticals tend to be poorly degradable in urine richter 2003 we believe that there is no significant degradation of the studied micropollutants in urine escher et al 2006 confirm this as they reported that there is no degradation of ibuprofen and propranolol in urine over time dried tomato biomass samples were also submitted for analysis at eurofins omegam b v netherlands to determine the micro pollutant accumulation in the tomato fruits samples were extracted and analysed with hplc ms ms by direct injection the mass uptake of pharmaceuticals into the tomato biomass from urine derived fertilisers was then calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 struvite characterisation higher purity struvite is less prone to the uptake of contaminants since the main goal of this research was the possible detection of pharmaceuticals in crops using struvite in combination with sorbent materials we wanted to set an upper limit by using low purity struvite 84 wt to maximise the possible uptake of contaminants in the fertilizers this will provide an upper boundary for the quality and safety of the recovered nutrients for subsequent reuse in food production the obtained struvite by struvite precipitation of the pure urine from the urinary of restaurant de ceuvel amsterdam was observed to be greyish white and powdery with little odour a crystallinity analysis by x ray powder diffraction xrpd fig 1 indicated that the material was crystalline and comparable to literature values sinha et al 2014 there were no extra peaks qualitatively indicating just one polymorphic form and no trace crystalline impurities the crystal size observed by polarised light microscopy plm was very small between 20 and 120 μm with an x shaped morphology which supports literature kemacheevakul et al 2015 crystallised material from struvite zeolite mineral with n adsorption from urine szm and struvite biochar with n adsorption from urine sb experiments were also analysed by plm and the morphology observed was more rod shaped crystals in nature likely caused by the presence of solid zeolite and biochar material during the crystallisation process 3 2 phosphorus recovery the p recovery for struvite struvite in combination with zeolite szm and in combination with biochar sb fertilisers was in all cases high 96 98 as confirmed in literature liu et al 2014 ronteltap et al 2010 whereas the p recovery for zeolite and biochar without struvite precipitation was substantially lower 5 which indicates that p recovery for szm and sb was predominantly controlled by struvite precipitation rather than adsorption into the sorbent materials the mean measured p uptake of the solely zeolite fertiliser of 4 9 is in line with previous findings that report between 2 8 and 12 9 uptake from an average urine concentration 200 mg p l urine the p po4 3 adsorption capacity of zeolite is low due to unfavourable electrostatic interaction and was found to be 0 93 mg p g zeolite this is consistent with the previous reported findings which varies from 0 46 mg p g zeolite drizo et al 1999 to 2 15 mg p g zeolite sakadevan and bavor 1998 zeolite p adsorption is known to be driven by the presence of hydrous metal oxides such as al oh on the surface where phosphate anions replace oh and h2o groups rajan 1976 phosphate adsorption onto zeolite can also occur via precipitation with native exchangeable zeolite cations ca2 na or k which are free to move in the channels of the zeolite framework wang and peng 2010 however the average concentration of these cations in zeolite is low table s2 in the supplementary information a combination of these mechanisms and varying availability of these metals accounted for the low p recovery from urine into zeolite we believe that the uptake for batch 3 and 4 2 5 and 7 7 respectively is a result of the intrinsic p content of biochar 1 8 table s2 of the supplementary information which could have released water soluble p the soluble p content of biochar 500 mg p kg described in the supplementary information could release 150 mg p batch on average due to the irregular nature of biochar this value may not be representative of the total amount of water soluble p in every batch resulting in a positive uptake for batches 1 2 and 5 and net release in 3 and 4 zheng et al 2010 showed that p adsorption by biochar is controlled by a precipitation reaction with ca2 producing ca3 po4 2 xh2o and is therefore dependent on the intrinsic ca2 content of the biochar 3 3 nitrogen recovery besides p recovery also the n recovery of each of the fertiliser streams has been analysed the n recovery of struvite without the sorbent materials zeolite or biochar was on average 6 0 and almost doubled when combined with addition of the sorbent materials in both szm and sb reaching 10 total n recovery the n recovery into struvite was found to be 6 0 gn per 25 l batch this is greater than the n recovery by a 1 1 n p molar ratio with recovered p which would be 4 9 gn this indicates an excess n of 1 1 gn per batch table s4 of the supplementary information which is possibly adsorbed to the 16 amorphous struvite content the n recovery into zeolite 1 52 mol nh4 kg zeolite was equal to the cation exchange capacity cec of the zeolite table s2 in the supplementary information indicating that the main uptake mechanism was cation exchange hina et al 2015 the szm fertiliser did not contain the n impurity observed in the struvite experiments this is because zeolite seeding enhances crystal growth allowing agglomeration of struvite fines on the zeolite surface which do not otherwise agglomerate in hydrolysed urine due to high struvite zeta potentials at high ph le corre et al 2007 urine contains naturally competing cations such as mg2 and ca2 which are most likely the reason for the high variability of n uptake since mg2 can compete with nh4 for adsorption sites a high 5 1 ratio of mg p is used in our sb experiments the chemical composition and surface functionality of biochar is known to vary widely which results in a number of different adsorption mechanisms these account for the higher n uptake variability relative to zeolite based fertilisers spokas et al 2012 where some of these uptake mechanisms such as ammonium sulphate or amine formation in the biochar carbon lattice can be irreversible hina et al 2015 spokas et al 2012 the n uptake of biochar was therefore higher than zeolite but the availability of n to plants may be lower 3 4 micro pollutant uptake into fertilisers a significant uptake of pharmaceuticals into the five fertilizers was found as the micro pollutant concentration in the effluent streams was reduced compared to the total input concentrations fig 2 the pharmaceutical uptake is dependent on the type of fertilisers and pharmaceuticals table 4 the highest average uptake during the conditions and concentrations of this experiment was for propranolol with an average uptake ranging between 34 and 87 and an average of 66 8 on average 92 of the diclofenac of the input urine concentrations was found in the effluent which means that only 8 of the diclofenac was taken up in the fertilizers the fertiliser with on average the highest uptake was zeolite with an uptake of 50 of the micro pollutants in the input stream the lowest uptake was in the struvite and szm fertilizers both on average 26 6 uptake a more extensive study with different concentrations of pharmaceuticals and amounts of struvite and sorbent materials is necessary to understand fully the sorption processes the ibuprofen concentration in the struvite effluent and diclofenac concentration in sb and biochar effluent streams have a slightly higher concentration than in the influent streams which compares well with a study on pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of several wastewater treatment plants where also a slight increase of diclofenac in the effluent stream was found kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 this increase can be a result of hydrolysis of pharmaceutical conjugates or other factors since human urine has been used instead of synthetic urine in this study there were no trends linking uptake to pharmaceutical properties such as logk ow or pk a table s1 in the supplementary information kemacheevakul et al 2015 indicates that the mg p ratio has a direct influence on pharmaceuticals in struvite via using a low mg p ratio 1 2 1 for the precipitation of the struvite fertilisers we succeeded in a high pharmaceutical uptake in the struvite based streams by using a low mg p ratio the micro pollutants had the opportunity to be adsorbed to the 16 amorphous impurity content in the struvite consequently if the purity is improved via increasing the mg p ratio the micro pollutant uptake will be lower in combination with zeolite in szm the crystallisation of struvite improved resulting in the lowest uptake of 4 out of 5 micro pollutants table 4 the uptake of all the micro pollutants except diclofenac into sb and biochar fertilisers was relatively high ranging between 30 and 90 uptake this is due to the organic composition of the biochar as the hydrocarbon micro pollutant molecules are able to form hydrophobic interactions that are not possible with inorganic zeolite and struvite spokas et al 2012 the high logk ow values table s1 indicate high hydrophobicity for the majority of the pharmaceuticals with the exception of sulfamethoxazole logk ow 0 89 however the uptake of sulfamethoxazole into biochar based fertilisers was the second highest since there was no direct correlation between hydrophobicity and uptake therefore in addition to hydrophobic interactions pharmaceutical adsorption may also be controlled by the high amount of functional groups on the biochar s surface allowing interaction with pharmaceuticals via several different mechanisms zhang et al 2013 the pharmaceutical uptake was not affected by the addition of magnesium used in sb experiments compared to biochar indicating that the additional mg content was indeed sequestered by the biochar and not available to chelate with pharmaceutical molecules xie and reddy 2013 kemacheevakul et al 2015 unlike the similarity between sb and biochar the uptake of micro pollutants into zeolite was 30 higher than szm on average with the exception of ibuprofen uptake the sorption characteristics of zeolite are largely controlled by surface area pore size and electrostatic interaction with the surface charge anderson 2000 in the basic environment of the urine ph 9 4 9 8 the micro pollutants with higher pk a than nh4 pk a 9 24 table s1 in the supplementary information carbamazepine pk a 13 9 and propranolol pk a 9 24 are more basic and could compete with nh4 the remaining micro pollutants with lower pk a values are more likely to be deprotonated by the more basic species in solution the uptake of the remaining micro pollutants is therefore more likely to be due to a different mechanism yousef et al 2011 found that phenol adsorption onto zeolite was enthalpy driven and physical in nature zeolites with less al3 substation of si4 have a lower capacity for nh4 uptake but are more hydrophobic and could thus sorb the uncharged organic micro pollutants anderson 2000 the pharmaceutical micro pollutants are also slightly polar which strengthens dipole interactions with the zeolite surface however selectivity could arise from size exclusion by the zeolite micro pore which reduces the effective surface area for adsorption onto zeolite the comparatively reduced uptake to szm may be partially due the presence of struvite crystals blocking the zeolite pores and reducing the number of adsorption sites finally the spiked micro pollutant concentrations were based on predicted urine concentration puc values calculated by escher et al 2006 which were representative for the selected pharmaceutical micro pollutants additional micro pollutants are also often present in human urine such as hormones and other pharmaceuticals indeed the following chemicals which were not spiked to urine were detected by hplc ms ms in trace amounts salicylic acid atenolol caffeine gabapentin and paracetamol which can therefore have only a minor influence on the sorption results 3 5 micro pollutant bioaccumulation in tomato fruit next the bioaccumulation of five common pharmaceuticals propranolol diclofenac sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and carbamazepine was determined by harvesting the tomatoes fertilized with the various fertiliser streams and analyzing these with hplc ms ms no pharmaceuticals were detected in the tomatoes produced with the struvite sb szm and biochar fertilizers detection limit 0 001 mg kg in the tomatoes fertilized with zeolite only a minimal amount of carbamazepine 0 003 mg per kg tomato fruit was detected therefore we can conclude that the bioaccumulation was at most 0 0003 for the micro pollutant carbamazepine and for the others below 0 0001 under the circumstances of this study which is the detection limit the harm to human health that could be caused by this micro concentration of carbamazepine is assessed using toxicology data fig 3 several different limits are available in the literature 3 mg kg day is the lowest dose of carbamazepine at which an adverse effect is observed loael from which a toxicological reference value trv or tolerable daily intake of 0 033 mg kg day can be derived houeto et al 2012 with a mean uptake of 0 003 mg carbamazepine kg dw tomato biomass an adult weighing 67 kg would need to consume 220 000 kg of dried tomatoes per day in order to reach the loael limit which is 10 million times more than the average daily intake of a citizen of the united states fig 3 an alternative to using loael and trv values is to calculate an acceptable daily intake adi value by applying a safety factor of 100 to the minimum therapeutic dose carter et al 2014 shown in the supporting information since none of the other pharmaceuticals has been detected the acceptable daily intake is based on the margin of error of the instrument 0 001 mg kg tomato dw table 5 the total dry tomato biomass calculated in each case of taking the detection limit as the value is at least a million times higher than what would reasonably be consumed per day for each pharmaceutical it can therefore be concluded that levels of micro pollutants detected in the tomatoes are not harmful to human health and the tomato fruit are safe for human consumption from a health safety point of view the struvite sorbent fertilisers derived from spiked human urine are hence acceptable for use in tomato production the uptake of pharmaceutical micro pollutants in the struvite is high due to the amorphous impurities and the low mg p ratio for the precipitation when the crystallisation process is optimized the amount of taken up pharmaceuticals will be reduced resulting in an even lower bioaccumulation in the fruits in addition to the uptake of pharmaceuticals in fruits and the roots the accumulation of the pharmaceuticals in the soil and ground water has previously been studied the uptake into plants could increase over time if there is an accumulation of micro pollutants in soils or that pharmaceutical concentrations could affect bacterial or mycorrhizal organisms in the soil hillis et al 2008 a complex but important task for further research would be to carry out an analysis of the accumulation of the pharmaceuticals in other parts of the plant roots and leaves and the soil and aqueous environment in this case human urine is used but struvite is currently mainly precipitated out of waste streams such as wastewater these sources increase the risk of contaminations with several types of micro pollutants as other pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones pesticides and industrial chemicals 4 concluding remarks struvite based fertilisers resulted in effective p recovery and combination with sorbent materials zeolite and biochar allowed the n recovery to increase which is related to the presence of competing ions the bioaccumulation in tomato fruit biomass from each of the contaminated fertilisers in a crop trial was at most 0 0003 and far below the acceptable daily intake adi levels calculated from the literature with an uptake of 0 003 mg carbamazepine kg dw tomato biomass an adult weighing 67 kg would need to consume 73 kg of dried tomatoes per day in order to reach the trv limit table 5 which is 10 thousand times more than the average daily intake of a citizen of the united states to reach the lowest toxicity limit loael2 over 220 000 kg dried tomatoes would need to be consumed in one day nutrient recovery into struvite sorbent fertilisers therefore has potential as a safe method to re use n and p from human urine as tomato plant leaves and roots are not consumed by humans this is unlikely to affect human health however it is advisable to carry out further research in order to determine the risk of using contaminated plant biomass for other purposes such as compost or animal feed therefore besides the uptake of pharmaceuticals in fruits the accumulation of the pharmaceuticals in the roots the soil and ground water should be investigated this study has shown that the health risk from pharmaceutical micro pollutants transferred from human urine to struvite and sorbent based fertilisers into tomato crop fruit is insignificant acknowledgement we would like to thank waternet netherlands for lending their

strontium 90 sr 90 at the interface between groundwater and surface water wetlands possess unique hydrogeochemical properties whose impact on sr transport has not been investigated thoroughly in this study the adsorption and desorption of sr was investigated on six natural wetland substrates and two mixes of exogenous media and wetland sediment winter and summer wetland sediments decayed cattails wood leaf litter moss bone charcoal and clinoptilolite the composition of the organic matter was characterized using carbon 13 solid phase nuclear magnetic resonance analysis the range of the substrates adsorption coefficients obtained could be explained by factors indicative of proteins in the organic matter which were shown to support strong and poorly reversible sr adsorption in contrast the proportion of carbohydrates and lignin were found to be indicative of lower adsorption coefficients and higher desorption the implications of these results for sr pollution remediation in

sr transport remains affected by its adsorption and desorption from solid phases such as soil and sediments guillen et al 2010 where sr adsorption mainly occurs as outer sphere complexes forsberg et al 2001 wallace et al 2012 and depends on ph and ionic strength savoye et al 2015 at low ph and high ionic strength hydronium and other cations compete with sr for binding sites thus lowering its adsorption potential seeprasert et al 2016 wallace et al 2012 both organic and inorganic compounds are responsible for delays in sr transport smičiklas et al 2015b however to date the biogeochemical processes governing sr interactions with the organic portion of environmental matrices have not been characterized in detail when studying which organic fractions sr bounds to for a variety of organic soils fedorkova et al 2012 found that 25 35 of the sr was adsorbed to fulvic acids juo and barber 1970 studied the adsorption of sr and speciation of remaining aqueous sr for an organic sediment with 49 organic matter they found that at ph above 10 a significant portion of the sr in solution could be present as sr chelates or complexes whereas at lower ph around 5 the soluble sr was in its free cationic form juo and barber 1970 besides organic sediments a few organic vegetal substrates such as fungus khani et al 2012 and seeds chakraborty et al 2007 have also been studied for their potential to adsorb sr all of these substrates exhibited high adsorption capacities especially at higher ph while research conducted to date has clearly outlined the importance and high potential of organic matter in sr adsorption chen 1997 khani et al 2012 seeprasert et al 2016 the effect of organic matter origin and composition on sr adsorption has been poorly characterized in addition very limited research has quantified the potential of adsorbed sr to be mobilized back into the water column via desorption a key process in investigating sr environmental fate gao et al 2003 munthali et al 2015 oecd 2000 one of sr s isotopes radioactive strontium 90 90sr is a widely distributed radiological contaminant with a half life of 28 8 years that is present at multiple nuclear sites around the world bugai et al 2012 corcho alvarado et al 2016 dewiere et al 2004 johnson and dortch 2014 um et al 2013 this anthropogenic radionuclide is produced by nuclear fuel irradiation and is present in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste shevchuk et al 2010 in addition to globally distributed deposition resulting from bomb testing and nuclear accidents dezerald et al 2015 there are many point source emissions of 90sr coming from reactor or fuel cycle facility effluents nuclear waste management areas and accident sites guillen et al 2010 even though this pollution has motivated multiple studies on sr environmental fate munthali et al 2015 qi et al 2014 smičiklas et al 2015a few have evaluated potential methods to remediate 90sr pollution at many of these sites the radionuclides leach into groundwater and later resurface into wetlands kaplan et al 2014 due to its short half life relative to that of other radioisotopes a potential remediation method for 90sr pollution involves its confinement in a controlled system until its decay to the stable zirconium 90 isotope wetlands encompass a wide range of physical chemical and biological conditions while this rich complexity has proven efficient in eliminating a number of pollutants kadlec and wallace 2009 sr behavior in such environments is still poorly understood both field and modeling studies showed that sr removal in natural wetlands exists but is typically weak kröpfelová et al 2009 lidman et al 2014 šíma et al 2016 however no wetlands have been specifically designed to contain sr pollution by identifying the key components of organic matter that strongly retain sr better designs and wetland management practices can be developed in a way to support the production of such organic compounds and limit the long term release of radioactive contamination from groundwater discharge bugai et al 2012 the first objective of this study was to evaluate the adsorption and desorption potential of sr on two wetland sediments four wetland organic substrates and two exogenous media sediment mixes the second objective was to identify relationships between sr adsorption and desorption and the organic substrates properties these included ph cation exchange capacity cec organic matter content elemental composition and the relative proportion of organic matter functional groups finally the last objective of this work was to discuss the environmental implications of these results for the remediation of sr pollution in wetlands and the design of engineered wetlands for sr retention 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates eight different substrates were tested in batch sr adsorption and desorption experiments two wetland sediments four wetland organic substrates and two exogenous media sediment mixes besides the two exogenous media and the wood the other five natural substrates consisted of well mixed composite samples of several samples obtained from uncontaminated wetland areas at the chalk river canadian nuclear laboratories cnl site ontario canada the two sediments were collected from the top 10 cm in a 10 m2 plot in a treed swamp once in february 2016 and once in may 2016 referred to as the winter wetland sediments and the summer wetland sediments respectively the two seasons were selected to evaluate if potential changes in the sediment organic matter composition due to seasonal changes in redox biological and microbial conditions affected sr adsorption and desorption potential the treed swamp was flooded seasonally in the winter the treed swamp was continuously saturated and was covered by approximately 30 cm of snow resulting in sustained anaerobic conditions whereas in the summer the treed swamp had variable saturation conditions and the presence of new plant shoots resulting in more oxygenated sediments the four wetland organic substrates consisted of leaf litter populus and betula papyrifera moss sphagnum wood pinus strobus and cattails typha latifolia the latter included live and dead standing shoots roots and seeds they were all collected in may 2016 the leaf litter and moss were both sampled from a 50 m2 area in the treed swamp while the cattails were collected from a 30 m2 area in a marsh the marsh was flooded seasonally and densely vegetated with cattails the wood was 100 kiln dried pine wood chips and obtained from rolf c hagen incorporated mississauga on canada to investigate if sr retention increased by incorporating amendments with known high adsorption capacity in the wetland sediments clinoptilolite na2 k2 ca 3 si30 al6 o72 20h2o and bone charcoal were mixed into the summer wetland sediment at a proportion of 2 and 10 by weight respectively the clinoptilolite was procured from cnl and the bone charcoal was purchased from highwater filters colville wa united states before use the cattails collected in the field were anaerobically decayed in the lab to mimic dead vegetation accumulating in the water column of many wetlands the sediments leaf litter cattails and moss were first air dried then freeze dried international standard organisation iso 2005 ground using a high speed rotating cutting mill and sieved to 2 mm oecd 2000 the wood was also ground and sieved to 2 mm before their use all substrates were stored in hermetic containers at 4 c for less than 3 months the initial characterization of the substrates is summarized in table 1 and supplementary material sm sm s 2 2 2 adsorption desorption isotherm experiments triplicate adsorption and desorption isotherm experiments were conducted following the batch method outlined in oecd 106 oecd 2000 with solid liquid ratios ranging from 0 01 to 0 09 g ml the smaller ratios for the wetland organic substrates were chosen to ensure uniform mixing due to the wide range of carbon contents in the substrates studied table 1 the solid liquid ratios were chosen so that the ratios of organic content to liquid volumes were similar ranging from 0 01 to 0 03 g ml sm table s 1 between 0 5 and 2 4 g dry weight of substrates was weighed into 50 ml polycarbonate centrifuge tubes and either 22 5 or 42 5 ml of 0 5 mm cacl2 was added depending on the target solid liquid ratio sm s 3 the tubes were mixed using a carousel shaker at 30 rpm for 12 h for pre equilibration as recommended in the oecd method each tube was then spiked with 2 ml of stable sr solution to obtain initial stable sr concentrations of 0 5 10 30 100 and 500 μg l giving triplicate samples for each of the five concentration levels the tubes were also spiked with 0 5 ml of radioactive 85sr solution to reach an initial activity in each tube close to 7000 bq sm s 4 as determined during initial kinetics experiments the tubes were shaken for 24 h to reach adsorption equilibrium the tubes were then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 40 min the supernatant collected filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter and analyzed by gamma spectroscopy sm s 5 immediately after the adsorption study the desorption study was performed on the samples that had an initial sr concentration of 500 μg l for that sr free 0 5 mm cacl2 was added to each tube containing the substrates pellets in amounts corresponding to the initial volume of cacl2 solution the tubes were then mixed for 24 h to reach desorption equilibrium the equilibrium was determined through a kinetics study according to the oecd 106 protocol results not shown oecd 2000 the samples were centrifuged and the supernatants collected and analyzed to determine the amount of 85sr desorbed the desorption experiments were done a total of three times for six of the substrates and twice for the wood and the bone charcoal mixed with summer wetland sediment sm s 6 strontium adsorption and desorption on each substrate were modeled using linear and freundlich isotherms described in equations 1 and 2 respectively oecd 2000 1 m a d s k d c e where mads is the adsorption density mg kg ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l and kd is the linear adsorption coefficient l kg 2 m a d s k f a d s c e n f a d s where kf ads is the freundlich adsorption coefficient mg 1 nf ads l nf ads kg 1 and nf ads is the unitless regression constant the linear kd and freundlich kf ads adsorption coefficients were normalized to the fraction of organic carbon foc measured in each substrate leading to koc and kfoc adsorption coefficients respectively isotherms were considered linear when the curvatures of the freundlich isotherms nf ads were between 0 95 and 1 05 calvet et al 2005 the desorption isotherms are best described by their difference with the adsorption isotherms defined as hysteresis oecd 2000 this difference can be explained by irreversible retention or slow molecular diffusion of the adsorbed analyte out of the micro and nano porous spaces calvet et al 2005 gao et al 2003 the hysteresis can be quantified by the hysteresis coefficient h which is calculated according to equation 3 oecd 2000 3 h n f d e s n f a d s 100 where nf des is the unitless regression constant for the desorption freundlich isotherm all adsorption and desorption isotherm parameters were obtained following oecd 106 guideline on data analysis oecd 2000 2 3 size fractionation to assess the formation of mobile sr complexes the supernatants from the adsorption equilibrium experiments were filtered through three diminishing pore sizes pokrovsky et al 2005 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm both using cellulose acetate filters and 10 kda 1 15 nm using a microfiltration unit pokrovsky et al 2005 in this study these sr fractions are further referred to as large colloids 0 22 μm 0 45 μm small colloids 10 kda 0 22 μm and complexes and cationic 10 kda samples were analyzed by gamma spectroscopy 2 4 nmr spectroscopy due to low decomposition rates and in some cases high biological productivity many wetland soils have high organic content which ranged from 46 to 92 in the substrates studied to evaluate the effect of the substrates organic matter properties on sr adsorption solid state direct polarization magic angle spinning dp mas 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analysis was performed full details are provided in sm s 7 to quantify both the organic matter functional groups and its components two techniques were employed the first simply sectioned the nmr spectra into seven well accepted regions consistent with major functional groups nelson and baldock 2005 the second used interactive weighting of model biopolymers to assess their contribution to the entire spectral profile of the environmental mixtures masoom et al 2016 the spectra were modeled using five components expected in natural organic matter carbohydrates proteins lignins and crystalline and amorphous aliphatic carbons ahmad et al 2006 masoom et al 2016 nelson and baldock 2005 this approach is further described in sm s 7 the first technique can quantify the proportion of carbon in different carbon functional groups e g carboxyl aliphatic amide and methoxy knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 and the second one can identify and quantify the different organic matter components first all nmr spectra were integrated over 7 chemical shift ranges ppm a 210 165 b 165 145 c 145 110 d 110 95 e 95 60 f 60 45 and g 45 10 each integration range can be assigned to specific carbons the a integration range is assigned to carboxyl carbonyl and amide regions knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the b and c ranges are assigned to the aromatics with b corresponding to aromatics bond to nitrogen and oxygen such as phenols and c associated with carbon hydrogen bonds knicker and lüdemann 1995 the d range is assigned to the anomeric carbons found in carbohydrates knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the e range represents the carbohydrates and some amino acid groups knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the f range is assigned to the carbon in methoxyl groups of polysaccharides and amino acids knicker and lüdemann 1995 from the lignin masoom et al 2016 and the g range represents the carbon in methylene groups from aliphatic carbons or from the amino acids in proteins knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the second technique was used to calculate the proportion of the five different soil components listed above by fitting the substrate spectrums to a 5 component model this method aligns with the new paradigm that soil organic matter is a complex mixture that has strong well defined biopolymer signatures kelleher and simpson 2006 nelson and baldock 2005 vepraskas and craft 2015 the model iteratively scaled the spectra of the five components until their sum best matched the overall spectra profile of the mixture being fitted the percentage of the area occupied by each standard in the combined spectrum corresponds to the percentage of that component in the organic matter weighted contributions are provided in sm figs s4 s6 standards were selected to represent the range of components expected in similar organic sediment and vegetal substrates based on former studies masoom et al 2016 nelson and baldock 2005 sm s 8 2 5 statistical analysis principal component analysis pca was completed to display data groupings and correlations for the adsorption koc coefficients and desorption hysteresis h coefficients for the six natural substrates this resulted in 5 degrees of freedom therefore the five most influential physical and chemical descriptors for each of the adsorption and desorption datasets identified through the pearson s product moment sm s 9 were used in pca all analyses were done in r team 2015 3 results 3 1 adsorption isotherms for all substrates the adsorption isotherms fig 1 were well described by the linear model with r2 values above 0 97 and freundlich nf ads coefficients ranging from 0 96 to 1 05 table 2 the koc adsorption coefficients ranged from 384 to 5960 l kg the winter and summer wetland sediments displayed large adsorption with koc values of 2020 30 and 4270 310 l kg respectively despite sr is known to be a mobile element in the environment bugai et al 2012 dewiere et al 2004 these koc values are within the range of or higher than adsorption coefficients reported in the literature sm s 10 and table s 3 the addition of 2 w w clinoptilolite to summer wetland sediment resulted in a 220 increase in the koc value of the sediment alone to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report bone charcoal s very high potential for sr adsorption with a koc of 280 000 360 l kg sm s 11 however 10 w w bone charcoal resulted in only a 13 increase in the adsorption of the native wetland sediments 3 2 desorption isotherms the freundlich desorption models were not as robust as the linear adsorption models with r2 values ranging from 0 68 for the summer wetland sediment to 0 99 for the moss and clinoptilolite overall the results showed that all substrates and exogenous media sediment mixes had low desorption table 2 and fig 2 the hysteresis coefficients were below 6 for all substrates except for the decayed cattails at 14 7 and for the sediment mixes with bone charcoal at 30 3 and clinoptilolite at 17 1 3 3 size fractionation study for all substrates less than 20 of the sr was bound to large colloids sm s 12 the substrates with the largest sr amounts bound to this size fraction were those with the highest adsorption capacities moss and the summer and winter wetland sediments with 10 18 and 11 respectively all other organic substrates had less than 5 of the sr bound to large colloids sm table s 4 for the sr partitioned in the small colloids fraction the duplicate measurements did not allow for calculating a standard deviation therefore the combined uncertainty was computed due to the low radioactivity of the samples in the small colloid fraction the combined uncertainty was large as a result only two significant measurements can be reported for the decayed cattails and for the leaf litter which had at least 32 and 5 of the sr in the small colloid fraction respectively the portions of sr in all other substrates were below the calculated combined uncertainty 3 4 nmr the nmr chemical shift range results in fig 2a showed that the largest proportions of carbons in the proteins were in ranges a and g for a total of 65 whereas it was in ranges e and d for carbohydrates total of 84 ranges b and f for lignins total of 47 and in range g for the aliphatic carbons total of 73 for the natural substrates tested the sediments had the largest fraction of carbon in ranges a and g indicating that they had the largest proportion of proteins and aliphatic carbons at 47 and 48 for the winter and summer wetland sediments respectively in the sediments of natural wetlands the processes of organic matter decomposition and microbial growth increase the protein content knicker and lüdemann 1995 simpson et al 2007 when comparing the four wetland organic substrates the moss had the largest proportion of carbon in range a at 13 and a large carbon proportion in range g at 28 with the high nitrogen content of the moss the most likely attributions for range g are the amino acids in proteins like the moss the leaf litter had a large proportion of its carbon in range g at 20 however unlike the sediments and peat the lower nitrogen content of the leaf litter and the high content of the epicuticular wax in leaves indicate that the carbons could be in long aliphatic chains nguyen tu et al 2001 all the wetland organic substrates had a large fraction of the carbon in range e between 29 and 50 because these substrates have not gone through the humification process to a large extent there are many remaining carbohydrates in these substrates the wood had the largest fraction of carbon in range f which relates to the high lignin content of wood material suhas et al 2007 no paramagnetic influence was seen in the sediment sm figure s 6 therefore the spectra of the sediments that were not treated with hydrofluoric acid were used for analysis the five component model fig 3 confirmed these findings the sediment was the substrate highest in proteins with 14 and 17 of the carbons as proteins for the summer and winter wetland sediments respectively similarly the moss with 7 of the carbons as proteins was the wetland organic substrate highest in proteins wood had the largest proportion of lignin 23 while the leaf litter was the highest for both amorphous and crystalline aliphatic carbons 25 and 23 respectively an example acquired and modeled spectra for both sediments are shown in fig 4 all other spectra can be seen in sm s 13 3 5 principal component analysis pca the two principal components pcs explained 89 7 of the variance in the adsorption data set fig 5 a the koc percent lignin and cec parameters were only described by pc1 while tn and nmr range b 165 145 ppm were described by both pc1 and pc2 there was a strong positive correlation between the koc and the cec parameters and a smaller positive correlation between koc and tn the adsorption coefficients were negatively or not correlated with the percent lignin there was also a weaker negative or no correlation between the koc values and the 165 145 ppm integration range b for the desorption data the two principal components explained 84 6 of the variance fig 5b desorption was described by both pc1 and pc2 the hysteresis coefficients were positively correlated with the 110 95 ppm integration range d while it was negatively or not correlated to the 145 110 and 45 10 ppm integration ranges c and g respectively and the total nitrogen to organic carbon ratio 4 discussion 4 1 exogenous media sediment mixes the adsorption of sr onto clinoptilolite was tested by smičiklas et al 2007 who found a maximum adsorption density of 9 mg g bone charcoal has not yet been tested for sr but was found to adsorb divalent cations such as ca2 in the lattice of apatites cheung et al 2000 since these were cationic exchange adsorption processes they were both found to be highly ph dependent moreno et al 2010 smičiklas et al 2007 the addition of 2 clinoptilolite to the summer wetland sediments increased the adsorption of the sediment by a factor of three but the addition of a larger proportion of bone charcoal 10 had no significant effect clinoptilolite is known to have high selectivity for sr smičiklas et al 2007 and the various compounds present in the sediment did not appear to compete for ion exchange sites in the zeolite in contrast bone charcoal is not selective and has been shown to adsorb a range of different metals cheung et al 2000 moreno et al 2010 it is possible that the ion exchange sites in the bone charcoal bound to hydronium minerals or organic ligands present in the sediment that outcompeted sr for adsorption explaining the surprising low enhancement in sr adsorption both exogenous media sediment mixes had more reversible adsorption than the wetland organic substrates the ion exchange adsorption sites must therefore lead to more reversible sr adsorption or have less diffusion in micro or nano porous spaces compared to the other natural substrates studied calvet et al 2005 gao et al 2003 4 2 interactions between strontium and organic matter functional groups sample drying and sieving might have affected sr adsorption see sm s 14 however these effects were not expected to be significant compared to those of other factors such as ph cec and organic matter functional groups as described in detail below 4 2 1 role of substrate ph and cec both in inorganic and organic sediments sr competes with other cations for adsorption sites wallace et al 2012 in this study both hydronium at 10 5 m and calcium at 10 4 m could have competed with sr whose initial concentrations ranged from 10 9 to 10 6 m as a result sr adsorption increases with increasing ph khani et al 2012 wallace et al 2012 since the experiments were run at natural ph and all wetland substrate ph values were below 5 1 moderate sr adsorption was expected however all substrates exhibited high to very high and mostly poorly reversible sr adsorption the wetland organic substrates evaluated were able to compensate for hydronium competition this can be explained by the high cec of these substrates at their natural low ph which is known to have a positive correlation with sr adsorption yamaguchi et al 2007 as the ph decreases more of the cation exchange sites are bound to hydroniums thus decreasing the cec helling et al 1964 in inorganic fractions cec increases with clay content helling et al 1964 whereas in organic fractions the cec comes from specific carbon functional groups broadbent and bradford 1952 4 2 2 proteins the four organic substrates had no clay content as they were mainly made of vegetal material and had total organic contents that ranged from 81 to 96 therefore their cec was due to the various carbon functional groups that they were composed of broadbent and bradford 1952 found that carboxylic phenolic and enolic groups were responsible for cec in organic matter additionally multisurface binding models for metal ions onto organic matter use both carboxylic and phenolic groups as their two surface types tipping 1998 the carboxylic carbons are related to polyuronides and aliphatic acids the phenolic groups are related to the lignin aromatics amino acids and tannins and the enolic groups are related to nucleic acids broadbent and bradford 1952 all three groups are associated with proteins present in organic matter broadbent and bradford 1952 since moss was the organic wetland substrate with the largest protein content as indicated by both the nitrogen content and the nmr model results even though it had the lowest ph at 4 3 it had the largest adsorption accordingly pca revealed that a positive correlation was found between cec and nitrogen the latter being an indicator of proteins in the substrate knicker and lüdemann 1995 fig 5a both wetland sediments also had large sr adsorption capacities and were associated with large cec values in this case the high cec was attributed to natural clays organic molecules and the large fraction of carbon found in proteins helling et al 1964 juo and barber 1970 the 5 component model showed that both sediments had more proteins than the other natural substrates by a factor of two or more it is likely that the various ligands available in protein groups would complex sr thus providing the binding sites necessary for the observed high adsorption a large proportion of proteins in organic sediments has been found to originate from the microbial decay of organic matter that results in proteins with characteristic amide peaks simpson et al 2007 these amide groups cause a higher intensity in the carboxyl resonance range in c 13 nmr spectra knicker and lüdemann 1995 this was indeed observed for both the winter and summer wetland sediments which exhibited high resonance in range a 12 1 and 17 9 respectively compared to the other substrates sm table s 5 the resonance of the carbonyl region can also explain the difference between the adsorption coefficients of the winter and summer wetland sediments with a larger intensity in range a a larger total nitrogen concentration and larger cec the summer wetland sediment had more proteins than the winter wetland sediment which resulted in larger sr adsorption potential this is likely due to the larger microbial population in the summer when the temperature is higher and the wetland sediment is more oxidized due to removal of snow cover intermittent flooding and plant root aeration mitsch and gosselink 1993 the protein group also appeared to be related to sr desorption from organic substrates the desorption hysteresis coefficients had a negative or no correlation with the tn tc ratio and resonating range g of the nmr spectra two factors indicative of proteins as a consequence not only were the proteins able to increase sr adsorption but they limited sr desorption 4 2 3 carbohydrates and aromatics the complexes that are forming in the sediments could be sr organic acid complexes forsberg et al 2001 helal et al 1998 juo and barber 1970 the potential for these complexes to form in wetland organic matter were identified by the low proportion of organic carbon found as carbohydrates at approximately 40 in combination with a high proportion found in proteins at around 15 aromatic carbons and hysteresis coefficients were found to be negatively or not correlated even though the adsorption of an ionic compound with aromatic carbons is not expected ahmad et al 2001 the presence of aromatic carbons could therefore be an indicator of mixtures of organic molecules that can decrease sr desorption as explained above the carbohydrates being the easiest to decompose knicker and lüdemann 1995 large proportions of carbon in carbohydrates such as the moss decayed cattails and wood can indicate that there has been less decay in the organic matter and a mixture of organic molecules is not present 4 2 4 lignin lignin was the organic molecule found to have a negative or no correlation with sr adsorption coefficients the high content of lignin in sediments is explained by the molecule being only mineralized by white rot fungus thevenot et al 2010 it is possible that lignin did not have a negative effect on adsorption but did not provide any adsorption sites either as a result substrates with higher lignin and no protein would have lower sr adsorption capacities suhas et al 2007 found that lignin can adsorb cations through ion exchange but only at high ph when hydronium competition is low the wetland substrates tested in this study all had natural ph values lower than 5 1 which is within the 3 5 7 ph range of natural wetlands mitsch and gosselink 1993 but lower than the typical circumneutral ph of treatment wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 4 2 5 colloidal transport of sr the type of carbons in the substrate was not the only factor affecting sr desorption although the c 13 spectrum of the decayed cattails was similar to the spectrum of wood the decayed cattails hysteresis coefficient was almost 3 times larger than that of the wood the cattails were the only substrate that was anaerobically decayed a process that could have resulted in sr mobilization in the form of mobile sr laden colloids in environmental samples most aqueous sr is typically in its ionic form or in complexes whose size fraction is smaller than 10 kda dahlqvist et al 2004 lidman et al 2014 salbu et al 1992 however a previous field study carried out by salbu et al 1992 found that a higher 90sr activity was associated with a larger sr proportion up to 40 present in fractions larger than 10 kda it is possible that the decayed cattails that exhibited the highest but still moderate sr desorption also had enhanced transport due to the large portion greater than 32 associated with the small colloid phase 4 3 environmental implications engineered and natural wetland management practices there could be two opposite goals with respect to environmental sr pollution first some contaminated natural wetlands require remediation to reduce the risk of exposure to 90sr in this case increasing 90sr desorption from contaminated natural wetlands can be an effective remediation method alternatively given the high content and diversity in organic components in wetland environments efficiently delaying 90sr transport towards downstream surface ecosystems by supporting adsorption processes in engineered wetlands can be an effective means to manage radioactive pollution kadlec and wallace 2009 kaplan et al 2014 the differences in the amount of sr adsorption and desorption for the natural and exogenous media tested in this study bring new insight on how to best manage natural and engineered wetlands to remediate contaminated wetlands and increase sr release the results of this study suggest that both sediment and organic matter should be minimized in wetlands as they were shown to be strong sr adsorbents on the other hand if sr retention is desired management practices for engineered wetlands should aim to increase the contact of the contaminated water with the sediment and increase the sediment depth the contact with sediment is best increased by using shallow surface flow wetlands and by increasing the hydraulic retention time kadlec and wallace 2009 all organic matter inputs such as plant material should be left in the wetland to support sr retention although the organic materials initially have a moderate adsorption potential due to their low protein content they can still contribute to retaining sr plant decay also enriches wetland sediments in organic molecules and dense vegetation decreases flow velocity thus increasing the sedimentation rate hosokawa and horie 1992 the sedimentation rate could also be increased by permanent flooding of the wetland cheng 1984 olk and cassman 1996 permanent flooding can decrease both the kinetic energy of the water in the outflow and the decomposition rate due to the resulting anoxic conditions du laing et al 2008 flooding was also proven to increase sediment nitrogen content suggesting protein accumulation olk and cassman 1996 in a full scale wetland the role of inorganic phases in controlling sr retention cannot be ruled out however even though sr can be incorporated into newly produced minerals these tend to form at higher ph and sr concentrations than typically observed in the field ford and wilkin 2010 it is therefore unlikely that inclusion into mineral phases would play a key role in removing aqueous sr in wetlands strontium can also adsorb onto iron fe and manganese mn oxyhydroxides forsberg et al 2001 which might have contributed to the high sr adsorption coefficients measured in this study in the field the reducing conditions present in wetlands would lead in the dissolution of fe and mn oxides thus releasing sr into the water column although maintaining dense vegetation and supporting permanent flooding is expected to help increase sr adsorption in wetlands the consequences of employing such practices e g changes in redox conditions must be evaluated in pilot or full scale studies before conclusive wetland management strategies can be proposed 5 conclusions wetland sediments showed strong and poorly reversible sr adsorption sediment management is therefore essential to either remediate sr contaminated wetlands or retain sr in engineered treatment wetlands of all the natural substrates studied moss had the strongest sr adsorption it is therefore an efficient natural substrate for long term sr retention in wetlands clinoptilolite and bone charcoal showed significant sr desorption therefore their addition into wetland sediments is not recommended increased sr association with colloids between 0 22 μm and 10 kda was observed for the decayed cattails the cattails were also the only natural substrate exhibiting some desorption which could be attributed to sr complexes with the aqueous colloids resulting from the decayed cattails the proteins identified through the nmr spectra integration the 5 component model and the substrates nitrogen content were found to cause stronger adsorption of sr in organic substrates less reversible sr adsorption was observed in organic substrates whose carbon content was lower in carbohydrates and higher aromatics funding this work was supported by the natural sciences

19718,strontium sr is a chemical element that is often used as a tracer in hydrogeochemical studies and is ubiquitously distributed as a radioactive contaminant in nuclear sites in the form of strontium 90 sr 90 at the interface between groundwater and surface water wetlands possess unique hydrogeochemical properties whose impact on sr transport has not been investigated thoroughly in this study the adsorption and desorption of sr was investigated on six natural wetland substrates and two mixes of exogenous media and wetland sediment winter and summer wetland sediments decayed cattails wood leaf litter moss bone charcoal and clinoptilolite the composition of the organic matter was characterized using carbon 13 solid phase nuclear magnetic resonance analysis the range of the substrates adsorption coefficients obtained could be explained by factors indicative of proteins in the organic matter which were shown to support strong and poorly reversible sr adsorption in contrast the proportion of carbohydrates and lignin were found to be indicative of lower adsorption coefficients and higher desorption the implications of these results for sr pollution remediation in wetlands are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords strontium wetland adsorption desorption c 13 nmr soil organic matter 1 introduction strontium sr is an alkaline earth metal with four stable and multiple radioactive isotopes once in the environment sr a calcium analogue is mostly in the form of divalent cation sr2 dahlqvist et al 2004 guillen et al 2010 ilina et al 2013 or in various complexes depending on the environmental physical chemical characteristics it is therefore a mobile radionuclide in surface water groundwater and saturated sediments bugai et al 2012 dewiere et al 2004 strontium isotope ratios e g 87sr 86sr and 88sr 86sr are often used as hydrogeological and biogeochemical tracers andrews and jacobson 2017 burke et al 1982 halicz et al 2008 despite its mobility sr transport remains affected by its adsorption and desorption from solid phases such as soil and sediments guillen et al 2010 where sr adsorption mainly occurs as outer sphere complexes forsberg et al 2001 wallace et al 2012 and depends on ph and ionic strength savoye et al 2015 at low ph and high ionic strength hydronium and other cations compete with sr for binding sites thus lowering its adsorption potential seeprasert et al 2016 wallace et al 2012 both organic and inorganic compounds are responsible for delays in sr transport smičiklas et al 2015b however to date the biogeochemical processes governing sr interactions with the organic portion of environmental matrices have not been characterized in detail when studying which organic fractions sr bounds to for a variety of organic soils fedorkova et al 2012 found that 25 35 of the sr was adsorbed to fulvic acids juo and barber 1970 studied the adsorption of sr and speciation of remaining aqueous sr for an organic sediment with 49 organic matter they found that at ph above 10 a significant portion of the sr in solution could be present as sr chelates or complexes whereas at lower ph around 5 the soluble sr was in its free cationic form juo and barber 1970 besides organic sediments a few organic vegetal substrates such as fungus khani et al 2012 and seeds chakraborty et al 2007 have also been studied for their potential to adsorb sr all of these substrates exhibited high adsorption capacities especially at higher ph while research conducted to date has clearly outlined the importance and high potential of organic matter in sr adsorption chen 1997 khani et al 2012 seeprasert et al 2016 the effect of organic matter origin and composition on sr adsorption has been poorly characterized in addition very limited research has quantified the potential of adsorbed sr to be mobilized back into the water column via desorption a key process in investigating sr environmental fate gao et al 2003 munthali et al 2015 oecd 2000 one of sr s isotopes radioactive strontium 90 90sr is a widely distributed radiological contaminant with a half life of 28 8 years that is present at multiple nuclear sites around the world bugai et al 2012 corcho alvarado et al 2016 dewiere et al 2004 johnson and dortch 2014 um et al 2013 this anthropogenic radionuclide is produced by nuclear fuel irradiation and is present in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste shevchuk et al 2010 in addition to globally distributed deposition resulting from bomb testing and nuclear accidents dezerald et al 2015 there are many point source emissions of 90sr coming from reactor or fuel cycle facility effluents nuclear waste management areas and accident sites guillen et al 2010 even though this pollution has motivated multiple studies on sr environmental fate munthali et al 2015 qi et al 2014 smičiklas et al 2015a few have evaluated potential methods to remediate 90sr pollution at many of these sites the radionuclides leach into groundwater and later resurface into wetlands kaplan et al 2014 due to its short half life relative to that of other radioisotopes a potential remediation method for 90sr pollution involves its confinement in a controlled system until its decay to the stable zirconium 90 isotope wetlands encompass a wide range of physical chemical and biological conditions while this rich complexity has proven efficient in eliminating a number of pollutants kadlec and wallace 2009 sr behavior in such environments is still poorly understood both field and modeling studies showed that sr removal in natural wetlands exists but is typically weak kröpfelová et al 2009 lidman et al 2014 šíma et al 2016 however no wetlands have been specifically designed to contain sr pollution by identifying the key components of organic matter that strongly retain sr better designs and wetland management practices can be developed in a way to support the production of such organic compounds and limit the long term release of radioactive contamination from groundwater discharge bugai et al 2012 the first objective of this study was to evaluate the adsorption and desorption potential of sr on two wetland sediments four wetland organic substrates and two exogenous media sediment mixes the second objective was to identify relationships between sr adsorption and desorption and the organic substrates properties these included ph cation exchange capacity cec organic matter content elemental composition and the relative proportion of organic matter functional groups finally the last objective of this work was to discuss the environmental implications of these results for the remediation of sr pollution in wetlands and the design of engineered wetlands for sr retention 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates eight different substrates were tested in batch sr adsorption and desorption experiments two wetland sediments four wetland organic substrates and two exogenous media sediment mixes besides the two exogenous media and the wood the other five natural substrates consisted of well mixed composite samples of several samples obtained from uncontaminated wetland areas at the chalk river canadian nuclear laboratories cnl site ontario canada the two sediments were collected from the top 10 cm in a 10 m2 plot in a treed swamp once in february 2016 and once in may 2016 referred to as the winter wetland sediments and the summer wetland sediments respectively the two seasons were selected to evaluate if potential changes in the sediment organic matter composition due to seasonal changes in redox biological and microbial conditions affected sr adsorption and desorption potential the treed swamp was flooded seasonally in the winter the treed swamp was continuously saturated and was covered by approximately 30 cm of snow resulting in sustained anaerobic conditions whereas in the summer the treed swamp had variable saturation conditions and the presence of new plant shoots resulting in more oxygenated sediments the four wetland organic substrates consisted of leaf litter populus and betula papyrifera moss sphagnum wood pinus strobus and cattails typha latifolia the latter included live and dead standing shoots roots and seeds they were all collected in may 2016 the leaf litter and moss were both sampled from a 50 m2 area in the treed swamp while the cattails were collected from a 30 m2 area in a marsh the marsh was flooded seasonally and densely vegetated with cattails the wood was 100 kiln dried pine wood chips and obtained from rolf c hagen incorporated mississauga on canada to investigate if sr retention increased by incorporating amendments with known high adsorption capacity in the wetland sediments clinoptilolite na2 k2 ca 3 si30 al6 o72 20h2o and bone charcoal were mixed into the summer wetland sediment at a proportion of 2 and 10 by weight respectively the clinoptilolite was procured from cnl and the bone charcoal was purchased from highwater filters colville wa united states before use the cattails collected in the field were anaerobically decayed in the lab to mimic dead vegetation accumulating in the water column of many wetlands the sediments leaf litter cattails and moss were first air dried then freeze dried international standard organisation iso 2005 ground using a high speed rotating cutting mill and sieved to 2 mm oecd 2000 the wood was also ground and sieved to 2 mm before their use all substrates were stored in hermetic containers at 4 c for less than 3 months the initial characterization of the substrates is summarized in table 1 and supplementary material sm sm s 2 2 2 adsorption desorption isotherm experiments triplicate adsorption and desorption isotherm experiments were conducted following the batch method outlined in oecd 106 oecd 2000 with solid liquid ratios ranging from 0 01 to 0 09 g ml the smaller ratios for the wetland organic substrates were chosen to ensure uniform mixing due to the wide range of carbon contents in the substrates studied table 1 the solid liquid ratios were chosen so that the ratios of organic content to liquid volumes were similar ranging from 0 01 to 0 03 g ml sm table s 1 between 0 5 and 2 4 g dry weight of substrates was weighed into 50 ml polycarbonate centrifuge tubes and either 22 5 or 42 5 ml of 0 5 mm cacl2 was added depending on the target solid liquid ratio sm s 3 the tubes were mixed using a carousel shaker at 30 rpm for 12 h for pre equilibration as recommended in the oecd method each tube was then spiked with 2 ml of stable sr solution to obtain initial stable sr concentrations of 0 5 10 30 100 and 500 μg l giving triplicate samples for each of the five concentration levels the tubes were also spiked with 0 5 ml of radioactive 85sr solution to reach an initial activity in each tube close to 7000 bq sm s 4 as determined during initial kinetics experiments the tubes were shaken for 24 h to reach adsorption equilibrium the tubes were then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 40 min the supernatant collected filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter and analyzed by gamma spectroscopy sm s 5 immediately after the adsorption study the desorption study was performed on the samples that had an initial sr concentration of 500 μg l for that sr free 0 5 mm cacl2 was added to each tube containing the substrates pellets in amounts corresponding to the initial volume of cacl2 solution the tubes were then mixed for 24 h to reach desorption equilibrium the equilibrium was determined through a kinetics study according to the oecd 106 protocol results not shown oecd 2000 the samples were centrifuged and the supernatants collected and analyzed to determine the amount of 85sr desorbed the desorption experiments were done a total of three times for six of the substrates and twice for the wood and the bone charcoal mixed with summer wetland sediment sm s 6 strontium adsorption and desorption on each substrate were modeled using linear and freundlich isotherms described in equations 1 and 2 respectively oecd 2000 1 m a d s k d c e where mads is the adsorption density mg kg ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l and kd is the linear adsorption coefficient l kg 2 m a d s k f a d s c e n f a d s where kf ads is the freundlich adsorption coefficient mg 1 nf ads l nf ads kg 1 and nf ads is the unitless regression constant the linear kd and freundlich kf ads adsorption coefficients were normalized to the fraction of organic carbon foc measured in each substrate leading to koc and kfoc adsorption coefficients respectively isotherms were considered linear when the curvatures of the freundlich isotherms nf ads were between 0 95 and 1 05 calvet et al 2005 the desorption isotherms are best described by their difference with the adsorption isotherms defined as hysteresis oecd 2000 this difference can be explained by irreversible retention or slow molecular diffusion of the adsorbed analyte out of the micro and nano porous spaces calvet et al 2005 gao et al 2003 the hysteresis can be quantified by the hysteresis coefficient h which is calculated according to equation 3 oecd 2000 3 h n f d e s n f a d s 100 where nf des is the unitless regression constant for the desorption freundlich isotherm all adsorption and desorption isotherm parameters were obtained following oecd 106 guideline on data analysis oecd 2000 2 3 size fractionation to assess the formation of mobile sr complexes the supernatants from the adsorption equilibrium experiments were filtered through three diminishing pore sizes pokrovsky et al 2005 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm both using cellulose acetate filters and 10 kda 1 15 nm using a microfiltration unit pokrovsky et al 2005 in this study these sr fractions are further referred to as large colloids 0 22 μm 0 45 μm small colloids 10 kda 0 22 μm and complexes and cationic 10 kda samples were analyzed by gamma spectroscopy 2 4 nmr spectroscopy due to low decomposition rates and in some cases high biological productivity many wetland soils have high organic content which ranged from 46 to 92 in the substrates studied to evaluate the effect of the substrates organic matter properties on sr adsorption solid state direct polarization magic angle spinning dp mas 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analysis was performed full details are provided in sm s 7 to quantify both the organic matter functional groups and its components two techniques were employed the first simply sectioned the nmr spectra into seven well accepted regions consistent with major functional groups nelson and baldock 2005 the second used interactive weighting of model biopolymers to assess their contribution to the entire spectral profile of the environmental mixtures masoom et al 2016 the spectra were modeled using five components expected in natural organic matter carbohydrates proteins lignins and crystalline and amorphous aliphatic carbons ahmad et al 2006 masoom et al 2016 nelson and baldock 2005 this approach is further described in sm s 7 the first technique can quantify the proportion of carbon in different carbon functional groups e g carboxyl aliphatic amide and methoxy knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 and the second one can identify and quantify the different organic matter components first all nmr spectra were integrated over 7 chemical shift ranges ppm a 210 165 b 165 145 c 145 110 d 110 95 e 95 60 f 60 45 and g 45 10 each integration range can be assigned to specific carbons the a integration range is assigned to carboxyl carbonyl and amide regions knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the b and c ranges are assigned to the aromatics with b corresponding to aromatics bond to nitrogen and oxygen such as phenols and c associated with carbon hydrogen bonds knicker and lüdemann 1995 the d range is assigned to the anomeric carbons found in carbohydrates knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the e range represents the carbohydrates and some amino acid groups knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the f range is assigned to the carbon in methoxyl groups of polysaccharides and amino acids knicker and lüdemann 1995 from the lignin masoom et al 2016 and the g range represents the carbon in methylene groups from aliphatic carbons or from the amino acids in proteins knicker and lüdemann 1995 masoom et al 2016 the second technique was used to calculate the proportion of the five different soil components listed above by fitting the substrate spectrums to a 5 component model this method aligns with the new paradigm that soil organic matter is a complex mixture that has strong well defined biopolymer signatures kelleher and simpson 2006 nelson and baldock 2005 vepraskas and craft 2015 the model iteratively scaled the spectra of the five components until their sum best matched the overall spectra profile of the mixture being fitted the percentage of the area occupied by each standard in the combined spectrum corresponds to the percentage of that component in the organic matter weighted contributions are provided in sm figs s4 s6 standards were selected to represent the range of components expected in similar organic sediment and vegetal substrates based on former studies masoom et al 2016 nelson and baldock 2005 sm s 8 2 5 statistical analysis principal component analysis pca was completed to display data groupings and correlations for the adsorption koc coefficients and desorption hysteresis h coefficients for the six natural substrates this resulted in 5 degrees of freedom therefore the five most influential physical and chemical descriptors for each of the adsorption and desorption datasets identified through the pearson s product moment sm s 9 were used in pca all analyses were done in r team 2015 3 results 3 1 adsorption isotherms for all substrates the adsorption isotherms fig 1 were well described by the linear model with r2 values above 0 97 and freundlich nf ads coefficients ranging from 0 96 to 1 05 table 2 the koc adsorption coefficients ranged from 384 to 5960 l kg the winter and summer wetland sediments displayed large adsorption with koc values of 2020 30 and 4270 310 l kg respectively despite sr is known to be a mobile element in the environment bugai et al 2012 dewiere et al 2004 these koc values are within the range of or higher than adsorption coefficients reported in the literature sm s 10 and table s 3 the addition of 2 w w clinoptilolite to summer wetland sediment resulted in a 220 increase in the koc value of the sediment alone to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report bone charcoal s very high potential for sr adsorption with a koc of 280 000 360 l kg sm s 11 however 10 w w bone charcoal resulted in only a 13 increase in the adsorption of the native wetland sediments 3 2 desorption isotherms the freundlich desorption models were not as robust as the linear adsorption models with r2 values ranging from 0 68 for the summer wetland sediment to 0 99 for the moss and clinoptilolite overall the results showed that all substrates and exogenous media sediment mixes had low desorption table 2 and fig 2 the hysteresis coefficients were below 6 for all substrates except for the decayed cattails at 14 7 and for the sediment mixes with bone charcoal at 30 3 and clinoptilolite at 17 1 3 3 size fractionation study for all substrates less than 20 of the sr was bound to large colloids sm s 12 the substrates with the largest sr amounts bound to this size fraction were those with the highest adsorption capacities moss and the summer and winter wetland sediments with 10 18 and 11 respectively all other organic substrates had less than 5 of the sr bound to large colloids sm table s 4 for the sr partitioned in the small colloids fraction the duplicate measurements did not allow for calculating a standard deviation therefore the combined uncertainty was computed due to the low radioactivity of the samples in the small colloid fraction the combined uncertainty was large as a result only two significant measurements can be reported for the decayed cattails and for the leaf litter which had at least 32 and 5 of the sr in the small colloid fraction respectively the portions of sr in all other substrates were below the calculated combined uncertainty 3 4 nmr the nmr chemical shift range results in fig 2a showed that the largest proportions of carbons in the proteins were in ranges a and g for a total of 65 whereas it was in ranges e and d for carbohydrates total of 84 ranges b and f for lignins total of 47 and in range g for the aliphatic carbons total of 73 for the natural substrates tested the sediments had the largest fraction of carbon in ranges a and g indicating that they had the largest proportion of proteins and aliphatic carbons at 47 and 48 for the winter and summer wetland sediments respectively in the sediments of natural wetlands the processes of organic matter decomposition and microbial growth increase the protein content knicker and lüdemann 1995 simpson et al 2007 when comparing the four wetland organic substrates the moss had the largest proportion of carbon in range a at 13 and a large carbon proportion in range g at 28 with the high nitrogen content of the moss the most likely attributions for range g are the amino acids in proteins like the moss the leaf litter had a large proportion of its carbon in range g at 20 however unlike the sediments and peat the lower nitrogen content of the leaf litter and the high content of the epicuticular wax in leaves indicate that the carbons could be in long aliphatic chains nguyen tu et al 2001 all the wetland organic substrates had a large fraction of the carbon in range e between 29 and 50 because these substrates have not gone through the humification process to a large extent there are many remaining carbohydrates in these substrates the wood had the largest fraction of carbon in range f which relates to the high lignin content of wood material suhas et al 2007 no paramagnetic influence was seen in the sediment sm figure s 6 therefore the spectra of the sediments that were not treated with hydrofluoric acid were used for analysis the five component model fig 3 confirmed these findings the sediment was the substrate highest in proteins with 14 and 17 of the carbons as proteins for the summer and winter wetland sediments respectively similarly the moss with 7 of the carbons as proteins was the wetland organic substrate highest in proteins wood had the largest proportion of lignin 23 while the leaf litter was the highest for both amorphous and crystalline aliphatic carbons 25 and 23 respectively an example acquired and modeled spectra for both sediments are shown in fig 4 all other spectra can be seen in sm s 13 3 5 principal component analysis pca the two principal components pcs explained 89 7 of the variance in the adsorption data set fig 5 a the koc percent lignin and cec parameters were only described by pc1 while tn and nmr range b 165 145 ppm were described by both pc1 and pc2 there was a strong positive correlation between the koc and the cec parameters and a smaller positive correlation between koc and tn the adsorption coefficients were negatively or not correlated with the percent lignin there was also a weaker negative or no correlation between the koc values and the 165 145 ppm integration range b for the desorption data the two principal components explained 84 6 of the variance fig 5b desorption was described by both pc1 and pc2 the hysteresis coefficients were positively correlated with the 110 95 ppm integration range d while it was negatively or not correlated to the 145 110 and 45 10 ppm integration ranges c and g respectively and the total nitrogen to organic carbon ratio 4 discussion 4 1 exogenous media sediment mixes the adsorption of sr onto clinoptilolite was tested by smičiklas et al 2007 who found a maximum adsorption density of 9 mg g bone charcoal has not yet been tested for sr but was found to adsorb divalent cations such as ca2 in the lattice of apatites cheung et al 2000 since these were cationic exchange adsorption processes they were both found to be highly ph dependent moreno et al 2010 smičiklas et al 2007 the addition of 2 clinoptilolite to the summer wetland sediments increased the adsorption of the sediment by a factor of three but the addition of a larger proportion of bone charcoal 10 had no significant effect clinoptilolite is known to have high selectivity for sr smičiklas et al 2007 and the various compounds present in the sediment did not appear to compete for ion exchange sites in the zeolite in contrast bone charcoal is not selective and has been shown to adsorb a range of different metals cheung et al 2000 moreno et al 2010 it is possible that the ion exchange sites in the bone charcoal bound to hydronium minerals or organic ligands present in the sediment that outcompeted sr for adsorption explaining the surprising low enhancement in sr adsorption both exogenous media sediment mixes had more reversible adsorption than the wetland organic substrates the ion exchange adsorption sites must therefore lead to more reversible sr adsorption or have less diffusion in micro or nano porous spaces compared to the other natural substrates studied calvet et al 2005 gao et al 2003 4 2 interactions between strontium and organic matter functional groups sample drying and sieving might have affected sr adsorption see sm s 14 however these effects were not expected to be significant compared to those of other factors such as ph cec and organic matter functional groups as described in detail below 4 2 1 role of substrate ph and cec both in inorganic and organic sediments sr competes with other cations for adsorption sites wallace et al 2012 in this study both hydronium at 10 5 m and calcium at 10 4 m could have competed with sr whose initial concentrations ranged from 10 9 to 10 6 m as a result sr adsorption increases with increasing ph khani et al 2012 wallace et al 2012 since the experiments were run at natural ph and all wetland substrate ph values were below 5 1 moderate sr adsorption was expected however all substrates exhibited high to very high and mostly poorly reversible sr adsorption the wetland organic substrates evaluated were able to compensate for hydronium competition this can be explained by the high cec of these substrates at their natural low ph which is known to have a positive correlation with sr adsorption yamaguchi et al 2007 as the ph decreases more of the cation exchange sites are bound to hydroniums thus decreasing the cec helling et al 1964 in inorganic fractions cec increases with clay content helling et al 1964 whereas in organic fractions the cec comes from specific carbon functional groups broadbent and bradford 1952 4 2 2 proteins the four organic substrates had no clay content as they were mainly made of vegetal material and had total organic contents that ranged from 81 to 96 therefore their cec was due to the various carbon functional groups that they were composed of broadbent and bradford 1952 found that carboxylic phenolic and enolic groups were responsible for cec in organic matter additionally multisurface binding models for metal ions onto organic matter use both carboxylic and phenolic groups as their two surface types tipping 1998 the carboxylic carbons are related to polyuronides and aliphatic acids the phenolic groups are related to the lignin aromatics amino acids and tannins and the enolic groups are related to nucleic acids broadbent and bradford 1952 all three groups are associated with proteins present in organic matter broadbent and bradford 1952 since moss was the organic wetland substrate with the largest protein content as indicated by both the nitrogen content and the nmr model results even though it had the lowest ph at 4 3 it had the largest adsorption accordingly pca revealed that a positive correlation was found between cec and nitrogen the latter being an indicator of proteins in the substrate knicker and lüdemann 1995 fig 5a both wetland sediments also had large sr adsorption capacities and were associated with large cec values in this case the high cec was attributed to natural clays organic molecules and the large fraction of carbon found in proteins helling et al 1964 juo and barber 1970 the 5 component model showed that both sediments had more proteins than the other natural substrates by a factor of two or more it is likely that the various ligands available in protein groups would complex sr thus providing the binding sites necessary for the observed high adsorption a large proportion of proteins in organic sediments has been found to originate from the microbial decay of organic matter that results in proteins with characteristic amide peaks simpson et al 2007 these amide groups cause a higher intensity in the carboxyl resonance range in c 13 nmr spectra knicker and lüdemann 1995 this was indeed observed for both the winter and summer wetland sediments which exhibited high resonance in range a 12 1 and 17 9 respectively compared to the other substrates sm table s 5 the resonance of the carbonyl region can also explain the difference between the adsorption coefficients of the winter and summer wetland sediments with a larger intensity in range a a larger total nitrogen concentration and larger cec the summer wetland sediment had more proteins than the winter wetland sediment which resulted in larger sr adsorption potential this is likely due to the larger microbial population in the summer when the temperature is higher and the wetland sediment is more oxidized due to removal of snow cover intermittent flooding and plant root aeration mitsch and gosselink 1993 the protein group also appeared to be related to sr desorption from organic substrates the desorption hysteresis coefficients had a negative or no correlation with the tn tc ratio and resonating range g of the nmr spectra two factors indicative of proteins as a consequence not only were the proteins able to increase sr adsorption but they limited sr desorption 4 2 3 carbohydrates and aromatics the complexes that are forming in the sediments could be sr organic acid complexes forsberg et al 2001 helal et al 1998 juo and barber 1970 the potential for these complexes to form in wetland organic matter were identified by the low proportion of organic carbon found as carbohydrates at approximately 40 in combination with a high proportion found in proteins at around 15 aromatic carbons and hysteresis coefficients were found to be negatively or not correlated even though the adsorption of an ionic compound with aromatic carbons is not expected ahmad et al 2001 the presence of aromatic carbons could therefore be an indicator of mixtures of organic molecules that can decrease sr desorption as explained above the carbohydrates being the easiest to decompose knicker and lüdemann 1995 large proportions of carbon in carbohydrates such as the moss decayed cattails and wood can indicate that there has been less decay in the organic matter and a mixture of organic molecules is not present 4 2 4 lignin lignin was the organic molecule found to have a negative or no correlation with sr adsorption coefficients the high content of lignin in sediments is explained by the molecule being only mineralized by white rot fungus thevenot et al 2010 it is possible that lignin did not have a negative effect on adsorption but did not provide any adsorption sites either as a result substrates with higher lignin and no protein would have lower sr adsorption capacities suhas et al 2007 found that lignin can adsorb cations through ion exchange but only at high ph when hydronium competition is low the wetland substrates tested in this study all had natural ph values lower than 5 1 which is within the 3 5 7 ph range of natural wetlands mitsch and gosselink 1993 but lower than the typical circumneutral ph of treatment wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 4 2 5 colloidal transport of sr the type of carbons in the substrate was not the only factor affecting sr desorption although the c 13 spectrum of the decayed cattails was similar to the spectrum of wood the decayed cattails hysteresis coefficient was almost 3 times larger than that of the wood the cattails were the only substrate that was anaerobically decayed a process that could have resulted in sr mobilization in the form of mobile sr laden colloids in environmental samples most aqueous sr is typically in its ionic form or in complexes whose size fraction is smaller than 10 kda dahlqvist et al 2004 lidman et al 2014 salbu et al 1992 however a previous field study carried out by salbu et al 1992 found that a higher 90sr activity was associated with a larger sr proportion up to 40 present in fractions larger than 10 kda it is possible that the decayed cattails that exhibited the highest but still moderate sr desorption also had enhanced transport due to the large portion greater than 32 associated with the small colloid phase 4 3 environmental implications engineered and natural wetland management practices there could be two opposite goals with respect to environmental sr pollution first some contaminated natural wetlands require remediation to reduce the risk of exposure to 90sr in this case increasing 90sr desorption from contaminated natural wetlands can be an effective remediation method alternatively given the high content and diversity in organic components in wetland environments efficiently delaying 90sr transport towards downstream surface ecosystems by supporting adsorption processes in engineered wetlands can be an effective means to manage radioactive pollution kadlec and wallace 2009 kaplan et al 2014 the differences in the amount of sr adsorption and desorption for the natural and exogenous media tested in this study bring new insight on how to best manage natural and engineered wetlands to remediate contaminated wetlands and increase sr release the results of this study suggest that both sediment and organic matter should be minimized in wetlands as they were shown to be strong sr adsorbents on the other hand if sr retention is desired management practices for engineered wetlands should aim to increase the contact of the contaminated water with the sediment and increase the sediment depth the contact with sediment is best increased by using shallow surface flow wetlands and by increasing the hydraulic retention time kadlec and wallace 2009 all organic matter inputs such as plant material should be left in the wetland to support sr retention although the organic materials initially have a moderate adsorption potential due to their low protein content they can still contribute to retaining sr plant decay also enriches wetland sediments in organic molecules and dense vegetation decreases flow velocity thus increasing the sedimentation rate hosokawa and horie 1992 the sedimentation rate could also be increased by permanent flooding of the wetland cheng 1984 olk and cassman 1996 permanent flooding can decrease both the kinetic energy of the water in the outflow and the decomposition rate due to the resulting anoxic conditions du laing et al 2008 flooding was also proven to increase sediment nitrogen content suggesting protein accumulation olk and cassman 1996 in a full scale wetland the role of inorganic phases in controlling sr retention cannot be ruled out however even though sr can be incorporated into newly produced minerals these tend to form at higher ph and sr concentrations than typically observed in the field ford and wilkin 2010 it is therefore unlikely that inclusion into mineral phases would play a key role in removing aqueous sr in wetlands strontium can also adsorb onto iron fe and manganese mn oxyhydroxides forsberg et al 2001 which might have contributed to the high sr adsorption coefficients measured in this study in the field the reducing conditions present in wetlands would lead in the dissolution of fe and mn oxides thus releasing sr into the water column although maintaining dense vegetation and supporting permanent flooding is expected to help increase sr adsorption in wetlands the consequences of employing such practices e g changes in redox conditions must be evaluated in pilot or full scale studies before conclusive wetland management strategies can be proposed 5 conclusions wetland sediments showed strong and poorly reversible sr adsorption sediment management is therefore essential to either remediate sr contaminated wetlands or retain sr in engineered treatment wetlands of all the natural substrates studied moss had the strongest sr adsorption it is therefore an efficient natural substrate for long term sr retention in wetlands clinoptilolite and bone charcoal showed significant sr desorption therefore their addition into wetland sediments is not recommended increased sr association with colloids between 0 22 μm and 10 kda was observed for the decayed cattails the cattails were also the only natural substrate exhibiting some desorption which could be attributed to sr complexes with the aqueous colloids resulting from the decayed cattails the proteins identified through the nmr spectra integration the 5 component model and the substrates nitrogen content were found to cause stronger adsorption of sr in organic substrates less reversible sr adsorption was observed in organic substrates whose carbon content was lower in carbohydrates and higher aromatics funding this work was supported by the natural sciences

19719,start up of biofilm process initiated by the deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers is a very important yet time consuming procedure however rapid start up methods especially in the enhancement of soluble matters deposition have been rarely addressed in this study a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d was applied to investigate the influences of calcium ion and rhamnolipid rl on the deposition of soluble matters from real and synthetic industrial wastewaters with different configurations of organics bovine serum albumin and sodium alginate and ionic strength on the model biocarriers polystyrene and polyamide results showed that deposition was effectively promoted by the addition of ca2 and along with the increase in ca2 content however rl enhanced the deposition effectively only in hyperhaline wastewater through breaking hydration repulsion and decreased the deposition in low salinity wastewater and its influence to the deposited layer property exhibited characteristics of negative feedback the combined use of ca2 and rl had a better enhancement effect than that of separate use and the mechanism involved can not be soundly explained only by derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory the strategy of mediating the deposition of soluble matters on different biocarriers by adding ca2 and rl has important implications for regulating biofilm formation to accelerate the start up process in attached growth bioreactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords calcium ion rhamnolipid biofilm formation qcm d 1 introduction since the term of biofilm was first reported by zobell in 1943 topics about biofilm have attracted more and more attention in many fields especially in food production biopharmaceutics and environmental science simoes et al 2010 biofilm process also known as attached growth process is regarded as a promising biotechnology for water pollution control due to its high efficiency low secondary pollution risk and operational cost yang et al 2015 however its start up procedure is time consuming e g the start up even takes several weeks in drinking water treatment which constrains the application and development of biofilm process in some extent seredynska sobecka et al 2006 yang et al 2014 biofilm formation on biocarriers is the base of a successful start up and it generally consists of several dynamic processes including preconditioning of the biocarrier surface planktonic cells adhesion microorganism growth substrate metabolism secretion of extracellular polymeric substance eps and finally the maturing of biofilm bryers and ratner 2004 the whole dynamic process is influenced by properties of the biocarrier e g texture and wettability characteristics of interfacial fluid e g flow velocity and fluid properties and cell properties e g the hydrophilicity of cell simoes et al 2010 felföldi et al 2015 the transition of bacteria from bulk liquid to surfaces is essential to the initiation of biofilm formation some bacteria will not form biofilms on surfaces unless supplemented with medium or substrate containing nutritional content that allow growth o toole et al 2000 davey and o toole 2000 the soluble matters in wastewater usually are inorganic salts and organic substances most of which are vital nutrients for the growth of microorganism huang et al 2010 xie et al 2016 moreover various soluble matters especially organic substance e g proteins carbohydrates lipids and saccharides accumulate on the surfaces of biocarriers and potentially provide numerous functional groups and adsorption sites for binding between surfaces and bacteria or extracellular polymeric substances eps associated with bacteria lackner et al 2009 ribeiro et al 2017 such deposited layer e g a layer of protein provides a conditioning layer for microbial colonization and subsequent biofilm formation banerjee et al 2011 therefore enhancing the deposition of soluble matters in wastewater is crucial for rapid biofilm formation and has significant engineering merit as for the influence of ions on biofilm formation researchers held the opinion that calcium ions have no direct impact on the adhesion and development of biofilm for a time stanley 1983 vanhoogmoed et al 1997 dunne and burd 1992 with more and more investigations conducted many studies have reported the remarkable role of divalent cations especially ca2 on the initial adhesion of marine microorganisms chiovitti et al 2008 relevant reports showed that ca2 affects biofilm formation from various aspects physicochemical interactions such as compression of the electrical double layer sheng et al 2010 mitigation of electrostatic repulsion geesey et al 2000 marciňáková et al 2010 and reduction in electron donicity chiovitti et al 2008 strongly influence the depositing behavior of soluble matters in wastewater in terms of the biological aspect ca2 increases the eps production e g polysaccharide as well as biofilm thickness during biofilm formation which facilitates biofilm adhesion on surfaces mangwani et al 2014 sarkisova et al 2005 in addition ca2 can bind edna of several species of bacteria and enhance the aggregation of microorganisms and development of biofilm das et al 2014 the structural integrity cell growth and cell to cell adhesion will also be enhanced by ca2 through electrostatic interaction cavaliere et al 2014 recently he et al 2016 found that ca2 played an important role in protein expression and enhanced the adhesion of chlorella however impact of ca2 on the deposition of wastewater soluble matters on biocarriers remains further explored rhamnolipid rl is a type of biosurfactant produced by pseudomonas species kim et al 2015 having advantages of a low toxicity a high biodegradability and stability at a wide range of temperatures ph and salinity abdel mawgoud et al 2011 although there are lots of reports focusing on the impact of rl on biofilm formation the conclusions are somehow contradictive and confusing on one hand researchers thought rl was detrimental to the formation of biofilm for example the pre conditioning of surfaces using 0 25 and 1 0 w v rl disrupted the formation and reduced the adhesion of biofilms of food borne pathogenic bacteria zezzi do valle gomes and nitschke 2012 and kim et al 2015 claimed that rl 240 mg l showed a great potential for reducing biofilm by decreasing the carbohydrate and protein of eps additionally rodrigues et al 2006 found that preconditioning of silicone rubber by high concentration 4000 mg l of rl inhibited the initial deposition of bacteria and yeasts on it while minor effect was observed by low concentration 4 mg l of rl on the other hand some researchers found rl enhanced and accelerated biofilm formation for instance pseudomonas aeruginosa secreted rl to maintain biofilm architecture by affecting cell cell interactions and the attachment of bacterial cells to surfaces davey et al 2003 nickzad and deziel 2014 rl can also facilitate the dissemination of cells in some cases schooling et al 2004 moreover yu et al 2014 observed a sharp decline in bacterial attachment and microcolony formation of lasb deficient mutant pseudomonas aeruginosa attributed by a decreased biosynthesis of rl apparently the impact of rl on biofilm formation is concentration related a possible explanation is that low concentration 100 mg l of rhamnolipids affects the cell surface properties through increasing cell hydrophobicity by causing a release of lipopolysaccharide from the cell surface thereby increasing the affinity for initial adherence of cells to a surface nickzad and deziel 2014 although many efforts have been devoted into exploring the impact of ca2 and rl to the middle and later periods of biofilm formation there has been so far no more further investigations focusing on the influence at the initial stage i e preconditioning of biofilm formation preconditioning of soluble pollutants on the model biocarriers polystyrene ps and polyamide pa influenced by 1 5 mm ca2 and in situ activity recovery of aging biofilm by 300 mg l of rl were explored in our previous study huang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 however a comprehensive evaluation including separate and combined use of ca2 and rl on the enhancement of soluble matters deposition still needs to be intensively investigated this study examined the role that ca2 and rl played in the deposition of soluble matters on model biocarriers ps and pa using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d to provide some beneficial enlightenments of utilizing ca2 and rl to regulate biofilm formation for accelerating the start up process in attached growth bioreactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sources and characterization real wastewater sourced from aerobic bioreactors in three typical wastewater treatment plants wwtps soluble constituents were obtained from the mixed liquor of wastewater after filtration through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane millipore usa within 2 h after sampling and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c until use the characteristics of real wastewater including ph value conductivity organic materials composed of total organic carbon toc protein pn polysaccharide ps and humic acid ha metal elements zeta potential molecular weight distribution and fluorescence spectral were systematically investigated according to the methods in our previous study huang et al 2015 synthetic wastewater samples were prepared according to compositions of real wastewater with different concentrations of ca2 and rl two constant pn ps ratios 2 and 0 2 by model macromolecules bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa and gradients of ionic strengths from 0 to 3000 mm in order to figure out the impact of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters in wastewater and its feasibility in further application in biofilm process comparatively biocompatible concentrations of ca2 1 mm 100 mm were selected besides 1000 mm ca2 was selected to simulate the extreme condition high salinity caused by high ca2 concentration meantime low concentrations 20 mg l 40 mg l and 80 mg l of rl were selected for their potential to enhance the deposition of soluble matters and compatibility in the future application for biofilm formation enhancement table 1 table 2 and table 3 showed the configurations of tested solutes in separate and combined use of ca2 and rl respectively 2 2 qcm d experiment and modeling deposition behaviors of real and synthetic wastewaters on ps and pa were both investigated in q sense e4 system biolin scientific ab sweden at 25 c water contact angles of ps and pa were 99 8 2 23 and 63 5 1 52 respectively huang et al 2015 and the pretreatment of crystals was referred to sweity et al 2011 a constant flow rate of 150 μl min 1 of fluid in the chamber was applied the flow schedule was as follows i background solution i e double distilled water ii tested solution of the wastewater sample and iii background solution variations of frequency f hz and dissipation factor d were monitored and ratios of dissipation factor versus frequency shifts δ d δ f values were recorded at five overtones n 3 5 7 9 and 11 the depositing amount was defined as the frequency shift δf between the 3rd overtone frequency at deposition equilibrium in stage ii and the reference frequency in stage i depending on the average δ d δ f values sauerbrey and voigt models were employed to model the deposited layer mass and thickness variations respectively the sauerbrey model is valid for nondissipative to weakly dissipative deposited layers with an average δ d δ f value smaller than 1 10 7 hz 1 liu and meenan 2008 wang et al 2013 1 δ m c δ f n n where δm ng cm 2 is the areal mass density of the deposited layer c 17 7 ng cm 2 hz 1 is the sensor specific mass sensitivity constant and δf n hz is the frequency shift of the nth overtone the voigt model in the qtool software q sense is applied when the average δ d δ f value is greater than 1 10 7 hz 1 the best fit shear modulus and thickness of the deposited layer were obtained by modeling δd and δf values at three overtones 3 5 and 7 the density and viscosity of the fluid and the density of the deposited layer were assigned at 1000 kg m 3 0 001 kg m 1 s 1 and 1030 kg m 3 respectively huang et al 2015 sweity et al 2011 ferrando et al 2017 2 3 statistical analysis results were expressed as mean standard deviation one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the statistical differences all the significance analyses were performed using pasw 18 0 software spss inc usa and a p value of 0 05 was accepted as indicating statistical significance deng et al 2016 pallant 2013 redundancy analysis rda was applied to figure out the relationship between ca2 or rl concentration and deposited layer characteristics using canoco for window 4 5 scientiapro hungary as revealed by detrended correspondence analysis dca analysis that the linear model was more suitable for the present study braak et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of real wastewater the properties of real wastewater were shown in table s1 in supplementary information ll hm and hh represented electronic factory wastewater with low organic concentration and low salinity landfill wastewater with high organic concentration and medium salinity and burning power plant wastewater with high organic concentration and high salinity respectively ph value showed that ll and hm were neutral while hh was alkalescent i e 8 61 0 01 the highest concentration of toc and ps in hh and those of pn and ha in hm were observed respectively and ll had the lowest concentration of all the four organic indicators mentioned above the main cations in the three wastewater samples were na k ca2 i e from 8 2 to 28 1 mg l and mg2 and all of their concentrations increased in the order of ll hm hh zeta potentials of the three wastewater samples were negative with absolute values 30 0 mv suggesting instability of the colloidal dispersion figs s1 and s2 in supplementary information showed the molecule weight distribution and eem fluorescence spectra of the real wastewater samples respectively in general the concentration of macromolecules increased in the order of ll hh hm which was consistent with the trend of toc ll displayed a strong fluorescence response of soluble microbial by product like substance and modest response of humic acid like substance whereas both hm and hh exhibited fluorescence characteristics of humic acid like substances 3 2 influence of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters the frequency and dissipation shift of real wastewater influenced by separate use of ca2 was shown as a representative example in fig s3 in supplementary information the depositing amount of frequency shift δf between the 3rd overtone frequency at deposition equilibrium and the reference frequency was used as a benchmark influence of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters was intensively displayed in fig 1 partial correlation was applied to explore the relationship between depositing amount δf and concentration of ca2 in real wastewater while controlling the salinity of the samples there was a strong and positive partial correlation between them r 0 75 p 0001 which indicated that in general with the concentration of ca2 increased more soluble matters deposited on the biocarrier surfaces however the depositing patterns differed from one another among each real wastewater samples and biocarriers proving that the solute configuration and biocarrier properties might partly determine the effect of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters in order to figure out this experiments in synthetic wastewaters with different pn ps ratio and ionic strength were conducted fig 1c and d minor depositing amount of bsa and sa in both synthetic wastewaters i e sww1 and sww2 was observed δf from 1 78 to 2 16 hz without ca2 addition the depositing amount of soluble matters in sww1 which possessed a higher pn ps ratio 2 1 increased at 1 mm ca2 then fell down as the concentration of ca2 increased to 100 mm and went up again at 1000 mm ca2 by contrast the depositing amount in sww2 whose pn ps ratio was 1 5 kept increasing as the concentration of ca2 increased fig 1c classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory can be used to explain the phenomenon presented in sww2 it s clear that addition of calcium chloride would enhance the ionic strength of the solution and lead to compression of the electric double layer as well as reduction of the net charge of protein and polysaccharide molecules as a result the electrostatic repulsion between soluble matters and the biocarriers was weakened resulting in an increase in the deposition of soluble matters miao et al 2015 2017 in addition a relatively higher concentration of sa in sww2 reacted with ca2 and formed insoluble calcium gels which also contributed to the increase of depositing amount xin et al 2015 yin et al 2015 sriamornsak and kennedy 2006 however dlvo theory cannot soundly explain the phenomenon exhibited in sww1 due to the decrease of the depositing amount at 1 100 mm ca2 it s reported that bsa is difficult to react with ca2 and it bind to ca2 mainly via electrostatic interactions yan et al 2017 when the concentration of ca2 increased to 1 mm the electrostatic repulsion alleviated because of the higher ionic strength this was consistent with dlvo theory as the concentration of ca2 continued increasing ca2 tended to retain some water of hydration which surrounded to negatively charged bsa and formed a hydration layer in the vicinity of bsa and biocarrier surface valle delgado et al 2011 the hydration layer prevented interaction of two surfaces from contacting by hydration repulsion force manciu and ruckenstein 2001 the hydration repulsion force became stronger as more and more hydrated ca2 generated which induced a reduction of the depositing amount though the electrostatic repulsion reduced simultaneously parsegian and zemb 2011 nevertheless when the concentration of ca2 exceeded a specific threshold bsa might convert to positively charged and lose the ability to retain hydrated cations as a result hydration repulsion was eliminated while the electrostatic repulsion force remained negligible at a high ionic strength miao et al 2015 thus the depositing amount rose again at 1000 mm ca2 the discussion above revealed that the solute configuration and ionic strength of wastewater impact calcium ion mediated deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers every sort of soluble matter has a unique interaction with ca2 consequently it will exhibit different regular patterns as concentration of ca2 increases the impact of ionic strength to the influence of ca2 was shown in fig 1d through keeping the constant concentration of ca2 at 1 mm and adjusting the ionic strength of sww1 by adding sodium chloride as for ps the highest depositing amount δf 37 25 hz was observed at 10 mm ionic strength when the ionic strength was lower than 10 mm more soluble matters deposited on ps surface as ionic strength increased in contrast deposition mitigated as ionic strength increased when ionic strength 10 mm namely low ionic strength was favorable for ca2 mediated deposition of soluble matters in wastewater while high ionic strength was detrimental to the deposition however with the ionic strength increased the depositing amount of soluble matters on pa surface decreased until the ionic strength reached 1000 mm such phenomenon can be explained by the theories mentioned above at first after adding 1 mm calcium chloride corresponding ionic strength of 3 mm the deposition on both ps and pa surfaces was enhanced because of compression of the electric double layer complexation and bridging action and then the electrostatic repulsion was mitigated on ps at ionic strength of 10 mm which led to the enhancement of deposition of bsa and sa by dlvo theory but when the ionic strength increased further the influence of hydration repulsion dominated over that of electrostatic repulsion thus deposition on ps was mitigated as ionic strength increased over 10 mm hydration repulsion became a leading factor at ionic strength lower than 100 mm on pa whereas it disappear at 1000 mm as the soluble matters converted to positively charged at high ionic strength fig 2 illustrated a simplified schematic diagram of ca2 and rl mediated deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers in which a b c and d represented deposition behaviors influenced by the separate use of ca2 given the above deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers can be effectively promoted by the addition of ca2 and the enhancement can be mediated not only by the solute configuration but also by the ionic strength of wastewater results of lab scale mbbrs experiment show adding ca2 promotes the increase of biomass on biocarriers the greatest biomass is obtained at 12 5 mg l of ca2 and 187 mg l of nacl while the highest cod removal rate is obtained at 6 88 mg l of ca2 and 187 mg l of nacl data not shown 3 3 influence of rl on the deposition of soluble matters the influence of low concentration of rl was investigated in both synthetic wastewater with different ionic strength and real wastewater samples fig s4 in supplementary information and fig 3 for synthetic wastewater the influence of rl concentration was exhibited individually without the impact of ionic strength fig 3a and simultaneously with the impact of ionic strength fig 3b respectively in general the depositing amount increased as the concentration of rl increased as shown by fig 3a this trend kept similar in different ionic strength wastewaters as shown by fig 3b indicating that moderately increase the amount of rl in wastewater may be beneficial to the deposition of soluble matters in addition the depositing amount declined slightly when the ionic strength increased from 0 mm to 1 mm while increased when ionic strength increased from 1 mm to 100 mm such observations illustrated that rl was more inclined to promote the deposition of soluble matters at a higher ionic strength rather than a lower one in order to verifythe assumption impact of rl in real wastewater was investigated fig 3c and d in ll and hm which represented low salinity and medium salinity wastewater respectively comparatively low concentration 40 mg l of rl mitigated the deposition of soluble matters however in high salinity wastewater i e hh rl always enhanced the deposition this was consistent with the result of rda fig s5 in supplementary information from rda analysis smaller the angel between two arrowheads is closer the correlation between the two variables will be braak et al 2002 apparently rl concentration shown as rl in fig s5 itself was poorly correlated to the depositing amount as well as the thickness of the layer but exhibited a positive correlation after correlated with salinity shown as rl correlated with salinity in fig s5 this indicated that a certain ionic strength is the prerequisite for rl to enhance the deposition of soluble matters such phenomenon is possibly attributed to the hydrate anti agglomeration property of rl york and firoozabadi 2008 in low or medium salinity wastewater hydration repulsion was too negligible to affect the deposition of soluble matters rl as a surfactant brought away some matters that already deposited on the biocarriers due to the solubilization effect with the flow of tested solution and led to decline of the deposition fig 2e and in high salinity wastewater hydrated calcium cations were supposed to aggregate around soluble matters and biocarriers surfaces which might cause strong hydration repulsion and mitigate the deposition however rl had the ability to break the aggregation of water molecules around hydrated cations therefore mitigate the hydration repulsion and eventually enhance the deposition of soluble matters fig 2f in a lab scale mbbrs experiment an increase of biomass 1 9 fold and 1 7 fold respectively at the startup procedure was observed in the treatment groups with 20 mg l and 50 mg l rl compared to the control group 0 mg l rl data not shown it reveals that low concentration 100 mm of rl has potential to enhance not only the soluble matter deposition but also the initial biofilm formation 3 4 influence of combined use of ca2 and rl on the deposition the combined effect of rl and ca2 was investigated by adding both rl and ca2 into ll hh and sww1 and compared with those of the separate use the experiment design and depositing amount of soluble matters in different treatment groups were shown in table 3 and fig 4 respectively in most of the cases adding both ca2 and rl resulted in more depositing amount than adding ca2 or rl separately except for group 1 6 and 12 especially at high ionic strength the cause may be due to the dominant anti hydration repulsion effect at high ionic strength under the combined use of rl and ca2 at low ionic strength on one hand comparatively low doses of rl mitigated the deposition of soluble matters as mentioned in the preceding section on the other hand hydration repulsion was not strong enough to inhibit the enhancement of the soluble matters deposition by ca2 at low ionic strength thus group 1 6 and 12 in which only 1 mm calcium chloride was added exhibited lower depositing amount though with addition of both ca2 and rl compared to that of the separate use of ca2 apparently the deposition of soluble matters in combined use of rl and ca2 treatment groups i e group 2 5 and 8 was enhanced substantially e g the depositing amount with the combined use was 13 fold of that with rl only and 5 fold of that with ca2 only in group 8 this is consistent with the result that a higher ionic strength due to comparatively higher concentration of ca2 100 mm is in favor of the enhancement of soluble matters deposition by rl according to chen chen et al 2013 the binding between rl and ca2 is weak due to the weakly ionic nature of rl it means ca2 has little effect upon the adsorption of rl this indicated that the increment of depositing amount was not caused by the interactions between ca2 and rl but due to the enhancement of soluble matters deposition caused by the specific interactions between soluble matters and ca2 as well as rl 3 5 properties of ca2 and rl mediated deposited layer fig 5 exhibited the properties of ca2 and rl mediated deposited layer in different configurations of tested groups in the present study normally a lower δ d δ f value means the deposited layer is compact and rigid while a higher δ d δ f value suggests a nonrigid and viscoelastic layer liu and meenan 2008 wang et al 2013 for synthetic wastewater the lowest δ d δ f value was obtained at 10 mm and 1 mm ca2 for sww1 and sww2 respectively fig 5a the δ d δ f value increased as the concentration of ca2 increased indicating a compact and rigid layer formed at lower concentration of ca2 while a non rigid layer with open structure formed at higher concentration of ca2 in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the influence of ca2 to the property of deposited layer structure the impact of ionic strength was investigated fig 5b after adding 1 mm calcium chloride and different amounts of sodium chloride to each wastewater samples no obvious discrepancy was observed until the ionic strength reached to 1000 mm significant increase of δ d δ f value at ionic strength of 1000 mm p 05 indicated that high ionic strength conduced a more nonrigid and viscoelastic layer fig 2c whereupon a rigid and compact layer was formed due to the presence of ca2 instead of associated ionic strength at low ca2 concentration 100 mm due to the suppression of electrostatic repulsion and bridging action among soluble matters induced by ca2 soluble matters aggregate closer and the structure of the deposited layer becomes more compact however when the hydration repulsion dominate over that of electrostatic repulsion and bridging action the deposited layer becomes looser and incompact such explanation was consistent with the result in real wastewater fig 5c the δ d δ f value first declined then rose as the concentration of ca2 increased and in general significant higher δ d δ f value p 05 was obtained in high salinity hh wastewater taking the value of 1 10 7 hz 1 of δ d δ f as a threshold sauerbrey and voigt models were applied to model depositing layer thickness respectively huang et al 2015 liu and meenan 2008 wang et al 2013 sauerbrey model was only suitable for two cases deposition of ll on ps and deposition of hm on pa at 10 mm ca2 meanwhile voigt model was fit for the rest the fitting results were given in fig 5d the highest thickness exhibited at 1000 mm ca2 under all situations attributing to the highest depositing amount similar to the variation of δ d δ f value thickness of the deposited layer declined first and then rose as ca2 concentration increased indicating that lower ca2 concentration was in favor of a thinner and denser deposited layer while higher ca2 concentration resulted in a thicker layer it s worth mentioning that the deposited layer tended to be thinner on pa compared to that of ps in wastewater samples with low ca2 concentration 100 mm implying that no matter rigid or not the layer was the formation of a thinner layer was preferred on pa at lower concentration of ca2 usually compact and rigid layer has a stronger ability to resist the deformation caused by external forces e g shear force than nonrigid and viscoelastic layer peterson et al 2015 giving a possible strategy involves mediating the viscoelastic property of deposited layer to resist external forces and maintain biofilm structure by adding ca2 and therefore indirectly enhances the biofilm formation in the start up process of attached growth bioreactors rda analysis showed that ca2 concentration shown as ca in fig s5 in supplementary information has strong and positive correlations with depositing amount represented by δf and deposited layer thickness represented by thickness verifying the relevant discussions i e ca2 enhances the deposition of soluble matters in the previous sections it s interesting that the shear modulus represented by shear in fig s5 calculated by voigt model was strongly and positively correlated to ca2 concentration indicating that though nonrigid and viscoelastic deposited layer would form at high ca2 concentration the layer possessed high shear modulus a possible explanation is the deposited soluble matters act as stakes and thus solidify surrounding liquid at high frequency vibration in qcm measurements the layer adjacent to the chip exhibited high shear modulus and was calculated by voigt model while the layer far from the chip exhibited high dissipation and was represented by δ d δ f value as for rl its impact on viscoelasticity of the deposited layer was exhibited in fig 5e addition of rl prompted a higher δ d δ f in ll and hm and a lower δ d δ f in hh it was mentioned above that higher ionic strength was in favor of nonrigid and viscoelastic layer corresponding to a higher δ d δ f so the δ d δ f value in hh was supposed to be higher than those of ll and hm but the presence of rl lowered the δ d δ f value in hh and reversely increased it in ll and hm it was somewhat like the negative feedback which meant rl would make a rigid layer less rigid and a nonrigid layer more rigid concerning the corresponding δ d δ f value in addition rl concentration was negatively correlated to deposited layer shear modulus fig s5 which may be attributed to the surfactant nature of rl applying voigt model to calculate the layer thickness was suitable for all the cases except for the deposition layer in ll on pa with 20 mg l rl the fitting result was shown in fig 5f variance existed between the deposition on ps and pa the deposited layers in treating groups were thinner than those of the control on ps nevertheless they were thicker than those of the control on pa such result supported the negative feedback theory mentioned above in other words in the presence of rl a deposited layer supposed to be a comparatively thick one will become thinner and that supposed to be a thin layer will become thicker 3 6 influence of biocarrier properties on ca2 and rl mediated deposition it s interesting to note the difference between the deposition on pa and ps as shown in fig 1 the depositing amount on pa increased in the order ll hh hm at a lower concentration 10 mm of ca2 and in the order hh ll hm at a higher concentration 100 mm of ca2 as for ps the depositing amount increased in the order hh hm ll until the concentration of ca2 reached to 1000 mm it indicated that the key factors determining the depositing amount on pa and ps at low ca2 concentration were organic concentration and salinity respectively ps and pa coatings exhibited hydrophobic and hydrophilic natures respectively as revealed by their water contact angles water molecules tended to gather onto the hydrophilic surface and weakened the binding efficiency between hydrated cations and biocarrier surface miao et al 2017 then the hydration repulsion was mitigated and it can hardly affect the deposition on hydrophilic surface thus the deposition on pa at low ca2 concentration was mainly determined by organic concentration rather than ionic strength however hydration repulsion can still substantially affect the deposition at high ca2 concentration because of high ionic strength as for hydrophobic surface of ps hydration repulsion is the major force to determine the depositing amount at low ca2 concentration as discussed in the previous section and therefore makes the ionic strength the key factor that determines the deposition at low ca2 concentration while at high ca2 concentration hydration repulsion might disappear as the soluble matters converted to be positively charged in addition the depositing amount on ps kept higher than that of pa unless ionic strength reached to 1000 mm fig 1d indicating that hydrophobic surface was more favorable to ca2 and rl mediated deposition of soluble matters in wastewater guo et al 2015 also found that the hydrophobic surface was much more favorable to the cell immobilization and tightly bound eps deposition than hydrophilic surface both indicate biocarrier made by ps is more preferable for biofilm formation 4 conclusions the present study verified the role that ca2 and rhamnolipid played in the deposition of soluble matters on model biocarriers ps and pa results showed that the deposition was effectively promoted by the addition of ca2 and along with the increase in ca2 content a low concentration of ca2 induced a compact deposited layer while a viscoelastic layer was easily available at a high concentration of ca2 rhamnolipid tended to enhance the deposition in hyperhaline wastewater through breaking hydration repulsion and decrease the deposition in low salinity wastewater and its influence to the deposited layer property exhibited characteristics of negative feedback the combined use of ca2 and rhamnolipid had a better enhancement effect than that of separate use and the mechanism involved can not be soundly explained only by dlvo theory the strategy of mediating the deposition of soluble matters on different biocarriers by adding ca2 and rhamnolipid in the study has important implications for regulating biofilm formation to accelerate the start up process in

property exhibited characteristics of negative feedback the combined use of ca2 and rl had a better enhancement effect than that of separate use and the mechanism involved can not be soundly explained only by derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory the strategy of mediating the deposition of soluble matters on different biocarriers by adding ca2 and rl has important implications for regulating biofilm formation to accelerate the start up process in attached growth bioreactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords calcium ion rhamnolipid biofilm formation qcm d 1 introduction since the term of biofilm was first reported by zobell in 1943 topics about biofilm have attracted more and more attention in many fields especially in food production biopharmaceutics and environmental science simoes et al 2010 biofilm process also known as attached growth process is regarded as a promising biotechnology for water pollution control due to its high efficiency low secondary pollution risk and operational cost yang et al 2015 however its start up procedure is time consuming e g the start up even takes several weeks in drinking water treatment which constrains the application and development of biofilm process in some extent seredynska sobecka et al 2006 yang et al 2014 biofilm formation on biocarriers is the base of a successful start up and it generally consists of several dynamic processes including preconditioning of the biocarrier surface planktonic cells adhesion microorganism growth substrate metabolism secretion of extracellular polymeric substance eps and finally the maturing of biofilm bryers and ratner 2004 the whole dynamic process is influenced by properties of the biocarrier e g texture and wettability characteristics of interfacial fluid e g flow velocity and fluid properties and cell properties e g the hydrophilicity of cell simoes et al 2010 felföldi et al 2015 the transition of bacteria from bulk liquid to surfaces is essential to the initiation of biofilm formation some bacteria will not form biofilms on surfaces unless supplemented with medium or substrate containing nutritional content that allow growth o toole et al 2000 davey and o toole 2000 the soluble matters in wastewater usually are inorganic salts and organic substances most of which are vital nutrients for the growth of microorganism huang et al 2010 xie et al 2016 moreover various soluble matters especially organic substance e g proteins carbohydrates lipids and saccharides accumulate on the surfaces of biocarriers and potentially provide numerous functional groups and adsorption sites for binding between surfaces and bacteria or extracellular polymeric substances eps associated with bacteria lackner et al 2009 ribeiro et al 2017 such deposited layer e g a layer of protein provides a conditioning layer for microbial colonization and subsequent biofilm formation banerjee et al 2011 therefore enhancing the deposition of soluble matters in wastewater is crucial for rapid biofilm formation and has significant engineering merit as for the influence of ions on biofilm formation researchers held the opinion that calcium ions have no direct impact on the adhesion and development of biofilm for a time stanley 1983 vanhoogmoed et al 1997 dunne and burd 1992 with more and more investigations conducted many studies have reported the remarkable role of divalent cations especially ca2 on the initial adhesion of marine microorganisms chiovitti et al 2008 relevant reports showed that ca2 affects biofilm formation from various aspects physicochemical interactions such as compression of the electrical double layer sheng et al 2010 mitigation of electrostatic repulsion geesey et al 2000 marciňáková et al 2010 and reduction in electron donicity chiovitti et al 2008 strongly influence the depositing behavior of soluble matters in wastewater in terms of the biological aspect ca2 increases the eps production e g polysaccharide as well as biofilm thickness during biofilm formation which facilitates biofilm adhesion on surfaces mangwani et al 2014 sarkisova et al 2005 in addition ca2 can bind edna of several species of bacteria and enhance the aggregation of microorganisms and development of biofilm das et al 2014 the structural integrity cell growth and cell to cell adhesion will also be enhanced by ca2 through electrostatic interaction cavaliere et al 2014 recently he et al 2016 found that ca2 played an important role in protein expression and enhanced the adhesion of chlorella however impact of ca2 on the deposition of wastewater soluble matters on biocarriers remains further explored rhamnolipid rl is a type of biosurfactant produced by pseudomonas species kim et al 2015 having advantages of a low toxicity a high biodegradability and stability at a wide range of temperatures ph and salinity abdel mawgoud et al 2011 although there are lots of reports focusing on the impact of rl on biofilm formation the conclusions are somehow contradictive and confusing on one hand researchers thought rl was detrimental to the formation of biofilm for example the pre conditioning of surfaces using 0 25 and 1 0 w v rl disrupted the formation and reduced the adhesion of biofilms of food borne pathogenic bacteria zezzi do valle gomes and nitschke 2012 and kim et al 2015 claimed that rl 240 mg l showed a great potential for reducing biofilm by decreasing the carbohydrate and protein of eps additionally rodrigues et al 2006 found that preconditioning of silicone rubber by high concentration 4000 mg l of rl inhibited the initial deposition of bacteria and yeasts on it while minor effect was observed by low concentration 4 mg l of rl on the other hand some researchers found rl enhanced and accelerated biofilm formation for instance pseudomonas aeruginosa secreted rl to maintain biofilm architecture by affecting cell cell interactions and the attachment of bacterial cells to surfaces davey et al 2003 nickzad and deziel 2014 rl can also facilitate the dissemination of cells in some cases schooling et al 2004 moreover yu et al 2014 observed a sharp decline in bacterial attachment and microcolony formation of lasb deficient mutant pseudomonas aeruginosa attributed by a decreased biosynthesis of rl apparently the impact of rl on biofilm formation is concentration related a possible explanation is that low concentration 100 mg l of rhamnolipids affects the cell surface properties through increasing cell hydrophobicity by causing a release of lipopolysaccharide from the cell surface thereby increasing the affinity for initial adherence of cells to a surface nickzad and deziel 2014 although many efforts have been devoted into exploring the impact of ca2 and rl to the middle and later periods of biofilm formation there has been so far no more further investigations focusing on the influence at the initial stage i e preconditioning of biofilm formation preconditioning of soluble pollutants on the model biocarriers polystyrene ps and polyamide pa influenced by 1 5 mm ca2 and in situ activity recovery of aging biofilm by 300 mg l of rl were explored in our previous study huang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 however a comprehensive evaluation including separate and combined use of ca2 and rl on the enhancement of soluble matters deposition still needs to be intensively investigated this study examined the role that ca2 and rl played in the deposition of soluble matters on model biocarriers ps and pa using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d to provide some beneficial enlightenments of utilizing ca2 and rl to regulate biofilm formation for accelerating the start up process in attached growth bioreactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sources and characterization real wastewater sourced from aerobic bioreactors in three typical wastewater treatment plants wwtps soluble constituents were obtained from the mixed liquor of wastewater after filtration through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane millipore usa within 2 h after sampling and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c until use the characteristics of real wastewater including ph value conductivity organic materials composed of total organic carbon toc protein pn polysaccharide ps and humic acid ha metal elements zeta potential molecular weight distribution and fluorescence spectral were systematically investigated according to the methods in our previous study huang et al 2015 synthetic wastewater samples were prepared according to compositions of real wastewater with different concentrations of ca2 and rl two constant pn ps ratios 2 and 0 2 by model macromolecules bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa and gradients of ionic strengths from 0 to 3000 mm in order to figure out the impact of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters in wastewater and its feasibility in further application in biofilm process comparatively biocompatible concentrations of ca2 1 mm 100 mm were selected besides 1000 mm ca2 was selected to simulate the extreme condition high salinity caused by high ca2 concentration meantime low concentrations 20 mg l 40 mg l and 80 mg l of rl were selected for their potential to enhance the deposition of soluble matters and compatibility in the future application for biofilm formation enhancement table 1 table 2 and table 3 showed the configurations of tested solutes in separate and combined use of ca2 and rl respectively 2 2 qcm d experiment and modeling deposition behaviors of real and synthetic wastewaters on ps and pa were both investigated in q sense e4 system biolin scientific ab sweden at 25 c water contact angles of ps and pa were 99 8 2 23 and 63 5 1 52 respectively huang et al 2015 and the pretreatment of crystals was referred to sweity et al 2011 a constant flow rate of 150 μl min 1 of fluid in the chamber was applied the flow schedule was as follows i background solution i e double distilled water ii tested solution of the wastewater sample and iii background solution variations of frequency f hz and dissipation factor d were monitored and ratios of dissipation factor versus frequency shifts δ d δ f values were recorded at five overtones n 3 5 7 9 and 11 the depositing amount was defined as the frequency shift δf between the 3rd overtone frequency at deposition equilibrium in stage ii and the reference frequency in stage i depending on the average δ d δ f values sauerbrey and voigt models were employed to model the deposited layer mass and thickness variations respectively the sauerbrey model is valid for nondissipative to weakly dissipative deposited layers with an average δ d δ f value smaller than 1 10 7 hz 1 liu and meenan 2008 wang et al 2013 1 δ m c δ f n n where δm ng cm 2 is the areal mass density of the deposited layer c 17 7 ng cm 2 hz 1 is the sensor specific mass sensitivity constant and δf n hz is the frequency shift of the nth overtone the voigt model in the qtool software q sense is applied when the average δ d δ f value is greater than 1 10 7 hz 1 the best fit shear modulus and thickness of the deposited layer were obtained by modeling δd and δf values at three overtones 3 5 and 7 the density and viscosity of the fluid and the density of the deposited layer were assigned at 1000 kg m 3 0 001 kg m 1 s 1 and 1030 kg m 3 respectively huang et al 2015 sweity et al 2011 ferrando et al 2017 2 3 statistical analysis results were expressed as mean standard deviation one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the statistical differences all the significance analyses were performed using pasw 18 0 software spss inc usa and a p value of 0 05 was accepted as indicating statistical significance deng et al 2016 pallant 2013 redundancy analysis rda was applied to figure out the relationship between ca2 or rl concentration and deposited layer characteristics using canoco for window 4 5 scientiapro hungary as revealed by detrended correspondence analysis dca analysis that the linear model was more suitable for the present study braak et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of real wastewater the properties of real wastewater were shown in table s1 in supplementary information ll hm and hh represented electronic factory wastewater with low organic concentration and low salinity landfill wastewater with high organic concentration and medium salinity and burning power plant wastewater with high organic concentration and high salinity respectively ph value showed that ll and hm were neutral while hh was alkalescent i e 8 61 0 01 the highest concentration of toc and ps in hh and those of pn and ha in hm were observed respectively and ll had the lowest concentration of all the four organic indicators mentioned above the main cations in the three wastewater samples were na k ca2 i e from 8 2 to 28 1 mg l and mg2 and all of their concentrations increased in the order of ll hm hh zeta potentials of the three wastewater samples were negative with absolute values 30 0 mv suggesting instability of the colloidal dispersion figs s1 and s2 in supplementary information showed the molecule weight distribution and eem fluorescence spectra of the real wastewater samples respectively in general the concentration of macromolecules increased in the order of ll hh hm which was consistent with the trend of toc ll displayed a strong fluorescence response of soluble microbial by product like substance and modest response of humic acid like substance whereas both hm and hh exhibited fluorescence characteristics of humic acid like substances 3 2 influence of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters the frequency and dissipation shift of real wastewater influenced by separate use of ca2 was shown as a representative example in fig s3 in supplementary information the depositing amount of frequency shift δf between the 3rd overtone frequency at deposition equilibrium and the reference frequency was used as a benchmark influence of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters was intensively displayed in fig 1 partial correlation was applied to explore the relationship between depositing amount δf and concentration of ca2 in real wastewater while controlling the salinity of the samples there was a strong and positive partial correlation between them r 0 75 p 0001 which indicated that in general with the concentration of ca2 increased more soluble matters deposited on the biocarrier surfaces however the depositing patterns differed from one another among each real wastewater samples and biocarriers proving that the solute configuration and biocarrier properties might partly determine the effect of ca2 on the deposition of soluble matters in order to figure out this experiments in synthetic wastewaters with different pn ps ratio and ionic strength were conducted fig 1c and d minor depositing amount of bsa and sa in both synthetic wastewaters i e sww1 and sww2 was observed δf from 1 78 to 2 16 hz without ca2 addition the depositing amount of soluble matters in sww1 which possessed a higher pn ps ratio 2 1 increased at 1 mm ca2 then fell down as the concentration of ca2 increased to 100 mm and went up again at 1000 mm ca2 by contrast the depositing amount in sww2 whose pn ps ratio was 1 5 kept increasing as the concentration of ca2 increased fig 1c classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory can be used to explain the phenomenon presented in sww2 it s clear that addition of calcium chloride would enhance the ionic strength of the solution and lead to compression of the electric double layer as well as reduction of the net charge of protein and polysaccharide molecules as a result the electrostatic repulsion between soluble matters and the biocarriers was weakened resulting in an increase in the deposition of soluble matters miao et al 2015 2017 in addition a relatively higher concentration of sa in sww2 reacted with ca2 and formed insoluble calcium gels which also contributed to the increase of depositing amount xin et al 2015 yin et al 2015 sriamornsak and kennedy 2006 however dlvo theory cannot soundly explain the phenomenon exhibited in sww1 due to the decrease of the depositing amount at 1 100 mm ca2 it s reported that bsa is difficult to react with ca2 and it bind to ca2 mainly via electrostatic interactions yan et al 2017 when the concentration of ca2 increased to 1 mm the electrostatic repulsion alleviated because of the higher ionic strength this was consistent with dlvo theory as the concentration of ca2 continued increasing ca2 tended to retain some water of hydration which surrounded to negatively charged bsa and formed a hydration layer in the vicinity of bsa and biocarrier surface valle delgado et al 2011 the hydration layer prevented interaction of two surfaces from contacting by hydration repulsion force manciu and ruckenstein 2001 the hydration repulsion force became stronger as more and more hydrated ca2 generated which induced a reduction of the depositing amount though the electrostatic repulsion reduced simultaneously parsegian and zemb 2011 nevertheless when the concentration of ca2 exceeded a specific threshold bsa might convert to positively charged and lose the ability to retain hydrated cations as a result hydration repulsion was eliminated while the electrostatic repulsion force remained negligible at a high ionic strength miao et al 2015 thus the depositing amount rose again at 1000 mm ca2 the discussion above revealed that the solute configuration and ionic strength of wastewater impact calcium ion mediated deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers every sort of soluble matter has a unique interaction with ca2 consequently it will exhibit different regular patterns as concentration of ca2 increases the impact of ionic strength to the influence of ca2 was shown in fig 1d through keeping the constant concentration of ca2 at 1 mm and adjusting the ionic strength of sww1 by adding sodium chloride as for ps the highest depositing amount δf 37 25 hz was observed at 10 mm ionic strength when the ionic strength was lower than 10 mm more soluble matters deposited on ps surface as ionic strength increased in contrast deposition mitigated as ionic strength increased when ionic strength 10 mm namely low ionic strength was favorable for ca2 mediated deposition of soluble matters in wastewater while high ionic strength was detrimental to the deposition however with the ionic strength increased the depositing amount of soluble matters on pa surface decreased until the ionic strength reached 1000 mm such phenomenon can be explained by the theories mentioned above at first after adding 1 mm calcium chloride corresponding ionic strength of 3 mm the deposition on both ps and pa surfaces was enhanced because of compression of the electric double layer complexation and bridging action and then the electrostatic repulsion was mitigated on ps at ionic strength of 10 mm which led to the enhancement of deposition of bsa and sa by dlvo theory but when the ionic strength increased further the influence of hydration repulsion dominated over that of electrostatic repulsion thus deposition on ps was mitigated as ionic strength increased over 10 mm hydration repulsion became a leading factor at ionic strength lower than 100 mm on pa whereas it disappear at 1000 mm as the soluble matters converted to positively charged at high ionic strength fig 2 illustrated a simplified schematic diagram of ca2 and rl mediated deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers in which a b c and d represented deposition behaviors influenced by the separate use of ca2 given the above deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers can be effectively promoted by the addition of ca2 and the enhancement can be mediated not only by the solute configuration but also by the ionic strength of wastewater results of lab scale mbbrs experiment show adding ca2 promotes the increase of biomass on biocarriers the greatest biomass is obtained at 12 5 mg l of ca2 and 187 mg l of nacl while the highest cod removal rate is obtained at 6 88 mg l of ca2 and 187 mg l of nacl data not shown 3 3 influence of rl on the deposition of soluble matters the influence of low concentration of rl was investigated in both synthetic wastewater with different ionic strength and real wastewater samples fig s4 in supplementary information and fig 3 for synthetic wastewater the influence of rl concentration was exhibited individually without the impact of ionic strength fig 3a and simultaneously with the impact of ionic strength fig 3b respectively in general the depositing amount increased as the concentration of rl increased as shown by fig 3a this trend kept similar in different ionic strength wastewaters as shown by fig 3b indicating that moderately increase the amount of rl in wastewater may be beneficial to the deposition of soluble matters in addition the depositing amount declined slightly when the ionic strength increased from 0 mm to 1 mm while increased when ionic strength increased from 1 mm to 100 mm such observations illustrated that rl was more inclined to promote the deposition of soluble matters at a higher ionic strength rather than a lower one in order to verifythe assumption impact of rl in real wastewater was investigated fig 3c and d in ll and hm which represented low salinity and medium salinity wastewater respectively comparatively low concentration 40 mg l of rl mitigated the deposition of soluble matters however in high salinity wastewater i e hh rl always enhanced the deposition this was consistent with the result of rda fig s5 in supplementary information from rda analysis smaller the angel between two arrowheads is closer the correlation between the two variables will be braak et al 2002 apparently rl concentration shown as rl in fig s5 itself was poorly correlated to the depositing amount as well as the thickness of the layer but exhibited a positive correlation after correlated with salinity shown as rl correlated with salinity in fig s5 this indicated that a certain ionic strength is the prerequisite for rl to enhance the deposition of soluble matters such phenomenon is possibly attributed to the hydrate anti agglomeration property of rl york and firoozabadi 2008 in low or medium salinity wastewater hydration repulsion was too negligible to affect the deposition of soluble matters rl as a surfactant brought away some matters that already deposited on the biocarriers due to the solubilization effect with the flow of tested solution and led to decline of the deposition fig 2e and in high salinity wastewater hydrated calcium cations were supposed to aggregate around soluble matters and biocarriers surfaces which might cause strong hydration repulsion and mitigate the deposition however rl had the ability to break the aggregation of water molecules around hydrated cations therefore mitigate the hydration repulsion and eventually enhance the deposition of soluble matters fig 2f in a lab scale mbbrs experiment an increase of biomass 1 9 fold and 1 7 fold respectively at the startup procedure was observed in the treatment groups with 20 mg l and 50 mg l rl compared to the control group 0 mg l rl data not shown it reveals that low concentration 100 mm of rl has potential to enhance not only the soluble matter deposition but also the initial biofilm formation 3 4 influence of combined use of ca2 and rl on the deposition the combined effect of rl and ca2 was investigated by adding both rl and ca2 into ll hh and sww1 and compared with those of the separate use the experiment design and depositing amount of soluble matters in different treatment groups were shown in table 3 and fig 4 respectively in most of the cases adding both ca2 and rl resulted in more depositing amount than adding ca2 or rl separately except for group 1 6 and 12 especially at high ionic strength the cause may be due to the dominant anti hydration repulsion effect at high ionic strength under the combined use of rl and ca2 at low ionic strength on one hand comparatively low doses of rl mitigated the deposition of soluble matters as mentioned in the preceding section on the other hand hydration repulsion was not strong enough to inhibit the enhancement of the soluble matters deposition by ca2 at low ionic strength thus group 1 6 and 12 in which only 1 mm calcium chloride was added exhibited lower depositing amount though with addition of both ca2 and rl compared to that of the separate use of ca2 apparently the deposition of soluble matters in combined use of rl and ca2 treatment groups i e group 2 5 and 8 was enhanced substantially e g the depositing amount with the combined use was 13 fold of that with rl only and 5 fold of that with ca2 only in group 8 this is consistent with the result that a higher ionic strength due to comparatively higher concentration of ca2 100 mm is in favor of the enhancement of soluble matters deposition by rl according to chen chen et al 2013 the binding between rl and ca2 is weak due to the weakly ionic nature of rl it means ca2 has little effect upon the adsorption of rl this indicated that the increment of depositing amount was not caused by the interactions between ca2 and rl but due to the enhancement of soluble matters deposition caused by the specific interactions between soluble matters and ca2 as well as rl 3 5 properties of ca2 and rl mediated deposited layer fig 5 exhibited the properties of ca2 and rl mediated deposited layer in different configurations of tested groups in the present study normally a lower δ d δ f value means the deposited layer is compact and rigid while a higher δ d δ f value suggests a nonrigid and viscoelastic layer liu and meenan 2008 wang et al 2013 for synthetic wastewater the lowest δ d δ f value was obtained at 10 mm and 1 mm ca2 for sww1 and sww2 respectively fig 5a the δ d δ f value increased as the concentration of ca2 increased indicating a compact and rigid layer formed at lower concentration of ca2 while a non rigid layer with open structure formed at higher concentration of ca2 in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the influence of ca2 to the property of deposited layer structure the impact of ionic strength was investigated fig 5b after adding 1 mm calcium chloride and different amounts of sodium chloride to each wastewater samples no obvious discrepancy was observed until the ionic strength reached to 1000 mm significant increase of δ d δ f value at ionic strength of 1000 mm p 05 indicated that high ionic strength conduced a more nonrigid and viscoelastic layer fig 2c whereupon a rigid and compact layer was formed due to the presence of ca2 instead of associated ionic strength at low ca2 concentration 100 mm due to the suppression of electrostatic repulsion and bridging action among soluble matters induced by ca2 soluble matters aggregate closer and the structure of the deposited layer becomes more compact however when the hydration repulsion dominate over that of electrostatic repulsion and bridging action the deposited layer becomes looser and incompact such explanation was consistent with the result in real wastewater fig 5c the δ d δ f value first declined then rose as the concentration of ca2 increased and in general significant higher δ d δ f value p 05 was obtained in high salinity hh wastewater taking the value of 1 10 7 hz 1 of δ d δ f as a threshold sauerbrey and voigt models were applied to model depositing layer thickness respectively huang et al 2015 liu and meenan 2008 wang et al 2013 sauerbrey model was only suitable for two cases deposition of ll on ps and deposition of hm on pa at 10 mm ca2 meanwhile voigt model was fit for the rest the fitting results were given in fig 5d the highest thickness exhibited at 1000 mm ca2 under all situations attributing to the highest depositing amount similar to the variation of δ d δ f value thickness of the deposited layer declined first and then rose as ca2 concentration increased indicating that lower ca2 concentration was in favor of a thinner and denser deposited layer while higher ca2 concentration resulted in a thicker layer it s worth mentioning that the deposited layer tended to be thinner on pa compared to that of ps in wastewater samples with low ca2 concentration 100 mm implying that no matter rigid or not the layer was the formation of a thinner layer was preferred on pa at lower concentration of ca2 usually compact and rigid layer has a stronger ability to resist the deformation caused by external forces e g shear force than nonrigid and viscoelastic layer peterson et al 2015 giving a possible strategy involves mediating the viscoelastic property of deposited layer to resist external forces and maintain biofilm structure by adding ca2 and therefore indirectly enhances the biofilm formation in the start up process of attached growth bioreactors rda analysis showed that ca2 concentration shown as ca in fig s5 in supplementary information has strong and positive correlations with depositing amount represented by δf and deposited layer thickness represented by thickness verifying the relevant discussions i e ca2 enhances the deposition of soluble matters in the previous sections it s interesting that the shear modulus represented by shear in fig s5 calculated by voigt model was strongly and positively correlated to ca2 concentration indicating that though nonrigid and viscoelastic deposited layer would form at high ca2 concentration the layer possessed high shear modulus a possible explanation is the deposited soluble matters act as stakes and thus solidify surrounding liquid at high frequency vibration in qcm measurements the layer adjacent to the chip exhibited high shear modulus and was calculated by voigt model while the layer far from the chip exhibited high dissipation and was represented by δ d δ f value as for rl its impact on viscoelasticity of the deposited layer was exhibited in fig 5e addition of rl prompted a higher δ d δ f in ll and hm and a lower δ d δ f in hh it was mentioned above that higher ionic strength was in favor of nonrigid and viscoelastic layer corresponding to a higher δ d δ f so the δ d δ f value in hh was supposed to be higher than those of ll and hm but the presence of rl lowered the δ d δ f value in hh and reversely increased it in ll and hm it was somewhat like the negative feedback which meant rl would make a rigid layer less rigid and a nonrigid layer more rigid concerning the corresponding δ d δ f value in addition rl concentration was negatively correlated to deposited layer shear modulus fig s5 which may be attributed to the surfactant nature of rl applying voigt model to calculate the layer thickness was suitable for all the cases except for the deposition layer in ll on pa with 20 mg l rl the fitting result was shown in fig 5f variance existed between the deposition on ps and pa the deposited layers in treating groups were thinner than those of the control on ps nevertheless they were thicker than those of the control on pa such result supported the negative feedback theory mentioned above in other words in the presence of rl a deposited layer supposed to be a comparatively thick one will become thinner and that supposed to be a thin layer will become thicker 3 6 influence of biocarrier properties on ca2 and rl mediated deposition it s interesting to note the difference between the deposition on pa and ps as shown in fig 1 the depositing amount on pa increased in the order ll hh hm at a lower concentration 10 mm of ca2 and in the order hh ll hm at a higher concentration 100 mm of ca2 as for ps the depositing amount increased in the order hh hm ll until the concentration of ca2 reached to 1000 mm it indicated that the key factors determining the depositing amount on pa and ps at low ca2 concentration were organic concentration and salinity respectively ps and pa coatings exhibited hydrophobic and hydrophilic natures respectively as revealed by their water contact angles water molecules tended to gather onto the hydrophilic surface and weakened the binding efficiency between hydrated cations and biocarrier surface miao et al 2017 then the hydration repulsion was mitigated and it can hardly affect the deposition on hydrophilic surface thus the deposition on pa at low ca2 concentration was mainly determined by organic concentration rather than ionic strength however hydration repulsion can still substantially affect the deposition at high ca2 concentration because of high ionic strength as for hydrophobic surface of ps hydration repulsion is the major force to determine the depositing amount at low ca2 concentration as discussed in the previous section and therefore makes the ionic strength the key factor that determines the deposition at low ca2 concentration while at high ca2 concentration hydration repulsion might disappear as the soluble matters converted to be positively charged in addition the depositing amount on ps kept higher than that of pa unless ionic strength reached to 1000 mm fig 1d indicating that hydrophobic surface was more favorable to ca2 and rl mediated deposition of soluble matters in wastewater guo et al 2015 also found that the hydrophobic surface was much more favorable to the cell immobilization and tightly bound eps deposition than hydrophilic surface both indicate biocarrier made by ps is more preferable for biofilm formation 4 conclusions the present study verified the role that ca2 and rhamnolipid played in the deposition of soluble matters on model biocarriers ps and pa results showed that the deposition was effectively promoted by the addition of ca2 and along with the increase in ca2 content a low concentration of ca2 induced a compact deposited layer while a viscoelastic layer was easily available at a high concentration of ca2 rhamnolipid tended to enhance the deposition in hyperhaline wastewater through breaking hydration repulsion and decrease the deposition in low salinity wastewater and its influence to the deposited layer property exhibited characteristics of negative feedback the combined use of ca2 and rhamnolipid had a better enhancement effect than that of separate use and the mechanism involved can not be soundly explained only by dlvo theory the strategy of mediating the deposition of soluble matters on different biocarriers by adding ca2 and rhamnolipid in the study has important implications for regulating biofilm formation to accelerate the start up process in
