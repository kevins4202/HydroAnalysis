15405,fe mn composite oxide fmo is widely applied to the oxidation and removal of as iii from water however as iii can directly reduce manganese oxides decreasing the oxidation capacity or reusability and thereby greatly limiting the applicability of fmo here the oxidation capacity and reusability of fmo for as iii were efficiently improved by light radiation and the effect of typical coexisting ions so4 2 and ca2 on the removal of as iii was also studied o2 produced from excited manganese oxide and ligand to metal charge transfer in iron oxide as iii complex enhanced as iii oxidation and removal under light radiation at an initial as iii concentration of 1000 μg l 1 the total as concentration was respectively decreased to 11 5 1 5 and 4 4 μg l 1 under darkness uv light and sunlight at 180 min and could be reduced to below the guideline limitation of drinking water 10 μg l 1 within 40 and 60 min under uv light and sunlight respectively so4 2 exhibited negligible effect on as removal efficiency because fmo had obviously lower adsorption capacity and selectivity for so4 2 than for as v the adsorption of coexisting ca2 on manganese oxide decreased the negative charge on the fmo surface thereby improving as iii adsorption and oxidation fmo exhibited excellent reusability and a total as removal efficiency of 99 1 was still maintained after five cycles of an adsorption desorption process under uv light this work elucidates the photochemical oxidation and removal mechanism of fmo for as iii and proposes a low cost and efficient method for the detoxification of as iii contaminated drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic fe mn composite oxide photooxidation drinking water superoxide radical data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasingly serious arsenic as contamination of drinking water has become a common environmental problem worldwide ma et al 2021 wallis et al 2020 inorganic as is of high toxicity and poses threats to metabolism podgorski and berg 2020 accumulation of as in the human body can lead to dysfunction and cancer in the skin vascular and nervous system bhandari et al 2012 roy et al 2021 in the human diet as is mainly derived from polluted drinking water especially groundwater podgorski and berg 2020 the groundwater sources for 94 million to 220 million people may be polluted by high concentrations of as around the world podgorski and berg 2020 particularly in southern and southeastern asia wallis et al 2020 for example the concentration of as in groundwater even exceeds 1000 μg l 1 in some regions of bangladesh annaduzzaman et al 2021 therefore it is critical to reduce as concentration in drinking water to below 10 μg l 1 according to the world health organization who roy et al 2021 the toxicity of inorganic as is significantly related to its valence state chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2011 as preferentially exists as arsenate as v in oxic environments while as arsenite as iii in reducing environments such as groundwater the mobility and toxicity of as iii h3aso3 without charge are obviously stronger than those of as v haso4 2 and h2aso4 in natural waters bhandari et al 2011 therefore a pre oxidation process of as iii is usually necessary for its removal from contaminated waters ma et al 2021 at present some oxidants including kmno4 naclo and o3 have been applied to as iii pre oxidation roy et al 2021 however they have some disadvantages such as the generally expensive cost of kmno4 1719 usd ton 1 and o3 2610 usd ton 1 li et al 2021b lu et al 2022 and the unnecessary by products of cl formed from naclo which may lead to the secondary pollution in drinking water zhang et al 2022 in addition further treatment of as v by combining adsorption ion exchange or flocculation techniques also results in complex operation and additional cost roy et al 2021 therefore it is still of great environmental and ecological significance to develop simple efficient and low cost techniques for as iii oxidation and removal from drinking water metal oxides such as mn ce fe mg al and cu oxides have been widely studied for as removal from aqueous solutions due to their high oxidation capacity for as iii or adsorption capacity for as v gupta et al 2021 compared with these single metal oxides composite oxides such as al mn fe mn and ce mn oxides exhibit both adsorption and oxidation properties cai et al 2022 among them fe mn composite oxide fmo has the advantages of cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness and possesses excellent as iii detoxification performance due to the rapid oxidation of manganese oxide for as iii and the synergistic effect of iron oxide with high affinity to as v zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 as iii oxidation rate is a key factor affecting its removal efficiency by fmo cai et al 2022 however the direct reduction of manganese oxide by as iii can easily lead to the release of mn2 ions eqs 1 and 2 mnooh represents mn iii intermediate 1 2 mn o 2 s h 3 as o 3 l h 2 o l h 3 as o 4 l 2 mnoo h s 2 h 3 as o 3 l 2 mnoo h s 4 h aq 2 m n 2 aq h 3 as o 4 l 3 h 2 o l the above processes inevitably decrease the oxidation capacity and reusability of fmo cai et al 2022 owings et al 2019 shan and tong 2013 although increasing the proportion of manganese oxide can accelerate as iii oxidation this may decrease the adsorption performance of fmo for as v zhang et al 2012 therefore it is critical to effectively improve the as iii removal performance of fmo and simultaneously alleviate the reduction of manganese oxide so as to promote the applicability of fmo in the treatment of as iii polluted drinking water photocatalytic oxidation is an efficient and low cost method for pollutant removal without the loss of catalyst cai et al 2022 for example tio2 can photo catalyze the oxidation of as iii to as v lee and choi 2002 recently tio2 and cuo with photochemical activity were introduced into fmo to enhance its as iii oxidation ability cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a in these ternary composite oxides holes hvb and electrons ecb were thought to be generated on light excited tio2 and cuo causing the formation of oh 1o2 and o2 through eqs 3 7 georgiou et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a 3 ti o 2 cuo s h v e cb h vb 4 o 2 g e cb o 2 5 h 2 o l h vb oh h aq 6 h vb o 2 1 o 2 7 o 2 g energy 1 o 2 although these reactive oxygen species ros contribute much to as iii oxidation and removal capacity of fmo which of them plays a leading role needs to be further studied cai et al 2022 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2018a as a matter of fact iron oxide and manganese oxide in fmo are also semiconductor minerals and ros may be formed under light radiation lu et al 2019 in addition iron oxide can also catalyze oxygen to oxidize as iii through ligand to metal charge transfer lmct under light radiation xu et al 2014 however the roles of these processes in the removal of as iii by fmo remain poorly understood clarification of the underlying mechanism can help to improve the oxidation performance and reusability of fmo by simple sunlight radiation without the use of other active metals in this work the performance and mechanism of fmo for photochemical removal of aqueous as iii were systematically investigated and the effect of typical coexisting ions on as iii removal performance was also explored finally the role of possible ros and lmct in as iii removal process was systemically analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 oxide preparation the preparation of fmo manganese oxide and ferrihydrite was performed through the reaction of feso4 and kmno4 mnso4 and kmno4 and fe2 so4 3 and naoh respectively according to previous studies zhang et al 2014 the preparation cost of fmo is about 929 usd ton 1 according to the calculation listed in table s1 more details about the preparation are shown in supporting information 2 2 photochemical removal of as iii photochemical removal of as iii 1000 μg l 1 from aqueous solution was carried out at ph 7 0 in a quartz bottle 500 ml equipped with magnetic stirring two led lamps with a main emission wavelength of 365 nm were used as the ultraviolet uv light source and the irradiance of the reaction system was 7 5 mw cm 2 at 320 400 nm as measured by a uv a irradiatometer liu et al 2021a during the specific experiment fmo powder 0 03 g was firstly added into the quartz bottle containing 270 ml of deionized water the suspension ph was adjusted to 7 0 with naoh solution after 4 min of ultrasound treatment then 30 ml of as iii stock solution at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 and ph of 7 0 was added to the fmo suspension and the led lamps were turned on immediately to perform the photochemical experiments after reaction the solid was collected and stored in a refrigerator at 20 c after filtering followed by washing with deionized water and freeze drying a control experiment was carried out under darkness with the quartz bottle being wrapped with aluminum foil the influence of light conditions was investigated under sunlight and visible vis light the sunlight irradiance was 56 1 62 4 and 2 4 2 9 mw cm 2 at 400 1000 and 320 400 nm respectively a xenon lamp cel hxuv300 zhongjiao jinyuan equipped with uv filter was used to produce vis light and the irradiance was 76 8 mw cm 2 at 400 1000 nm na2so4 1 10 mg l 1 and cacl2 10 100 mg l 1 were respectively added to the reaction system to study the influence of coexisting ions the photochemical experiment was performed in nitrogen to explore the role of dissolved oxygen in as iii removal and the dissolved oxygen concentration was lower than 0 1 mg l 1 as determined with a inesa jpb 607a dissolved oxygen meter in addition five cycles of an adsorption desorption process were conducted to evaluate the reusability of fmo as desorption was performed by dispersing the solid with naoh solution 0 5 mol l 1 50 ml and shaking for 2 h the collected solid was rinsed with deionized water and reused for photochemical removal of as iii 2 3 characterization and analysis a shimadzu 6100 diffractometer was used to collect the x ray diffraction xrd patterns a tescan mira4 field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray fesem edx was employed to collected the information about the micromorphology and chemical composition a vg multilab2000 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was employed to characterize the forms of as o fe and mn on fmo cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a mn valence in fmo was also analyzed through the linear combination fitting lcf of mn k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra obtained at the 1w1b beamline of beijing synchrotron radiation facility manceau et al 2012 mott schottky equation has been widely applied to estimate the flat band potential of semiconductor gelderman et al 2007 hankin et al 2019 therefore photocurrent experiments mott schottky plots valence band xps spectra and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs were together applied to analyze the band structures of iron oxide and manganese oxide xu et al 2021 photoelectrochemical experiments including photocurrent and mott schottky measurements were conducted in na2so4 solution 0 5 mol l 1 using a three electrode system on a chi 660e workstation at 20 c the working electrode was prepared by coating a mixture of 90 wt iron manganese oxide and 10 wt pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride adhesive on an ito conducting glass 1 cm 2 cm a platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode sce were used as counter and reference electrode respectively mott schottky measurements were conducted at a frequency of 1000 hz more details for the collection and analysis of the xps spectra xanes spectra and band structures are given in supporting information the concentration determination of as iii total as and fe2 is described in supporting information liu et al 2022a to study the role of ros in as iii oxidation and removal methanol ma 600 mmol l 1 superoxide dismutase sod 25 mg l 1 furfuralcohol ffa 100 mmol l 1 and tert butanol tba 20 mmol l 1 were respectively added into the photochemical reaction to trap hvb o2 1o2 and oh appiani and mcneill 2015 kim et al 2022 liu et al 2021a benzoic acid 10 mmol l 1 was used as a scavenger to quantitatively detect oh the concentration of cumulative oh was 5 87 times that of produced p hydroxybenzoic acid which was detected with an agilent 1200 high performance liquid chromatography liu et al 2022b zhang et al 2018a h2o2 was quantitatively determined with a n n diethyl phenylenediamine spectrophotometry lee and choi 2002 the concentration of cumulative o2 was analyzed through the reduction of ferrocytochrome c and then spectrophotometric measurement at 550 nm yaghini et al 2014 ffa at an initial concentration of 5 μmol l 1 was used as the probe to determine the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss according to a previous report mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker emx plus was used to determine the possible ros the solvent was ma deionized water and deionized water and the scavenger was 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp and dmpo for the determination of o2 1o2 and oh respectively wei et al 2022 the fitting of uv vis absorption spectra using the benesi hildebrand equation was applied to analyze the possible lmct between as iii and iron oxide benesi and hildebrand 1949 kong et al 2016 xu et al 2014 the determination of uv vis adsorption spectra was performed on a perkin elmer lambda 650s spectrophotometer with the thickness of a quartz cell of 1 0 cm the suspensions were dispersed by ultrasonic treatment for 5 min under darkness before measurements the data at 387 nm of uv vis absorption spectra were fitted with the benesi hildebrand equation shown in eq 8 benesi and hildebrand 1949 kong et al 2016 xu et al 2014 8 c fe iii δ a 1 ε 1 ε k 1 c as iii where cfe iii mol l 1 is the concentration of ferrihydrite δa is the difference of the absorbance between as iii ferrihydrite complex and ferrihydrite ε and k are respectively the molar absorptivity and equilibrium constant of as iii ferrihydrite complex and cas iii mol l 1 represents the concentration of as iii 3 results 3 1 photochemical removal of as iii the removal performance of fmo for as iii 1000 μg l 1 was investigated under darkness sunlight uv and vis light in air atmosphere respectively fig 1a under different light conditions dissolved as mainly existed as as iii and the concentrations of total as and as iii first decreased rapidly followed by slow decreases during reaction under darkness the final concentrations of total as and as iii were 11 5 and 9 9 μg l 1 respectively under sunlight uv and vis light the total as concentrations decreased to below 10 μg l 1 at 60 40 and 90 min the final concentrations of total as were 4 4 1 5 and 2 9 μg l 1 and that of as iii were 2 5 1 0 and 2 5 μg l 1 respectively the photochemical removal performance of fmo for as iii was better than that of fe ti mn and fe cu mn ternary composite oxides cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a as shown in fig s1 the concentrations of released mn2 and fe2 ions increased first and then decreased under uv light which were close to those under darkness at the end of the reaction the maximum concentrations of dissolved mn2 and fe2 ions under uv light were only 43 0 and 17 1 μg l 1 respectively which were significantly lower than those 0 4 and 0 3 mg l 1 for mn2 and fe2 respectively in drinking water specified by who ravichandiran et al 2019 wang et al 2012 these results indicated that light radiation can effectively enhance as iii removal by fmo the mechanism for as iii removal by fmo was studied through experiments under uv light possible ros in the reaction were detected by epr spectra fig 1b no ros signal was found in the epr spectrum of the initial suspension after 30 min of reaction temp 1o2 and dmpo oh signals were weak under darkness but obviously stronger under uv light accompanied by the occurrence of dmpo o2 and dmpo so4 signals hong et al 2022 wei et al 2022 compared with that under darkness considerably higher cumulative oh and o2 concentrations and 1o2 ss were observed under uv light fig s2a c h2o2 concentration was not affected by light radiation with very low value about 1 μmol l 1 under both uv light and darkness fig s2d ma ffa tba and sod were further used to trap hvb 1o2 oh and o2 respectively appiani and mcneill 2015 kim et al 2022 liu et al 2021a the addition of tba accelerated the removal of total as and as iii while that of ma and ffa only resulted in slight changes in addition as iii oxidation was notably inhibited by sod accompanied by a decrease in total as and as iii concentrations which were similar to that under darkness fig 1c and fig s3 these results suggested a crucial role of o2 in enhancing as iii removal under light radiation the solid products were characterized after 180 min of reaction under uv light and darkness the xrd patterns of fmo are presented in fig s4 pristine fmo was composed of ferrihydrite and amorphous manganese oxide after reaction under uv light and darkness no obvious change was found in the xrd pattern indicating that the change in fmo crystal phase after as iii removal is negligible fesem edx was applied to analyze the change in micromorphology and elemental distribution of fmo fig 2 pristine fmo exhibited a micromorphology of nano particles which only changed slightly after reaction under uv light and darkness corresponding edx spectra showed an even distribution of fe mn and o elements and adsorption of as on fmo after as iii removal the forms of as o fe and mn on fmo were characterized with xps spectra fig 3 and table s2 the adsorption of as on fmo was further confirmed by the xps broad scans and as 3d spectra fig 3a and b in xps as 3d spectra 44 3 and 45 2 ev are assigned to as as iii and as as v binding energies respectively zhang et al 2018a the proportions of as as iii and as as v were 11 2 and 88 8 under darkness while decreased to 4 2 and increased to 95 8 under uv light respectively in the xps o 1s spectra fig 3c 530 1 531 6 and 533 0 ev correspond to o o2 o oh and o h2o binding energies respectively cai et al 2022 the proportions of o o2 o oh and o h2o were 40 0 48 5 and 11 5 in pristine fmo 49 8 45 4 and 4 8 under darkness and 49 8 45 4 and 4 8 under uv light respectively the decreasing proportion of o oh and o h2o and the increasing proportion of o o2 could be ascribed to the adsorption of as on fmo under darkness and uv light liu et al 2021b these results suggested that light radiation promotes the oxidation of fmo for as iii in the xps fe 2p spectra the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 occurred at 710 4 ev and a 13 6 ev of binding energy interval was observed between fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 implying that fe exists in fmo as fe iii fig 3d zhang et al 2018a in the xps mn 2p spectra the binding energy of mn 2p3 2 occurred at 641 7 ev and there was a binding energy interval of 11 7 ev between mn 2p3 2 and mn 2p1 2 indicating that the mn in fmo mainly exists as mn iii or mn iv fig 3e zhang et al 2018a lcf of mn k edge xanes spectra obtained through the combo method was applied to further calculate the valence state of mn in fmo manceau et al 2012 fig 3f and table s3 show the references and fitting results the proportions of mn iii and mn iv were 15 9 and 84 1 in pristine fmo 29 4 and 69 9 with the existence of 0 7 of mn ii under darkness and 24 9 and 75 1 under uv light respectively the average mn oxidation state mn aos was 3 84 in pristine fmo and decreased to 3 69 and 3 75 under darkness and uv light respectively these results indicated effective alleviation of manganese oxide reduction by as iii under light radiation 3 2 influence of coexisting ions and reuse of fe mn composite oxide so4 2 and ca2 are two common and typical anions and cations in natural waters torres martínez et al 2020 therefore different concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 were respectively added to the reaction system under uv light to investigate their effects on as iii oxidation and removal by fmo fig 4a the removal efficiency of as iii and total as showed no obvious change with increasing so4 2 concentration from 1 to 5 mg l 1 while was slightly inhibited by 10 mg l 1 of so4 2 with the final concentration of total as and as iii being increased from 1 5 to 2 5 μg l 1 and 1 0 to 1 8 μg l 1 respectively nevertheless total as concentration still decreased to below 10 μg l 1 within 40 min the presence of ca2 slightly promoted as iii oxidation and removal at the ca2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 the total as concentration decreased to lower than 10 μg l 1 within 25 min and the final concentration of total as and as iii decreased from 1 5 to 1 4 μg l 1 and 1 0 to 0 7 μg l 1 respectively the concentrations of dissolved mn2 and fe2 ions in the above reactions were also obviously lower than those in drinking water set by who figs s5 and s6 these results demonstrated that fmo can still be applied to the photochemical oxidation and removal of as iii in drinking water with high concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 the reusability of fmo was studied through five cycles of adsorption desorption experiments under darkness and uv light fig 4b after five cycles of adsorption desorption experiments the residual concentrations and removal efficiencies of total as were 50 7 μg l 1 and 95 0 under darkness and 9 0 μg l 1 and 99 1 under uv light respectively from the first to the fifth photochemical removal the concentrations of released mn2 ions were 21 7 56 5 65 6 53 2 and 90 0 μg l 1 and those of released fe2 were 9 4 23 4 25 1 28 2 and 37 2 μg l 1 respectively fig s7 these concentrations were also significantly lower than those in drinking water set by who fig s8 shows the xrd patterns of fmo after reuse transformation of a part of ferrihydrite to goethite was observed under darkness and uv light 4 discussion 4 1 photochemical oxidation and removal mechanism of as iii light radiation can effectively accelerate as iii oxidation and removal by fmo as well as alleviate the reduction of manganese oxides as v can be rapidly adsorbed by iron oxides ding et al 2018 and therefore as iii removal rate by fmo is primarily limited by its oxidation to as v cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2012 under darkness as iii oxidation is ascribed to manganese oxide gude et al 2017 under uv light the rapid decrease in total as concentration to below the guideline limitation in drinking water can be mainly attributed to the improvement of as iii oxidation by ros the epr spectra demonstrated the presence of 1o2 oh o2 and so4 fig 1b the formation of so4 is likely due to the introduction of so4 2 during fmo synthesis photochemical experiments in the presence of ma ffa tba and sod indicated that hvb 1o2 and oh have little contribution to as iii oxidation fig 1c in addition no promotion of as iii oxidation was observed with increasing concentration of so4 2 indicating that so4 also has little effect on as iii oxidation fig 4a although the cumulative concentration of oh was higher than that of o2 oh contributed less to as iii oxidation possibly due to the significantly longer lifetime of o2 about 102 s than that of oh about 10 6 s anifowose et al 2015 hirakawa et al 2007 therefore o2 plays a crucial role in the enhanced as iii oxidation and removal under light radiation which was further verified by the photochemical reaction in nitrogen fig s9 as previously reported the as removal rate could be promoted by tba which can be attributed to the formation of more o2 through the reaction between tba and oh liu et al 2018a semiconductor minerals can be excited by light radiation to generate hvb ecb pairs and o2 may be formed through the reduction of o2 by ecb eqs 3 and 4 in fmo suspensions o2 was detected under light radiation and the presence of as iii decreased its signal intensity in epr spectra fig 5a further indicating the formation of o2 on fmo under light radiation an epr test on single ferrihydrite and manganese oxide suspension was also performed to distinguish their contribution to o2 formation in fmo the results indicated that o2 is mainly produced from excited manganese oxide instead of ferrihydrite fig 5b which may be ascribed to their different conduction band cb potentials the photocurrent response plots verified the photochemical properties of manganese oxide and ferrihydrite fig 6a according to the uv vis drs mott schottky plots and vb xps spectra the band gaps eg were 1 76 and 1 50 ev the valence band vb potentials were 2 41 and 1 10 ev and the cb potentials were 0 65 and 0 40 ev for ferrihydrite and manganese oxide respectively fig 6b d fig s10 and table s4 due to the higher cb potential of ferrihydrite than the reduction potential of o2 to o2 0 33 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe o2 could not be formed on ferrihydrite through the reduction of o2 by ecb xu et al 2021 the weak o2 signal in the epr of the single ferrihydrite reaction system may be ascribed to the reaction of oh and h2o2 kong et al 2015 liu et al 2021a therefore the reaction between o2 and ecb produced by light excited manganese oxide led to o2 formation fig 6e and f as iii oxidation may also be promoted by the lmct in the ferrihydrite as iii complex xu et al 2014 electrons can be transferred from as iii to fe iii in iron oxide as iii complexes under light radiation which is accompanied by as iii oxidation to as iv and fe iii reduction to fe2 then the generated as iv is oxidized to as v by o2 with the formation of o2 further enhancing as iii oxidation xu et al 2014 in this work the lmct in ferrihydrite as iii complex was checked by uv vis absorption spectra fig 7 in the suspension with as iii and ferrihydrite the absorbance significantly increased with increasing as iii concentration which is similar to the phenomenon observed in the system containing as iii and colloidal iron xu et al 2014 the uv vis spectral data obtained at 387 nm were fitted with the benesi hildebrand equation and the good linearity r2 0 9879 and release of more fe2 under uv light than darkness confirmed the occurrence of lmct between as iii and ferrihydrite in fmo 4 2 influence of coexisting ions and reusability the removal of as iii is commonly affected by coexisting ions in waters in this work as iii removal efficiency was only slightly inhibited by so4 2 at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 during as iii removal by fmo the formed as v is adsorbed on iron oxide through the generation of bidentate binuclear corner edge sharing complexes zhang et al 2014 although inner and outer sphere complexes are involved in the adsorption of iron oxide for so4 2 kitadai et al 2018 the adsorption capacity and selectivity for so4 2 are obviously lower than those for as v zhang et al 2007 therefore so4 2 showed little effect on as iii removal ca2 could promote as iii removal by fmo the point of zero charge of manganese oxide in fmo usually varies from 1 to 2 which contributes to its high adsorption capacity for metal cations liu et al 2018b yang et al 2018 the adsorption of ca2 on manganese oxide decreases the negative charge on fmo surfaces thereby improving as iii adsorption and subsequent oxidation reusability is a key factor affecting the practical application of fmo zheng et al 2021 under darkness the oxidation of as iii was ascribed to the reduction of manganese oxides in fmo eqs 1 and 2 and the release of mn2 ions directly led to decreases in the removal capacity and reusability of fmo under uv light o2 produced from excited manganese oxide through the reduction of o2 and lmct process in iron oxide as iii complex enhanced as iii oxidation and removal besides manganese oxide o2 was also the electron acceptor of as iii oxidation as indicated by the lower as iii oxidation in n2 atmosphere than air atmosphere fig s9 therefore light radiation can improve the as iii oxidation capacity and simultaneously alleviate the reduction of manganese oxide a higher concentration of mn2 ions was detected under uv light than under darkness at the initial stage fig s1 which can be attributed to the reduction of manganese oxide by fe2 generated from the lmct process the mn aos in fmo after reaction under uv light was higher than that under darkness indicating that the o2 formed in the photochemical system can not only promote as iii oxidation but also improve the stability of fmo through the oxidization of released mn2 ions to manganese oxide jung et al 2021 in our previous work o2 generated from the photolysis of no3 also led to the oxidation of mn2 ions to birnessite zhang et al 2018b in this work the oxidation of mn2 ions by o2 was further verified by the release of more mn2 ions in the presence of sod under uv light fig s11 after five cycles of reuse the transformation of a part of ferrihydrite to goethite could be primarily attributed to the effect of released fe2 ferrihydrite is a metastable iron oxide and fe2 can induce the transformation of ferrihydrite to more stable iron oxides such as goethite and lepidocrocite through the lmct process shu et al 2019 a total as removal efficiency of 99 1 under uv light could still be retained after five cycles of reuse at a high as concentration of 1000 μg l 1 which is significantly higher than that under darkness and that of fe ti mn and fe cu mn ternary composite oxides cai et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 the high retention rate of as removal efficiency during reuse of fmo may be ascribed to the high photochemical activity and adsorption ability of goethite for as v bhandari et al 2012 therefore light radiation can improve the as iii removal performance and reusability of fmo 4 3 environmental implications drinking water pollution by as mostly occurs in developing countries and regions in southern asia over the world mihajlov et al 2020 podgorski and berg 2020 some techniques including membrane filtration ion exchange modified coagulation filtration enhanced lime softening and reverse osmosis for as iii removal from drinking water are recommended by the united states environmental protection agency however these techniques have not been widely used in developing countries due to their complex processing system or high energy consumption berg et al 2006 adsorption with natural and locally available adsorbents has been considered as a sustainable technology for as iii removal from drinking water for low income and remote rural areas canas kurz et al 2021 fmo has the advantages of rich raw materials environmental friendliness and low cost however the mn2 ions released during as iii removal can decrease the oxidation capacity and stability of fmo cai et al 2022 gude et al 2017 owings et al 2019 shan and tong 2013 it remains a challenge to improve the oxidation capacity and stability of fmo using facile and low cost methods this work shows that o2 produced on manganese oxide and the lmct in iron oxide as iii complex under sunlight can effectively improve the removal capacity and reusability of fmo for as iii contributing to a rapid decrease in total as concentrations to below 10 μg l 1 in order to further investigate the applicability of the photochemical removal of as iii by fmo the 50 ml of naoh solution was reused for as desorption during the regeneration of fmo after three cycles of reuse of fmo under uv light the total as removal efficiency was still maintained at 99 7 these results indicated the water recovery ratio can be improved through the reuse of naoh solution therefore fmo has promising application prospects in the photochemical removal of as iii from drinking water 5 conclusions light radiation can effectively improve the as iii oxidation and removal from aqueous solutions by fmo as well as alleviate the reduction of manganese oxide which can significantly enhance the practicality of fmo under sunlight the total as can be rapidly removed with the concentration decreasing to below 10 μg l 1 by fmo in 1000 μg l 1 as iii containing solution within 60 min which is acceptable in drinking water according to who under light radiation the ros 1o2 oh o2 and so4 are generated and o2 contributes considerably to the enhancement of as iii oxidation and alleviation of manganese oxide reduction o2 is mainly produced from the reaction between o2 and ecb generated on light excited manganese oxide although o2 cannot be formed on ferrihydrite through the reduction of o2 by ecb due to its limited cb potential as iii oxidation may also be promoted by the lmct process in the ferrihydrite as iii complex coexisting so4 2 and ca2 exhibit little effect on as iii oxidation and removal fmo can be reused through the desorption of as with naoh solution and the as removal efficiency can reach as high as 99 1 after five cycles of reuse under uv light the present work expands the environmental application of fmo and provides an alternative low cost and efficient method for as iii detoxication in

15405,fe mn composite oxide fmo is widely applied to the oxidation and removal of as iii from water however as iii can directly reduce manganese oxides decreasing the oxidation capacity or reusability and thereby greatly limiting the applicability of fmo here the oxidation capacity and reusability of fmo for as iii were efficiently improved by light radiation and the effect of typical coexisting ions so4 2 and ca2 on the removal of as iii was also studied o2 produced from excited manganese oxide and ligand to metal charge transfer in iron oxide as iii complex enhanced as iii oxidation and removal under light radiation at an initial as iii concentration of 1000 μg l 1 the total as concentration was respectively decreased to 11 5 1 5 and 4 4 μg l 1 under darkness uv light and sunlight at 180 min and could be reduced to below the guideline limitation of drinking water 10 μg l 1 within 40 and 60 min under uv light and sunlight respectively so4 2 exhibited negligible effect on as removal efficiency because fmo had obviously lower adsorption capacity and selectivity for so4 2 than for as v the adsorption of coexisting ca2 on manganese oxide decreased the negative charge on the fmo surface thereby improving as iii adsorption and oxidation fmo exhibited excellent reusability and a total as removal efficiency of 99 1 was still maintained after five cycles of an adsorption desorption process under uv light this work elucidates the photochemical oxidation and removal mechanism of fmo for as iii and proposes a low cost and efficient method for the detoxification of as iii contaminated drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic fe mn composite oxide photooxidation drinking water superoxide radical data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasingly serious arsenic as contamination of drinking water has become a common environmental problem worldwide ma et al 2021 wallis et al 2020 inorganic as is of high toxicity and poses threats to metabolism podgorski and berg 2020 accumulation of as in the human body can lead to dysfunction and cancer in the skin vascular and nervous system bhandari et al 2012 roy et al 2021 in the human diet as is mainly derived from polluted drinking water especially groundwater podgorski and berg 2020 the groundwater sources for 94 million to 220 million people may be polluted by high concentrations of as around the world podgorski and berg 2020 particularly in southern and southeastern asia wallis et al 2020 for example the concentration of as in groundwater even exceeds 1000 μg l 1 in some regions of bangladesh annaduzzaman et al 2021 therefore it is critical to reduce as concentration in drinking water to below 10 μg l 1 according to the world health organization who roy et al 2021 the toxicity of inorganic as is significantly related to its valence state chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2011 as preferentially exists as arsenate as v in oxic environments while as arsenite as iii in reducing environments such as groundwater the mobility and toxicity of as iii h3aso3 without charge are obviously stronger than those of as v haso4 2 and h2aso4 in natural waters bhandari et al 2011 therefore a pre oxidation process of as iii is usually necessary for its removal from contaminated waters ma et al 2021 at present some oxidants including kmno4 naclo and o3 have been applied to as iii pre oxidation roy et al 2021 however they have some disadvantages such as the generally expensive cost of kmno4 1719 usd ton 1 and o3 2610 usd ton 1 li et al 2021b lu et al 2022 and the unnecessary by products of cl formed from naclo which may lead to the secondary pollution in drinking water zhang et al 2022 in addition further treatment of as v by combining adsorption ion exchange or flocculation techniques also results in complex operation and additional cost roy et al 2021 therefore it is still of great environmental and ecological significance to develop simple efficient and low cost techniques for as iii oxidation and removal from drinking water metal oxides such as mn ce fe mg al and cu oxides have been widely studied for as removal from aqueous solutions due to their high oxidation capacity for as iii or adsorption capacity for as v gupta et al 2021 compared with these single metal oxides composite oxides such as al mn fe mn and ce mn oxides exhibit both adsorption and oxidation properties cai et al 2022 among them fe mn composite oxide fmo has the advantages of cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness and possesses excellent as iii detoxification performance due to the rapid oxidation of manganese oxide for as iii and the synergistic effect of iron oxide with high affinity to as v zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 as iii oxidation rate is a key factor affecting its removal efficiency by fmo cai et al 2022 however the direct reduction of manganese oxide by as iii can easily lead to the release of mn2 ions eqs 1 and 2 mnooh represents mn iii intermediate 1 2 mn o 2 s h 3 as o 3 l h 2 o l h 3 as o 4 l 2 mnoo h s 2 h 3 as o 3 l 2 mnoo h s 4 h aq 2 m n 2 aq h 3 as o 4 l 3 h 2 o l the above processes inevitably decrease the oxidation capacity and reusability of fmo cai et al 2022 owings et al 2019 shan and tong 2013 although increasing the proportion of manganese oxide can accelerate as iii oxidation this may decrease the adsorption performance of fmo for as v zhang et al 2012 therefore it is critical to effectively improve the as iii removal performance of fmo and simultaneously alleviate the reduction of manganese oxide so as to promote the applicability of fmo in the treatment of as iii polluted drinking water photocatalytic oxidation is an efficient and low cost method for pollutant removal without the loss of catalyst cai et al 2022 for example tio2 can photo catalyze the oxidation of as iii to as v lee and choi 2002 recently tio2 and cuo with photochemical activity were introduced into fmo to enhance its as iii oxidation ability cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a in these ternary composite oxides holes hvb and electrons ecb were thought to be generated on light excited tio2 and cuo causing the formation of oh 1o2 and o2 through eqs 3 7 georgiou et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a 3 ti o 2 cuo s h v e cb h vb 4 o 2 g e cb o 2 5 h 2 o l h vb oh h aq 6 h vb o 2 1 o 2 7 o 2 g energy 1 o 2 although these reactive oxygen species ros contribute much to as iii oxidation and removal capacity of fmo which of them plays a leading role needs to be further studied cai et al 2022 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2018a as a matter of fact iron oxide and manganese oxide in fmo are also semiconductor minerals and ros may be formed under light radiation lu et al 2019 in addition iron oxide can also catalyze oxygen to oxidize as iii through ligand to metal charge transfer lmct under light radiation xu et al 2014 however the roles of these processes in the removal of as iii by fmo remain poorly understood clarification of the underlying mechanism can help to improve the oxidation performance and reusability of fmo by simple sunlight radiation without the use of other active metals in this work the performance and mechanism of fmo for photochemical removal of aqueous as iii were systematically investigated and the effect of typical coexisting ions on as iii removal performance was also explored finally the role of possible ros and lmct in as iii removal process was systemically analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 oxide preparation the preparation of fmo manganese oxide and ferrihydrite was performed through the reaction of feso4 and kmno4 mnso4 and kmno4 and fe2 so4 3 and naoh respectively according to previous studies zhang et al 2014 the preparation cost of fmo is about 929 usd ton 1 according to the calculation listed in table s1 more details about the preparation are shown in supporting information 2 2 photochemical removal of as iii photochemical removal of as iii 1000 μg l 1 from aqueous solution was carried out at ph 7 0 in a quartz bottle 500 ml equipped with magnetic stirring two led lamps with a main emission wavelength of 365 nm were used as the ultraviolet uv light source and the irradiance of the reaction system was 7 5 mw cm 2 at 320 400 nm as measured by a uv a irradiatometer liu et al 2021a during the specific experiment fmo powder 0 03 g was firstly added into the quartz bottle containing 270 ml of deionized water the suspension ph was adjusted to 7 0 with naoh solution after 4 min of ultrasound treatment then 30 ml of as iii stock solution at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 and ph of 7 0 was added to the fmo suspension and the led lamps were turned on immediately to perform the photochemical experiments after reaction the solid was collected and stored in a refrigerator at 20 c after filtering followed by washing with deionized water and freeze drying a control experiment was carried out under darkness with the quartz bottle being wrapped with aluminum foil the influence of light conditions was investigated under sunlight and visible vis light the sunlight irradiance was 56 1 62 4 and 2 4 2 9 mw cm 2 at 400 1000 and 320 400 nm respectively a xenon lamp cel hxuv300 zhongjiao jinyuan equipped with uv filter was used to produce vis light and the irradiance was 76 8 mw cm 2 at 400 1000 nm na2so4 1 10 mg l 1 and cacl2 10 100 mg l 1 were respectively added to the reaction system to study the influence of coexisting ions the photochemical experiment was performed in nitrogen to explore the role of dissolved oxygen in as iii removal and the dissolved oxygen concentration was lower than 0 1 mg l 1 as determined with a inesa jpb 607a dissolved oxygen meter in addition five cycles of an adsorption desorption process were conducted to evaluate the reusability of fmo as desorption was performed by dispersing the solid with naoh solution 0 5 mol l 1 50 ml and shaking for 2 h the collected solid was rinsed with deionized water and reused for photochemical removal of as iii 2 3 characterization and analysis a shimadzu 6100 diffractometer was used to collect the x ray diffraction xrd patterns a tescan mira4 field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray fesem edx was employed to collected the information about the micromorphology and chemical composition a vg multilab2000 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was employed to characterize the forms of as o fe and mn on fmo cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a mn valence in fmo was also analyzed through the linear combination fitting lcf of mn k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra obtained at the 1w1b beamline of beijing synchrotron radiation facility manceau et al 2012 mott schottky equation has been widely applied to estimate the flat band potential of semiconductor gelderman et al 2007 hankin et al 2019 therefore photocurrent experiments mott schottky plots valence band xps spectra and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs were together applied to analyze the band structures of iron oxide and manganese oxide xu et al 2021 photoelectrochemical experiments including photocurrent and mott schottky measurements were conducted in na2so4 solution 0 5 mol l 1 using a three electrode system on a chi 660e workstation at 20 c the working electrode was prepared by coating a mixture of 90 wt iron manganese oxide and 10 wt pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride adhesive on an ito conducting glass 1 cm 2 cm a platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode sce were used as counter and reference electrode respectively mott schottky measurements were conducted at a frequency of 1000 hz more details for the collection and analysis of the xps spectra xanes spectra and band structures are given in supporting information the concentration determination of as iii total as and fe2 is described in supporting information liu et al 2022a to study the role of ros in as iii oxidation and removal methanol ma 600 mmol l 1 superoxide dismutase sod 25 mg l 1 furfuralcohol ffa 100 mmol l 1 and tert butanol tba 20 mmol l 1 were respectively added into the photochemical reaction to trap hvb o2 1o2 and oh appiani and mcneill 2015 kim et al 2022 liu et al 2021a benzoic acid 10 mmol l 1 was used as a scavenger to quantitatively detect oh the concentration of cumulative oh was 5 87 times that of produced p hydroxybenzoic acid which was detected with an agilent 1200 high performance liquid chromatography liu et al 2022b zhang et al 2018a h2o2 was quantitatively determined with a n n diethyl phenylenediamine spectrophotometry lee and choi 2002 the concentration of cumulative o2 was analyzed through the reduction of ferrocytochrome c and then spectrophotometric measurement at 550 nm yaghini et al 2014 ffa at an initial concentration of 5 μmol l 1 was used as the probe to determine the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss according to a previous report mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker emx plus was used to determine the possible ros the solvent was ma deionized water and deionized water and the scavenger was 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp and dmpo for the determination of o2 1o2 and oh respectively wei et al 2022 the fitting of uv vis absorption spectra using the benesi hildebrand equation was applied to analyze the possible lmct between as iii and iron oxide benesi and hildebrand 1949 kong et al 2016 xu et al 2014 the determination of uv vis adsorption spectra was performed on a perkin elmer lambda 650s spectrophotometer with the thickness of a quartz cell of 1 0 cm the suspensions were dispersed by ultrasonic treatment for 5 min under darkness before measurements the data at 387 nm of uv vis absorption spectra were fitted with the benesi hildebrand equation shown in eq 8 benesi and hildebrand 1949 kong et al 2016 xu et al 2014 8 c fe iii δ a 1 ε 1 ε k 1 c as iii where cfe iii mol l 1 is the concentration of ferrihydrite δa is the difference of the absorbance between as iii ferrihydrite complex and ferrihydrite ε and k are respectively the molar absorptivity and equilibrium constant of as iii ferrihydrite complex and cas iii mol l 1 represents the concentration of as iii 3 results 3 1 photochemical removal of as iii the removal performance of fmo for as iii 1000 μg l 1 was investigated under darkness sunlight uv and vis light in air atmosphere respectively fig 1a under different light conditions dissolved as mainly existed as as iii and the concentrations of total as and as iii first decreased rapidly followed by slow decreases during reaction under darkness the final concentrations of total as and as iii were 11 5 and 9 9 μg l 1 respectively under sunlight uv and vis light the total as concentrations decreased to below 10 μg l 1 at 60 40 and 90 min the final concentrations of total as were 4 4 1 5 and 2 9 μg l 1 and that of as iii were 2 5 1 0 and 2 5 μg l 1 respectively the photochemical removal performance of fmo for as iii was better than that of fe ti mn and fe cu mn ternary composite oxides cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a as shown in fig s1 the concentrations of released mn2 and fe2 ions increased first and then decreased under uv light which were close to those under darkness at the end of the reaction the maximum concentrations of dissolved mn2 and fe2 ions under uv light were only 43 0 and 17 1 μg l 1 respectively which were significantly lower than those 0 4 and 0 3 mg l 1 for mn2 and fe2 respectively in drinking water specified by who ravichandiran et al 2019 wang et al 2012 these results indicated that light radiation can effectively enhance as iii removal by fmo the mechanism for as iii removal by fmo was studied through experiments under uv light possible ros in the reaction were detected by epr spectra fig 1b no ros signal was found in the epr spectrum of the initial suspension after 30 min of reaction temp 1o2 and dmpo oh signals were weak under darkness but obviously stronger under uv light accompanied by the occurrence of dmpo o2 and dmpo so4 signals hong et al 2022 wei et al 2022 compared with that under darkness considerably higher cumulative oh and o2 concentrations and 1o2 ss were observed under uv light fig s2a c h2o2 concentration was not affected by light radiation with very low value about 1 μmol l 1 under both uv light and darkness fig s2d ma ffa tba and sod were further used to trap hvb 1o2 oh and o2 respectively appiani and mcneill 2015 kim et al 2022 liu et al 2021a the addition of tba accelerated the removal of total as and as iii while that of ma and ffa only resulted in slight changes in addition as iii oxidation was notably inhibited by sod accompanied by a decrease in total as and as iii concentrations which were similar to that under darkness fig 1c and fig s3 these results suggested a crucial role of o2 in enhancing as iii removal under light radiation the solid products were characterized after 180 min of reaction under uv light and darkness the xrd patterns of fmo are presented in fig s4 pristine fmo was composed of ferrihydrite and amorphous manganese oxide after reaction under uv light and darkness no obvious change was found in the xrd pattern indicating that the change in fmo crystal phase after as iii removal is negligible fesem edx was applied to analyze the change in micromorphology and elemental distribution of fmo fig 2 pristine fmo exhibited a micromorphology of nano particles which only changed slightly after reaction under uv light and darkness corresponding edx spectra showed an even distribution of fe mn and o elements and adsorption of as on fmo after as iii removal the forms of as o fe and mn on fmo were characterized with xps spectra fig 3 and table s2 the adsorption of as on fmo was further confirmed by the xps broad scans and as 3d spectra fig 3a and b in xps as 3d spectra 44 3 and 45 2 ev are assigned to as as iii and as as v binding energies respectively zhang et al 2018a the proportions of as as iii and as as v were 11 2 and 88 8 under darkness while decreased to 4 2 and increased to 95 8 under uv light respectively in the xps o 1s spectra fig 3c 530 1 531 6 and 533 0 ev correspond to o o2 o oh and o h2o binding energies respectively cai et al 2022 the proportions of o o2 o oh and o h2o were 40 0 48 5 and 11 5 in pristine fmo 49 8 45 4 and 4 8 under darkness and 49 8 45 4 and 4 8 under uv light respectively the decreasing proportion of o oh and o h2o and the increasing proportion of o o2 could be ascribed to the adsorption of as on fmo under darkness and uv light liu et al 2021b these results suggested that light radiation promotes the oxidation of fmo for as iii in the xps fe 2p spectra the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 occurred at 710 4 ev and a 13 6 ev of binding energy interval was observed between fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 implying that fe exists in fmo as fe iii fig 3d zhang et al 2018a in the xps mn 2p spectra the binding energy of mn 2p3 2 occurred at 641 7 ev and there was a binding energy interval of 11 7 ev between mn 2p3 2 and mn 2p1 2 indicating that the mn in fmo mainly exists as mn iii or mn iv fig 3e zhang et al 2018a lcf of mn k edge xanes spectra obtained through the combo method was applied to further calculate the valence state of mn in fmo manceau et al 2012 fig 3f and table s3 show the references and fitting results the proportions of mn iii and mn iv were 15 9 and 84 1 in pristine fmo 29 4 and 69 9 with the existence of 0 7 of mn ii under darkness and 24 9 and 75 1 under uv light respectively the average mn oxidation state mn aos was 3 84 in pristine fmo and decreased to 3 69 and 3 75 under darkness and uv light respectively these results indicated effective alleviation of manganese oxide reduction by as iii under light radiation 3 2 influence of coexisting ions and reuse of fe mn composite oxide so4 2 and ca2 are two common and typical anions and cations in natural waters torres martínez et al 2020 therefore different concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 were respectively added to the reaction system under uv light to investigate their effects on as iii oxidation and removal by fmo fig 4a the removal efficiency of as iii and total as showed no obvious change with increasing so4 2 concentration from 1 to 5 mg l 1 while was slightly inhibited by 10 mg l 1 of so4 2 with the final concentration of total as and as iii being increased from 1 5 to 2 5 μg l 1 and 1 0 to 1 8 μg l 1 respectively nevertheless total as concentration still decreased to below 10 μg l 1 within 40 min the presence of ca2 slightly promoted as iii oxidation and removal at the ca2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 the total as concentration decreased to lower than 10 μg l 1 within 25 min and the final concentration of total as and as iii decreased from 1 5 to 1 4 μg l 1 and 1 0 to 0 7 μg l 1 respectively the concentrations of dissolved mn2 and fe2 ions in the above reactions were also obviously lower than those in drinking water set by who figs s5 and s6 these results demonstrated that fmo can still be applied to the photochemical oxidation and removal of as iii in drinking water with high concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 the reusability of fmo was studied through five cycles of adsorption desorption experiments under darkness and uv light fig 4b after five cycles of adsorption desorption experiments the residual concentrations and removal efficiencies of total as were 50 7 μg l 1 and 95 0 under darkness and 9 0 μg l 1 and 99 1 under uv light respectively from the first to the fifth photochemical removal the concentrations of released mn2 ions were 21 7 56 5 65 6 53 2 and 90 0 μg l 1 and those of released fe2 were 9 4 23 4 25 1 28 2 and 37 2 μg l 1 respectively fig s7 these concentrations were also significantly lower than those in drinking water set by who fig s8 shows the xrd patterns of fmo after reuse transformation of a part of ferrihydrite to goethite was observed under darkness and uv light 4 discussion 4 1 photochemical oxidation and removal mechanism of as iii light radiation can effectively accelerate as iii oxidation and removal by fmo as well as alleviate the reduction of manganese oxides as v can be rapidly adsorbed by iron oxides ding et al 2018 and therefore as iii removal rate by fmo is primarily limited by its oxidation to as v cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2012 under darkness as iii oxidation is ascribed to manganese oxide gude et al 2017 under uv light the rapid decrease in total as concentration to below the guideline limitation in drinking water can be mainly attributed to the improvement of as iii oxidation by ros the epr spectra demonstrated the presence of 1o2 oh o2 and so4 fig 1b the formation of so4 is likely due to the introduction of so4 2 during fmo synthesis photochemical experiments in the presence of ma ffa tba and sod indicated that hvb 1o2 and oh have little contribution to as iii oxidation fig 1c in addition no promotion of as iii oxidation was observed with increasing concentration of so4 2 indicating that so4 also has little effect on as iii oxidation fig 4a although the cumulative concentration of oh was higher than that of o2 oh contributed less to as iii oxidation possibly due to the significantly longer lifetime of o2 about 102 s than that of oh about 10 6 s anifowose et al 2015 hirakawa et al 2007 therefore o2 plays a crucial role in the enhanced as iii oxidation and removal under light radiation which was further verified by the photochemical reaction in nitrogen fig s9 as previously reported the as removal rate could be promoted by tba which can be attributed to the formation of more o2 through the reaction between tba and oh liu et al 2018a semiconductor minerals can be excited by light radiation to generate hvb ecb pairs and o2 may be formed through the reduction of o2 by ecb eqs 3 and 4 in fmo suspensions o2 was detected under light radiation and the presence of as iii decreased its signal intensity in epr spectra fig 5a further indicating the formation of o2 on fmo under light radiation an epr test on single ferrihydrite and manganese oxide suspension was also performed to distinguish their contribution to o2 formation in fmo the results indicated that o2 is mainly produced from excited manganese oxide instead of ferrihydrite fig 5b which may be ascribed to their different conduction band cb potentials the photocurrent response plots verified the photochemical properties of manganese oxide and ferrihydrite fig 6a according to the uv vis drs mott schottky plots and vb xps spectra the band gaps eg were 1 76 and 1 50 ev the valence band vb potentials were 2 41 and 1 10 ev and the cb potentials were 0 65 and 0 40 ev for ferrihydrite and manganese oxide respectively fig 6b d fig s10 and table s4 due to the higher cb potential of ferrihydrite than the reduction potential of o2 to o2 0 33 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe o2 could not be formed on ferrihydrite through the reduction of o2 by ecb xu et al 2021 the weak o2 signal in the epr of the single ferrihydrite reaction system may be ascribed to the reaction of oh and h2o2 kong et al 2015 liu et al 2021a therefore the reaction between o2 and ecb produced by light excited manganese oxide led to o2 formation fig 6e and f as iii oxidation may also be promoted by the lmct in the ferrihydrite as iii complex xu et al 2014 electrons can be transferred from as iii to fe iii in iron oxide as iii complexes under light radiation which is accompanied by as iii oxidation to as iv and fe iii reduction to fe2 then the generated as iv is oxidized to as v by o2 with the formation of o2 further enhancing as iii oxidation xu et al 2014 in this work the lmct in ferrihydrite as iii complex was checked by uv vis absorption spectra fig 7 in the suspension with as iii and ferrihydrite the absorbance significantly increased with increasing as iii concentration which is similar to the phenomenon observed in the system containing as iii and colloidal iron xu et al 2014 the uv vis spectral data obtained at 387 nm were fitted with the benesi hildebrand equation and the good linearity r2 0 9879 and release of more fe2 under uv light than darkness confirmed the occurrence of lmct between as iii and ferrihydrite in fmo 4 2 influence of coexisting ions and reusability the removal of as iii is commonly affected by coexisting ions in waters in this work as iii removal efficiency was only slightly inhibited by so4 2 at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 during as iii removal by fmo the formed as v is adsorbed on iron oxide through the generation of bidentate binuclear corner edge sharing complexes zhang et al 2014 although inner and outer sphere complexes are involved in the adsorption of iron oxide for so4 2 kitadai et al 2018 the adsorption capacity and selectivity for so4 2 are obviously lower than those for as v zhang et al 2007 therefore so4 2 showed little effect on as iii removal ca2 could promote as iii removal by fmo the point of zero charge of manganese oxide in fmo usually varies from 1 to 2 which contributes to its high adsorption capacity for metal cations liu et al 2018b yang et al 2018 the adsorption of ca2 on manganese oxide decreases the negative charge on fmo surfaces thereby improving as iii adsorption and subsequent oxidation reusability is a key factor affecting the practical application of fmo zheng et al 2021 under darkness the oxidation of as iii was ascribed to the reduction of manganese oxides in fmo eqs 1 and 2 and the release of mn2 ions directly led to decreases in the removal capacity and reusability of fmo under uv light o2 produced from excited manganese oxide through the reduction of o2 and lmct process in iron oxide as iii complex enhanced as iii oxidation and removal besides manganese oxide o2 was also the electron acceptor of as iii oxidation as indicated by the lower as iii oxidation in n2 atmosphere than air atmosphere fig s9 therefore light radiation can improve the as iii oxidation capacity and simultaneously alleviate the reduction of manganese oxide a higher concentration of mn2 ions was detected under uv light than under darkness at the initial stage fig s1 which can be attributed to the reduction of manganese oxide by fe2 generated from the lmct process the mn aos in fmo after reaction under uv light was higher than that under darkness indicating that the o2 formed in the photochemical system can not only promote as iii oxidation but also improve the stability of fmo through the oxidization of released mn2 ions to manganese oxide jung et al 2021 in our previous work o2 generated from the photolysis of no3 also led to the oxidation of mn2 ions to birnessite zhang et al 2018b in this work the oxidation of mn2 ions by o2 was further verified by the release of more mn2 ions in the presence of sod under uv light fig s11 after five cycles of reuse the transformation of a part of ferrihydrite to goethite could be primarily attributed to the effect of released fe2 ferrihydrite is a metastable iron oxide and fe2 can induce the transformation of ferrihydrite to more stable iron oxides such as goethite and lepidocrocite through the lmct process shu et al 2019 a total as removal efficiency of 99 1 under uv light could still be retained after five cycles of reuse at a high as concentration of 1000 μg l 1 which is significantly higher than that under darkness and that of fe ti mn and fe cu mn ternary composite oxides cai et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 the high retention rate of as removal efficiency during reuse of fmo may be ascribed to the high photochemical activity and adsorption ability of goethite for as v bhandari et al 2012 therefore light radiation can improve the as iii removal performance and reusability of fmo 4 3 environmental implications drinking water pollution by as mostly occurs in developing countries and regions in southern asia over the world mihajlov et al 2020 podgorski and berg 2020 some techniques including membrane filtration ion exchange modified coagulation filtration enhanced lime softening and reverse osmosis for as iii removal from drinking water are recommended by the united states environmental protection agency however these techniques have not been widely used in developing countries due to their complex processing system or high energy consumption berg et al 2006 adsorption with natural and locally available adsorbents has been considered as a sustainable technology for as iii removal from drinking water for low income and remote rural areas canas kurz et al 2021 fmo has the advantages of rich raw materials environmental friendliness and low cost however the mn2 ions released during as iii removal can decrease the oxidation capacity and stability of fmo cai et al 2022 gude et al 2017 owings et al 2019 shan and tong 2013 it remains a challenge to improve the oxidation capacity and stability of fmo using facile and low cost methods this work shows that o2 produced on manganese oxide and the lmct in iron oxide as iii complex under sunlight can effectively improve the removal capacity and reusability of fmo for as iii contributing to a rapid decrease in total as concentrations to below 10 μg l 1 in order to further investigate the applicability of the photochemical removal of as iii by fmo the 50 ml of naoh solution was reused for as desorption during the regeneration of fmo after three cycles of reuse of fmo under uv light the total as removal efficiency was still maintained at 99 7 these results indicated the water recovery ratio can be improved through the reuse of naoh solution therefore fmo has promising application prospects in the photochemical removal of as iii from drinking water 5 conclusions light radiation can effectively improve the as iii oxidation and removal from aqueous solutions by fmo as well as alleviate the reduction of manganese oxide which can significantly enhance the practicality of fmo under sunlight the total as can be rapidly removed with the concentration decreasing to below 10 μg l 1 by fmo in 1000 μg l 1 as iii containing solution within 60 min which is acceptable in drinking water according to who under light radiation the ros 1o2 oh o2 and so4 are generated and o2 contributes considerably to the enhancement of as iii oxidation and alleviation of manganese oxide reduction o2 is mainly produced from the reaction between o2 and ecb generated on light excited manganese oxide although o2 cannot be formed on ferrihydrite through the reduction of o2 by ecb due to its limited cb potential as iii oxidation may also be promoted by the lmct process in the ferrihydrite as iii complex coexisting so4 2 and ca2 exhibit little effect on as iii oxidation and removal fmo can be reused through the desorption of as with naoh solution and the as removal efficiency can reach as high as 99 1 after five cycles of reuse under uv light the present work expands the environmental application of fmo and provides an alternative low cost and efficient method for as iii detoxication in

15406,cyanobacteria and their toxic secondary metabolites present challenges for water treatment globally in this study we have assessed tio2 immobilized onto recycled foamed glass beads by a facile calcination method combined in treatment units with 365 nm uv leds the treatment system was deployed in mesocosms within a eutrophic brazilian drinking water reservoir the treatment units were deployed for 7 days and suppressed cyanobacterial abundance by 85 while at the same time enhancing other water quality parameters turbidity and transparency improved by 40 and 81 respectively genomic analysis of the microbiota in the treated mesocosms revealed that the composition of the cyanobacterial community was affected and the abundance of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria increased during cyanobacterial suppression the effect of the treatment on zooplankton and other eukaryotes was also monitored the abundance of zooplankton decreased while chrysophyte and alveolata loadings increased

events called blooms paerl and huisman 2008 cyanobacterial blooms present significant challenges to the water treatment sector globally due to the potentially toxic cellular biomass in raw waters hitzfeld et al 2000 zamyadi et al 2012 modifying and upgrading existing infrastructure is often impractical and prohibitively costly to counter the challenge posed by increased cyanobacterial blooms a paradigm shift to in reservoir pre treatment could be considered as an alternative treatment option with targeted treatment of cyanobacteria and their toxins in the raw water prior to abstraction can ease the burden on existing water treatment plant wtp infrastructure promising technologies for in reservoir pre treatment include advanced oxidation processes aops camacho muñoz et al 2020 huang et al 2011 li et al 2017 menezes et al 2021 aops are chemical processes that generate highly reactive oxidative species radicals that can remove organic contaminants the application of chemical oxidants as algaecides e g kmno4 h2o2 clo2 has been explored previously with limited success fan et al 2014 2013 usually biomass removal occurs upon the application of chemical oxidants which is desirable however the reduction in cell density goes hand in hand with the release of intracellular cyanotoxins a promising aop for the removal of cyanobacterial cells and their toxins is semiconductor

quality the tio2 based photocatalysis treatment system placed in mesocosms in a eutrophic reservoir in brazil significantly affected bacterioplankton dynamics when compared to the control p 0 001 f 3 90 over time p 0 0001 f 8 25 according to permanova analysis nmds ordination provides a clear distribution opposing control and treatment conditions mainly for the day 7 fig s1 following treatment using tio2 photocatalysis the relative abundance of the cyanobacteria decreased in the treatment mesocosms compared to the control mesocosms fig 2 initially the bacterioplankton composition was dominated by cyanobacteria with 45 relative abundance on average and members of bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and proteobacteria contributed as major other phyla fig 2b after three days the relative abundance of cyanobacteria decreased to about 33 35 fig 2 and table s3 the most pronounced effect of the treatment was observed on day 7 when the cyanobacterial contribution decreased to less than 5 on average in the mesocosms where the photocatalytic units had been deployed while it represented approximately 25 in the control this selective removal of cyanobacteria by ros based treatment methods has been described previously and is linked to the internal structure of cyanobacteria and the co action of irradiation induced intracellular ros generation drábková et al 2007 specifically the photosynthetic apparatus in cyanobacteria is not segregated into organelles and has direct connection with the plasma membrane of the cell thus making it more susceptible to ros attack grossman et al 1995 and the cyanobacterial light harvesting complex the phycobilisome is located outside of the thylakoidal membrane thus making it more susceptible to external ros attack grossman et al 1995 cyanobacteria have also been shown to be sensitive to ros attack due to having a limited enzymatic defense mechanism lacking the common ros eliminating ascorbate peroxidase passardi et al 2007 and most species further lacking alternative members of the haem peroxidase family of ros defense enzymes bernroitner et al 2009 further it has been shown that irradiation induced intercellular generation of ros by the mehler reaction can overwhelm the internal enzymatic ros defense mechanisms under increased irradiation levels such a those presented by the uv irradiation provided by the photocatalytic reactors in the current study tytler et al 1984 additionally it has been demonstrated that the phycocyanin pigment which is unique to cyanobacteria can enhance photocatalytically generated ros attacks robertson et al 1998b the combination of these effects is responsible for the selective sensitivity of cyanobacteria to the proposed treatment system planctomycetes abundance also decreased following photocatalytic treatment compared to controls in contrast bacteroidetes increased its abundance from 14 in the control to 35 on average following photocatalytic treatment and proteobacteria increased in abundance from 12 in the control condition to 24 with photocatalytic treatment fig 2 and table s3 using different loadings of tio2 nanoparticles 15 100 and 1000 mg l 1 in samples from three different swedish lakes farkas et al 2015 observed a high impact on the bacterial community in a dose dependent manner considering their abundance and activity which was estimated by the incorporation of radioactive labeled l 4 5 3h leucine they also reported that the light regime considering the uv and par photosynthetically active radiation sources compared to the dark condition contributed to the decrease on bacterial activity mainly from the highest concentration of tio2 nanoparticles moreover the authors observed that tio2 effects on bacterial abundance and activity were stronger in lakes with high dissolved organic carbon doc and low chemical elements concentrations however they did not investigate any modification on bacterioplankton composition in our findings lefse analysis identified the most important taxa considering cyanobacteria and non cyanobacteria that contributed to the differential abundance between treatment and control p 0 05 fig s2 using a lda threshold of 3 5 we selected 38 genera that reflected the effect of tio2 on the 7th day including 18 resistant and 20 susceptible taxa we observed that the main susceptible organisms besides cyanobacteria were unclassified taxa from phycisphaeraceae cl500 3 and methylacidiphilaceae families sphingobacteriales order as well as the genus terrimicrobium compared to the control condition fig 3 a d the resistant taxa flectobacillus asinibacterium prosthecobacter and armatimonas contributed to about 60 of the bacterioplankton community in the treatment mesocosms fig 3e h the application of tio2 photocatalysis represents a continuous low level treatment with a steady production of reactive oxigen species ros compared to the addition of oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide that are dosed at a set concentration with an almost immediate albeit short lived effect this is clearly demonstrated when comparing our previous study santos et al 2021 investigating the application of hydrogen peroxide in mesocosms to the current one in this study photocatalytic treatment showed a marked decrease in the cyanobacterial phytoplankton portion between days 3 and 7 of the treatment compared to a marked decrease for cyanobacteria after 24 h for the hydrogen peroxide study conducted in the same reservoir apart from cyanobacteria other susceptible taxa were identified as heterotrophic members of the phycisphaeraceae family planctomycetes this appears reasonable as this family has been described as directly related with cyanobacterial taxa in marine synechococcus and freshwater systems microcystis chun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 explaining their simultaneous decrease in relative abundance fig 3 additionally terrimicrobium terrimicrobiaceae identified in the current study as susceptible to the treatment process was also identified as vulnerable after h2o2 treatment in this same reservoir santos et al 2021 flectobacillus asinibacterium prosthecobacter and armatimonas were identified as resistant taxa in the current study fig 3e h increasing in relative abundance as the cyanobacterial and other susceptible taxa abundance decreased in the treatment mesocosms reasons for resistance against ros attack could be an increased production of carotenoids as observed by asker et al 2012 for flectobacillus in a radioactively impacted region in japan asker et al 2012 and others martínez laborda et al 1990 stafsnes et al 2010 proposed that carotenoids were able to quench ros produced by uv irradiation and photo oxidation besides the production of pigments such as high carotenoid contents the protection against ros may be due to the efficient enzymatic activities for reducing the oxidative damage slade and radman 2011 takebe et al 2007 the resistance tolerance to ros attack allows taxa to capitalize on resource availability or reduced competition litchman et al 2015 explaining the marked increase of the aforementioned resistant taxa in the treatment mesocosms as mentioned earlier cyanobacteria dominated both bacterioplankton and phytoplankton which was also observed by other authors for the same and similar reservoirs dokulil and teubner 2000 guedes et al 2018 liu et al 2019 focusing on the genus level 40 genera were observed consisting of cyanobacteria 18 chlorophyta 11 bacillariophyta 5 charophyta 3 euglenozoa 2 cryptophyta 1 and ochrophyta 1 table s6 cyanobacteria reached approximately 98 of the total phytoplankton with a density of around 106 cell ml 1 in both control and treatment conditions the composition of the observed cyanobacteria genera originally composed mainly of planktothrix agardhii raphidiopsis raciborskii pseudoanabaena sp and pseudolyngbya sp was modified by the treatment within the cyanobacteria grouping a dominance of planktothrix and raphidiopsis in the original community 32 and 28 respectively fig 2a was observed additionally 10 picocyanobacteria including cyanobium synechococcus and synechocystis sphaeropermopsis prochlorothrix microcystis and an unclassified genus of leptolyngbyaceae fig 2a were detected on day 3 of the experiment raphidiopsis presented a higher abundance than at t0 while planktothrix decreased in abundance in both conditions following the decrease of cyanobacterial abundance by the 7th day planktothrix 61 presented the highest relative contribution of cyanobacteria compared to the other sampling times and to the control we also detected a higher resistance of planktothrix compared to the other cyanobacteria genera fig 2a santos et al 2021 monitored cyanobacteria by pigment fluorescence and the bacterioplankton composition 16s rrna sequencing after applying 10 mg l 1 h2o2 to a mesocosm system in the same drinking water reservoir cyanobacteria originally composed of planktothrix sp raphidiopsis sp microcystis sp and cyanobium sp were suppressed for 5 days after a single application of h2o2 non filamentous cyanobacteria were most resistant against h2o2 while planktothrix sp was markedly affected throughout the treatment interestingly unlike the results presented here thus in both mesocosm studies planktothrix sp and raphidiopsis sp dominated the initial cyanobacterial community but although both h2o2 and tio2 uv produce ros they affected the cyanobacterial community differently however there is no clear evidence that supports different pattern of interspecific resistance sensitivity mainly for raphidiopsis sp and planktothrix sp considering specific ros for treatment purposes this aspect should be further explored since both cyanobacterial genera have shown a co dominance along with dolichospermum sp in drinking water reservoirs mainly in the brazilian semi arid region barros et al 2019 clemente et al 2020 pestana et al 2019 santos et al 2021 interestingly in h2o2 studies at lab scale yang et al 2018 evidenced similar values for effective concentration ec50 of h2o2 that inhibit the growth of planktothrix 0 42 mg l 1 and raphidiopsis 0 32 mg l 1 as well as damage to the photosynthetic apparatus whereas non filamentous microcystis presented higher resistance the diverse composition of other cyanobacterial taxa and the bacterioplankton community in each case may have affected the different outcomes in terms of competitive or synergistic interactions and succession more detailed information on the genomics data is provided in the supplementary information figs s2 and s3 as well as tables s4 and s5 physico chemical parameters representing water quality markedly improved over the course of the study in the treated mesocosms versus the control mesocosms table 1 transparency almost doubled on average in the treatment mesocosms while turbidity practically halved which is logical as both parameters are inversely related this observation was confirmed by pca analysis which identified ph total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc dissolved oxygen turbidity and transparency as the most relevant physico chemical variables fig s3 the ph was directly proportional to the variables toc and doc the highest values of transparency were associated with the lowest values of turbidity and dissolved oxygen this trend for turbidity and transparency was also observed in our previous study with solar irradiation and hydrogen peroxide 10 mg l 1 applied in the same reservoir santos et al 2021 increased transparency represents an improvement in the water quality both for treatment purposes and from an ecological perspective the fact that the tio2 photocatalysis applied here reduced the turbidity and increased the transparency means it improved its own performances for the treatment purposes its effective capability for these physical aspects should be emphasized sinceorganic particles initially competed with bacteria for ros and for the photoactive sites of the tio2 furthermore suspended particles reduced light penetration through the water by dispersion by reducing these effects the treatment became more effective which could be a possible explanation for the lag time in observable effects of the treatment on the phytoplankton communities before day 7 ecologically greater transparency means light can penetrate deeper into the water column thus expanding the euphotic zone and generating oxygen in deeper zone of the reservoir additionally eukaryotic phytoplankton can take better advantage of light penetration growing faster and bringing new stability to the water system a reduction of the dissolved oxygen concentration was observed throughout the experiment which may have been caused by two mechanisms the action of the oxidative process promoted in the treatment reactors and the water retention inside the mesocosms the latter reduces the mixing processes of the water column thus influencing its stratification båmstedt and larsson 2018 the depth of the mesocosms in the current study 1 5 m is comparable to shallow areas within reservoirs or reservoirs that experience water shortage and are only fractionally filled this combined with the fact that the experiment took place during the time of year with traditionally high temperatures the current mesocosm design could favor weak thermal stratification inside the system comparable to most reservoirs in the brazilian semi arid region marques et al 2019 regarding the doc concentration values remained close to the control at t0 and day 3 with no major changes observed the concentrations of toc followed a similar trend as that observed for doc toc results showed little significant differences in most experimental times after exposure to the photocatalysis there was no modification of nutrient or salt ion concentrations over time as would be expected supplementary information s4 table s6 fig s4 the continuing presence of nutrients could theoretically favor regrowth of the cyanobacteria which is why it is important to bear in mind that the current system is designed to be continually operating and treating the reservoir it is not designed to prevent the formation of blooms by nutrient control but by population control 3 2 effect of tio2 photocatalysis on the eukaryotic plankton community combined with the marked effects on the bacterioplankton community in the reservoir the tio2 uv treatment significantly affected the eukaryotic plankton community in general p 0 0049 f 3 21 according to permanova when compared to the control over time p 0 0001 f 6 73 especially for the zooplankton community nmds ordination provides a clear distribution opposing control and treatment conditions mainly for the day 7 fig s1 while little change was observed at day 3 on day 7 of the treatment the zooplankton community decreased from around 61 of the total eukaryotic plankton community to less than 5 fig 4 originally the community was rich in zooplankton followed by the diatom and alveolate groups which together accounted for over 75 of the eukaryotic plankton community fig 4 the arthropoda subclass copepoda was the main component of zooplankton accounting for 50 on average table s7 with calanoida and cyclopoida as the main taxa in this group table s3 diatoms contributed 13 of the total eukaryotic plankton community including fragilariales as the major group 10 of diatom alveolate represented 6 of the total eukaryotic plankton community with dinoflagellata as the main representative 4 of alveolate fig 4 table s7 on day 3 there was no clear evidence of compositional changes except for an increase in the abundance of an unclassified member of eukarya and a decrease in the diatom group to 7 on average although this occurred in both conditions fig 4 and table s7 on day 7 the relative abundance of zooplankton decreased by more than 95 on average fig 4 and table s7 whereas chrysophyte increased to about 41 compared to its low abundance at the start of the experiment and in the control condition on day 7 0 5 1 the decrease in the relative abundance of zooplankton components may be a direct effect of the oxidizing treatment or a secondary effect due to changes in the phytoplankton community composition mainly linked to the modification of cyanobacterial dynamics where planktothrix dominated the cyanobacteria community compared to the original distribution at t0 and the control condition where raphidiopsis pseudoanabaena and pseudolyngbya were more prevalent fig 2a different zooplankton species have different preferred target food species tõnno et al 2016 however it stands to reason that in a biome that is so strongly dominated by cyanobacteria as is the current study site a large portion of the zooplankton grazes on cyanobacteria as preferred food source thus a possible explanation of the marked decrease of the zooplankton abundancy is that due to the reduction of cyanobacterial abundance an important food source for zooplankton was removed leading to the zooplankton reduction a detailed investigation of the zooplankton species present in the reservoir and an investigation of their feeding behavior would clarify these possibilities but was out with the scope of the current study within chrysophyte the taxa chromulinales 12 chrysophyceae 10 and ochromonadales 19 family order presented the highest increase in contribution table s6 suggesting resistance to the treatment interestingly the chrysophyte also referred to as golden brown algae presented an increase in the treated mesocosms which is unlikely as was observed for the effect of h2o2 in different studies where the treatment promoted the growth of green algae when applied to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms fan et al 2019 santos et al 2021 yang et al 2018 an unclassified member of eukarya increased to 22 in the treatment compared to 5 in the control condition although less abundant alveolate also increased in abundance at this time members of the family perkinsidae reached about 8 of relative contribution compared to t0 or the control condition 1 table s7 following this pronounced modification on day 7 lefse analysis identified the most important eukaryote taxa contributing to the observed effect p 0 05 fig s2b using the lda 3 5 threshold we detected a lower number of taxa that distinguished the tio2 based photocatalysis treatment and the control condition where resistant and susceptible components included 11 and 8 taxa respectively besides calanoida and cyclopoida organisms we observed the zooplankton ploimida rotifera and the fungi catenaria blastocladyales as susceptible organisms fig 5 a d these four taxa represented about 60 of the original eukaryote community which was considerably diminished on day 7 in the resistant group with the highest lda scores in the tio2 treatment we identified ochromonas ochrophyta chrysophyceae uncl unclassified poteriospumella chrysophyte and nuclearia gastrotricha figs 5e h and s2b ochromonas poteriospumella and nuclearia did not present significant abundance at any sampling time except for day 7 of the treatment condition when their abundances rose to 15 and 6 7 respectively indicating a resistance to the tio2 based photocatalysis fig 5e g and h respectively following that poteriospumella and ochromonas genera from the chrysophyte were the most relevant taxa to increase in abundance throughout the photocatalytic treatment the antioxidant activity from both chrysophyte genera is unclear and any report that could explain this specific response against ros could not be found however it is known that other chrysophyte species from marine environment present a pronounced ability to produce lipopolysaccharide and carotenoids such as fucoxanthin which produces a high antioxidant response considering both ros quenching as well as photo damage protection méresse et al 2020 sun et al 2014 the increased abundance of this group in the treatment conditions may be linked to an intrinsic resistance or can reflect the impact on the microbial plankton community composition including the decrease of the originally dominant cyanobacteria and zooplankton also these organisms could have taken advantage of the altered abiotic environmental conditions that occurred as a result of the treatment e g increased light availability due to a decrease in turbidity and increase in transparency although these organisms are mixotrophic they present a pronounced heterotrophy activity with limited use of light as energy source graupner et al 2018 for example in north america lakes chrysophyte species are commonly found in oligo and mesotrophic environments where their competitive ability in phosphorous limitation allows them to dominate the planktonic community over other algae nicholls and wujek 2003 although we did not observe any change in nutrient content this group could dominate the eukaryote community due to other factors besides microbial composition such as doc dynamics their mixotrophic characteristics as well as the increased light availability in the photocatalytic system interestingly ochromonas have been identified as microcystis grazers and a microcystin cyanotoxin degrader after an ultrasound assisted process was used at lab scale to estimate its application for water cleaning and cyanobacteria controlling zhang et al 2021 2018 alternatively the treatment could stimulate an indirect control of cyanobacteria and a potential microcystin degradation by promoting an increase in ochromonas abundance this fact indicates the importance of investigating the ecological role of microbial communities resistant to alternative treatments and their capacity for degrading diverse toxic compounds that may be released after treatment 3 3 relationship between biotic and abiotic parameters in this study we tested for correlation between relevant abiotic parameters affected by the treatment and selected taxa corresponding to the susceptible or resistant bacterial and eukaryotic taxa high lda scores according to the lefse analysis at t7 including the main cyanobacterial genera observed in 16s rrna data we used a canonical correspondence analysis cca coupled to spearman correlation p 0 05 fig 6 and table s8 for the bacterioplankton the cca ordination had the total variation of data explained by the two main axes 82 and 14 respectively with a significant p value for their eigenvalues p 0 01 and 0 02 respectively a strict relationship was observed between turbidity and all cyanobacterial genera sharing the same dimensional quadrant which considered all sampling times for the control condition including t0 fig 6a in which cyanobacteria maintained high relative abundance this was confirmed by the spearman analysis showing a significant positive correlation between turbidity and cyanobacteria with high r values for planktothrix and microcystis r 0 67 for both as well as raphidiopsis and sphaerospermospsis r 0 54 for both table s8 for transparency microcystis presented a significant negative correlation r 0 61 as well as cyanobium and nodosilinea r 0 60 and 0 66 respectively the resistant bacteria asinibacterium and prosthecobacter presented significant negative correlations with turbidity r 0 74 and 0 45 respectively and a positive correlation with transparency r 0 57 and 0 44 respectively the association between cyanobacterial dynamics and the improvement of turbidity and transparency was previously observed from the use of h2o2 in gavião reservoir santos et al 2021 where the chlorophyll content of these organisms decreased over time simultaneously with an increase in transparency other abiotic parameters such as dissolved oxygen and ph also presented a positive correlation with susceptible cyanobacterial genera and negative correlations with resistant bacteria for dissolved oxygen the correlation was significant for microcystis r 0 51 planktothrix r 0 50 and sphaerospermopsis r 0 53 and for the resistant asinibacterium r 0 55 and prosthecobacter r 0 46 for ph significant correlations were found for the cyanobacteria leptolyngbyaceae uncl r 0 68 prochlorothrix r 0 50 and raphidiopsis r 0 44 and for the resistant taxa flectobacillus r 0 51 fig 6a and table s7 organic carbon content toc and doc presented negative correlation with the cyanobacteria cyanobium and microcystis r 0 45 and 0 53 respectively and with the heterotrophic bacteria cl500 3 and ld29 r 0 47 and 0 58 respectively whereas prosthecobacter a resistant bacterium showed positive correlation with toc and doc r 0 61 and 0 49 respectively table s8 this relationship between toc doc and bacteria among cyanobacteria and heterotrophic ones could be associated to the photodegradation and lysis of susceptible cyanobacteria while other bacteria could be involved in the biodegradation of intracellular products released to the water huang et al 2017 ye et al 2015 farkas et al 2015 observed a strict relationship between the tio2 nanoparticles and organic carbon affecting the bacterial community where lakes with higher concentrations of doc and lower chemical element concentrations presented a significant reduction of bacterial abundance and activity although we identified a positive correlation between some resistant taxa among bacteria and eukaryote and doc we could not establish the influence of carbon on the treatment efficiency in the eukaryotic community cca showed a discrete ordination of taxa and abiotic parameters with fewer relationships when compared to the bacterioplankton fig 6b the two main axes explained the total variation of data contributing with 69 and 21 respectively and significant p values p 0 002 and 0 1 respectively cyclopoida was the only susceptible taxon located opposite transparency topresent a negative correlation with this parameter r 0 54 in contrast the resistant ochromonas poteriospumella and nuclearia were located close to transparency in the opposite quadrant fig 6b ochromonas r 0 58 and nuclearia r 0 55 were positively correlated with transparency whereas poteriospumella was negatively correlated with turbidity r 0 44 ochromonas and nuclearia also showed positive correlation with toc and doc r 0 47 and 0 58 respectively for ochromonas and r 0 55 and 0 53 respectively for nuclearia table s8 3 4 in situ application of tio2 based photocatalysis for over twenty five years the potential of tio2 photocatalysis as a promising technology for the control of cyanobacteria and their toxins has been described in the literature lawton et al 1999 robertson et al 1997 1998a much of the work however has involved lab scale applications with only a small number of reports detailing pilot scale reactor studies menezes et al 2021 pestana et al 2014 consequently much of the work reported has been at lower technology readiness levels trls between 1 and 3 to move this technology further up the trl scale larger scale applications capable of treating cubic meter quantities of water will need to be demonstrated in this paper for the first time the technology has been demonstrated to be a feasible in situ treatment step capable of larger scale water treatment hence moving the photocatalytic process up the trl scale from four to five it is envisioned that continuous or as needed treatment with the proposed system adjacent to the wtp abstraction point could ease the cyanobacterial burden on the treatment plant the removal of cyanobacteria and the intrinsic improvement of water quality could significantly decrease the need for treatment chemicals which is economically and environmentally favorable the exact number of treatment units required would be determined on a case by case basis dependent on local conditions and incoming raw water quality cyanobacterial load considerations of the potential inherent cost of the deployment system can be found in the supplementary information s8 previous work has clearly demonstrated that the proposed technology can remove both cyanobacteria and dissolved cyanotoxins gunaratne et al 2020 pestana et al 2020c this markedly decreases the public health dangers posed by toxic cyanobacterial blooms and could potentially also mitigate the effects of cyanobacteriogenic taste and odor episodes as the removal of taste and odor compounds by tio2 photocatalysis has described before pestana et al 2014 2020b post treatment testing has demonstrated that the coating on the beads is stable figs s5 and s6 it was observed that iron and manganese were incorporated into the elemental composition of the tio2 coated beads which is most likely from components of the treatment unit the photocatalytic efficiency of the used beads was tested against methylene blue in the laboratory fig s7 and a 20 drop in removal efficiency was observed most likely due to the aforementioned contamination with fe and mn for future iterations of this treatment system materials will have to be carefully selected to avoid affecting the photocatalytic efficiency in the current study we observed alterations in the phyto and zooplankton communities as a result of the photocatalytic treatment whether any changes would affect the microbial community in a water body the size of a drinking water reservoir would have to be carefully examined in due course it is worth bearing in mind however that any type of intervention e g limiting nutrient input or application of broad spectrum algaecides will have a knock on effect on the micro biosphere of a water body and will have to be carefully evaluated to balance the desired effects a potential additional area of concern is the effect of the treatment on disinfection by product formation the effect of the tio2 photocatalysis in this regard will have to be carefully monitored and coordinated with carefully dialed in treatment conditions in the disinfection step furthermore as the treatment solution presented here is designed to be operated continuously the danger of re growth of undesirable species is low compared to periodic treatments such as the application of algaecides or h2o2 in the future it would be desirable to power the lighting array with renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic or wind power depending on the local climatic conditions a promising approach would be the deployment of floating photovoltaic units that feed a battery system allowing for 24 h operation of the photocatalytic units an additional advantage of the application of floating photovoltaic units would be the shading of the underlying water further limiting cyanobacterial growth although the environmental impact of the use of photovoltaic units would have to be assessed against the benefits of their employment farrell et al 2020 the application of the treatment units is not limited to the reservoir alone while it is envisaged that this will be the main deployment point deployment in settling tanks or on top of filter units within the conventional water treatment unit processes could unlock further potential to polish water and decrease treatment costs by increasing filter life and decreasing the demand for chemical disinfection 4 conclusion to ultimately ease the burden on water treatment plants an innovative tio2 uv led reactor system was tested at mesocosm scale within seven days cyanobacterial abundance was reduced by 85 and water quality parameters like transparency and turbidity improved markedly the current study represents a move towards bridging the gap between decades of academic laboratory based research towards real life deployment of the technology pushing the trl further up the scale the proposed photocatalytic system aims to be sustainable with readily available and recycled constituent parts off the shelve components were used to construct the reactor system complimented by a facile photocatalyst deposition method onto beads made from post consumer glass while the treatment units were powered by mains power in the current study there is scope to utilize renewable energy systems to further enhance the sustainability aspect due to the flexibility the system offers reactor length could be increased or decreased as required other applications can be envisaged including deployment on top of filters within conventional water treatment plants as well as a polishing technology of product water and within product water storage areas for future research include full lake trials long term effect on the ecosystem life cycle analysis and techno economic assessment to further push the treatment system up the trl scale to conclude we have for the first time demonstrated practical application of tio2 based photocatalysis at mesocosm scale under environmental conditions allowing future development of in situ treatment for the reduction of cyanobacteria and their toxins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

calcination method combined in treatment units with 365 nm uv leds the treatment system was deployed in mesocosms within a eutrophic brazilian drinking water reservoir the treatment units were deployed for 7 days and suppressed cyanobacterial abundance by 85 while at the same time enhancing other water quality parameters turbidity and transparency improved by 40 and 81 respectively genomic analysis of the microbiota in the treated mesocosms revealed that the composition of the cyanobacterial community was affected and the abundance of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria increased during cyanobacterial suppression the effect of the treatment on zooplankton and other eukaryotes was also monitored the abundance of zooplankton decreased while chrysophyte and alveolata loadings increased

on request 1 introduction climate change and anthropogenically driven hyper eutrophication of surface drinking waters lead to an increase in frequency and severity of cyanobacterial mass occurrence events called blooms paerl and huisman 2008 cyanobacterial blooms present significant challenges to the water treatment sector globally due to the potentially toxic cellular biomass in raw waters hitzfeld et al 2000 zamyadi et al 2012 modifying and upgrading existing infrastructure is often impractical and prohibitively costly to counter the challenge posed by increased cyanobacterial blooms a paradigm shift to in reservoir pre treatment could be considered as an alternative treatment option with targeted treatment of cyanobacteria and their toxins in the raw water prior to abstraction can ease the burden on existing water treatment plant wtp infrastructure promising technologies for in reservoir pre treatment include advanced oxidation processes aops camacho muñoz et al 2020 huang et al 2011 li et al 2017 menezes et al 2021 aops are chemical processes that generate highly reactive oxidative species radicals that can remove organic contaminants the application of chemical oxidants as algaecides e g kmno4 h2o2 clo2 has been explored previously with limited success fan et al 2014 2013 usually biomass removal occurs upon the application of chemical oxidants which is desirable however the reduction in cell density goes hand in hand with the release of intracellular cyanotoxins a promising aop for the removal of cyanobacterial cells and their toxins is semiconductor photocatalysis tio2 is a semiconductor catalyst that upon incident of ultraviolet uv irradiation of 387 nm can generate hydroxyl oh and superoxide anion o2 radicals via redox reactions on the surface

liu et al 2003 robertson et al 1998a the deployment of nano particulate tio2 photocatalysis in water treatment plants to date has been limited by the lack of validation of bench scale studies at pilot and industrial scale loeb et al 2019 the main underlying factors of the limited pilot full scale evaluation have been designing and testing of suitable photocatalytic treatment units that move the technology readiness level trl up the scale in the current study we have made progress addressing the technology transfer from bench scale testing towards implantation of the technology for water treatment by immobilizing tio2 nanoparticles onto beads made from foamed recycled glass and using a low energy waterproof uv led lighting system for deployment at mesocosm scale in previous studies we have demonstrated the efficacy of the tio2 coated beads in controlling cyanobacteria and their toxins at bench scale gunaratne et al 2020 pestana et al 2020c 2020a and at pilot scale menezes et al 2021 this investigation evaluates the removal of cyanobacteria in a mesocosm study within an operating drinking water reservoir in the northeast of brazil that suffers from perennial cyanobacterial

quality the tio2 based photocatalysis treatment system placed in mesocosms in a eutrophic reservoir in brazil significantly affected bacterioplankton dynamics when compared to the control p 0 001 f 3 90 over time p 0 0001 f 8 25 according to permanova analysis nmds ordination provides a clear distribution opposing control and treatment conditions mainly for the day 7 fig s1 following treatment using tio2 photocatalysis the relative abundance of the cyanobacteria decreased in the treatment mesocosms compared to the control mesocosms fig 2 initially the bacterioplankton composition was dominated by cyanobacteria with 45 relative abundance on average and members of bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and proteobacteria contributed as major other phyla fig 2b after three days the relative abundance of cyanobacteria decreased to about 33 35 fig 2 and table s3 the most pronounced effect of the treatment was observed on day 7 when the cyanobacterial contribution decreased to less than 5 on average in the mesocosms where the photocatalytic units had been deployed while it represented approximately 25 in the control this selective removal of cyanobacteria by ros based treatment methods has been described previously and is linked to the internal structure of cyanobacteria and the co action of irradiation induced intracellular ros generation drábková et al 2007 specifically the photosynthetic apparatus in cyanobacteria is not segregated into organelles and has direct connection with the plasma membrane of the cell thus making it more susceptible to ros attack grossman et al 1995 and the cyanobacterial light harvesting complex the phycobilisome is located outside of the thylakoidal membrane thus making it more susceptible to external ros attack grossman et al 1995 cyanobacteria have also been shown to be sensitive to ros attack due to having a limited enzymatic defense mechanism lacking the common ros eliminating ascorbate peroxidase passardi et al 2007 and most species further lacking alternative members of the haem peroxidase family of ros defense enzymes bernroitner et al 2009 further it has been shown that irradiation induced intercellular generation of ros by the mehler reaction can overwhelm the internal enzymatic ros defense mechanisms under increased irradiation levels such a those presented by the uv irradiation provided by the photocatalytic reactors in the current study tytler et al 1984 additionally it has been demonstrated that the phycocyanin pigment which is unique to cyanobacteria can enhance photocatalytically generated ros attacks robertson et al 1998b the combination of these effects is responsible for the selective sensitivity of cyanobacteria to the proposed treatment system planctomycetes abundance also decreased following photocatalytic treatment compared to controls in contrast bacteroidetes increased its abundance from 14 in the control to 35 on average following photocatalytic treatment and proteobacteria increased in abundance from 12 in the control condition to 24 with photocatalytic treatment fig 2 and table s3 using different loadings of tio2 nanoparticles 15 100 and 1000 mg l 1 in samples from three different swedish lakes farkas et al 2015 observed a high impact on the bacterial community in a dose dependent manner considering their abundance and activity which was estimated by the incorporation of radioactive labeled l 4 5 3h leucine they also reported that the light regime considering the uv and par photosynthetically active radiation sources compared to the dark condition contributed to the decrease on bacterial activity mainly from the highest concentration of tio2 nanoparticles moreover the authors observed that tio2 effects on bacterial abundance and activity were stronger in lakes with high dissolved organic carbon doc and low chemical elements concentrations however they did not investigate any modification on bacterioplankton composition in our findings lefse analysis identified the most important taxa considering cyanobacteria and non cyanobacteria that contributed to the differential abundance between treatment and control p 0 05 fig s2 using a lda threshold of 3 5 we selected 38 genera that reflected the effect of tio2 on the 7th day including 18 resistant and 20 susceptible taxa we observed that the main susceptible organisms besides cyanobacteria were unclassified taxa from phycisphaeraceae cl500 3 and methylacidiphilaceae families sphingobacteriales order as well as the genus terrimicrobium compared to the control condition fig 3 a d the resistant taxa flectobacillus asinibacterium prosthecobacter and armatimonas contributed to about 60 of the bacterioplankton community in the treatment mesocosms fig 3e h the application of tio2 photocatalysis represents a continuous low level treatment with a steady production of reactive oxigen species ros compared to the addition of oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide that are dosed at a set concentration with an almost immediate albeit short lived effect this is clearly demonstrated when comparing our previous study santos et al 2021 investigating the application of hydrogen peroxide in mesocosms to the current one in this study photocatalytic treatment showed a marked decrease in the cyanobacterial phytoplankton portion between days 3 and 7 of the treatment compared to a marked decrease for cyanobacteria after 24 h for the hydrogen peroxide study conducted in the same reservoir apart from cyanobacteria other susceptible taxa were identified as heterotrophic members of the phycisphaeraceae family planctomycetes this appears reasonable as this family has been described as directly related with cyanobacterial taxa in marine synechococcus and freshwater systems microcystis chun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 explaining their simultaneous decrease in relative abundance fig 3 additionally terrimicrobium terrimicrobiaceae identified in the current study as susceptible to the treatment process was also identified as vulnerable after h2o2 treatment in this same reservoir santos et al 2021 flectobacillus asinibacterium prosthecobacter and armatimonas were identified as resistant taxa in the current study fig 3e h increasing in relative abundance as the cyanobacterial and other susceptible taxa abundance decreased in the treatment mesocosms reasons for resistance against ros attack could be an increased production of carotenoids as observed by asker et al 2012 for flectobacillus in a radioactively impacted region in japan asker et al 2012 and others martínez laborda et al 1990 stafsnes et al 2010 proposed that carotenoids were able to quench ros produced by uv irradiation and photo oxidation besides the production of pigments such as high carotenoid contents the protection against ros may be due to the efficient enzymatic activities for reducing the oxidative damage slade and radman 2011 takebe et al 2007 the resistance tolerance to ros attack allows taxa to capitalize on resource availability or reduced competition litchman et al 2015 explaining the marked increase of the aforementioned resistant taxa in the treatment mesocosms as mentioned earlier cyanobacteria dominated both bacterioplankton and phytoplankton which was also observed by other authors for the same and similar reservoirs dokulil and teubner 2000 guedes et al 2018 liu et al 2019 focusing on the genus level 40 genera were observed consisting of cyanobacteria 18 chlorophyta 11 bacillariophyta 5 charophyta 3 euglenozoa 2 cryptophyta 1 and ochrophyta 1 table s6 cyanobacteria reached approximately 98 of the total phytoplankton with a density of around 106 cell ml 1 in both control and treatment conditions the composition of the observed cyanobacteria genera originally composed mainly of planktothrix agardhii raphidiopsis raciborskii pseudoanabaena sp and pseudolyngbya sp was modified by the treatment within the cyanobacteria grouping a dominance of planktothrix and raphidiopsis in the original community 32 and 28 respectively fig 2a was observed additionally 10 picocyanobacteria including cyanobium synechococcus and synechocystis sphaeropermopsis prochlorothrix microcystis and an unclassified genus of leptolyngbyaceae fig 2a were detected on day 3 of the experiment raphidiopsis presented a higher abundance than at t0 while planktothrix decreased in abundance in both conditions following the decrease of cyanobacterial abundance by the 7th day planktothrix 61 presented the highest relative contribution of cyanobacteria compared to the other sampling times and to the control we also detected a higher resistance of planktothrix compared to the other cyanobacteria genera fig 2a santos et al 2021 monitored cyanobacteria by pigment fluorescence and the bacterioplankton composition 16s rrna sequencing after applying 10 mg l 1 h2o2 to a mesocosm system in the same drinking water reservoir cyanobacteria originally composed of planktothrix sp raphidiopsis sp microcystis sp and cyanobium sp were suppressed for 5 days after a single application of h2o2 non filamentous cyanobacteria were most resistant against h2o2 while planktothrix sp was markedly affected throughout the treatment interestingly unlike the results presented here thus in both mesocosm studies planktothrix sp and raphidiopsis sp dominated the initial cyanobacterial community but although both h2o2 and tio2 uv produce ros they affected the cyanobacterial community differently however there is no clear evidence that supports different pattern of interspecific resistance sensitivity mainly for raphidiopsis sp and planktothrix sp considering specific ros for treatment purposes this aspect should be further explored since both cyanobacterial genera have shown a co dominance along with dolichospermum sp in drinking water reservoirs mainly in the brazilian semi arid region barros et al 2019 clemente et al 2020 pestana et al 2019 santos et al 2021 interestingly in h2o2 studies at lab scale yang et al 2018 evidenced similar values for effective concentration ec50 of h2o2 that inhibit the growth of planktothrix 0 42 mg l 1 and raphidiopsis 0 32 mg l 1 as well as damage to the photosynthetic apparatus whereas non filamentous microcystis presented higher resistance the diverse composition of other cyanobacterial taxa and the bacterioplankton community in each case may have affected the different outcomes in terms of competitive or synergistic interactions and succession more detailed information on the genomics data is provided in the supplementary information figs s2 and s3 as well as tables s4 and s5 physico chemical parameters representing water quality markedly improved over the course of the study in the treated mesocosms versus the control mesocosms table 1 transparency almost doubled on average in the treatment mesocosms while turbidity practically halved which is logical as both parameters are inversely related this observation was confirmed by pca analysis which identified ph total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc dissolved oxygen turbidity and transparency as the most relevant physico chemical variables fig s3 the ph was directly proportional to the variables toc and doc the highest values of transparency were associated with the lowest values of turbidity and dissolved oxygen this trend for turbidity and transparency was also observed in our previous study with solar irradiation and hydrogen peroxide 10 mg l 1 applied in the same reservoir santos et al 2021 increased transparency represents an improvement in the water quality both for treatment purposes and from an ecological perspective the fact that the tio2 photocatalysis applied here reduced the turbidity and increased the transparency means it improved its own performances for the treatment purposes its effective capability for these physical aspects should be emphasized sinceorganic particles initially competed with bacteria for ros and for the photoactive sites of the tio2 furthermore suspended particles reduced light penetration through the water by dispersion by reducing these effects the treatment became more effective which could be a possible explanation for the lag time in observable effects of the treatment on the phytoplankton communities before day 7 ecologically greater transparency means light can penetrate deeper into the water column thus expanding the euphotic zone and generating oxygen in deeper zone of the reservoir additionally eukaryotic phytoplankton can take better advantage of light penetration growing faster and bringing new stability to the water system a reduction of the dissolved oxygen concentration was observed throughout the experiment which may have been caused by two mechanisms the action of the oxidative process promoted in the treatment reactors and the water retention inside the mesocosms the latter reduces the mixing processes of the water column thus influencing its stratification båmstedt and larsson 2018 the depth of the mesocosms in the current study 1 5 m is comparable to shallow areas within reservoirs or reservoirs that experience water shortage and are only fractionally filled this combined with the fact that the experiment took place during the time of year with traditionally high temperatures the current mesocosm design could favor weak thermal stratification inside the system comparable to most reservoirs in the brazilian semi arid region marques et al 2019 regarding the doc concentration values remained close to the control at t0 and day 3 with no major changes observed the concentrations of toc followed a similar trend as that observed for doc toc results showed little significant differences in most experimental times after exposure to the photocatalysis there was no modification of nutrient or salt ion concentrations over time as would be expected supplementary information s4 table s6 fig s4 the continuing presence of nutrients could theoretically favor regrowth of the cyanobacteria which is why it is important to bear in mind that the current system is designed to be continually operating and treating the reservoir it is not designed to prevent the formation of blooms by nutrient control but by population control 3 2 effect of tio2 photocatalysis on the eukaryotic plankton community combined with the marked effects on the bacterioplankton community in the reservoir the tio2 uv treatment significantly affected the eukaryotic plankton community in general p 0 0049 f 3 21 according to permanova when compared to the control over time p 0 0001 f 6 73 especially for the zooplankton community nmds ordination provides a clear distribution opposing control and treatment conditions mainly for the day 7 fig s1 while little change was observed at day 3 on day 7 of the treatment the zooplankton community decreased from around 61 of the total eukaryotic plankton community to less than 5 fig 4 originally the community was rich in zooplankton followed by the diatom and alveolate groups which together accounted for over 75 of the eukaryotic plankton community fig 4 the arthropoda subclass copepoda was the main component of zooplankton accounting for 50 on average table s7 with calanoida and cyclopoida as the main taxa in this group table s3 diatoms contributed 13 of the total eukaryotic plankton community including fragilariales as the major group 10 of diatom alveolate represented 6 of the total eukaryotic plankton community with dinoflagellata as the main representative 4 of alveolate fig 4 table s7 on day 3 there was no clear evidence of compositional changes except for an increase in the abundance of an unclassified member of eukarya and a decrease in the diatom group to 7 on average although this occurred in both conditions fig 4 and table s7 on day 7 the relative abundance of zooplankton decreased by more than 95 on average fig 4 and table s7 whereas chrysophyte increased to about 41 compared to its low abundance at the start of the experiment and in the control condition on day 7 0 5 1 the decrease in the relative abundance of zooplankton components may be a direct effect of the oxidizing treatment or a secondary effect due to changes in the phytoplankton community composition mainly linked to the modification of cyanobacterial dynamics where planktothrix dominated the cyanobacteria community compared to the original distribution at t0 and the control condition where raphidiopsis pseudoanabaena and pseudolyngbya were more prevalent fig 2a different zooplankton species have different preferred target food species tõnno et al 2016 however it stands to reason that in a biome that is so strongly dominated by cyanobacteria as is the current study site a large portion of the zooplankton grazes on cyanobacteria as preferred food source thus a possible explanation of the marked decrease of the zooplankton abundancy is that due to the reduction of cyanobacterial abundance an important food source for zooplankton was removed leading to the zooplankton reduction a detailed investigation of the zooplankton species present in the reservoir and an investigation of their feeding behavior would clarify these possibilities but was out with the scope of the current study within chrysophyte the taxa chromulinales 12 chrysophyceae 10 and ochromonadales 19 family order presented the highest increase in contribution table s6 suggesting resistance to the treatment interestingly the chrysophyte also referred to as golden brown algae presented an increase in the treated mesocosms which is unlikely as was observed for the effect of h2o2 in different studies where the treatment promoted the growth of green algae when applied to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms fan et al 2019 santos et al 2021 yang et al 2018 an unclassified member of eukarya increased to 22 in the treatment compared to 5 in the control condition although less abundant alveolate also increased in abundance at this time members of the family perkinsidae reached about 8 of relative contribution compared to t0 or the control condition 1 table s7 following this pronounced modification on day 7 lefse analysis identified the most important eukaryote taxa contributing to the observed effect p 0 05 fig s2b using the lda 3 5 threshold we detected a lower number of taxa that distinguished the tio2 based photocatalysis treatment and the control condition where resistant and susceptible components included 11 and 8 taxa respectively besides calanoida and cyclopoida organisms we observed the zooplankton ploimida rotifera and the fungi catenaria blastocladyales as susceptible organisms fig 5 a d these four taxa represented about 60 of the original eukaryote community which was considerably diminished on day 7 in the resistant group with the highest lda scores in the tio2 treatment we identified ochromonas ochrophyta chrysophyceae uncl unclassified poteriospumella chrysophyte and nuclearia gastrotricha figs 5e h and s2b ochromonas poteriospumella and nuclearia did not present significant abundance at any sampling time except for day 7 of the treatment condition when their abundances rose to 15 and 6 7 respectively indicating a resistance to the tio2 based photocatalysis fig 5e g and h respectively following that poteriospumella and ochromonas genera from the chrysophyte were the most relevant taxa to increase in abundance throughout the photocatalytic treatment the antioxidant activity from both chrysophyte genera is unclear and any report that could explain this specific response against ros could not be found however it is known that other chrysophyte species from marine environment present a pronounced ability to produce lipopolysaccharide and carotenoids such as fucoxanthin which produces a high antioxidant response considering both ros quenching as well as photo damage protection méresse et al 2020 sun et al 2014 the increased abundance of this group in the treatment conditions may be linked to an intrinsic resistance or can reflect the impact on the microbial plankton community composition including the decrease of the originally dominant cyanobacteria and zooplankton also these organisms could have taken advantage of the altered abiotic environmental conditions that occurred as a result of the treatment e g increased light availability due to a decrease in turbidity and increase in transparency although these organisms are mixotrophic they present a pronounced heterotrophy activity with limited use of light as energy source graupner et al 2018 for example in north america lakes chrysophyte species are commonly found in oligo and mesotrophic environments where their competitive ability in phosphorous limitation allows them to dominate the planktonic community over other algae nicholls and wujek 2003 although we did not observe any change in nutrient content this group could dominate the eukaryote community due to other factors besides microbial composition such as doc dynamics their mixotrophic characteristics as well as the increased light availability in the photocatalytic system interestingly ochromonas have been identified as microcystis grazers and a microcystin cyanotoxin degrader after an ultrasound assisted process was used at lab scale to estimate its application for water cleaning and cyanobacteria controlling zhang et al 2021 2018 alternatively the treatment could stimulate an indirect control of cyanobacteria and a potential microcystin degradation by promoting an increase in ochromonas abundance this fact indicates the importance of investigating the ecological role of microbial communities resistant to alternative treatments and their capacity for degrading diverse toxic compounds that may be released after treatment 3 3 relationship between biotic and abiotic parameters in this study we tested for correlation between relevant abiotic parameters affected by the treatment and selected taxa corresponding to the susceptible or resistant bacterial and eukaryotic taxa high lda scores according to the lefse analysis at t7 including the main cyanobacterial genera observed in 16s rrna data we used a canonical correspondence analysis cca coupled to spearman correlation p 0 05 fig 6 and table s8 for the bacterioplankton the cca ordination had the total variation of data explained by the two main axes 82 and 14 respectively with a significant p value for their eigenvalues p 0 01 and 0 02 respectively a strict relationship was observed between turbidity and all cyanobacterial genera sharing the same dimensional quadrant which considered all sampling times for the control condition including t0 fig 6a in which cyanobacteria maintained high relative abundance this was confirmed by the spearman analysis showing a significant positive correlation between turbidity and cyanobacteria with high r values for planktothrix and microcystis r 0 67 for both as well as raphidiopsis and sphaerospermospsis r 0 54 for both table s8 for transparency microcystis presented a significant negative correlation r 0 61 as well as cyanobium and nodosilinea r 0 60 and 0 66 respectively the resistant bacteria asinibacterium and prosthecobacter presented significant negative correlations with turbidity r 0 74 and 0 45 respectively and a positive correlation with transparency r 0 57 and 0 44 respectively the association between cyanobacterial dynamics and the improvement of turbidity and transparency was previously observed from the use of h2o2 in gavião reservoir santos et al 2021 where the chlorophyll content of these organisms decreased over time simultaneously with an increase in transparency other abiotic parameters such as dissolved oxygen and ph also presented a positive correlation with susceptible cyanobacterial genera and negative correlations with resistant bacteria for dissolved oxygen the correlation was significant for microcystis r 0 51 planktothrix r 0 50 and sphaerospermopsis r 0 53 and for the resistant asinibacterium r 0 55 and prosthecobacter r 0 46 for ph significant correlations were found for the cyanobacteria leptolyngbyaceae uncl r 0 68 prochlorothrix r 0 50 and raphidiopsis r 0 44 and for the resistant taxa flectobacillus r 0 51 fig 6a and table s7 organic carbon content toc and doc presented negative correlation with the cyanobacteria cyanobium and microcystis r 0 45 and 0 53 respectively and with the heterotrophic bacteria cl500 3 and ld29 r 0 47 and 0 58 respectively whereas prosthecobacter a resistant bacterium showed positive correlation with toc and doc r 0 61 and 0 49 respectively table s8 this relationship between toc doc and bacteria among cyanobacteria and heterotrophic ones could be associated to the photodegradation and lysis of susceptible cyanobacteria while other bacteria could be involved in the biodegradation of intracellular products released to the water huang et al 2017 ye et al 2015 farkas et al 2015 observed a strict relationship between the tio2 nanoparticles and organic carbon affecting the bacterial community where lakes with higher concentrations of doc and lower chemical element concentrations presented a significant reduction of bacterial abundance and activity although we identified a positive correlation between some resistant taxa among bacteria and eukaryote and doc we could not establish the influence of carbon on the treatment efficiency in the eukaryotic community cca showed a discrete ordination of taxa and abiotic parameters with fewer relationships when compared to the bacterioplankton fig 6b the two main axes explained the total variation of data contributing with 69 and 21 respectively and significant p values p 0 002 and 0 1 respectively cyclopoida was the only susceptible taxon located opposite transparency topresent a negative correlation with this parameter r 0 54 in contrast the resistant ochromonas poteriospumella and nuclearia were located close to transparency in the opposite quadrant fig 6b ochromonas r 0 58 and nuclearia r 0 55 were positively correlated with transparency whereas poteriospumella was negatively correlated with turbidity r 0 44 ochromonas and nuclearia also showed positive correlation with toc and doc r 0 47 and 0 58 respectively for ochromonas and r 0 55 and 0 53 respectively for nuclearia table s8 3 4 in situ application of tio2 based photocatalysis for over twenty five years the potential of tio2 photocatalysis as a promising technology for the control of cyanobacteria and their toxins has been described in the literature lawton et al 1999 robertson et al 1997 1998a much of the work however has involved lab scale applications with only a small number of reports detailing pilot scale reactor studies menezes et al 2021 pestana et al 2014 consequently much of the work reported has been at lower technology readiness levels trls between 1 and 3 to move this technology further up the trl scale larger scale applications capable of treating cubic meter quantities of water will need to be demonstrated in this paper for the first time the technology has been demonstrated to be a feasible in situ treatment step capable of larger scale water treatment hence moving the photocatalytic process up the trl scale from four to five it is envisioned that continuous or as needed treatment with the proposed system adjacent to the wtp abstraction point could ease the cyanobacterial burden on the treatment plant the removal of cyanobacteria and the intrinsic improvement of water quality could significantly decrease the need for treatment chemicals which is economically and environmentally favorable the exact number of treatment units required would be determined on a case by case basis dependent on local conditions and incoming raw water quality cyanobacterial load considerations of the potential inherent cost of the deployment system can be found in the supplementary information s8 previous work has clearly demonstrated that the proposed technology can remove both cyanobacteria and dissolved cyanotoxins gunaratne et al 2020 pestana et al 2020c this markedly decreases the public health dangers posed by toxic cyanobacterial blooms and could potentially also mitigate the effects of cyanobacteriogenic taste and odor episodes as the removal of taste and odor compounds by tio2 photocatalysis has described before pestana et al 2014 2020b post treatment testing has demonstrated that the coating on the beads is stable figs s5 and s6 it was observed that iron and manganese were incorporated into the elemental composition of the tio2 coated beads which is most likely from components of the treatment unit the photocatalytic efficiency of the used beads was tested against methylene blue in the laboratory fig s7 and a 20 drop in removal efficiency was observed most likely due to the aforementioned contamination with fe and mn for future iterations of this treatment system materials will have to be carefully selected to avoid affecting the photocatalytic efficiency in the current study we observed alterations in the phyto and zooplankton communities as a result of the photocatalytic treatment whether any changes would affect the microbial community in a water body the size of a drinking water reservoir would have to be carefully examined in due course it is worth bearing in mind however that any type of intervention e g limiting nutrient input or application of broad spectrum algaecides will have a knock on effect on the micro biosphere of a water body and will have to be carefully evaluated to balance the desired effects a potential additional area of concern is the effect of the treatment on disinfection by product formation the effect of the tio2 photocatalysis in this regard will have to be carefully monitored and coordinated with carefully dialed in treatment conditions in the disinfection step furthermore as the treatment solution presented here is designed to be operated continuously the danger of re growth of undesirable species is low compared to periodic treatments such as the application of algaecides or h2o2 in the future it would be desirable to power the lighting array with renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic or wind power depending on the local climatic conditions a promising approach would be the deployment of floating photovoltaic units that feed a battery system allowing for 24 h operation of the photocatalytic units an additional advantage of the application of floating photovoltaic units would be the shading of the underlying water further limiting cyanobacterial growth although the environmental impact of the use of photovoltaic units would have to be assessed against the benefits of their employment farrell et al 2020 the application of the treatment units is not limited to the reservoir alone while it is envisaged that this will be the main deployment point deployment in settling tanks or on top of filter units within the conventional water treatment unit processes could unlock further potential to polish water and decrease treatment costs by increasing filter life and decreasing the demand for chemical disinfection 4 conclusion to ultimately ease the burden on water treatment plants an innovative tio2 uv led reactor system was tested at mesocosm scale within seven days cyanobacterial abundance was reduced by 85 and water quality parameters like transparency and turbidity improved markedly the current study represents a move towards bridging the gap between decades of academic laboratory based research towards real life deployment of the technology pushing the trl further up the scale the proposed photocatalytic system aims to be sustainable with readily available and recycled constituent parts off the shelve components were used to construct the reactor system complimented by a facile photocatalyst deposition method onto beads made from post consumer glass while the treatment units were powered by mains power in the current study there is scope to utilize renewable energy systems to further enhance the sustainability aspect due to the flexibility the system offers reactor length could be increased or decreased as required other applications can be envisaged including deployment on top of filters within conventional water treatment plants as well as a polishing technology of product water and within product water storage areas for future research include full lake trials long term effect on the ecosystem life cycle analysis and techno economic assessment to further push the treatment system up the trl scale to conclude we have for the first time demonstrated practical application of tio2 based photocatalysis at mesocosm scale under environmental conditions allowing future development of in situ treatment for the reduction of cyanobacteria and their toxins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15407,the use of ceramic membranes and ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds has advanced the application of photocatalytic membrane for water treatment we systematically evaluated the contribution of filtration and photocatalysis to dissolved organic matter dom removal and fouling mechanism during in situ uv led photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration the results showed that physical rejection primarily led to removal of 4 15 kda molecules and photocatalysis further increased the removal of 1 4 kda molecules causing small sized microbial humic like or protein like materials in the permeate in situ uv led photocatalysis had an excellent effect on membrane fouling mitigation regardless of dom sources the dominant fouling mechanism changed from partial blockage to gel layer formation with increasing ca2 concentration but did not change with uv treatment correlation analysis revealed that the removal of 1 4 kda molecules contributed to the mitigation of both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance and the small molecules were the major cause of irreversible fouling resistance removal of 1 4 kda terrestrial humic acid like contributed to the pore blockage mechanism for synthetic water removal of 4 15 kda protein like materials was closely correlated to the pore blockage mechanism for real water trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas formation potential fp were both significantly reduced after photocatalytic ceramic membrane process but precursors of nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps with high toxicity were not removed by filtration or by photocatalysis which deserves attention membrane rejection made higher contribution to better dbpfp control than photocatalysis this study provides novel insights into the impact of uv led on dom removal dbpfp control and fouling mitigation promoting the development of photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalytic ceramic membrane dissolved organic matter membrane fouling disinfection by products uv led data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ceramic membranes have greatly advanced water and wastewater treatment owing to their advantageous properties over conventional polymeric membranes including fouling resistance high permeability good recoverability chemical stability durability and environmental protection dong et al 2022 li et al 2020 because of their chemical resistance ceramic membranes are more favorable than their polymeric counterparts for integration in advanced oxidation processes aops chen et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 catalytic ceramic membranes have received increasing attention owing to their enhanced antifouling and pollutant removal capabilities asif and zhang 2021 gao et al 2020a the search for environmentally friendly green water treatment processes has prompted numerous studies on photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration which is a highly efficient and environmentally friendly water treatment technology that does not require a continuous supply of chemicals iglesias et al 2016 li et al 2018 ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds which are hg free lamps have increasingly attracted research attention for water disinfection and contaminant removal and have great potential for the design of photocatalytic membrane processes realizing the uv illumination on the membrane surface in real application chen et al 2019 lei et al 2021 uv led can be divided into uvc 200 280 nm uvb 280 315 nm and uva 315 400 nm uva led with high external quantum and wall plug efficiencies has developed rapidly and has been widely used in industry matafonova and batoev 2018 electrical energy per order e eo values for uv led photocatalysis have been reported to reduce to the range of traditional mercury lamps bertagna silva et al 2021 recently tio2 based photocatalysis uv leds irradiation is the most frequently applied method for treating organic pollutants matafonova and batoev 2018 intensive tio2 photocatalytic ceramic membrane studies mainly focused on tio2 modification and pollutant removal asif and zhang 2021 however there are few investigations on the removal of organic pollutants and fouling control by photocatalytic ceramic membranes under uv led irradiation li et al 2019b the contribution of membrane filtration and photocatalysis to the removal of organic pollutants in the photocatalytic membrane process has not been clearly isolated and identified although numerous studies have revealed that aops can reduce the disinfection by product formation potential dbpfp by removing precursors from water some studies have shown that dbpfp removal increases after aop treatment wang et al 2021 during uv tio2 treatment dissolved organic matter dom is transformed but not fully mineralized which may lead to an increase in the dbpfp and change fouling behavior xiang et al 2020 for example some studies have shown that photocatalysis reduces most of the dbp precursors such as dissolved organic carbon and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 but increases the trihalomethane thm formation potential thmfp li et al 2011 as intermediate degradation products may be more likely to generate dbps because they are more reactive towards chlorine in hydroxylated moieties in dom gora et al 2018 dbps need to be considered during photocatalytic ceramic filtration substantial membrane fouling by dom during ultrafiltration in water treatment results in reduced membrane performance zhang et al 2022 specific dom fractions have been found to contribute more to fouling than the total dom mass winter et al 2016 photocatalytic treatment has been reported to lower the dom fraction and reduce cake layer fouling or increase pore blocking huang et al 2008 yang et al 2019 in situ uv irradiation of the catalytic membrane surface increased the efficacy of the treatment process however it is not yet well understood how in situ photocatalysis affects the dom retention by and membrane fouling of ceramic membranes especially for real water our previous study revealed that pollutant degradation occurs in the membrane pores li et al 2022 therefore we expected the entrapment of hydroxyl radicals in membrane pores to control pore blocking during an in situ photocatalytic ceramic membrane process which would improve the backwashing efficiency thus the effect of in situ photocatalysis on the flux and cleaning efficiency as well as the fouling control mechanisms require systematic elucidation in this study dom removal and dbpfp in feed water and permeate water during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration under the dark and uv led irradiation were simultaneously studied which aimed to identify the contribution of filtration and photocatalytic degradation a synthetic suwannee river natural organic matter srnom solution and real water were both tested to study the impact of water matrix on dom removal dbpfp and membrane fouling during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration excitation emission matrix eem spectra coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac and molecular weight mw distribution analysis were used to characterize dom fate the effect of in situ photocatalytic oxidation on membrane fouling was systematically investigated and elaborated through dom characterization and fouling analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials porous ceramic discs diameter 90 mm mw cutoff 15 kda were commercially available tami france tio2 rgo nanomaterials were prepared in the lab li et al 2022 srnom used as a model was obtained from the international humic substances society after the srnom was dissolved in deionized di water the ph was adjusted using a naoh solution and the solution was stirred for 24 h to prepare a stock srnom solution before filtration through the membrane the ph of the srnom solution was adjusted to 7 0 using hcl and naoh solutions sand filter effluent of a water treatment plant in beijing was used as real water and was stored at 4 c the srnom solution and real water were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and then analyzed for water quality as shown in table s1 2 2 photocatalytic ceramic membrane preparation photocatalytic ceramic membranes were prepared as described in our previous study li et al 2019a briefly composite tio2 rgo nanomaterials were first prepared using hydrothermal methods with go contents of 1 6 wt and then were coated on porous ceramic discs through vacuum filtration photocatalytic ceramic membranes were prepared after heating at 360 for 2 h in this paper the photocatalytic ceramic membrane is termed mcm and the pristine ceramic membrane is referred to as pcm 2 3 photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration process the process of ceramic photocatalytic membrane filtration combined with uv led irradiation is shown in fig 1 a homemade photocatalytic membrane reactor was constructed by machining a quartz window on the upper membrane surface to allow uv irradiation of the surface fig s1a the pearllab beamtm uv led apparatus used in this study was purchased from aquisense technologies erlanger ky usa the reactor contains three leds that emit at 275 300 and 365 nm and has an input voltage of 12v and a current of 1 2 a the uv led parameters provided by the manufacturer are shown in table s2 the distance between the led apparatus and the solution was approximately 3 cm the light intensity of the 275 300 and 365 nm uv leds at the center of the solution surface was measured to be 0 79 0 07 1 08 0 15 and 13 27 1 41 mw cm 2 respectively using a radiometer all cross flow filtrations were conducted in recycled mode with a constant transmembrane pressure of 1 bar experiments in the dark i e without uv irradiation for the mcm and photolysis for the pcm under uv irradiation were conducted as control experiments to calculate the physical retention and direct photolysis respectively to study the photocatalytic ceramic membrane process for the mcm the uv led apparatus was turned on membrane flux was recorded using a data acquisition system equipped with a balance the membrane flux is 95 1 1 0 l m2 h bar for clean pcm and 92 6 3 6 l m2 h bar for clean mcm srnom solution with a total organic carbon toc concentration of 5 5 mg l was filtrated for 3 h the effects of an external oxidant 0 5 mm h2o2 and ca2 1 mm in the feed water on dom removal were also investigated real water was also tested in the dark and under uv irradiation using the same operating conditions as those used for srnom solution filtration the retentate and permeate were recycled back to the feed tank based on the mass balance in this recycled mode dom removal from the feed water after filtration was ascribed to membrane adsorption alone in the dark experiments and to photocatalytic degradation for filtration under uv irradiation dom removal from the permeate water after filtration was ascribed to physical rejection by the mcm in the dark experiments and to physical rejection and photocatalytic degradation for filtration under uv irradiation feed and permeate samples were collected from the feed tank and permeate side at regular intervals for dom characterization untreated srnom solution and real water samples are denoted as fw0 feed water samples after 3 h of ceramic membrane filtration are denoted as fw3h and permeate water samples after 3 h of filtration are denoted as pw3h to analyze fouling resistance the membranes were physically washed using forward flushing with di water for 10 min for chemical cleaning the fouled membranes were soaked in 0 1 mol l naoh solution at 85 c for 15 min and then in 0 5 mol l h2po3 solution at 50 c for 15 min the flux recovery rate for the ceramic membranes after chemical cleaning was 100 which indicated that the membranes were clean and could be reused in subsequent experiments 2 4 analytical methods for toc and dbpfp analysis h2o2 was quenched using catalase the concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the feed and permeate water was determined based on uv254 and using a toc analyzer excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan was used to characterize the organic components eem spectra were measured at

time were fitted to the equations shown in table s4 through nonlinear optimization using a curve fitting tool in matlab and the trust region method 2 5 5 eem parafac eem parafac modeling was conducted in matlab v 2010a mathworks usa using the domfluor toolbox based on the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 parafac models with 3 to 7 components were applied the most suitable number of model components was validated through split half analysis the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax values of the components identified were used to determine the relative amounts of individual dom components 3 results and discussion 3 1 fractional dom removal during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of srnom dom removal efficiency was shown in fig s2 mcm presented a higher dom removal rate than the pcm in addition ca2 decreased toc removal through reduced electrostatic repulsion fig s2a fig s2b showed that uv irradiation decreased the total toc retention compared with the filtration alone in dark test which may be due to the degradation of large dom molecules into small molecules rather than mineralization varying the uv wavelength did not affect the toc removal efficiency 3 1 1 spectroscopic characteristics of dom the parafac model output showed that three fluorescent components were identified based on the eem data of all srnom samples fig s3 component 1 c1 exhibited primary and secondary maxima at 250 448 nm ex em and 315 448 nm ex em respectively which are assigned to terrestrial humic like t humic like components the fluorescence peaks at 275 475 nm for component 2 c2 are also assigned to t humic like components component 3 c3 with prominent peaks at 225 400 nm is related to microbial humic like m humic like fluorescence generally the red shifting of eem fluorescence suggests a higher degree of aromaticity or a larger mw ly et al 2018 hence the molecular size of humic acid like components followed the order of c2 c1 c3 as shown in table s5 the ratio of c1 c2 and c3 in the srnom solution were 44 9 31 5 and 23 6 respectively the percentage reductions in all peaks of the eem fluorescence spectra for both feed and permeate water are shown in fig 2 the removal of c1 and c2 from the feed water increased after ca2 addition in the dark experiment fig 2a indicating that ca2 promotes the adsorption of t humic like substances on the membrane surface through enhanced electrostatic attraction the surface charge of ceramic membrane is measured as 30 2 2 0 mv in our previous study li et al 2019a which is supposed to increase in the presence of ca2 the compositional removal in dom from the feed water were in the order c2 c1 c3 this is likely to be attributed to the existence of large aromatic and unsaturated substances in c2 that are more reactive towards oxidants and have more reactive sites gao et al 2020b lamsal et al 2011 negative removal of c3 in feed water indicated the c3 formation during photocatalytic process which may be a microbial transformation product of terrestrial dom c2 or c3 ly et al 2018 higher removal of c1 and c2 and less c3 formed under 365 nm uv and 365 nm uv h2o2 than those under 300 and 275 nm uv light indicating more effective photocatalytic degradation of dom fractions in addition the presence of ca2 promoted the photocatalytic oxidation of t humic like materials due to improved adsorption of them onto the membrane surface mariquit et al 2008 the compositional removal in dom from the permeate water was in the order c1 c2 c3 fig 2b dom removal from the permeate water was due to the combined effects of photocatalysis and physical retention high fraction of c3 in permeate water were found due to formed intermediate by products which were not retained by the mcm which is also reported by gonzález et al 2013 thus higher c3 content were found in the presence of ca2 in the permeate water due to stronger photocatalytic oxidation of c1 and c2 3 1 2 molecular weight distribution of dom the mw distribution of srnom was in the range of 0 1 15 kda with a major peak at 4 15 kda the mw distributions of feed and permeate water after srnom filtration through a ceramic membrane are shown in fig s4 a d showing larger molecular size of molecules in the presence of ca2 the calculated percentage reductions in all peaks of feed water through adsorption and degradation are shown in fig 3a for the pcm under uv irradiation only a small amount of 4 15 kda organic substances was decomposed by photolysis fig s4a the removal of 1 4 kda organic matters increased significantly due to photodegradation for mcm under uv irradiation the degradation efficiency was higher at 365 nm than at 300 nm and 275 nm fig s4c the calculated percentage reductions in all peaks of the mw distribution of permeate water through physical retention and degradation are shown in fig 3b it can be seen that the mcm showed better dom retention than the pcm while the addition of ca2 decreased the rejection of organic matter in the dark test fig s4b compared with the filtration alone in the dark photocatalysis further increased the total removal of 1 4 kda organic matters h2o2 addition further enhanced the reduction of the 1 15 kda peak fig s4d h2o2 as an external electron acceptor has been reported to inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes and produce hydroxyl radicals thus strengthening photocatalysis li et al 2022 further 0 1 1 kda organics were not degraded nor physically retained by the mcm thus we need to pay more attention to low mw organics in the 0 1 1 kda range together dom removal mechanism under uv led irradiation were concluded based on the dom characterization results the mcm showed significantly enhanced removal of molecules of 4 15 kda and 1 4 kda through photocatalytic membrane filtration compared with the pcm the contribution of filtration and photocatalysis to the dom fractional removal were elucidated 4 15 kda terrestrial humic like substances were physically rejected and 1 4 kda terrestrial humic like substances were further degraded low mw microbial humic like substances in the 0 1 1 kda range formed during photocatalysis the presence of ca2 and h2o2 further increased degradation of terrestrial humic like substances 3 2 dbp formation potential during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of srnom dbpfp reduction is not only due to enhanced toc removal but also due to the selective removal of dom fractions he et al 2020 the thmfp haafp and n dbpfp of the feed and permeate water after 3 h of treatment are shown in fig 4 a c respectively the major components of thmfp are tcmfp and bdcmfp and the concentration of cdbmfp and tbmfp below the detection limit were not shown in fig 4a the tcmfp was dramatically reduced in the feed and permeate whereas the bdcmfp remained nearly unchanged indicating that most tcm precursors are removed by the filtration and photocatalysis furthermore photocatalysis was found to cause higher thmfp compared with filtration alone due to the formation of low molecular weight microbial substances during photocatalytic process 365 nm uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 led to better thmfp control than other conditions the major component of haafp is mcaafp tcaafp dcaafp and mbaafp fig 4b photocatalytic degradation made significant contribution to the reduction in the precursors of mcaa and tcaa tcaa precursors are more easily degraded which may be because tcaa precursors have a higher mw higher aromaticity and weaker hydrophilicity gao et al 2019 li et al 2011 photocatalysis combined with filtration resulted in a better haafp control than filtration alone 275 nm uv irradiation led to better haafp control than 365 nm and 300 nm uv irradiation the major components of n dbpfp are bcanfp tcnmfp and tcpfp fig 4c the tcpfp and tcnmfp of the permeate water were dramatically decreased in the dark experiment indicating that tcp and tcnm precursors are removed by filtration alone after photocatalytic treatment the tcpfp and bcanfp of the feed water decreased whereas the tcnmfp increased higher tcnmfp in the permeate were also found after photocatalytic membrane filtration combined with the results of mw distribution analysis this suggests that tcnm precursors are mainly small molecules generated during photocatalysis and cannot be retained by the membrane resulting in a higher tcnmfp of the permeate water after uv irradiation than in the dark photocatalysis combined with filtration also resulted in a better n dbpfp control than filtration alone 365 nm uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 led to better n dbpfp control than other conditions as shown in table s6 the removal rate of the dbpfp of the permeate water after photocatalytic membrane filtration of srnom solution reached 52 69 with catalytic degradation accounting for 24 5 44 among the three dbps the removal rates were in the order haafp thmfp n dbpfp indicating that n dbp precursors could not be effectively removed by filtration or photocatalytic degradation photocatalysis combined with filtration resulted in a better haafp and n dbpfp control than filtration alone but increased thmfp the transformation of less reactive hydrophobic dom into more reactive hydrophilic dom during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration increases the thmfp borikar et al 2015 3 3 membrane fouling control during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration 3 3 1 effects of membrane modification and ca2 inclusion as shown in fig 5a ca2 aggravated the flux decline during membrane fouling in a concentration dependent manner for both the pcm and mcm in the absence of ca2 the mcm showed less flux decline than the pcm however in the presence of ca2 the flux reduction of the mcm was lower than that of the pcm in the initial stage of filtration but became higher than that of the pcm in the later stage of filtration the effect of membrane modification on fouling mitigation was weakened because the nanomaterial coating is further modified during filtration with dom especially in the presence of ca2 membrane fouling resistance analysis results showed that ca2 significantly increased the total fouling resistance especially irreversible fouling fig 5b ca2 can strengthen the interactions between foulants and the membrane surface through the bridge effect thus hampering foulant removal by physical cleaning compared with the pcm the mcm reduced both r r and r ir in the absence of ca2 however in the presence of ca2 the total fouling resistance of the mcm increased whereas r ir r f decreased the anti fouling performance of the mcm was mainly because of the increased negative charge and hydrophilicity of the mcm surface resulting in weakened electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the foulants the modified hermia s model was used to clarify the mechanisms of membrane fouling the goodness of fit r 2 values of all hermia s models to the experimental data are listed in table s7 a higher r 2 value indicates a higher degree of model fitting xing et al 2018 the major fouling mechanisms for the pcm are partial blockage and complete blockage whereas the major fouling mechanisms for the mcm are partial blockage and gel layer formation fig s5 presents the model fitting results for partial blockage the dominant fouling mechanism changed from partial blockage to gel layer formation with increasing ca2 concentration 3 3 2 effect of uv led irradiation as shown in fig 6a the permeate flux of the mcm gradually decreased during srnom filtration but the flux decline was mitigated under uv irradiation the flux decline was reduced in the order 365 nm uv h2o2 365 nm uv 300 nm uv 275 nm uv membrane fouling resistance analysis showed that the total fouling resistance especially r r was reduced under uv irradiation whereas uv had a limited effect on r ir probably because of an altered foulant composition fig 6b shi et al 2015 uv irradiation at 365 nm reduced both r r and r ir and uv irradiation at 300 nm and 275 nm mainly decreased r r compared with 365 nm uv irradiation the total fouling resistance was further reduced after h2o2 addition the preferential degradation of hydrophobic dom with higher mw during uv irradiation can effectively control r r because hydrophobic organic matter shows low adhesion to the membrane surface and is not adsorbed in the membrane pores awfa et al 2020 huang et al 2008 in addition the adhesion forces of foulant membrane and foulant foulant were found to be decreased after photocatalysis thereby mitigating reversible membrane fouling zhu et al 2018 however the small and hydrophilic molecules generated during photocatalytic degradation are more likely to cause an increase in r ir r f the goodness of fit r2 values of all hermia s models to the experimental flux data are listed in table 1 the results show that the partial blockage model could predict the permeate flux better than the other models the partial blockage model fit to the experimental data is shown in fig s6 after uv irradiation the dominant fouling mechanism did not change but the goodness of fit of the gel layer model was lower than that of the complete blocking model indicating that the macromolecular organic matter deposited on the membrane surface was degraded into small molecules leading to increased membrane pore blocking k i represents the proportion of membrane surface blockage per unit of water passing through the membrane the increased k i value after uv irradiation indicated that the degree of membrane surface blockage increased meanwhile the value of the gel layer coefficient k gl decreased after uv treatment this indicated that the photocatalytic degradation of 1 4 kda terrestrial humic like substances prevented large molecule pollutants from accumulating on the membrane surface and reduced the extent of gel layer formation thereby decreasing reversible membrane fouling in conclusion uv irradiation has a limited effect on the alleviation of r ir but alleviates r r to a large extent 3 3 3 membrane fouling mitigation mechanism the correlations between fouling parameters r ir r r k i and k gl and the percentage reductions in specific dom peaks in permeate water were investigated to identify the contributions of dom fractions to membrane fouling fig 7a showed that r r had a strong positive relationship with the percentage reduction of 4 15 kda substances r2 0 85 and a weak negative relationship with 1 4 kda substances r2 0 17 thus the removal of 4 15 kda substances were the major cause of reversible resistance and removal of 1 4 kda substances contributed to the mitigation of reversible resistance r ir had a strong negative relationship with the percentage reductions of 1 4 kda r2 0 59 and 0 01 1 kda substances r2 0 71 indicating that the removal of small molecules contributed to the mitigation of irreversible resistance the correlations between fouling resistance and percentage reductions in eem peaks fig 7b showed that r r had a strong negative relationship with the percentage reductions in c1 r2 0 73 and r ir had a strong negative relationship with c2 r2 0 83 indicating that the removal of c1 contributed to the mitigation of reversible resistance and removal of c2 contributed to the mitigation of irreversible resistance fig 7 c and d showed that k i had a strong linear relationship with the percentage reduction of 1 4 kda peak r2 0 62 and c1 r2 0 77 indicating removal of 1 4 kda c1 led to the pore blockage fouling mechanism k gl had a strong linear relationship with the percentage reduction of 4 15 kda r2 0 76 and c2 r2 0 73 suggesting removal of 4 15 kda c2 contributed to the gel layer formation as shown in fig 7 e and f 3 4 photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water 3 4 1 fractional dom removal dom degradation measured as a change in uv254 in feed water and permeate water during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water is shown in fig s7 after 3 h uv irradiation the dom degradation rate in the feed water was approximately 25 as seen from fig s7a the degradation rate under 365 nm uv irradiation was slightly higher than that under 300 and 275 nm uv irradiation fig s7b shows the fluence based reaction kinetics which indicate that the fluence based reaction rate constant for 365 nm uv was an order of magnitude lower than that for 300 nm and 275 nm uv thus the observed high dom removal over time under 365 nm uv irradiation was due to the higher uv light intensity the low wall plug efficiency of 300 nm and 275 nm uv leds is the major factor affecting the light intensity with the development of technology the wall plug efficiency of uv leds at low wavelengths is expected to increase making them a promising uv source for the photodegradation of dom by uv based aops in the future uv254 rejection by the mcm in the permeate water during the treatment of real water in the dark was approximately 50 fig s7c after uv irradiation the uv254 rejection decreased which suggested that large organic molecules were degraded to small molecules that cannot be retained by the mcm parafac model output showed that three fluorescent components were identified based on the eem dataset of all real water samples fig s8 c1 exhibited primary and secondary maxima at 225 350 nm ex em and 275 350 nm ex em respectively which are assigned to protein like fluorescence or tryptophan like components c2 exhibited primary and secondary maxima at 255 425 nm ex em and 310 425 nm ex em respectively which are assigned to t humic like components c3 exhibited major peaks at 210 290 nm implying the presence of tyrosine like aromatic proteins eem spectra showed that the major dom fractions in the real water were significantly different from those in the srnom solution as shown in table s8 the protein like components c1 and c3 were the most dominant in real water 88 2 whereas the terrestrial humic like component c2 was present in a minor amount 11 8 thus the main components of real water are protein like substances which are mostly hydrophilic and low mw organics humic like substances containing a large proportion of aromatic structures are more prone to be attacked by oxidants than large biopolymers including protein like substances maqbool et al 2020a this explains why the photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration treatment efficiency was lower for real water than for synthetic srnom solution which contains more humic like organics the percentage reductions in the peaks of three fluorescent components in feed water are shown in fig 8a after uv irradiation the protein like substances were preferentially degraded and 356 nm uv treatment led to higher degradation of terrestrial humic like components of the feed water fig 8b shows that in permeate water the removal of protein like substances increased but degraded terrestrial humic like components were also found leading to a decrease in the removal rate of c2 photocatalysis combined with filtration resulted in higher dom removal than filtration alone the mw distribution of real water showed 5 peaks of 0 01 0 4 kda 0 4 1 kda 1 2 kda 2 4 kda and 4 15 kda fig s9 most of the organic substances in real water had lower mws than those in the srnom solution the percentage reductions in the peaks through filtration and photocatalysis are shown in fig 8c in the dark experiment the adsorption capacity of the membrane surface was approximately 5 and organic substances of 4 15 kda were physically rejected by the mcm as the proportion of 4 15 kda organic matter in real water was relatively low toc rejection by the mcm was only 10 15 after the photocatalytic ceramic membrane treatment the percentage reduction in molecules of 1 4 kda was significantly increased due to photocatalysis 365 nm uv treatment had a stronger degradation effect on 1 4 kda molecules the percentage reduction in 0 01 0 4 kda molecules in the permeate water was negative because of the degradation of 1 4 kda molecules into 0 01 0 4 kda molecules which were entirely transported across the mcm thus 4 15 kda organic matters were mainly removed through filtration while 1 4 kda organic matters were further removed through photocatalysis 3 4 2 dbp formation potential thmfp haafp and n dbpfp after photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water are shown in fig s10 table s9 lists the dbpfp removal rates for the feed and permeate water after photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water in the dark dbpfp were both decreased by only physical retention however photocatalysis was found to cause higher dbpfp compared with filtration alone due to the formation of small protein like substances during photocatalysis combined with the dom characterization results this finding indicated that protein like molecules of 0 01 0 4 kda generated during photocatalytic degradation led to an increase in the dbpfp among the three types of dbpfp the removal rate was in the order thmfp haafp n dbpfp indicating that n dbp precursors in real water were hardly removed by filtration or photocatalysis comparing the three uv wavelengths 365 nm uv irradiation exhibited better thmfp control which may be due to the higher degradation of terrestrial humic like components the total removal rate of dbpfp in the permeate water was 19 46 and that in the feed water was 6 21 in addition to the dbp concentration dbp toxicity has to be considered dbp lc50 was used to calculate the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbps as shown in fig 9 dbp toxicity after 3 h of photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water was not reduced and mbaa dban and bcan contributed the most to toxicity although the thms and haas fp were reduced after photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration their contribution to total toxicity is low therefore we need to pay attention to the removal of precursors of dban and bcan with high toxicity pca parameters and heat map for pearson correlation were applied to study complex relationship between dbpfp and fluorescence indicators of both srnom and real water as illustrated in fig 10 the principal component 1 pc1 explained for 82 8 of the total variances while the pc2 was responsible for 10 2 of the variation humic like substances 4 15 kda 1 4 kda materials and dbpfp are strongly positively correlated and protein like substances and freshness are strongly correlated thus humic like materials were mostly responsible for precursors of tested dbps based on data from feed water and permeate water we could conclude that the filtration did not make significant impact on the relationship between dbpfp and spectroscopic indicators as shown in the fig s10 it showed that uv treatment made no significant impact on the relationship between dbpfp and spectroscopic indicators based on samples divided into dark and uv treatment groups all the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between dbpfp and each parameter were higher than 0 8 the occurrence of thms haas and n dbps in feed and permeate water could sufficiently be explained by eem parafac modeling and mw distribution 3 4 3 membrane fouling mitigation mechanism the membrane flux change during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water is shown in fig 11a the results suggest that uv irradiation slows down the decline in flux caused by membrane fouling and the degree of mitigation was in the order 365 nm 275 nm 300 nm as shown in fig 11b the fraction of r ir was substantially higher than that of r r during real water filtration dom fractions greatly contributed to the fouling mechanism the major organic compounds in real water were hydrophilic protein like materials with relatively low mws which are more likely to cause membrane pore blockage and are not fully removed by physical cleaning of the membrane uv irradiation significantly reduced r ir and the decline degree of r ir was in the order 365 nm 275 nm 300 nm according to the dom fraction analysis results fig 10 photocatalysis degraded protein like materials of 1 4 kda which are closely related to r ir during membrane filtration chen et al 2017 the modified hermia s model was used to clarify the membrane fouling mechanism for real water filtration k values and goodness of fit r2 values for the modified hermia s models during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water are shown in table 2 the results showed that the partial blocking was the dominant mechanism the fitting of the partial blockage model to the flux data is shown in fig s11 after uv irradiation pore blockage constant k i was reduced indicating that the degradation of 1 4 kda protein like materials reduced the extent of membrane pore blockage thereby changing membrane fouling from irreversible to reversible the correlations between fouling index r ir r r and k i and the percentage reductions in specific dom peaks in permeate water were investigated the correlations between fouling resistance r ir and r r with the percentage reductions in specific dom peaks were shown in table s10 r r had a negative relationship with the percentage reductions of 1 2 kda r2 0 48 and 2 4 kda r2 0 42 however r ir had a strong positive relationship with the percentage reductions of 4 15 kda r2 0 7 0 4 1 kda r2 0 88 and 0 01 0 4 kda r2 0 87 r r were highly negatively correlated with the percentage reductions of 1 2 kda r2 0 72 and 2 4 kda peak r2 0 86 but positively correlated with the percentage reductions of 0 4 1 kda r2 0 76 and 0 4 1 kda peak r2 0 7 thus we could conclude that the removal of 1 4 kda molecules contributed to the mitigation of both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance and the small molecules were the major cause of irreversible fouling resistance the correlations between r ir and the percentage reductions in eem peaks also showed that r ir had a strong negative relationship with the percentage reduction in protein like materials c1 c3 r2 0 62 thus the increased removal of 1 4 kda protein like materials led to a decrease in irreversible fouling fig s12 showed that k i had a strong linear relationship with the percentage reduction of 4 15 kda peak r2 0 82 but weak linear relationship with the percentage reduction of c1 c3 r2 0 33 indicating removal of 4 15 kda protein like materials explained the pore blockage fouling mechanism 4 conclusion this study elaborated the role of filtration and photocatalysis on dom fractional removal dbpfp and membrane fouling control the main conclusions are as follows 1 physical rejection primarily led to removal of 4 15 kda molecules and photocatalysis further increased the removal of 1 4 kda molecules causing small sized microbial humic like or hydrophilic protein like materials in the permeate and the addition of ca2 and h2o2 further increased the removal of these substances 2 irrespective of dom sources in situ uv led photocatalysis had an excellent effect on membrane fouling mitigation correlation analysis revealed that the removal of 1 4 kda molecules contributed to the mitigation of both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance the mechanisms of membrane fouling under uv treatment could be well elucidated by the modified hermia s model the dominant fouling mechanism changed from partial blockage to gel layer formation with increasing ca2 concentration but did not change with uv treatment the impact of uv led wavelengths made no significant impact on the fouling mechanism but dom sources did for srnom removal of 1 4 kda terrestrial humic acid like led to the pore blockage mechanism and removal of 4 15 kda terrestrial humic acid like contributed to the gel layer formation for real water removal of 4 15 kda protein like materials described well with the pore blockage fouling mechanism 3 thmfp and haafp were both significantly reduced after photocatalytic ceramic membrane process but n dbpfp with high toxicity were not removed by filtration or by photocatalysis which deserves attention membrane rejection made higher contribution to dbpfp control than photocatalysis 4 365 nm uv led irradiation with high wall plug efficiency still showed strong effect on membrane fouling mitigation suggesting that commercial uv led is a suitable uv

15407,the use of ceramic membranes and ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds has advanced the application of photocatalytic membrane for water treatment we systematically evaluated the contribution of filtration and photocatalysis to dissolved organic matter dom removal and fouling mechanism during in situ uv led photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration the results showed that physical rejection primarily led to removal of 4 15 kda molecules and photocatalysis further increased the removal of 1 4 kda molecules causing small sized microbial humic like or protein like materials in the permeate in situ uv led photocatalysis had an excellent effect on membrane fouling mitigation regardless of dom sources the dominant fouling mechanism changed from partial blockage to gel layer formation with increasing ca2 concentration but did not change with uv treatment correlation analysis revealed that the removal of 1 4 kda molecules contributed to the mitigation of both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance and the small molecules were the major cause of irreversible fouling resistance removal of 1 4 kda terrestrial humic acid like contributed to the pore blockage mechanism for synthetic water removal of 4 15 kda protein like materials was closely correlated to the pore blockage mechanism for real water trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas formation potential fp were both significantly reduced after photocatalytic ceramic membrane process but precursors of nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps with high toxicity were not removed by filtration or by photocatalysis which deserves attention membrane rejection made higher contribution to better dbpfp control than photocatalysis this study provides novel insights into the impact

contribution of membrane filtration and photocatalysis to the removal of organic pollutants in the photocatalytic membrane process has not been clearly isolated and identified although numerous studies have revealed that aops can reduce the disinfection by product formation potential dbpfp by removing precursors from water some studies have shown that dbpfp removal increases after aop treatment wang et al 2021 during uv tio2 treatment dissolved organic matter dom is transformed but not fully mineralized which may lead to an increase in the dbpfp and change fouling behavior xiang et al 2020 for example some studies have shown that photocatalysis reduces most of the dbp precursors such as dissolved organic carbon and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 but increases the trihalomethane thm formation potential thmfp li et al 2011 as intermediate degradation products may be more likely to generate dbps because they are more reactive towards chlorine in hydroxylated moieties in dom gora et al 2018 dbps need to be considered during photocatalytic ceramic filtration substantial membrane fouling by dom during ultrafiltration in water treatment results in reduced membrane performance zhang et al 2022 specific dom fractions have been found to contribute more to fouling than the total dom mass winter et al 2016 photocatalytic treatment has been reported to lower the dom fraction and reduce cake layer fouling or increase pore blocking huang et al 2008 yang et al 2019 in situ uv irradiation of the catalytic membrane surface increased the efficacy of the treatment process however it is not yet well understood how in situ photocatalysis affects the dom retention by and membrane fouling of ceramic membranes especially for real water our previous study revealed that pollutant degradation occurs in the membrane pores li et al 2022 therefore we expected the entrapment of hydroxyl radicals in membrane pores to control pore blocking during an in situ photocatalytic ceramic membrane process which would improve the backwashing efficiency thus the effect of in situ photocatalysis on the flux and cleaning efficiency as well as the fouling control mechanisms require systematic elucidation in this study dom removal and dbpfp in feed water and permeate water during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration under the dark and uv led irradiation were simultaneously studied which aimed to identify the contribution of filtration and photocatalytic degradation a synthetic suwannee river natural organic matter srnom solution and real water were both tested to study the impact of water matrix on dom removal dbpfp and membrane fouling during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration excitation emission matrix eem spectra coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac and molecular weight mw distribution analysis were used to characterize dom fate the effect of in situ photocatalytic oxidation on membrane fouling was systematically investigated and elaborated through dom characterization and fouling analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials porous ceramic discs diameter 90 mm mw cutoff 15 kda were commercially available tami france tio2 rgo nanomaterials were prepared in the lab li et al 2022 srnom used as a model was obtained from the international humic substances society after the srnom was dissolved in deionized di water the ph was adjusted using a naoh solution and the solution was stirred for 24 h to prepare a stock srnom solution before filtration through the membrane the ph of the srnom solution was adjusted to 7 0 using hcl and naoh solutions sand filter effluent of a water treatment plant in beijing was used as real water and was stored at 4 c the srnom solution and real water were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and then analyzed for water quality as shown in table s1 2 2 photocatalytic ceramic membrane preparation photocatalytic ceramic membranes were prepared as described in our previous study li et al 2019a briefly composite tio2 rgo nanomaterials were first prepared using hydrothermal methods with go contents of 1 6 wt and then were coated on porous ceramic discs through vacuum filtration photocatalytic ceramic membranes were prepared after heating at 360 for 2 h in this paper the photocatalytic ceramic membrane is termed mcm and the pristine ceramic membrane is referred to as pcm 2 3 photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration process the process of ceramic photocatalytic membrane filtration combined with uv led irradiation is shown in fig 1 a homemade photocatalytic membrane reactor was constructed by machining a quartz window on the upper membrane surface to allow uv irradiation of the surface fig s1a the pearllab beamtm uv led apparatus used in this study was purchased from aquisense technologies erlanger ky usa the reactor contains three leds that emit at 275 300 and 365 nm and has an input voltage of 12v and a current of 1 2 a the uv led parameters provided by the manufacturer are shown in table s2 the distance between the led apparatus and the solution was approximately 3 cm the light intensity of the 275 300 and 365 nm uv leds at the center of the solution surface was measured to be 0 79 0 07 1 08 0 15 and 13 27 1 41 mw cm 2 respectively using a radiometer all cross flow filtrations were conducted in recycled mode with a constant transmembrane pressure of 1 bar experiments in the dark i e without uv irradiation for the mcm and photolysis for the pcm under uv irradiation were conducted as control experiments to calculate the physical retention and direct photolysis respectively to study the photocatalytic ceramic membrane process for the mcm the uv led apparatus was turned on membrane flux was recorded using a data acquisition system equipped with a balance the membrane flux is 95 1 1 0 l m2 h bar for clean pcm and 92 6 3 6 l m2 h bar for clean mcm srnom solution with a total organic carbon toc concentration of 5 5 mg l was filtrated for 3 h the effects of an external oxidant 0 5 mm h2o2 and ca2 1 mm in the feed water on dom removal were also investigated real water was also tested in the dark and under uv irradiation using the same operating conditions as those used for srnom solution filtration the retentate and permeate were recycled back to the feed tank based on the mass balance in this recycled mode dom removal from the feed water after filtration was ascribed to membrane adsorption alone in the dark experiments and to photocatalytic degradation for filtration under uv irradiation dom removal from the permeate water after filtration was ascribed to physical rejection by the mcm in the dark experiments and to physical rejection and photocatalytic degradation for filtration under uv irradiation feed and permeate samples were collected from the feed tank and permeate side at regular intervals for dom characterization untreated srnom solution and real water samples are denoted as fw0 feed water samples after 3 h of ceramic membrane filtration are denoted as fw3h and permeate water samples after 3 h of filtration are denoted as pw3h to analyze fouling resistance the membranes were physically washed using forward flushing with di water for 10 min for chemical cleaning the fouled membranes were soaked in 0 1 mol l naoh solution at 85 c for 15 min and then in 0 5 mol l h2po3 solution at 50 c for 15 min the flux recovery rate for the ceramic membranes after chemical cleaning was 100 which indicated that the membranes were clean and could be reused in subsequent experiments 2 4 analytical methods for toc and dbpfp analysis h2o2 was quenched using catalase the concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the feed and permeate water was determined based on uv254 and using a toc analyzer excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan was used to characterize the organic components eem spectra were measured at excitation wavelengths of 200 500 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm both in 5 nm increments at a scan speed of 1 200 nm min mw distribution was analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a uv vis detector lc 20ad shimadzu japan the mobile phase consisted of 10 mmol l nahco3 methanol polystyrene sulfonate sodium mws of 4 230 da 6 520 da 29 100 da and 80 100 da and salicylic acid 138 da were used as calibration standards size exclusion chromatograms for the standards and linear regression of log mw versus elution time are shown in fig s1 b and c thmfp haloacetic acid haa formation potential haafp and nitrogenous n dbpfp were investigated under uniform formation conditions water samples were treated as described by fang et al 2021 the chlorine dose required for each sample to achieve a chlorine content of 1 0 mg l cl2 after storage in the dark at room temperature for 24 h was determined using a chlorine requirement experiment the chlorinated samples were quenched with na2s2o3 and immediately subjected to dbp analyses thms including trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm chlorodibromomethane cdbm and tribromomethane tbm haas including chloroacetic acid mcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa and n dbps including trichloroacetonitrile tcan trichloronitromethane tcnm bichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloropropanone tcp bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban were detected using gas chromatography electron capture detection gc 6890n agilent according to us environmental protection agency methods 551 1 and 552 2 the detection limits for dbps were 5 ug l dbp toxicity to animals and humans was evaluated based on the median lethal concentration lc50 the lc50 values of the various dbps are summarized in table s3 the measured molar dbp concentration divided by the lc50 value dbp lc50 was calculated to evaluate the theoretical cytotoxicity of the total dbps these methods have been used to evaluate the toxic effects of detected dbps and the contribution of each dbp to the total toxicity 2 5 mathematical analysis 2 5 1 specific peak removal for each dom fraction specific peak removal based on mw

obtained through di water filtration r t is obtained through fouling experiments and r irr is obtained through di water filtration after membrane cleaning experiments 2 5 4 modified hermia s model the

time were fitted to the equations shown in table s4 through nonlinear optimization using a curve fitting tool in matlab and the trust region method 2 5 5 eem parafac eem parafac modeling was conducted in matlab v 2010a mathworks usa using the domfluor toolbox based on the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 parafac models with 3 to 7 components were applied the most suitable number of model components was validated through split half analysis the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax values of the components identified were used to determine the relative amounts of individual dom components 3 results and discussion 3 1 fractional dom removal during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of srnom dom removal efficiency was shown in fig s2 mcm presented a higher dom removal rate than the pcm in addition ca2 decreased toc removal through reduced electrostatic repulsion fig s2a fig s2b showed that uv irradiation decreased the total toc retention compared with the filtration alone in dark test which may be due to the degradation of large dom molecules into small molecules rather than mineralization varying the uv wavelength did not affect the toc removal efficiency 3 1 1 spectroscopic characteristics of dom the parafac model output showed that three fluorescent components were identified based on the eem data of all srnom samples fig s3 component 1 c1 exhibited primary and secondary maxima at 250 448 nm ex em and 315 448 nm ex em respectively which are assigned to terrestrial humic like t humic like components the fluorescence peaks at 275 475 nm for component 2 c2 are also assigned to t humic like components component 3 c3 with prominent peaks at 225 400 nm is related to microbial humic like m humic like fluorescence generally the red shifting of eem fluorescence suggests a higher degree of aromaticity or a larger mw ly et al 2018 hence the molecular size of humic acid like components followed the order of c2 c1 c3 as shown in table s5 the ratio of c1 c2 and c3 in the srnom solution were 44 9 31 5 and 23 6 respectively the percentage reductions in all peaks of the eem fluorescence spectra for both feed and permeate water are shown in fig 2 the removal of c1 and c2 from the feed water increased after ca2 addition in the dark experiment fig 2a indicating that ca2 promotes the adsorption of t humic like substances on the membrane surface through enhanced electrostatic attraction the surface charge of ceramic membrane is measured as 30 2 2 0 mv in our previous study li et al 2019a which is supposed to increase in the presence of ca2 the compositional removal in dom from the feed water were in the order c2 c1 c3 this is likely to be attributed to the existence of large aromatic and unsaturated substances in c2 that are more reactive towards oxidants and have more reactive sites gao et al 2020b lamsal et al 2011 negative removal of c3 in feed water indicated the c3 formation during photocatalytic process which may be a microbial transformation product of terrestrial dom c2 or c3 ly et al 2018 higher removal of c1 and c2 and less c3 formed under 365 nm uv and 365 nm uv h2o2 than those under 300 and 275 nm uv light indicating more effective photocatalytic degradation of dom fractions in addition the presence of ca2 promoted the photocatalytic oxidation of t humic like materials due to improved adsorption of them onto the membrane surface mariquit et al 2008 the compositional removal in dom from the permeate water was in the order c1 c2 c3 fig 2b dom removal from the permeate water was due to the combined effects of photocatalysis and physical retention high fraction of c3 in permeate water were found due to formed intermediate by products which were not retained by the mcm which is also reported by gonzález et al 2013 thus higher c3 content were found in the presence of ca2 in the permeate water due to stronger photocatalytic oxidation of c1 and c2 3 1 2 molecular weight distribution of dom the mw distribution of srnom was in the range of 0 1 15 kda with a major peak at 4 15 kda the mw distributions of feed and permeate water after srnom filtration through a ceramic membrane are shown in fig s4 a d showing larger molecular size of molecules in the presence of ca2 the calculated percentage reductions in all peaks of feed water through adsorption and degradation are shown in fig 3a for the pcm under uv irradiation only a small amount of 4 15 kda organic substances was decomposed by photolysis fig s4a the removal of 1 4 kda organic matters increased significantly due to photodegradation for mcm under uv irradiation the degradation efficiency was higher at 365 nm than at 300 nm and 275 nm fig s4c the calculated percentage reductions in all peaks of the mw distribution of permeate water through physical retention and degradation are shown in fig 3b it can be seen that the mcm showed better dom retention than the pcm while the addition of ca2 decreased the rejection of organic matter in the dark test fig s4b compared with the filtration alone in the dark photocatalysis further increased the total removal of 1 4 kda organic matters h2o2 addition further enhanced the reduction of the 1 15 kda peak fig s4d h2o2 as an external electron acceptor has been reported to inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes and produce hydroxyl radicals thus strengthening photocatalysis li et al 2022 further 0 1 1 kda organics were not degraded nor physically retained by the mcm thus we need to pay more attention to low mw organics in the 0 1 1 kda range together dom removal mechanism under uv led irradiation were concluded based on the dom characterization results the mcm showed significantly enhanced removal of molecules of 4 15 kda and 1 4 kda through photocatalytic membrane filtration compared with the pcm the contribution of filtration and photocatalysis to the dom fractional removal were elucidated 4 15 kda terrestrial humic like substances were physically rejected and 1 4 kda terrestrial humic like substances were further degraded low mw microbial humic like substances in the 0 1 1 kda range formed during photocatalysis the presence of ca2 and h2o2 further increased degradation of terrestrial humic like substances 3 2 dbp formation potential during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of srnom dbpfp reduction is not only due to enhanced toc removal but also due to the selective removal of dom fractions he et al 2020 the thmfp haafp and n dbpfp of the feed and permeate water after 3 h of treatment are shown in fig 4 a c respectively the major components of thmfp are tcmfp and bdcmfp and the concentration of cdbmfp and tbmfp below the detection limit were not shown in fig 4a the tcmfp was dramatically reduced in the feed and permeate whereas the bdcmfp remained nearly unchanged indicating that most tcm precursors are removed by the filtration and photocatalysis furthermore photocatalysis was found to cause higher thmfp compared with filtration alone due to the formation of low molecular weight microbial substances during photocatalytic process 365 nm uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 led to better thmfp control than other conditions the major component of haafp is mcaafp tcaafp dcaafp and mbaafp fig 4b photocatalytic degradation made significant contribution to the reduction in the precursors of mcaa and tcaa tcaa precursors are more easily degraded which may be because tcaa precursors have a higher mw higher aromaticity and weaker hydrophilicity gao et al 2019 li et al 2011 photocatalysis combined with filtration resulted in a better haafp control than filtration alone 275 nm uv irradiation led to better haafp control than 365 nm and 300 nm uv irradiation the major components of n dbpfp are bcanfp tcnmfp and tcpfp fig 4c the tcpfp and tcnmfp of the permeate water were dramatically decreased in the dark experiment indicating that tcp and tcnm precursors are removed by filtration alone after photocatalytic treatment the tcpfp and bcanfp of the feed water decreased whereas the tcnmfp increased higher tcnmfp in the permeate were also found after photocatalytic membrane filtration combined with the results of mw distribution analysis this suggests that tcnm precursors are mainly small molecules generated during photocatalysis and cannot be retained by the membrane resulting in a higher tcnmfp of the permeate water after uv irradiation than in the dark photocatalysis combined with filtration also resulted in a better n dbpfp control than filtration alone 365 nm uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 led to better n dbpfp control than other conditions as shown in table s6 the removal rate of the dbpfp of the permeate water after photocatalytic membrane filtration of srnom solution reached 52 69 with catalytic degradation accounting for 24 5 44 among the three dbps the removal rates were in the order haafp thmfp n dbpfp indicating that n dbp precursors could not be effectively removed by filtration or photocatalytic degradation photocatalysis combined with filtration resulted in a better haafp and n dbpfp control than filtration alone but increased thmfp the transformation of less reactive hydrophobic dom into more reactive hydrophilic dom during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration increases the thmfp borikar et al 2015 3 3 membrane fouling control during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration 3 3 1 effects of membrane modification and ca2 inclusion as shown in fig 5a ca2 aggravated the flux decline during membrane fouling in a concentration dependent manner for both the pcm and mcm in the absence of ca2 the mcm showed less flux decline than the pcm however in the presence of ca2 the flux reduction of the mcm was lower than that of the pcm in the initial stage of filtration but became higher than that of the pcm in the later stage of filtration the effect of membrane modification on fouling mitigation was weakened because the nanomaterial coating is further modified during filtration with dom especially in the presence of ca2 membrane fouling resistance analysis results showed that ca2 significantly increased the total fouling resistance especially irreversible fouling fig 5b ca2 can strengthen the interactions between foulants and the membrane surface through the bridge effect thus hampering foulant removal by physical cleaning compared with the pcm the mcm reduced both r r and r ir in the absence of ca2 however in the presence of ca2 the total fouling resistance of the mcm increased whereas r ir r f decreased the anti fouling performance of the mcm was mainly because of the increased negative charge and hydrophilicity of the mcm surface resulting in weakened electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the foulants the modified hermia s model was used to clarify the mechanisms of membrane fouling the goodness of fit r 2 values of all hermia s models to the experimental data are listed in table s7 a higher r 2 value indicates a higher degree of model fitting xing et al 2018 the major fouling mechanisms for the pcm are partial blockage and complete blockage whereas the major fouling mechanisms for the mcm are partial blockage and gel layer formation fig s5 presents the model fitting results for partial blockage the dominant fouling mechanism changed from partial blockage to gel layer formation with increasing ca2 concentration 3 3 2 effect of uv led irradiation as shown in fig 6a the permeate flux of the mcm gradually decreased during srnom filtration but the flux decline was mitigated under uv irradiation the flux decline was reduced in the order 365 nm uv h2o2 365 nm uv 300 nm uv 275 nm uv membrane fouling resistance analysis showed that the total fouling resistance especially r r was reduced under uv irradiation whereas uv had a limited effect on r ir probably because of an altered foulant composition fig 6b shi et al 2015 uv irradiation at 365 nm reduced both r r and r ir and uv irradiation at 300 nm and 275 nm mainly decreased r r compared with 365 nm uv irradiation the total fouling resistance was further reduced after h2o2 addition the preferential degradation of hydrophobic dom with higher mw during uv irradiation can effectively control r r because hydrophobic organic matter shows low adhesion to the membrane surface and is not adsorbed in the membrane pores awfa et al 2020 huang et al 2008 in addition the adhesion forces of foulant membrane and foulant foulant were found to be decreased after photocatalysis thereby mitigating reversible membrane fouling zhu et al 2018 however the small and hydrophilic molecules generated during photocatalytic degradation are more likely to cause an increase in r ir r f the goodness of fit r2 values of all hermia s models to the experimental flux data are listed in table 1 the results show that the partial blockage model could predict the permeate flux better than the other models the partial blockage model fit to the experimental data is shown in fig s6 after uv irradiation the dominant fouling mechanism did not change but the goodness of fit of the gel layer model was lower than that of the complete blocking model indicating that the macromolecular organic matter deposited on the membrane surface was degraded into small molecules leading to increased membrane pore blocking k i represents the proportion of membrane surface blockage per unit of water passing through the membrane the increased k i value after uv irradiation indicated that the degree of membrane surface blockage increased meanwhile the value of the gel layer coefficient k gl decreased after uv treatment this indicated that the photocatalytic degradation of 1 4 kda terrestrial humic like substances prevented large molecule pollutants from accumulating on the membrane surface and reduced the extent of gel layer formation thereby decreasing reversible membrane fouling in conclusion uv irradiation has a limited effect on the alleviation of r ir but alleviates r r to a large extent 3 3 3 membrane fouling mitigation mechanism the correlations between fouling parameters r ir r r k i and k gl and the percentage reductions in specific dom peaks in permeate water were investigated to identify the contributions of dom fractions to membrane fouling fig 7a showed that r r had a strong positive relationship with the percentage reduction of 4 15 kda substances r2 0 85 and a weak negative relationship with 1 4 kda substances r2 0 17 thus the removal of 4 15 kda substances were the major cause of reversible resistance and removal of 1 4 kda substances contributed to the mitigation of reversible resistance r ir had a strong negative relationship with the percentage reductions of 1 4 kda r2 0 59 and 0 01 1 kda substances r2 0 71 indicating that the removal of small molecules contributed to the mitigation of irreversible resistance the correlations between fouling resistance and percentage reductions in eem peaks fig 7b showed that r r had a strong negative relationship with the percentage reductions in c1 r2 0 73 and r ir had a strong negative relationship with c2 r2 0 83 indicating that the removal of c1 contributed to the mitigation of reversible resistance and removal of c2 contributed to the mitigation of irreversible resistance fig 7 c and d showed that k i had a strong linear relationship with the percentage reduction of 1 4 kda peak r2 0 62 and c1 r2 0 77 indicating removal of 1 4 kda c1 led to the pore blockage fouling mechanism k gl had a strong linear relationship with the percentage reduction of 4 15 kda r2 0 76 and c2 r2 0 73 suggesting removal of 4 15 kda c2 contributed to the gel layer formation as shown in fig 7 e and f 3 4 photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water 3 4 1 fractional dom removal dom degradation measured as a change in uv254 in feed water and permeate water during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water is shown in fig s7 after 3 h uv irradiation the dom degradation rate in the feed water was approximately 25 as seen from fig s7a the degradation rate under 365 nm uv irradiation was slightly higher than that under 300 and 275 nm uv irradiation fig s7b shows the fluence based reaction kinetics which indicate that the fluence based reaction rate constant for 365 nm uv was an order of magnitude lower than that for 300 nm and 275 nm uv thus the observed high dom removal over time under 365 nm uv irradiation was due to the higher uv light intensity the low wall plug efficiency of 300 nm and 275 nm uv leds is the major factor affecting the light intensity with the development of technology the wall plug efficiency of uv leds at low wavelengths is expected to increase making them a promising uv source for the photodegradation of dom by uv based aops in the future uv254 rejection by the mcm in the permeate water during the treatment of real water in the dark was approximately 50 fig s7c after uv irradiation the uv254 rejection decreased which suggested that large organic molecules were degraded to small molecules that cannot be retained by the mcm parafac model output showed that three fluorescent components were identified based on the eem dataset of all real water samples fig s8 c1 exhibited primary and secondary maxima at 225 350 nm ex em and 275 350 nm ex em respectively which are assigned to protein like fluorescence or tryptophan like components c2 exhibited primary and secondary maxima at 255 425 nm ex em and 310 425 nm ex em respectively which are assigned to t humic like components c3 exhibited major peaks at 210 290 nm implying the presence of tyrosine like aromatic proteins eem spectra showed that the major dom fractions in the real water were significantly different from those in the srnom solution as shown in table s8 the protein like components c1 and c3 were the most dominant in real water 88 2 whereas the terrestrial humic like component c2 was present in a minor amount 11 8 thus the main components of real water are protein like substances which are mostly hydrophilic and low mw organics humic like substances containing a large proportion of aromatic structures are more prone to be attacked by oxidants than large biopolymers including protein like substances maqbool et al 2020a this explains why the photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration treatment efficiency was lower for real water than for synthetic srnom solution which contains more humic like organics the percentage reductions in the peaks of three fluorescent components in feed water are shown in fig 8a after uv irradiation the protein like substances were preferentially degraded and 356 nm uv treatment led to higher degradation of terrestrial humic like components of the feed water fig 8b shows that in permeate water the removal of protein like substances increased but degraded terrestrial humic like components were also found leading to a decrease in the removal rate of c2 photocatalysis combined with filtration resulted in higher dom removal than filtration alone the mw distribution of real water showed 5 peaks of 0 01 0 4 kda 0 4 1 kda 1 2 kda 2 4 kda and 4 15 kda fig s9 most of the organic substances in real water had lower mws than those in the srnom solution the percentage reductions in the peaks through filtration and photocatalysis are shown in fig 8c in the dark experiment the adsorption capacity of the membrane surface was approximately 5 and organic substances of 4 15 kda were physically rejected by the mcm as the proportion of 4 15 kda organic matter in real water was relatively low toc rejection by the mcm was only 10 15 after the photocatalytic ceramic membrane treatment the percentage reduction in molecules of 1 4 kda was significantly increased due to photocatalysis 365 nm uv treatment had a stronger degradation effect on 1 4 kda molecules the percentage reduction in 0 01 0 4 kda molecules in the permeate water was negative because of the degradation of 1 4 kda molecules into 0 01 0 4 kda molecules which were entirely transported across the mcm thus 4 15 kda organic matters were mainly removed through filtration while 1 4 kda organic matters were further removed through photocatalysis 3 4 2 dbp formation potential thmfp haafp and n dbpfp after photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water are shown in fig s10 table s9 lists the dbpfp removal rates for the feed and permeate water after photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water in the dark dbpfp were both decreased by only physical retention however photocatalysis was found to cause higher dbpfp compared with filtration alone due to the formation of small protein like substances during photocatalysis combined with the dom characterization results this finding indicated that protein like molecules of 0 01 0 4 kda generated during photocatalytic degradation led to an increase in the dbpfp among the three types of dbpfp the removal rate was in the order thmfp haafp n dbpfp indicating that n dbp precursors in real water were hardly removed by filtration or photocatalysis comparing the three uv wavelengths 365 nm uv irradiation exhibited better thmfp control which may be due to the higher degradation of terrestrial humic like components the total removal rate of dbpfp in the permeate water was 19 46 and that in the feed water was 6 21 in addition to the dbp concentration dbp toxicity has to be considered dbp lc50 was used to calculate the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbps as shown in fig 9 dbp toxicity after 3 h of photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water was not reduced and mbaa dban and bcan contributed the most to toxicity although the thms and haas fp were reduced after photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration their contribution to total toxicity is low therefore we need to pay attention to the removal of precursors of dban and bcan with high toxicity pca parameters and heat map for pearson correlation were applied to study complex relationship between dbpfp and fluorescence indicators of both srnom and real water as illustrated in fig 10 the principal component 1 pc1 explained for 82 8 of the total variances while the pc2 was responsible for 10 2 of the variation humic like substances 4 15 kda 1 4 kda materials and dbpfp are strongly positively correlated and protein like substances and freshness are strongly correlated thus humic like materials were mostly responsible for precursors of tested dbps based on data from feed water and permeate water we could conclude that the filtration did not make significant impact on the relationship between dbpfp and spectroscopic indicators as shown in the fig s10 it showed that uv treatment made no significant impact on the relationship between dbpfp and spectroscopic indicators based on samples divided into dark and uv treatment groups all the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between dbpfp and each parameter were higher than 0 8 the occurrence of thms haas and n dbps in feed and permeate water could sufficiently be explained by eem parafac modeling and mw distribution 3 4 3 membrane fouling mitigation mechanism the membrane flux change during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water is shown in fig 11a the results suggest that uv irradiation slows down the decline in flux caused by membrane fouling and the degree of mitigation was in the order 365 nm 275 nm 300 nm as shown in fig 11b the fraction of r ir was substantially higher than that of r r during real water filtration dom fractions greatly contributed to the fouling mechanism the major organic compounds in real water were hydrophilic protein like materials with relatively low mws which are more likely to cause membrane pore blockage and are not fully removed by physical cleaning of the membrane uv irradiation significantly reduced r ir and the decline degree of r ir was in the order 365 nm 275 nm 300 nm according to the dom fraction analysis results fig 10 photocatalysis degraded protein like materials of 1 4 kda which are closely related to r ir during membrane filtration chen et al 2017 the modified hermia s model was used to clarify the membrane fouling mechanism for real water filtration k values and goodness of fit r2 values for the modified hermia s models during photocatalytic ceramic membrane filtration of real water are shown in table 2 the results showed that the partial blocking was the dominant mechanism the fitting of the partial blockage model to the flux data is shown in fig s11 after uv irradiation pore blockage constant k i was reduced indicating that the degradation of 1 4 kda protein like materials reduced the extent of membrane pore blockage thereby changing membrane fouling from irreversible to reversible the correlations between fouling index r ir r r and k i and the percentage reductions in specific dom peaks in permeate water were investigated the correlations between fouling resistance r ir and r r with the percentage reductions in specific dom peaks were shown in table s10 r r had a negative relationship with the percentage reductions of 1 2 kda r2 0 48 and 2 4 kda r2 0 42 however r ir had a strong positive relationship with the percentage reductions of 4 15 kda r2 0 7 0 4 1 kda r2 0 88 and 0 01 0 4 kda r2 0 87 r r were highly negatively correlated with the percentage reductions of 1 2 kda r2 0 72 and 2 4 kda peak r2 0 86 but positively correlated with the percentage reductions of 0 4 1 kda r2 0 76 and 0 4 1 kda peak r2 0 7 thus we could conclude that the removal of 1 4 kda molecules contributed to the mitigation of both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance and the small molecules were the major cause of irreversible fouling resistance the correlations between r ir and the percentage reductions in eem peaks also showed that r ir had a strong negative relationship with the percentage reduction in protein like materials c1 c3 r2 0 62 thus the increased removal of 1 4 kda protein like materials led to a decrease in irreversible fouling fig s12 showed that k i had a strong linear relationship with the percentage reduction of 4 15 kda peak r2 0 82 but weak linear relationship with the percentage reduction of c1 c3 r2 0 33 indicating removal of 4 15 kda protein like materials explained the pore blockage fouling mechanism 4 conclusion this study elaborated the role of filtration and photocatalysis on dom fractional removal dbpfp and membrane fouling control the main conclusions are as follows 1 physical rejection primarily led to removal of 4 15 kda molecules and photocatalysis further increased the removal of 1 4 kda molecules causing small sized microbial humic like or hydrophilic protein like materials in the permeate and the addition of ca2 and h2o2 further increased the removal of these substances 2 irrespective of dom sources in situ uv led photocatalysis had an excellent effect on membrane fouling mitigation correlation analysis revealed that the removal of 1 4 kda molecules contributed to the mitigation of both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance the mechanisms of membrane fouling under uv treatment could be well elucidated by the modified hermia s model the dominant fouling mechanism changed from partial blockage to gel layer formation with increasing ca2 concentration but did not change with uv treatment the impact of uv led wavelengths made no significant impact on the fouling mechanism but dom sources did for srnom removal of 1 4 kda terrestrial humic acid like led to the pore blockage mechanism and removal of 4 15 kda terrestrial humic acid like contributed to the gel layer formation for real water removal of 4 15 kda protein like materials described well with the pore blockage fouling mechanism 3 thmfp and haafp were both significantly reduced after photocatalytic ceramic membrane process but n dbpfp with high toxicity were not removed by filtration or by photocatalysis which deserves attention membrane rejection made higher contribution to dbpfp control than photocatalysis 4 365 nm uv led irradiation with high wall plug efficiency still showed strong effect on membrane fouling mitigation suggesting that commercial uv led is a suitable uv

15408,globally the reuse of treated sewage effluent for irrigation purposes is increasingly encouraged as a practical solution against the mismatch between the demand for and availability of freshwater resources the reuse of sewage effluent for sub surface irrigation ssi in agriculture serves the dual purpose of supplying water to crops and diminishing emissions of contaminants of emerging concern coecs into surface water to investigate such reuse in a real scale cropland with ssi using sewage effluent from september 2017 to march 2019 including the extremely dry year 2018 residues were followed of 133 coecs as related to their physicochemical properties and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry of the 133 target coecs 89 were retrieved in the field most non detect coecs have low persistency during the growing season with sub surface irrigation coecs spread to the shallow groundwater and rhizosphere significantly lower concentrations are found between infiltration pipes as compared to directly next to the pipes in shallow groundwater for all persistency mobility classes coecs belonging to the class pm low persistency and low mobility or class pm high persistency and high mobility class show no change amongst their removal in the rhizosphere and groundwater in a dry versus normal year coecs belonging to the class pm low persistency and high mobility show high seasonal dynamics in the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater indicating that these coecs break down coecs of the class pm high persistency and low mobility only significantly build up in the rhizosphere next to infiltration pipes climatic conditions with dry summers and precipitation surplus and drainage in winter strongly affect the fate of coecs during the dry summer of 2018 infiltrated effluent is hardly diluted resulting in significantly higher concentrations for the coecs belonging to the classes pm and pm after the extremely dry year of 2018 cumulative concentrations are still significantly higher while after a normal year during winter precipitation surplus removes coecs for all persistency mobility classes in the shallow groundwater between the pipes we find significant removal efficiencies for the rhizosphere between the pipes we find the same except for pm next to the pipes however we find no significant removal for all classes in both the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater and even significant accumulation for pm for this group of persistent moderately hydrophobic coecs risk characterization ratio s were calculated for the period of time with the highest normalized concentration none of the single chemical rcrs are above one and the σrcr is also far below one implying sufficiently safe ambient exposures overall the deeper groundwater 7 0 11 8 m below soil surface has the lowest response to the sub surface irrigation for all persistency mobility when adopting a ssi stp effluent reuse system care must be taken to monitor the coecs that are moderately hydrophobic as these can build up in the ssi system for the deeper groundwater and for the discharge to the surface water we find significant removal for the pm and the pm class but not for other classes in conclusion relatively high removal efficiencies are shown benefiting the surface waters that would otherwise receive the

accounting for 69 of freshwater withdrawal food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2021 while significant attention has been paid to the more arid regions of the world maceda veiga et al 2018 temperate climates also suffer from seasonal droughts hänsel et al 2019 narain ford et al 2021 rey et al 2017 the pressure on the availability of freshwater resources will continue to increase due to global change which will enhance prolonged dry periods and thus freshwater demands from several sectors bijl et al 2018 de vos et al 2021 hence it is crucial that options for the exploitation of alternative freshwater resources such as sewage treatment plant stp effluent are explored intentional reuse of stp effluent can compensate for water shortages caused by seasonality or by irregular availability of other water sources for agricultural irrigation throughout the year hristov et al 2021 such intentional reuse offers better control and management possibilities than currently practiced de facto reuse drewes et al 2017 additionally when using sub surface irrigation ssi as a method of supply de wit et al 2022 the quality of stp effluent may improve due to the soil passage and related biodegradation processes also benefiting the receiving surface waters narain ford et al 2020 nonetheless the fate of the contaminants of emerging concern coecs present in the effluent such as pharmaceuticals biocides personal care products and their transformation products in ssi systems is not yet fully understood likewise direct evidence on the effects of re using treated effluent for ssi under real farming conditions on the fate of a broad selection of coecs is currently lacking narain ford et al 2020 revitt et al 2021 of particular concern is the persistent fraction of these contaminants reemtsma et al 2016 most persistent coecs capable of bioaccumulation are nonpolar and inherently poorly water soluble therefore they are readily removed in stps through sorption processes and preferably sorb to sewage sludge the remaining persistent hydrophobic fraction that reaches croplands through ssi might lead to soil concentrations building up over time christou et al 2019 persistent and mobile organic compounds also known as pmocs are a concern for water quality because they are not well removed from water by sorption processes due to their high polarity and thus water solubility liu et al 2021 reemtsma et al 2016 these persistent compounds may then result in the exposure of crops and deep groundwater and pose related risks to human health and the environment therefore a better understanding is needed of the environmental fate processes i e degradation sorption and horizontal and vertical leaching of coecs in these sub surface irrigation systems and the consequences for exposure to humans and ecosystems only limited quantitative data is available regarding the behavior and fate of many of coecs in full scale setups where real stp effluent was applied to croplands representing actual farming practices ben mordechay et al 2021 revitt et al 2021 as compared to pilot or lab scale studies christou et al 2017a kesari et al 2021 these full scale studies solely focus on aboveground irrigation techniques such as sprinkler spray and drip irrigation during ssi water is introduced into shallow groundwater and then capillary rise provides irrigation to the crop hence while aboveground irrigation captures primarily aerobic processes ssi includes both aerobic and anaerobic processes narain ford et al 2020 generally the biodegradation of coecs in soil is faster and more complete under aerobic conditions topsoil as compared to anaerobic conditions deeper layers of the vadose zone christou et al 2017a aerobic biodegradation may result in the fast initial enzymatic attack and the decomposition of alkyl side chains and other easily degradable factional groups e g carboxyl groups whereas anaerobic biodegradation may include various enzymatic processes that biodegrade more complex and stable functional groups and structural moieties such as aromatic groups naphthalene rings and sulfonamides greskowiak et al 2017 luo et al 2019 so far most studies investigating the fate of coecs in agricultural soils have been under aerobic conditions while information about their persistence in the absence of oxygen is still scarce especially in the context of relevant coecs concentrations christou et al 2017a the interplay between aerobic and anaerobic processes has been studied before in e g in riverbank filtration albergamo et al 2019 hamann et al 2016 and constructed wetlands he et al 2021 hübner et al 2022 however these systems were constructed primarily for purification purposes while ssi primarily serves as an irrigation system with relatively short residence times with regard to crop uptake and longer residence times for groundwater seepage narain ford et al 2020 this study aims to identify and quantify coecs in a real scale cropland with direct reuse of stp effluent in a sub surface irrigation system we study the fate of coecs in relation to their physicochemical properties half life in soil range of 0 4 1194 days and log dow range of 2 77 to 5 67 pore water and groundwater samples were collected at various depths 0 2 to 11 8 m and we analyzed 133 coecs relevant for effluents such as herbicides industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals personal care products and their transformation products such an extensive analysis of a real scale experimental site under real farming conditions is novel and ensures that the environmental fate processes such as an aerobic degradation sorption drainage and leaching occur under realistic conditions this study captured september 2017 march 2019 including the extremely dry year of 2018 to elucidate the maximum influence of the stp effluent reuse on croplands 2 material and methods 2 1 study area located in the east of the netherlands in haaksbergen lies the only dutch cropland 52 10 42 9 n 6 42 43 8 e which is intentionally and directly subsurfacely irrigated with municipal effluent during the growing season fig 1 infiltration of the effluent during the growing season occurs via a series of 6 m parallel pipes at a depth of 1 20 m at the cropland of 58 500 m2 maize intended for livestock feed is grown this cropland has ssi with stp effluent since 2015 as part of the initiative on alternative freshwater supply for agriculture in the dutch higher sandy soils region taken by the water management authority vechtstromen since the start of ssi in 2015 no other direct irrigation has taken place at this site as reference location the cropland without ssi on the other side of the surface water with the same farming conditions was selected an illustration of the monitoring wells installed at different depths in both the saturated and unsaturated zone is presented in si 1 of the supplementary information 2 2 sample collection five sampling episodes from september 2017 to april 2019 were carried out the period of sampling includes the extremely dry year of 2018 water balance components for the full time period are displayed in table 1 the irrigated stp effluent volume in the year 2017 was 562 2 mm whereas 502 8 mm was irrigated in 2018 the drainage volumes for 2017 were not measured in the year 2018 66 6 mm of water was drained wells that showed elevated chloride bromide ratio during ssi from the period 2015 2017 bartholomeus et al 2017 were chosen for sampling fig 1 pore water and groundwater samples were collected at several depths ranging from 0 20 m to 11 8 m below the soil surface table 2 to sample pore water pre installed rhizon samplers were used while the groundwater was sampled using pre installed mini filters apart from the

chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms the selection covers a broad range of physicochemical properties and represents a variety of chemical uses the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient expressed as log dow ph 7 4 which matches the effluent and field samples is used as a measure of mobility to account for ionizable coecs and ranges from 2 77 acesulfame to 5 69 flufenoxuron the ph was measured on site with a portable wtw meter the half life dt50 of coecs is used to embody persistency the persistency diverges from 0 4 days propanil to 1194 days 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam for parametrization of log d and half life data we followed preferences as explained in table 3 available data from the highest priority were used the coecs are assigned to four persistency mobility classes i e high persistency and high mobility pm high persistency and low mobility pm low persistency and high mobility pm and low persistency and low mobility pm as based on frequencies in the set of coecs of half lives and log d of all selected compounds fig 2 the empirical distribution function plots are presented in si 2 our 50th percentile cut off value of 57 day half

oasishlb 150 mg from waters etten leur the netherlands the cartridges were conditioned with 5 ml of methanol and equilibrated with 5 ml of ultrapure water the samples were loaded onto the cartridges and subsequently washed with 2 5 ml of ultrapure water and dried under vacuum for 20 min the cartridges were eluted 4 times with 2 5 ml of methanol the 10 ml extracts were filtered with 0 22mm ppfilters nantong filterbio membrane co ltd nantong china and evaporated to 0 5 ml then extracts were transferred to 1 5 ml pp lc vials and stored in the dark at 20 c prior to analysis the extracts were vortexed and diluted five times in ultrapure water to be more compatible with the aqueous mobile phase used for chromatography separation the procedure resulted in an enrichment factor of 20 and a concentration of isotope labeled standards equal to 2 µg l to match that of the standards used for the calibration series 2 4 3 lc hrms analysis the uhplc q tof ms ms analysis was performed on a

and limit of detection and quantification recoveries vary between 75 and 125 with residual standard deviation lower than 20 and 10 for intraday and interday repeatability was considered satisfactory limits of detection and limits of quantification recoveries and precision were investigated in 24h effluent and groundwater from our pilot site n 6 at concentrations matching the 5 lowest points of the calibration series calibration curves for quantification were calculated by analyzing ultrapure water spiked with 25 μg l of coecs and serially diluted to obtain 7 concentration levels with 390 63 ng l being the lowest concentration of the calibration series the spe method was suitable to further lower the detection limits by a factor of 20 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis for all measurements was performed with the r statistical environment r core team 2021 version 4 1 2 1 november 2021 all data used are based on means standard error se of three replicates except when stated differently and were first tested for normality by shapiro wilk tests if the significance value of the shapiro wilk test was below 0 05 the data was considered significantly deviated from a normal distribution as outlined by helsel et al 2020 when dealing with non normal data nonparametric tests can be many times more powerful than parametric tests a non parametric kruskal wallis kw test was used to compare the transport of coecs through time space and depth to account for dilution by precipitation groundwater and pore water coecs concentrations were normalized using the dilution factor of the artificial sweetener saccharin which is used as a tracer for effluent richards et al 2017 van stempvoort et al 2020 according to d f sach sample sach effluent where df is the dilution factor sach sample is the saccharin concentration of the sample and sach effluent is the saccharin concentration in the corresponding 24h effluent at our reference location saccharin was not detected thus it was excluded when normalizing for dates where the ssi was still inactive may 2018 and april 2019 we took the corresponding effluent before the stop of the growing season table 4 and further tested the robustness of our approach see si 6 the normalized coec concentration is then the measured coec concentration divided by df normalized concentrations were only used to calculate coec removal efficiencies expressed as related to the effluent for each chemical and each sampling location time and depth these removal efficiencies were then averaged per persistency mobility class for the rhizosphere next to and in between infiltration pipes for shallow groundwater next to and in between infiltration pipes and for deep groundwater the one sample wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine whether the removal efficiencies over the full sampling period differentiated from 0 comparisons between the removal efficiencies for the four persistency mobility classes were conducted with a non parametric kruskal wallis kw test the dunn test resulted in an adjusted p value based on the benjamin hochberg method 2 6 risk characterization risk characterizations were made by coupling normalized concentrations with hazard information from posthuma et al 2019 as policy adopted predicted no effect concentrations pnecs are lacking for many chemicals we used chronic noecs and acute ec50s distributions derived from ecotoxicity data posthuma et al 2019 risk characterization ratio s rcrs were obtained by dividing the normalized concentrations by the species sensitivity distributions ssd midpoint concentration the most acknowledged default mixture toxicity approach to yield σrcrs assumes that concentration addition is applicable for all components in the mixture martin et al 2021 in this approach environmental non toxic or acceptable risk conditions are defined by rcr 1 in the hypothetical case of single substance environments and σrcr 1 in case of co exposures rcr 1 and σrcr 1 define insufficient protection also referred to as unacceptable environmental risk in chemical safety assessment 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of coecs when stp effluent enters the shallow groundwater via ssi the coecs present in the effluent can migrate from shallow groundwater to the rhizosphere and or to deeper groundwater narain ford et al 2020 from the 133 coecs in our target list 89 are retrieved in our samples 39 out of the 44 coecs not detected belong to a class of low persistency and or mobility 16 pm 10 pm and 13 pm the remaining 5 non detected coecs are three transformation products tps and two biocides belonging to the pm class 57 out of the 89 detected coecs can be directly traced back to the stp effluent fig 3 the shallow groundwater 1 2 35 m below soil surface of the ssi system where the stp effluent enters shows the highest number of coecs 83 89 the deeper groundwater 5 11 8 m below surface has the lowest number of coecs coecs of the class pm low persistency and low mobility are underrepresented in all compartments from the 89 coecs detected seven out of 10 present in the target list are transformation products tps and are present variably across compartments si 7 of the supplementary information in the reference field shallow groundwater one sampling episode only two coecs from our target list are retrieved fig 4 shows the intersections of the compartments specified per persistency mobility class over the full sampling period columns 1 7 57 89 display the intersections that stp effluent has with the other five compartments only 2 57 coecs can be found in all six compartments of this study while 24 57 coecs can be found in all compartments except for the reference field and two coecs are exclusive to the stp effluent column 7 consequently 32 89 sum of columns 8 17 detected coecs not found in the compartments 24 h stp effluent nor in reference field can be found in other compartments inside of the ssi system and also in the ssi discharge to stream compartment of these 32 coecs only one is a transformation product only two of these parent compounds are of the class pm while the other 29 parent compounds are either highly persistent highly mobile or both when looking at the uses of the coecs not detected in the stp effluent compartment 11 are below the limit of quantification loq and the remaining 21 coecs can be classified as biocide 52 industrial chemical 10 and as pharmaceuticals personal care product 38 it is therefore likely that most of these coecs not detected in the stp effluent do occur in the effluent but are below the limit of detection also because of effluent matrix effects it is well known that stps are not optimized for the removal of highly persistent and or mobile coecs and stps are major contributors to coecs in the environment blum et al 2018 golovko et al 2021 serna galvis et al 2019 hence for further analysis of the transport of coecs and their subsequent removal we assumed that all 89 coecs 82 parent coecs and 7 tps originate from stp effluent 3 2 transport of coecs in time space and depth for the detected coecs overall detection frequencies ranged from 1 to 95 fig 5a 4 6 dinitro o cresol carbamazepine pfba gemfibrozil pfoa 1h benzotriazole bentazon saccharin mcpp p diclofenac acesulfame and pentachlorophenol were detected at over 50 across all sampling points over the full sampling period for all coecs their respective quantities are displayed in fig 5b with mean maximal concentrations of 1024 ng l in si 8 the detection frequency and non normalized concentration are presented separately for the rhizosphere shallow groundwater deeper groundwater and ssi discharge to the stream aside from the pm group having fewer coecs retrieved no clear differences in mean concentrations are observed between individual coecs among the four classes cumulative coecs concentrations of the four persistency and mobility classes are visualized in fig 6 for five time periods from sept 2017 to april 2019 in the ssi system see https doi org 10 17632 4x77nynfnx 1 for further data specified for the rhizosphere shallow groundwater and deep groundwater 3 2 1 seasonal dynamics during the dry summer of 2018 brakkee et al 2022 wolff and van vliet 2021 zscheischler and fischer 2020 infiltrated effluent is hardly diluted by precipitation resulting in significantly higher values for the coecs belonging to the classes pm and pm for aug and oct 2018 table 5 and fig 6 after the extremely dry year of 2018 and the subsequent winter the cumulative concentrations in april 2019 are still significantly higher as compared to may 2018 fig 6 this increase in concentrations is not seen after a normal year of infiltration during the winter 2017 2018 when ssi is inactive precipitation surplus and drainage remove coecs from the ssi system however it should be noted that even after a normal year coecs belonging to the pm class are present in higher concentrations in the rhizosphere of the ssi field compared to the effluent taken during that sampling episode sept 2017 fig 6 mordechay et al 2022 examined the fate of coecs in the irrigation water soil plant continuum and also found that the soil acts as a reservoir sink for persistent moderately hydrophobic coecs these coecs can be released into the soil solution between irrigations and during the rainy season allowing their uptake into irrigated as well as rain fed crops moreover this implies that mitigation strategies for soils irrigated with reclaimed wastewater should also consider soil treatment for coecs from the pm and pm classes no significant differences were observed over the study period except shortly for the deep groundwater for pm when distinguishing between sampling locations closenext also shows significant differences in time for pm fig 6 shows that apart from closenext pm coecs seem to follow the flow of the water reemtsma et al 2016 i e independent of seasonal dynamics their decrease in concentration from their point of entry in ssi systems shallow groundwater 1 20m below soil surface seems to be mainly due to dilution the coecs belonging to the pm class break down easily especially under warmer temperatures kahl et al 2017 accompanied by the removal of the coecs during the drought of 2018 is the increase in the formation of transformation products si 7 of the supplementary information which may be due to higher aerobic transformation serna galvis et al 2019 in the subsoil as a consequence of lower groundwater levels the relatively high temperatures during summer 2018 philip et al 2020 and or due to the more concentrated effluent which according to poursat et al 2019 can lead to higher biodegradation rates indeed also the effluent itself was more concentrated during and after the drought period https doi org 10 17632 4x77nynfnx 1 the highest non normalized concentration for the transformation products tps was measured for 4 hydroxyquinoline in the shallow groundwater 21 μg l and in the deeper groundwater 18 μg l the tps formed during ssi can sometimes represent a higher toxicity concern than parent substances in addition they are often more mobile than the parent compounds alygizakis et al 2020 christou et al 2017b the potential uptake of tps present in croplands as a result of biotic and abiotic transformation by plants warrants further investigation 3 2 2 location and depth dependence significantly lower non normalized concentrations between infiltration pipes midbet and farbet versus directly next to an infiltration pipe closenext and midnext table 6 are visible in the shallow groundwater for all persistency mobility classes and in the rhizosphere for all classes except for pm both the deeper groundwater and the discharge to the surface water have significantly lower concentrations as compared to the effluent being irrigated in the shallow groundwater sampling points next to infiltration pipe for all classes indeed the ssi uses the cleaning capacity of the soil and thus leads to a lower emission to surface water however in the rhizosphere 0 2 to 1 m below soil surface above the infiltration pipes concentrations do not significantly differ from concentrations in the shallow groundwater measured next to the pipe this confirms that the division between the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater is not so sharp and that in certain periods the shallow groundwater may reach 1 m below soil surface coecs with low persistency pm and pm do show much lower concentrations in the rhizosphere between the pipes the pm class shows a higher concentration in the deeper groundwater as compared to the other classes the coecs with the highest concentration in this class pm are nicosulfuron 1448 ng l ibuprofen 475 ng l n phenyl urea 437 ng l acesulfame 363 ng l and triethyl phosphate 346 ng l according to kahl et al 2017 coecs with low persistency two months under aerobic conditions can persist under anoxic conditions overall for the 82 parent coecs retrieved the deeper groundwater has the lowest response to the sub surface irrigation table 6 in this field under the ssi system is a loamy clay layer hindering the transport of coecs gil et al 2021 additionally bartholomeus et al 2017b shows that the lateral groundwater flow towards the stream is large compared to downward seepage 3 3 removal efficiency the overall removal efficiency by the soil system as related to the effluent was calculated with normalized concentrations over our two year study period including both an extremely dry year and a normal year fig 7 for all persistency mobility classes in shallow groundwater between the pipes we find significantly positive removal efficiencies with an interquartile range between 50 and 100 for the rhizosphere between the pipes we find the same except for pm with an interquartile removal efficiencies range of 40 to 100 directly next to the pipes we find no significant removal for all classes in both the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater and even significant accumulation for pm the accumulation in the shallow groundwater with a median of 25 is highly influenced by some outliers with an accumulation of 200 4000 for coecs 1h benzotriazole climbazole deet gemfibrozil and triclosan the removal of coecs belonging to the class pm is hindered by hydrophobicity and persistency thus drainage will have hardly any effect on this class of coecs and degradation may take years picó et al 2019 it was expected that pm coecs would show higher concentrations and possible accumulation over long term drought conditions our data are supported by other studies showing that independent of the method of supply coecs concentrations in sewage effluent and their physiochemical properties are the main factors governing their fate in agricultural water reuse systems ben mordechay et al 2022 christou et al 2017c delli compagni et al 2020 fig 7c shows no buildup in the deeper groundwater and the discharge to the surface water and even significant removal for the polar coecs pm and the pm for the two deeper groundwater sampling points that we were able to capture within this study midbet and farbet we observe the highest removal efficiencies for all classes the long residence time in the groundwater enhances the removal of coecs sopilniak et al 2018 3 4 public health implications a barrier to the reuse of stp effluent in agricultural irrigation is the perceived risk this reuse may pose to human health and the environment related to coecs present in the effluent risk assessment involves the identification of both hazards and exposure while all irrigation techniques i e surface spray sprinkler drip irrigation and ssi have the potential to contaminate croplands the ssi systems limit the direct exposure of stp effluent to crops and workers by supplying irrigation water underground through shallow groundwater as stated by revitt et al 2021 the likelihood of coecs reaching the root zone is largely dependent on a prior storage and transport buffer which is one attribute that makes ssi better compared to conventional irrigation systems several studies have discussed the need to develop a quantitative approach to assess the risks and benefits associated with stp effluent reuse in different irrigation systems and highlighted the need for quantitative datasets christou et al 2017a dingemans et al 2020 revitt et al 2021 relatively few studies focus on quantitative data in the context of direct reuse of stp effluent under real farming conditions ben mordechay et al 2021 revitt et al 2021 this is the first study to quantitatively assess direct effluent reuse in a real scale sub surface irrigation system for a broad range of coecs as such the results provide valuable insights into the presence transport and fate of a broad range of coecs in ssi systems under natural aerobic and anaerobic conditions which is an understudied area biel maeso et al 2018 revitt et al 2021 we differentiate between coecs removal during a normal and extremely dry year dilution by precipitation and groundwater by comparing sampling points next to and in between infiltration pipes and removal due to degradation and sorption processes we also take care to identify the coecs potential to accumulate in the soil compartments the transformation products formed during ssi are an important issue since it has been reported that transformation products can sometimes represent a higher toxicity concern than parent substances murrell et al 2021 all in all higher numbers and concentrations of coecs are found in the ssi field as compared to the reference field however also relatively high net removal efficiencies are shown in our nature based treatment benefiting the surface waters that would otherwise receive the stp effluent directly but care must be taken to monitor the coecs that are moderately hydrophobic as these significantly accumulate around infiltration pipes and show no significant removal in the rhizosphere for these persistent moderately hydrophobic coecs we determined the risk characterization ratio s rcrs and σrcr none of the single chemical rcrs are 1 table 7 the σrcr of this persistent moderately hydrophobic group is also much smaller than one for both the rhizosphere and the shallow groundwater both values imply sufficiently safe ambient exposures possible solutions to successfully further minimize the exposure of crops and deep groundwater to coec especially those belonging to the pm class in ssi reuse systems using stp effluent may consist of implementation of further stp upgrading through re designing of the existing treatment processes kahl et al 2017 optimizing operating conditions of the existing biological process he et al 2021 or implementing an effective additional tertiary treatment licciardello et al 2018 rizzo et al 2019 as a future perspective to facilitate risk management in the context of stp effluent reuse in ssi systems standardized emission scenarios should be developed for this use supporting the systematic assessment of risks posed by un regulated chemical substances released from stps 4 conclusion apart from sub surface irrigation providing a robust barrier against drought it also helps to significantly remove most coecs after a drought period the ssi system needs more time to reset to background concentrations whereas after a normal hydrological year with a precipitation surplus and drainage in winter most coecs are removed coecs of the class pm however significantly buildup in the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater next to infiltration pipes coecs belonging to the class pm show a high seasonal dependence this is true for rhizosphere and shallow groundwater but not the deeper groundwater indicating that these coecs break down coecs belonging to the pm class show no change amongst their removal in a dry versus normal year this also holds true for the pm class except shortly for the deep groundwater this indicates that the pm coecs go with the flow of the water and that pm coecs are degraded easily in the system in summary the removal efficiency is highly dependent on the persistency mobility class of a compound the seasonal drought conditions and the compartment of the ssi system thus when adopting a ssi stp effluent reuse system relatively high removal efficiencies are shown benefiting the surface waters that would otherwise receive the stp effluent directly but care must be taken to monitor the coecs that are moderately hydrophobic as these significantly accumulate around infiltration pipes and show no significant removal in the rhizosphere credit

15408,globally the reuse of treated sewage effluent for irrigation purposes is increasingly encouraged as a practical solution against the mismatch between the demand for and availability of freshwater resources the reuse of sewage effluent for sub surface irrigation ssi in agriculture serves the dual purpose of supplying water to crops and diminishing emissions of contaminants of emerging concern coecs into surface water to investigate such reuse in a real scale cropland with ssi using sewage effluent from september 2017 to march 2019 including the extremely dry year 2018 residues were followed of 133 coecs as related to their physicochemical properties and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry of the 133 target coecs 89 were retrieved in the field most non detect coecs have low persistency during the growing season with sub surface irrigation coecs spread to the shallow groundwater and rhizosphere significantly lower concentrations are found between infiltration pipes as compared to directly next to the pipes in shallow groundwater for all persistency mobility classes coecs belonging to the class pm low persistency and low mobility or class pm high persistency and high mobility class show no change amongst their removal in the rhizosphere and groundwater in a dry versus normal year coecs belonging to the class pm low persistency and high mobility show high seasonal dynamics in the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater indicating that these coecs break down coecs of the class pm high persistency and low mobility only significantly build up in the rhizosphere next to infiltration pipes climatic conditions with dry summers and precipitation surplus and drainage in winter strongly affect the fate of coecs during the dry summer of 2018 infiltrated effluent is hardly diluted resulting in significantly higher concentrations for the coecs belonging to the classes pm and pm after the extremely dry year of 2018 cumulative concentrations are still significantly higher while after a normal year during winter precipitation surplus removes coecs for all persistency mobility classes in the shallow groundwater between the pipes we find significant removal efficiencies for the rhizosphere between the pipes we find the same except for pm next to the pipes however we find no significant removal for all classes in both the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater and even significant accumulation for pm for this group of persistent moderately hydrophobic coecs risk characterization ratio s were calculated for the period of time with the highest normalized concentration none of the single chemical rcrs are above one and the σrcr is also far below one implying sufficiently safe ambient exposures overall the deeper groundwater 7 0 11 8 m below soil surface has the lowest response to the sub surface irrigation for all persistency mobility when adopting a ssi stp effluent reuse system care must be taken to monitor the coecs that are moderately hydrophobic as these can build up in the ssi system for the deeper groundwater and for the discharge to the surface water we find significant removal for the pm and the pm class but not for other classes in conclusion relatively high removal efficiencies are shown benefiting the surface waters that would otherwise receive the

accounting for 69 of freshwater withdrawal food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2021 while significant attention has been paid to the more arid regions of the world maceda veiga et al 2018 temperate climates also suffer from seasonal droughts hänsel et al 2019 narain ford et al 2021 rey et al 2017 the pressure on the availability of freshwater resources will continue to increase due to global change which will enhance prolonged dry periods and thus freshwater demands from several sectors bijl et al 2018 de vos et al 2021 hence it is crucial that options for the exploitation of alternative freshwater resources such as sewage treatment plant stp effluent are explored intentional reuse of stp effluent can compensate for water shortages caused by seasonality or by irregular availability of other water sources for agricultural irrigation throughout the year hristov et al 2021 such intentional reuse offers better control and management possibilities than currently practiced de facto reuse drewes et al 2017 additionally when using sub surface irrigation ssi as a method of supply de wit et al 2022 the quality of stp effluent may improve due to the soil passage and related biodegradation processes also benefiting the receiving surface waters narain ford et al 2020 nonetheless the fate of the contaminants of emerging concern coecs present in the effluent such as pharmaceuticals biocides personal care products and their transformation products in ssi systems is not yet fully understood likewise direct evidence on the effects of re using treated effluent for ssi under real farming conditions on the fate of a broad selection of coecs is currently lacking narain ford et al 2020 revitt et al 2021 of particular concern is the persistent fraction of these contaminants reemtsma et al 2016 most persistent coecs capable of bioaccumulation are nonpolar and inherently poorly water soluble therefore they are readily removed in stps through sorption processes and preferably sorb to sewage sludge the remaining persistent hydrophobic fraction that reaches croplands through ssi might lead to soil concentrations building up over time christou et al 2019 persistent and mobile organic compounds also known as pmocs are a concern for water quality because they are not well removed from water by sorption processes due to their high polarity and thus water solubility liu et al 2021 reemtsma et al 2016 these persistent compounds may then result in the exposure of crops and deep groundwater and pose related risks to human health and the environment therefore a better understanding is needed of the environmental fate processes i e degradation sorption and horizontal and vertical leaching of coecs in these sub surface irrigation systems and the consequences for exposure to humans and ecosystems only limited quantitative data is available regarding the behavior and fate of many of coecs in full scale setups where real stp effluent was applied to croplands representing actual farming practices ben mordechay et al 2021 revitt et al 2021 as compared to pilot or lab scale studies christou et al 2017a kesari et al 2021 these full scale studies solely focus on aboveground irrigation techniques such as sprinkler spray and drip irrigation during ssi water is introduced into shallow groundwater and then capillary rise provides irrigation to the crop hence while aboveground irrigation captures primarily aerobic processes ssi includes both aerobic and anaerobic processes narain ford et al 2020 generally the biodegradation of coecs in soil is faster and more complete under aerobic conditions topsoil as compared to anaerobic conditions deeper layers of the vadose zone christou et al 2017a aerobic biodegradation may result in the fast initial enzymatic attack and the decomposition of alkyl side chains and other easily degradable factional groups e g carboxyl groups whereas anaerobic biodegradation may include various enzymatic processes that biodegrade more complex and stable functional groups and structural moieties such as aromatic groups naphthalene rings and sulfonamides greskowiak et al 2017 luo et al 2019 so far most studies investigating the fate of coecs in agricultural soils have been under aerobic conditions while information about their persistence in the absence of oxygen is still scarce especially in the context of relevant coecs concentrations christou et al 2017a the interplay between aerobic and anaerobic processes has been studied before in e g in riverbank filtration albergamo et al 2019 hamann et al 2016 and constructed wetlands he et al 2021 hübner et al 2022 however these systems were constructed primarily for purification purposes while ssi primarily serves as an irrigation system with relatively short residence times with regard to crop uptake and longer residence times for groundwater seepage narain ford et al 2020 this study aims to identify and quantify coecs in a real scale cropland with direct reuse of stp effluent in a sub surface irrigation system we study the fate of coecs in relation to their physicochemical properties half life in soil range of 0 4 1194 days and log dow range of 2 77 to 5 67 pore water and groundwater samples were collected at various depths 0 2 to 11 8 m and we analyzed 133 coecs relevant for effluents such as herbicides industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals personal care products and their transformation products such an extensive analysis of a real scale experimental site under real farming conditions is novel and ensures that the environmental fate processes such as an aerobic degradation sorption drainage and leaching occur under realistic conditions this study captured september 2017 march 2019 including the extremely dry year of 2018 to elucidate the maximum influence of the stp effluent reuse on croplands 2 material and methods 2 1 study area located in the east of the netherlands in haaksbergen lies the only dutch cropland 52 10 42 9 n 6 42 43 8 e which is intentionally and directly subsurfacely irrigated with municipal effluent during the growing season fig 1 infiltration of the effluent during the growing season occurs via a series of 6 m parallel pipes at a depth of 1 20 m at the cropland of 58 500 m2 maize intended for livestock feed is grown this cropland has ssi with stp effluent since 2015 as part of the initiative on alternative freshwater supply for agriculture in the dutch higher sandy soils region taken by the water management authority vechtstromen since the start of ssi in 2015 no other direct irrigation has taken place at this site as reference location the cropland without ssi on the other side of the surface water with the same farming conditions was selected an illustration of the monitoring wells installed at different depths in both the saturated and unsaturated zone is presented in si 1 of the supplementary information 2 2 sample collection five sampling episodes from september 2017 to april 2019 were carried out the period of sampling includes the extremely dry year of 2018 water balance components for the full time period are displayed in table 1 the irrigated stp effluent volume in the year 2017 was 562 2 mm whereas 502 8 mm was irrigated in 2018 the drainage volumes for 2017 were not measured in the year 2018 66 6 mm of water was drained wells that showed elevated chloride bromide ratio during ssi from the period 2015 2017 bartholomeus et al 2017 were chosen for sampling fig 1 pore water and groundwater samples were collected at several depths ranging from 0 20 m to 11 8 m below the soil surface table 2 to sample pore water pre installed rhizon samplers were used while the groundwater was sampled using pre installed mini filters apart from the

chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms the selection covers a broad range of physicochemical properties and represents a variety of chemical uses the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient expressed as log dow ph 7 4 which matches the effluent and field samples is used as a measure of mobility to account for ionizable coecs and ranges from 2 77 acesulfame to 5 69 flufenoxuron the ph was measured on site with a portable wtw meter the half life dt50 of coecs is used to embody persistency the persistency diverges from 0 4 days propanil to 1194 days 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam for parametrization of log d and half life data we followed preferences as explained in table 3 available data from the highest priority were used the coecs are assigned to four persistency mobility classes i e high persistency and high mobility pm high persistency and low mobility pm low persistency and high mobility pm and low persistency and low mobility pm as based on frequencies in the set of coecs of half lives and log d of all selected compounds fig 2 the empirical distribution function plots are presented in si 2 our 50th percentile cut off value of 57 day half life in soil is comparable with annex xiii of reach echa 2017 which considers a chemical to be persistent in soil or water sediment if its dt50 is more than 120 days and very persistent if it is more

adapted to our chemical analysis in short pore water and groundwater samples v 50 ml in triplo were spiked to 100 ng l of isotope labeled standards and concentrated by solid phase extraction spe with oasishlb 150 mg from waters etten leur the netherlands the cartridges were conditioned with 5 ml of methanol and equilibrated with 5 ml of ultrapure water the samples were loaded onto the cartridges and subsequently washed with 2 5 ml of ultrapure water and dried under vacuum for 20 min the cartridges were eluted 4 times with 2 5 ml of methanol the 10 ml extracts were filtered with 0 22mm ppfilters nantong filterbio membrane co ltd nantong china and evaporated to 0 5 ml then extracts were transferred to 1 5 ml pp lc vials and stored in the dark at 20 c prior to analysis the extracts were vortexed and diluted five times in ultrapure water to be more compatible with the aqueous mobile phase used for chromatography separation the procedure resulted in an enrichment factor of 20 and a concentration of isotope labeled standards equal to 2 µg l to match that of the standards used for the calibration series 2 4 3 lc hrms analysis the uhplc q tof ms ms analysis was performed on a

and limit of detection and quantification recoveries vary between 75 and 125 with residual standard deviation lower than 20 and 10 for intraday and interday repeatability was considered satisfactory limits of detection and limits of quantification recoveries and precision were investigated in 24h effluent and groundwater from our pilot site n 6 at concentrations matching the 5 lowest points of the calibration series calibration curves for quantification were calculated by analyzing ultrapure water spiked with 25 μg l of coecs and serially diluted to obtain 7 concentration levels with 390 63 ng l being the lowest concentration of the calibration series the spe method was suitable to further lower the detection limits by a factor of 20 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis for all measurements was performed with the r statistical environment r core team 2021 version 4 1 2 1 november 2021 all data used are based on means standard error se of three replicates except when stated differently and were first tested for normality by shapiro wilk tests if the significance value of the shapiro wilk test was below 0 05 the data was considered significantly deviated from a normal distribution as outlined by helsel et al 2020 when dealing with non normal data nonparametric tests can be many times more powerful than parametric tests a non parametric kruskal wallis kw test was used to compare the transport of coecs through time space and depth to account for dilution by precipitation groundwater and pore water coecs concentrations were normalized using the dilution factor of the artificial sweetener saccharin which is used as a tracer for effluent richards et al 2017 van stempvoort et al 2020 according to d f sach sample sach effluent where df is the dilution factor sach sample is the saccharin concentration of the sample and sach effluent is the saccharin concentration in the corresponding 24h effluent at our reference location saccharin was not detected thus it was excluded when normalizing for dates where the ssi was still inactive may 2018 and april 2019 we took the corresponding effluent before the stop of the growing season table 4 and further tested the robustness of our approach see si 6 the normalized coec concentration is then the measured coec concentration divided by df normalized concentrations were only used to calculate coec removal efficiencies expressed as related to the effluent for each chemical and each sampling location time and depth these removal efficiencies were then averaged per persistency mobility class for the rhizosphere next to and in between infiltration pipes for shallow groundwater next to and in between infiltration pipes and for deep groundwater the one sample wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine whether the removal efficiencies over the full sampling period differentiated from 0 comparisons between the removal efficiencies for the four persistency mobility classes were conducted with a non parametric kruskal wallis kw test the dunn test resulted in an adjusted p value based on the benjamin hochberg method 2 6 risk characterization risk characterizations were made by coupling normalized concentrations with hazard information from posthuma et al 2019 as policy adopted predicted no effect concentrations pnecs are lacking for many chemicals we used chronic noecs and acute ec50s distributions derived from ecotoxicity data posthuma et al 2019 risk characterization ratio s rcrs were obtained by dividing the normalized concentrations by the species sensitivity distributions ssd midpoint concentration the most acknowledged default mixture toxicity approach to yield σrcrs assumes that concentration addition is applicable for all components in the mixture martin et al 2021 in this approach environmental non toxic or acceptable risk conditions are defined by rcr 1 in the hypothetical case of single substance environments and σrcr 1 in case of co exposures rcr 1 and σrcr 1 define insufficient protection also referred to as unacceptable environmental risk in chemical safety assessment 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of coecs when stp effluent enters the shallow groundwater via ssi the coecs present in the effluent can migrate from shallow groundwater to the rhizosphere and or to deeper groundwater narain ford et al 2020 from the 133 coecs in our target list 89 are retrieved in our samples 39 out of the 44 coecs not detected belong to a class of low persistency and or mobility 16 pm 10 pm and 13 pm the remaining 5 non detected coecs are three transformation products tps and two biocides belonging to the pm class 57 out of the 89 detected coecs can be directly traced back to the stp effluent fig 3 the shallow groundwater 1 2 35 m below soil surface of the ssi system where the stp effluent enters shows the highest number of coecs 83 89 the deeper groundwater 5 11 8 m below surface has the lowest number of coecs coecs of the class pm low persistency and low mobility are underrepresented in all compartments from the 89 coecs detected seven out of 10 present in the target list are transformation products tps and are present variably across compartments si 7 of the supplementary information in the reference field shallow groundwater one sampling episode only two coecs from our target list are retrieved fig 4 shows the intersections of the compartments specified per persistency mobility class over the full sampling period columns 1 7 57 89 display the intersections that stp effluent has with the other five compartments only 2 57 coecs can be found in all six compartments of this study while 24 57 coecs can be found in all compartments except for the reference field and two coecs are exclusive to the stp effluent column 7 consequently 32 89 sum of columns 8 17 detected coecs not found in the compartments 24 h stp effluent nor in reference field can be found in other compartments inside of the ssi system and also in the ssi discharge to stream compartment of these 32 coecs only one is a transformation product only two of these parent compounds are of the class pm while the other 29 parent compounds are either highly persistent highly mobile or both when looking at the uses of the coecs not detected in the stp effluent compartment 11 are below the limit of quantification loq and the remaining 21 coecs can be classified as biocide 52 industrial chemical 10 and as pharmaceuticals personal care product 38 it is therefore likely that most of these coecs not detected in the stp effluent do occur in the effluent but are below the limit of detection also because of effluent matrix effects it is well known that stps are not optimized for the removal of highly persistent and or mobile coecs and stps are major contributors to coecs in the environment blum et al 2018 golovko et al 2021 serna galvis et al 2019 hence for further analysis of the transport of coecs and their subsequent removal we assumed that all 89 coecs 82 parent coecs and 7 tps originate from stp effluent 3 2 transport of coecs in time space and depth for the detected coecs overall detection frequencies ranged from 1 to 95 fig 5a 4 6 dinitro o cresol carbamazepine pfba gemfibrozil pfoa 1h benzotriazole bentazon saccharin mcpp p diclofenac acesulfame and pentachlorophenol were detected at over 50 across all sampling points over the full sampling period for all coecs their respective quantities are displayed in fig 5b with mean maximal concentrations of 1024 ng l in si 8 the detection frequency and non normalized concentration are presented separately for the rhizosphere shallow groundwater deeper groundwater and ssi discharge to the stream aside from the pm group having fewer coecs retrieved no clear differences in mean concentrations are observed between individual coecs among the four classes cumulative coecs concentrations of the four persistency and mobility classes are visualized in fig 6 for five time periods from sept 2017 to april 2019 in the ssi system see https doi org 10 17632 4x77nynfnx 1 for further data specified for the rhizosphere shallow groundwater and deep groundwater 3 2 1 seasonal dynamics during the dry summer of 2018 brakkee et al 2022 wolff and van vliet 2021 zscheischler and fischer 2020 infiltrated effluent is hardly diluted by precipitation resulting in significantly higher values for the coecs belonging to the classes pm and pm for aug and oct 2018 table 5 and fig 6 after the extremely dry year of 2018 and the subsequent winter the cumulative concentrations in april 2019 are still significantly higher as compared to may 2018 fig 6 this increase in concentrations is not seen after a normal year of infiltration during the winter 2017 2018 when ssi is inactive precipitation surplus and drainage remove coecs from the ssi system however it should be noted that even after a normal year coecs belonging to the pm class are present in higher concentrations in the rhizosphere of the ssi field compared to the effluent taken during that sampling episode sept 2017 fig 6 mordechay et al 2022 examined the fate of coecs in the irrigation water soil plant continuum and also found that the soil acts as a reservoir sink for persistent moderately hydrophobic coecs these coecs can be released into the soil solution between irrigations and during the rainy season allowing their uptake into irrigated as well as rain fed crops moreover this implies that mitigation strategies for soils irrigated with reclaimed wastewater should also consider soil treatment for coecs from the pm and pm classes no significant differences were observed over the study period except shortly for the deep groundwater for pm when distinguishing between sampling locations closenext also shows significant differences in time for pm fig 6 shows that apart from closenext pm coecs seem to follow the flow of the water reemtsma et al 2016 i e independent of seasonal dynamics their decrease in concentration from their point of entry in ssi systems shallow groundwater 1 20m below soil surface seems to be mainly due to dilution the coecs belonging to the pm class break down easily especially under warmer temperatures kahl et al 2017 accompanied by the removal of the coecs during the drought of 2018 is the increase in the formation of transformation products si 7 of the supplementary information which may be due to higher aerobic transformation serna galvis et al 2019 in the subsoil as a consequence of lower groundwater levels the relatively high temperatures during summer 2018 philip et al 2020 and or due to the more concentrated effluent which according to poursat et al 2019 can lead to higher biodegradation rates indeed also the effluent itself was more concentrated during and after the drought period https doi org 10 17632 4x77nynfnx 1 the highest non normalized concentration for the transformation products tps was measured for 4 hydroxyquinoline in the shallow groundwater 21 μg l and in the deeper groundwater 18 μg l the tps formed during ssi can sometimes represent a higher toxicity concern than parent substances in addition they are often more mobile than the parent compounds alygizakis et al 2020 christou et al 2017b the potential uptake of tps present in croplands as a result of biotic and abiotic transformation by plants warrants further investigation 3 2 2 location and depth dependence significantly lower non normalized concentrations between infiltration pipes midbet and farbet versus directly next to an infiltration pipe closenext and midnext table 6 are visible in the shallow groundwater for all persistency mobility classes and in the rhizosphere for all classes except for pm both the deeper groundwater and the discharge to the surface water have significantly lower concentrations as compared to the effluent being irrigated in the shallow groundwater sampling points next to infiltration pipe for all classes indeed the ssi uses the cleaning capacity of the soil and thus leads to a lower emission to surface water however in the rhizosphere 0 2 to 1 m below soil surface above the infiltration pipes concentrations do not significantly differ from concentrations in the shallow groundwater measured next to the pipe this confirms that the division between the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater is not so sharp and that in certain periods the shallow groundwater may reach 1 m below soil surface coecs with low persistency pm and pm do show much lower concentrations in the rhizosphere between the pipes the pm class shows a higher concentration in the deeper groundwater as compared to the other classes the coecs with the highest concentration in this class pm are nicosulfuron 1448 ng l ibuprofen 475 ng l n phenyl urea 437 ng l acesulfame 363 ng l and triethyl phosphate 346 ng l according to kahl et al 2017 coecs with low persistency two months under aerobic conditions can persist under anoxic conditions overall for the 82 parent coecs retrieved the deeper groundwater has the lowest response to the sub surface irrigation table 6 in this field under the ssi system is a loamy clay layer hindering the transport of coecs gil et al 2021 additionally bartholomeus et al 2017b shows that the lateral groundwater flow towards the stream is large compared to downward seepage 3 3 removal efficiency the overall removal efficiency by the soil system as related to the effluent was calculated with normalized concentrations over our two year study period including both an extremely dry year and a normal year fig 7 for all persistency mobility classes in shallow groundwater between the pipes we find significantly positive removal efficiencies with an interquartile range between 50 and 100 for the rhizosphere between the pipes we find the same except for pm with an interquartile removal efficiencies range of 40 to 100 directly next to the pipes we find no significant removal for all classes in both the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater and even significant accumulation for pm the accumulation in the shallow groundwater with a median of 25 is highly influenced by some outliers with an accumulation of 200 4000 for coecs 1h benzotriazole climbazole deet gemfibrozil and triclosan the removal of coecs belonging to the class pm is hindered by hydrophobicity and persistency thus drainage will have hardly any effect on this class of coecs and degradation may take years picó et al 2019 it was expected that pm coecs would show higher concentrations and possible accumulation over long term drought conditions our data are supported by other studies showing that independent of the method of supply coecs concentrations in sewage effluent and their physiochemical properties are the main factors governing their fate in agricultural water reuse systems ben mordechay et al 2022 christou et al 2017c delli compagni et al 2020 fig 7c shows no buildup in the deeper groundwater and the discharge to the surface water and even significant removal for the polar coecs pm and the pm for the two deeper groundwater sampling points that we were able to capture within this study midbet and farbet we observe the highest removal efficiencies for all classes the long residence time in the groundwater enhances the removal of coecs sopilniak et al 2018 3 4 public health implications a barrier to the reuse of stp effluent in agricultural irrigation is the perceived risk this reuse may pose to human health and the environment related to coecs present in the effluent risk assessment involves the identification of both hazards and exposure while all irrigation techniques i e surface spray sprinkler drip irrigation and ssi have the potential to contaminate croplands the ssi systems limit the direct exposure of stp effluent to crops and workers by supplying irrigation water underground through shallow groundwater as stated by revitt et al 2021 the likelihood of coecs reaching the root zone is largely dependent on a prior storage and transport buffer which is one attribute that makes ssi better compared to conventional irrigation systems several studies have discussed the need to develop a quantitative approach to assess the risks and benefits associated with stp effluent reuse in different irrigation systems and highlighted the need for quantitative datasets christou et al 2017a dingemans et al 2020 revitt et al 2021 relatively few studies focus on quantitative data in the context of direct reuse of stp effluent under real farming conditions ben mordechay et al 2021 revitt et al 2021 this is the first study to quantitatively assess direct effluent reuse in a real scale sub surface irrigation system for a broad range of coecs as such the results provide valuable insights into the presence transport and fate of a broad range of coecs in ssi systems under natural aerobic and anaerobic conditions which is an understudied area biel maeso et al 2018 revitt et al 2021 we differentiate between coecs removal during a normal and extremely dry year dilution by precipitation and groundwater by comparing sampling points next to and in between infiltration pipes and removal due to degradation and sorption processes we also take care to identify the coecs potential to accumulate in the soil compartments the transformation products formed during ssi are an important issue since it has been reported that transformation products can sometimes represent a higher toxicity concern than parent substances murrell et al 2021 all in all higher numbers and concentrations of coecs are found in the ssi field as compared to the reference field however also relatively high net removal efficiencies are shown in our nature based treatment benefiting the surface waters that would otherwise receive the stp effluent directly but care must be taken to monitor the coecs that are moderately hydrophobic as these significantly accumulate around infiltration pipes and show no significant removal in the rhizosphere for these persistent moderately hydrophobic coecs we determined the risk characterization ratio s rcrs and σrcr none of the single chemical rcrs are 1 table 7 the σrcr of this persistent moderately hydrophobic group is also much smaller than one for both the rhizosphere and the shallow groundwater both values imply sufficiently safe ambient exposures possible solutions to successfully further minimize the exposure of crops and deep groundwater to coec especially those belonging to the pm class in ssi reuse systems using stp effluent may consist of implementation of further stp upgrading through re designing of the existing treatment processes kahl et al 2017 optimizing operating conditions of the existing biological process he et al 2021 or implementing an effective additional tertiary treatment licciardello et al 2018 rizzo et al 2019 as a future perspective to facilitate risk management in the context of stp effluent reuse in ssi systems standardized emission scenarios should be developed for this use supporting the systematic assessment of risks posed by un regulated chemical substances released from stps 4 conclusion apart from sub surface irrigation providing a robust barrier against drought it also helps to significantly remove most coecs after a drought period the ssi system needs more time to reset to background concentrations whereas after a normal hydrological year with a precipitation surplus and drainage in winter most coecs are removed coecs of the class pm however significantly buildup in the rhizosphere and shallow groundwater next to infiltration pipes coecs belonging to the class pm show a high seasonal dependence this is true for rhizosphere and shallow groundwater but not the deeper groundwater indicating that these coecs break down coecs belonging to the pm class show no change amongst their removal in a dry versus normal year this also holds true for the pm class except shortly for the deep groundwater this indicates that the pm coecs go with the flow of the water and that pm coecs are degraded easily in the system in summary the removal efficiency is highly dependent on the persistency mobility class of a compound the seasonal drought conditions and the compartment of the ssi system thus when adopting a ssi stp effluent reuse system relatively high removal efficiencies are shown benefiting the surface waters that would otherwise receive the stp effluent directly but care must be taken to monitor the coecs that are moderately hydrophobic as these significantly accumulate around infiltration pipes and show no significant removal in the rhizosphere credit

15409,nitrate is one of the most widespread and persistent pollutants in our time our understanding of nitrate dynamics has advanced substantially in the past decades although its predominant drivers across gradients of climate land use and geology have remained elusive here we collated nitrate data from 2061 rivers along with 32 watershed characteristic indexes and developed machine learning models to reconstruct long term mean multi year average nitrate concentrations in the contiguous united states conus the trained models show similarly satisfactory model performance and can predict nitrate concentrations in chemically ungauged places with about 70 accuracy further analysis revealed that five out of 32 indexes drivers can explain about 70 of spatial variations in mean nitrate concentrations the five influential drivers are nitrogen application rates nrate and urban area aurban human drivers mean annual precipitation and temperature climate drivers and sand percent sand soil property driver nitrate concentrations in undeveloped sites are primarily modulated by climate and soil property they decrease with increasing mean discharge and sand nitrate concentrations in agriculture and urban sites increase with nrate and aurban until reaching their apparent maxima around 10 000 kg km2 yr and around 25 respectively results indicate that nitrate concentrations may remain similar or increase with growing human population in addition nitrate concentrations can increase even without human input as warming escalates water demand and reduces mean discharge in many places these results allude to a conceptual model that highlights the impacts of distinct drivers while human drivers predominate nitrogen input to land and rivers climate drivers and soil properties modulate its transport and transformation the balance of which determine long term mean concentrations such mechanism based insights and forecasting capabilities are essential for water management as we expect changing climate and growing agriculture and urbanization graphical abstract machine learning models identify the most influential factors of long term mean nitrate concentrations in us rivers they are nitrogen application rates and urban area human drivers mean annual precipitation and temperature climate drivers and sand content soil property driver the developed models can

and land use conditions as long as the values of the five influential drivers are available these five drivers are nitrogen application rates percentage of urban area mean annual precipitation and temperature and sand content in soils synopsis a continental scale machine learning model identified five most influential drivers for long term mean nitrate concentration in us rivers nitrogen

induced persistent nitrogen pollution eutrophication and harmful algal blooms have occurred in 60 of us estuaries and coastal water bodies and across the globe ascott et al 2017 howarth et al 2002 nitrogen pollution causes extensive evasion of greenhouse gasses such as n2o beaulieu et al 2011 and human health issues including low fetal blood oxygen ward et al 2018 extensive efforts to reduce riverine nitrate concentrations have not worked as expected van meter et al 2018 brookfield et al 2021 there is a pressing need to understand drivers of nitrate concentrations in order to develop forecasting capabilities in chemically ungauged basins and under future climate and land use conditions as an example urban lands in the us are expected to double by 2060 and cropland is expanding by one million acres per year bureau et al 2012 lark et al 2020 both of which will exacerbate nitrogen contamination riverine nitrate concentrations and loads depend on the balance between processes that add versus those that remove and export nitrate elevated human input through fertilizer application wastewater input among other types of input have tripled reactive nitrogen input to us land and waterways in agricultural and urban landscapes compared to pre european settlement sobota et al 2013 pervasive legacy nitrogen stores in soils have elevated nitrogen export to streams van meter et al 2018 nitrate concentration in agricultural and urban rivers has been shown to be eleven times and five times higher respectively than in rivers draining undeveloped rivers clune et al 2020 nitrate is often a small portion of total nitrogen in forested catchments but exceed 50 in urban and agricultural streams pellerin et al 2004 while 20 25 of n input is exported to streams the rest is retained removed or cycled through multiple processes howarth et al 2006 these processes include biological assimilation nitrification from ammonia to nitrate denitrification from nitrate to gases n2 no n2o kampschreur et al 2009 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 nitrate can be removed via processes such as biological uptake dodds et al 2002 and denitrification in riparian zones lutz et al 2020 wherry et al 2021 wetlands cheng et al 2020 soils harms and ludwig 2016 streams beaulieu et al 2011 mulholland et al 2008 ponded waters schmadel et al 2018 and groundwater hinkle and tesoriero 2014 watershed characteristics including geology and tile drains can also regulate nitrate concentrations makino et al 2021 wherry et al 2021 the influence of human and climate drivers often intertwine guo et al 2020 lintern et al 2021 lintern et al 2018 nitrate loads and fluxes are primarily driven by water fluxes regulated by climate e g precipitation evapotranspiration nitrate loads from agriculture runoff are expected to increase under intensified hydrologic events such as flooding kumar et al 2020 sinha and michalak 2016 instantaneous nitrate concentrations have been observed to often increase with river discharge in agriculture land as rising water tables flush nitrate out of nitrogen rich shallow soils ebeling et al 2021a zhi and li 2020 nitrate fluxes are typically lower at low flow where high temperature and evapotranspiration reduce discharge elongate residence times and possibly promote nitrogen removal benettin et al 2020 jeppesen et al 2011 distinguishing these entangling drivers require high spatial and temporal resolution datasets yet water quality data are often inconsistent and sparse challenging mechanistic understanding and differentiation of individual drivers the recent renaissance of machine learning ml algorithms can build models that accommodate complex relationships beyond traditional regression models and reconstruct data records based on spatially and temporally sparse data varadharajan et al 2022 zhi et al 2021 ml algorithms have been used to reproduce and predict spatial distribution of nitrate concentrations in groundwater ransom et al 2022 and streams wang et al 2021 they have identified urban and agriculture land use as major drivers in individual watersheds and at regional scales golden et al 2016 wherry et al 2021 a recently developed continental scale random forest rf model estimated nutrient concentrations total nitrogen and phosphorous total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous nitrate in different seasons at 62 495 stations across the us streams for the period of 1994 2018 using 47 environmental variables shen et al 2020 the estimated data offer potentials for further investigation of ecosystem and biogeochemical processes at the continental scale although this study itself did not further examine the patterns and drivers of these nutrients our understanding on drivers of long term baseline mean nitrate concentrations at the continental scale therefore is still lacking here we ask the question how and to what extent do human climate and watershed characteristics regulate long term mean nitrate concentration at the continental scale here mean nitrate concentrations hereafter nitrate concentrations are defined and calculated as the multi year averages of instantaneous nitrate concentrations from individual rivers and streams they differ from instantaneous concentrations directly measured from sensors or grab water samples that reflect nitrate response to variations in short term weather conditions four machine learning models were trained to reproduce and predict nitrate concentration data from 2061 rivers in the contiguous united states conus each river has 32 watershed characteristic indexes including climate land use and soil properties among other characteristics we further analyzed data and model output to identify the most influential indexes drivers and explore the functional dependence of nitrate concentrations on individual drivers which is often missing in machine learning studies the trained model can be used to forecast mean baseline nitrate concentrations in chemically ungauged basins and under future climate and land use scenarios a much needed capability for present and future water management 2 methods 2 1 data nitrate concentration data were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs water data survey 2016 using the usgs r dataretrieval package hirsch and de cicco 2015 and usgs parameter 00618 nitrate in filtered water sample in mg l as nitrogen site characteristics pertaining to entire watersheds were obtained from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii database falcone 2011 nitrate data availability varies significantly from site to site in duration frequency and time periods a common challenge for water quality data li et al 2021 the temporal data coverage is from 1900 to 2020 less than 0 5 of data is from before 1940 fig s 1 about 90 of data are from 1960 onwards choosing sites with consistent period coverage from 2000 2020 for example would lead to only 792 sites which would be insufficient for model training the means calculated for between 1960 2020 and those for between 1980 2020 shows negligible difference fig s 2 this is not surprising although urban and agriculture lands are still expanding they have mostly stabilized in patterns since 1950s li et al 2022b fig s 3 detection limits differ across sites we compared arithmetic means with and without detection limit values except for a handful of sites the two sets of means fall on the 1 1 line indicating negligible impact of excluding data below detection limit fig s 4 we therefore used data in all years in each site excluding the below detection limit values to maximize the number of data sites and robust model training we also purposely chose to use arithmetic mean instead of commonly used discharge weighted mean concentrations because arithmetic mean gives equal weight to every data point river discharge typically vary by orders of magnitude such that discharge weighted means give more weight to concentrations at high discharge this could lead to biased mean concentrations especially when the timing and frequency of sampling are inconsistent across discharge regimes at different sites we did not choose to use geometric means as they do not have clear physical meanings 2 2 watershed characteristic indexes thirty two watershed characteristic indexes from the gages ii database were selected as candidate predictors these characteristics include categories of nitrogen input land cover climate geomorphological characteristics soil geology stream characteristics and topography table s 1 specifically measures of nitrogen input include indexes such as fertilizer and manure application rates hydrological disturbance index quantifies anthropogenic modifications land use parameters include the percent of forest agricultural and urban areas the climate variables include mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat mean annual number of rainy days snow percent of precipitation and precipitation seasonality index soil properties include soil thickness bulk density available water capacity sand clay and organic matter content dominant geology include gneiss granitic quaternary sedimentary ultramafic and volcanic bedrocks river network characteristics include stream density maximum strahler stream order base flow index topographic wetness index subsurface flow contact time index average stream runoff and percent length of first order stream topographical attributes include mean elevation and slope percent watershed drainage areas vary from 1 66 to 49 802 km2 mean 4 912 km2 standard deviation 8 679 km2 some small watersheds are nested within the same river basins characteristic indexes were derived from the delineated watershed for each site therefore representing the average of each watershed contributing to river flow at the gauge 2 3 model development we trained four models including boosted regression trees brt random forest rf neural network nnet and ensemble ensemble model the first three widely used varadharajan et al 2022 the fourth ensemble model combines the outputs of brt rf and nnet by generalized linear model with elastic net penalty it was expected to outperform the other three all indexes were used initially in model training the model performance was evaluated using testing data that were not used in the model training the four models have very similar performance and parameter ranking figs s 5 and s 6 in si the ensemble performed the best but only slightly and was closely followed by brt it however is considerably more complex with a much larger number of parameters we therefore only analyzed the brt model output to avoid model complexity and redundancy brt uses the decision tree classification and regression trees carts as base learners carts make recursive binary partitions that divide the predictor space into subregions with similar outputs the model output is calculated as the mean of outputs regression tree or majority class classification tree of training data in the subregion of predictor space where test data falls breiman et al 1984 brt fits several carts sequentially in a stage wise forward manner to training data using stochastic gradient descent method such that each successively added tree concentrates on improving poorly fit data points friedman 2001 the xgboost extreme gradient boosting package in r environment was used to build the model chen and guestrin 2016 nitrate concentration data were log base 10 transformed and randomly split into 80 training and 20 testing data in other words 80 of the 2061 sites were used for model training the model training processes does not see the 20 testing data the model was calibrated on training data using 10 fold cross validation with root mean square error rmse as the performance metric the prediction from the trained model was compared with testing data to validate the model in effect the model performance in the testing sites indicate the model prediction capabilities in chemically ungauged basins the calibrated brt model parameters are in table s 2 2 4 identifying and evaluating influential drivers although all watershed characteristics indexes were used for training influential indexes were analyzed by choosing independent relatively uncorrelated indexes with spearman s rank correlation less than 0 5 if two indexes represent similar characteristics they are mostly correlated discarding one of them will not affect the model much because the other index captures the pertinent characteristics we chose to use watershed indexes that are more relevant and commonly available when selecting one out of two or more correlated parameters figs s 7 in si for the extent of nitrogen input we tried both nrate and percent agricultural area aagri although nrate is highly correlated with aagri it is a better measure of nutrient input as it also accounts for fertilizer requirement of different crops and farming practices in different areas sites with the same aagri could have very different nrate and therefore nitrogen input the indexes were evaluated for their order of influence using forward selection backward selection and feature importance as detailed in si the influential indexes were ranked based on gain the average improvement in model performance when including the index chen et al 2019 a final model was built using only the five most important indexes drivers the brt model was fit and evaluated 1000 times on resampled training data and testing data respectively to ensure minimal influence of data splitting on model structure or performance all of them showed the same relative ranking of important predictors the model with median performance was chosen for further analysis to represent the average behavior individual conditional expectation ice plots and partial dependence plots pdp were used to visualize the dependence of nitrate concentrations on influential drivers friedman 2001 ice plots show how nitrate concentrations at individual sites would change as the value of a particular driver is varied while all others are held constant if different ice plots follow different trends it indicates possible interactions among drivers molnar 2019 the pdp is the average of ice plots for individual sites and represents the average response of nitrate concentration to variations of an individual driver to visualize interactions among drivers two way partial dependence plots pdp were also used where the model was run by varying two drivers at a time while keeping others constant 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of nitrate concentrations and continental scale brt model most of the 2061 sites are undeveloped nrate 5 000 kg km2 yr and aurban 20 fig 1 nitrate concentrations vary from 0 02 to 25 7 mg l the majority of the rivers have mean concentrations between 0 1 to 1 0 mg l high nitrate concentrations cluster in the mid west corn belt and in the northeastern us near the chesapeake bay fig 1 low nitrate concentrations occur in the relatively pristine western mountains and in southeast florida the highest nitrate concentration occurs in ottawa river ohio a site that drains an intensively cultivated watershed in allentown ohio the lookout creek in hj andrews experimental forest oregon has the lowest nitrate concentrations the trained brt model included five most influential drivers nitrogen application rates nrate percent urban area aurban mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat and percent sand content sand across the 1000 fitted models fig s 8 test r2 reported on log nitrate concentration varied from 0 59 to 0 76 and test rmse reported on log nitrate concentration ranged from 0 25 to 0 32 mg l predicted nitrate concentrations and model performance are shown in fig 2 where the model uses 5 indexes the training r2 is 0 89 the training rmse is 0 16 mg l the testing r2 is 0 69 the testing rmse is 0 29 mg l this is analogous to predicting nitrate concentrations in chemically ungauged basins without nitrate data the model with 32 indexes is only marginally better than the final model using only five drivers with an r2 of 0 73 and an rmse of 0 27 mg l in the testing sites the five drivers therefore can predict similarly as using all 32 suggesting their prominent role in controlling nitrate concentrations in other words given the values of the five drivers the trained model can predict nitrate concentration with about 70 accuracy in chemical ungauged sites and under future climate and land use conditions within the covered range of conditions the model captured intermediate concentrations well but overestimated the low end and underestimated the high end of the concentration range model residuals versus model predictions fig s 9 show no clear pattern this is common among machine learning models blanzeisky and cunningham 2021 arguably due to two reasons one is the data scarcity in high and low nitrate concentration regimes there are only 3 sites that have concentration above 5 mg l and 8 sites with concentration less than 0 1 mg l the distribution of nitrate concentration has a high positive skewness of 5 06 second the model captures the dominant drivers in data but misses subtle signals that can be important in predicting very high and very low concentrations blanzeisky and cunningham 2021 kamishima et al 2012 3 2 human n addition climate and sand content as the predominant drivers the top five influential drivers are of three major types in descending order human drivers climate drivers and soil properties their gain importance quantifies the extent to which each index improves the model performance with its addition fig 3a the human drivers nrate and aurban are most influential adding each of these two indexes improves the model by 35 and 26 respectively highlighting agriculture and urbanization as the predominant drivers the climate indexes follow with map and mat enhancing the model by 18 and 12 respectively sand is ranked the fifth enhancing performance by about 9 the strength of driver interactions was quantified using friedman s h statistic fig 3b friedman and popescu 2008 a higher h statistic means stronger dependence on other drivers if the h statistic for a driver is zero it means that the driver does not interact with other drivers the h statistic figure shows that aurban has the highest h statistic value indicating substantial interaction with other drivers in fact human and climate drivers interact substantially in determining nitrate concentrations the sand interacts with other drivers to the least degree 3 3 the differential influence of individual drivers partial dependence plots pdp and individual conditional expectation plots ice show that as nrate increases nitrate concentrations increase steadily until reaching a maximum at nrate 10 000 kg km2 yr fig 4a note that the number of sites having nrate 10 000 kg km2 yr is relatively small such that the model struggles to represent variation at this range and the plateau of values might have large uncertainties nitrate concentrations increase with aurban until reaching 25 beyond which nitrate concentrations level off with small variations fig 4b nitrate concentrations decrease with increasing map likely because high precipitation enhances nitrate exports fig 4c and reduces water residence time for nitrate accumulation and for processes such as denitrification nitrate concentrations remain relatively constant with temperature except between 5 15 c where maximum concentrations are reached between 9 10 c fig 4d sandy soils or increasing sand generally reduce nitrate concentration fig 4e deviation of individual ices from the pdp line indicates differences from average behavior in some sites for example multiple ice lines increase at low map fig 4c deviating from the general decreasing trend in pdp such behavior indicates other indexes may be more important than map at that map range for these sites also note that these trends are more trustworthy at driver values with ample training data there are less data points low density tick marks on x axis for pdps at extreme driver values e g nrate 10000 kg km2 yr aurban 50 and map 200 cm as a result patterns in these ranges have larger uncertainties 3 4 contrasting influence of human versus climate drivers two way pdps were used to further understand interactions among different drivers fig 5 as expected the highest concentrations occur at maximum agriculture nrate and urbanization aurban fig 5a suggesting human input as the most significant driver the contours indicate non linear relationships between nitrate concentrations and the extent of human influence at all nrate nitrate concentrations generally increase with aurban however the aurban value at which maximum concentration occurs varies with nrate for example at the nrate 2 500 kg km2 yr nitrate peaks at around aurban of 25 at the nrate range of 7 500 10 000 kg km2 yr highest concentrations occur at or below the aurban of 10 in other words as nrate increases higher concentrations occur at lower aurban indicating increasing dominance of agriculture compared to urbanization the impact of climate under different land uses are illustrated in the two way pdp plots fig 5b d sites of different land use were classified as follows undeveloped sites having nrate 500 kg km2 yr aurban 2 5 and aagri 2 5 agricultural sites having nrate 5000 kg km2 yr aagri 50 and aurban 10 and urban sites having aurban 50 nrate 2500 kg km2 yr and aagri 10 the criteria were chosen to ensure separation of sites with different land uses and sufficient number of sites for robust two way pdp analysis these criteria yield 210 undeveloped 129 agricultural and 81 urban sites in undeveloped sites highest concentrations cluster in arid and hot climates low map and high mat top left corner fig 5c in urban sites highest concentrations occur in low mat below 13 c and generally lower map left fig 5b lowest concentrations occur at intermediate mat and map conditions in agricultural sites concentrations are generally higher at low map 125 cm and low mat range peaking between 7 5 10 c left and bottom fig 5d conversely lowest concentrations occur at high map and high mat top right corner in fig 5d at map below 125 cm and mat higher than 10 c intermediate concentrations occur the data figure similarly shows the different dependence of mean concentrations on mean discharge under different land uses fig 6 note that mean concentrations versus mean discharge relationship across sites differ from the instantaneous concentration and discharge relationship in individual sites as the former represents more of the climate control whereas the latter reflects short term response to weather conditions botter et al 2020 zhi and li 2020 for water balanced watersheds mean discharge is generally the difference between water input precipitation and vegetation transpiration and atmospheric demand evaporation as water output it depends on mat map and vegetation cover and is generally considered as a long term climate measure under dry climates the ratios of annual potential evapotranspiration pet dependent on temperature and solar radiation to map are high most precipitated water lose via transpiration and evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration aet resulting in low annual discharges this aet map and pet map relationships is shown on the classic budyko curve fig s 10 it is therefore common to use mean annual discharge as a measure of climate combining effect of map and mat in undeveloped sites concentrations decrease with increasing mean discharge cmean no3 n 0 32 q 0 11 r2 0 17 p 0 001 under similar discharge conditions sandy sites generally have lower concentrations fig 6a this indicates that in minimally impacted sites high concentrations arise in arid places with low export capacity low discharge and low sand or low map but high mat fig 5c in urban sites there is no significant correlation between mean concentration and mean discharge fig 6b urban sites have a narrow range of mean annual discharges 10 100 cm fig 6b possibly due to human dwelling preference in sufficiently wet places fang et al 2018 it could also arise from water import and sewer systems in urban areas townsend small et al 2013 white and greer 2006 as the map range in urban sites is in fact wide ranging nitrate concentrations in agriculture sites with relatively low nrate small circles decrease with increasing mean discharge fig 6c resembling those in undeveloped sites fig 6a in other words when human influence is comparatively low climate emerges as the predominant driver low concentrations generally occur in wet and hot climates top right region of pdps under every land use conditions 4 discussion 4 1 agriculture and urbanization as the predominant drivers for long term baseline concentrations results confirm existing paradigm that human perturbations in particular urbanization and agriculture predominantly drive nitrate concentrations and override both climate and soil property drivers among other watershed characteristics clune et al 2020 mulholland et al 2008 anthropogenic nitrogen comes from multiple sources including synthetic fertilizer application fossil fuel combustion schlesinger 2009 and manure zhang et al 2017 in urban areas high nitrate concentrations arise from waste treatment plants jiang et al 2021 leaky sewers and septic tanks pennino et al 2016 atmospheric deposition from traffic decina et al 2020 and fertilizer application in green spaces and lawns hobbie et al 2017 these processes lead to high nitrogen stores that approach the maximum at about 10 000 kg km2 yr and 25 aurban respectively in agriculture and urban sites further increase beyond these levels appear to have little effect on nitrate concentrations such phenomena were similarly observed for other solutes for example total organic carbon and has been explained by watershed connectivity zarnetske et al 2018 the data and model also indicate that patterns of nitrate concentrations under different climates mat and map are shaped by human agriculture and dwelling preference for example the mat range of 7 5 10 c emerges as an apparent hot zone of elevated nitrate concentration fig 5b pdp further examination of the data in the condition regime indicates that it is not the temperature range that leads to unique conditions for high nitrate concentrations instead it is the presence of more intensive agriculture sites in this particular temperature regime that leads to high nitrate concentrations more agriculture sites also occur in the mean annual discharge range of 10 100 cm similarly urbanization mostly occurs in the preferential mean discharge range from 10 100 cm in places with relatively low application rates nrate 7 000 kg km2 yr nitrate decreases with increasing discharge similar to patterns in undeveloped sites this underscores the outsized role of human impacts on nitrate concentrations in other words human input dramatically elevates n sources often by orders of magnitude such that it obscures the effects of climate and other characteristics botter et al 2020 clune et al 2020 mulholland et al 2008 only under limited anthropogenic impacts the climate and soil drivers can manifest their influences 4 2 climate and soil properties modulate nitrate transport and transformation while nitrate concentrations generally decrease with increasing discharge in undeveloped sites such patterns are not observed in urban and agriculture sites fig 6 riverine nitrate from undeveloped lands is governed by hydroclimatic conditions particularly mean discharge mainly dependent on map and mat and sand both important regulators of nitrate transport and transformation riverine nitrate fluxes typically increase with precipitation howarth et al 2006 sinha and michalak 2016 whereas nitrate concentrations decrease with increasing mean discharge fig 6a decreasing pattern of mean concentrations with increasing mean discharge is not unique for nitrate this pattern in fact echoes those of 16 water quality solutes in undeveloped rivers in the contiguous united states including nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen and total nitrogen li et al 2022a a watershed reactor model indicates that this universal pattern arises from relatively large solute export compared to solute addition under humid climates li et al 2022a stewart et al 2022 nitrate application is the main driver of nitrate concentration in agriculture sites however no particular driver correlates significantly with nitrate concentrations in urban sites this potentially indicates comparable influence of different drivers such that no single one stands out as the most significant or the watershed characteristics used in this work do not include key characteristics that regulate mean nitrate in urban sites in addition to regulation by the human input and export fluxes mediated by climate conditions nitrate concentrations also depend on a wide range of processes including biotic uptake nitrification and denitrification these processes depend on ecosystem and biogeochemical function that in turn hinge on an array of climate vegetation and geology characteristics beaulieu et al 2011 mulholland et al 2008 wherry et al 2021 despite the distinct pdps and mean concentrations versus discharge patterns across different land uses low nitrate concentrations generally occur in humid and hot climates top right of pdps under every land use conditions fig 5b d this can arise from two possibilities one is the higher nitrate outfluxes due to higher hydrological connectivity at high map the other is the wetter and hot conditions that enhance anaerobic microbial activities and denitrification sand content emerges as an important watershed characteristic driver highlighting the dependence of nitrate on subsurface properties and flow paths under otherwise similar conditions high sand content facilitates fast discharge and flushing of nitrate to streams resulting in less accumulation and lower nitrate content in watersheds and ultimately lower concentrations sandy soils also promote groundwater recharge resulting in longer flow paths and residence times in groundwater aquifers that maximize denitrification before its ultimate re entry into streams and rivers burns et al 2009 tesoriero et al 2017 wherry et al 2021 in addition sandy soils indicate lower clay content which often sorb and store ammonia ammonia can readily become nitrate via nitrification the lower storage for ammonia in sandy soils also indicate easy loss of nitrogen and generally lower nitrate concentrations nitrate dependence on mean discharge indicates possible concentration increase under changing climate although map has been projected to remain at similar levels in many places warming will escalate water demand by the atmosphere evaporation and vegetation transpiration mastrotheodoros et al 2020 vadeboncoeur et al 2018 therefore reducing river discharge and elevating nitrate concentrations in undeveloped sites in other words even without human perturbation we expect rising nitrate concentrations in undeveloped lands as warming continues li et al 2022a ombadi and varadharajan 2022 it is challenging to directly project nitrate concentrations for future climate in agriculture and urban sites due to the complex interplay between human climate and subsurface property conditions the model however indicates higher nitrate concentration at the sites with increasing human input the developed model here also offers the capability to forecast nitrate concentrations with available values of the five drivers 4 3 data availability and model limitations this work shows the promise of using machine learning to reconstruct nitrate concentrations across conus and to examine their broad patterns and drivers under a constellation of entangled external and internal structure drivers it is interesting that out of 32 indexes five indexes are sufficient to predict 69 of the concentration variations across the enormous span of climate land use vegetation and geology conditions within the entire conus as long as the values of these drivers are available the model can be used to predict nitrate concentration under future climate and land use conditions and in rivers where nitrate concentrations are not available such ml approaches and accompanying analysis for influencing drivers can potentially be extended to other water quality measures it is important to note however that model was developed to predict long term mean concentrations with given indexes in the model it cannot predict short term variations such as daily concentration response to weather conditions and extensively studied concentration discharge relationships that reflect variations in hydrological conditions and flow paths ebeling et al 2021b zhi and li 2020 it also cannot be used to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as the restoration of wetlands and riparian zones farm management practices and stringent effluent standards among others the absence of riparian vegetation in the final five drivers does not undermine the importance of riparian vegetation as detailed in model training and feature selection in si riparian land use strongly correlates to general catchment land use the model identifies the most influential factors at the continental scale but not the unique subtle influence of local nuances the work also reveals inconsistent data coverage in different land uses nitrate concentrations are measured in a much larger number of undeveloped sites compared to human impacted sites especially the most intensive agriculture sites and mega cities with high n input fig 1 the disparate patterns and drivers of human impacted versus undeveloped sites suggests that human impacts have an outsized influence on nitrate concentrations this indicates that more intensive data collection in human impacted land use conditions are essential in addition separate models of different land use types may be necessary to accommodate nuances and uniqueness of their distinct features and to forecast more accurately and at higher spatial and temporal resolution in the face of increasing urbanization and agricultural expansion such forecasting capabilities are essential 5 conclusion this work collated nitrate data in 2 061 rivers and developed machine learning models to forecast the long term baseline nitrate concentrations in us rivers and to identify its influential drivers as expected nitrate concentrations peak in the us corn belt reaching as high as 25 mg l and are lowest in undeveloped sites with high precipitation and discharge of the 32 site characteristics indexes five indexes emerge as the most influential drivers and can explain about 69 of spatial variations in nitrate concentrations the values of these five indexes including nitrogen application rates percentage of urban area mean annual precipitation and temperature and sand content in soils are available for most us watersheds and rivers further analysis of data and model output revealed the interacting influence of climate versus human drivers in regulating riverine nitrate concentrations results here allude to a conceptual model that human drivers provide the outsized source inputs whereas climate and soil property drivers regulate the export and removal of nitrate via transport and transformation processes results here also indicate that as warming escalates water demand and reduce river discharge in many places mean baseline concentrations can increase even without additional human input direct inference of nitrate concentrations in future climate and land use conditions is challenging although the model indicates higher nitrate under high human influence conditions the model offers the capability to forecast long term mean nitrate concentrations in chemically ungaued rivers and in future climate and land use conditions as long as the values of the five drivers are available the estimation can potentially be used for water quality management and risk assessment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

15409,nitrate is one of the most widespread and persistent pollutants in our time our understanding of nitrate dynamics has advanced substantially in the past decades although its predominant drivers across gradients of climate land use and geology have remained elusive here we collated nitrate data from 2061 rivers along with 32 watershed characteristic indexes and developed machine learning models to reconstruct long term mean multi year average nitrate concentrations in the contiguous united states conus the trained models show similarly satisfactory model performance and can predict nitrate concentrations in chemically ungauged places with about 70 accuracy further analysis revealed that five out of 32 indexes drivers can explain about 70 of spatial variations in mean nitrate concentrations the five influential drivers are nitrogen application rates nrate and urban area aurban human drivers mean annual precipitation and temperature climate drivers and sand percent sand soil property driver nitrate concentrations in undeveloped sites are primarily modulated by climate and soil property they decrease with increasing mean discharge and sand nitrate concentrations in agriculture and urban sites increase with nrate and aurban until reaching their apparent maxima around 10 000 kg km2 yr and around 25 respectively results indicate that nitrate concentrations may remain similar or increase with growing human population in addition nitrate concentrations can increase even without human input as warming escalates water demand and reduces mean discharge in many places these results allude to a conceptual model that highlights the impacts of distinct drivers while human drivers predominate nitrogen input to land and rivers climate drivers and soil properties modulate its transport and transformation the balance of which determine long term mean concentrations such mechanism based insights and forecasting capabilities are essential for water management as we expect changing climate and growing agriculture and urbanization graphical abstract machine learning models identify the most influential factors of long term mean nitrate concentrations in us

induced persistent nitrogen pollution eutrophication and harmful algal blooms have occurred in 60 of us estuaries and coastal water bodies and across the globe ascott et al 2017 howarth et al 2002 nitrogen pollution causes extensive evasion of greenhouse gasses such as n2o beaulieu et al 2011 and human health issues including low fetal blood oxygen ward et al 2018 extensive efforts to reduce riverine nitrate concentrations have not worked as expected van meter et al 2018 brookfield et al 2021 there is a pressing need to understand drivers of nitrate concentrations in order to develop forecasting capabilities in chemically ungauged basins and under future climate and land use conditions as an example urban lands in the us are expected to double by 2060 and cropland is expanding by one million acres per year bureau et al 2012 lark et al 2020 both of which will exacerbate nitrogen contamination riverine nitrate concentrations and loads depend on the balance between processes that add versus those that remove and export nitrate elevated human input through fertilizer application wastewater input among other types of input have tripled reactive nitrogen input to us land and waterways in agricultural and urban landscapes compared to pre european settlement sobota et al 2013 pervasive legacy nitrogen stores in soils have elevated nitrogen export to streams van meter et al 2018 nitrate concentration in agricultural and urban rivers has been shown to be eleven times and five times higher respectively than in rivers draining undeveloped rivers clune et al 2020 nitrate is often a small portion of total nitrogen in forested catchments but exceed 50 in urban and agricultural streams pellerin et al 2004 while 20 25 of n input is exported to streams the rest is retained removed or cycled through multiple processes howarth et al 2006 these processes include biological assimilation nitrification from ammonia to nitrate denitrification from nitrate to gases n2 no n2o kampschreur et al 2009 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 nitrate can be removed via processes such as biological uptake dodds et al 2002 and denitrification in riparian zones lutz et al 2020 wherry et al 2021 wetlands cheng et al 2020 soils harms and ludwig 2016 streams beaulieu et al 2011 mulholland et al 2008 ponded waters schmadel et al 2018 and groundwater hinkle and tesoriero 2014 watershed characteristics including geology and tile drains can also regulate nitrate concentrations makino et al 2021 wherry et al 2021 the influence of human and climate drivers often intertwine guo et al 2020 lintern et al 2021 lintern et al 2018 nitrate loads and fluxes are primarily driven by water fluxes regulated by climate e g precipitation evapotranspiration nitrate loads from agriculture runoff are expected to increase under intensified hydrologic events such as flooding kumar et al 2020 sinha and michalak 2016 instantaneous nitrate concentrations have been observed to often increase with river discharge in agriculture land as rising water tables flush nitrate out of nitrogen rich shallow soils ebeling et al 2021a zhi and li 2020 nitrate fluxes are typically lower at low flow where high temperature and evapotranspiration reduce discharge elongate residence times and possibly promote nitrogen removal benettin et al 2020 jeppesen et al 2011 distinguishing these entangling drivers require high spatial and temporal resolution datasets yet water quality data are often inconsistent and sparse challenging mechanistic understanding and differentiation of individual drivers the recent renaissance of machine learning ml algorithms can build models that accommodate complex relationships beyond traditional regression models and reconstruct data records based on spatially and temporally sparse data varadharajan et al 2022 zhi et al 2021 ml algorithms have been used to reproduce and predict spatial distribution of nitrate concentrations in groundwater ransom et al 2022 and streams wang et al 2021 they have identified urban and agriculture land use as major drivers in individual watersheds and at regional scales golden et al 2016 wherry et al 2021 a recently developed continental scale random forest rf model estimated nutrient concentrations total nitrogen and phosphorous total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous nitrate in different seasons at 62 495 stations across the us streams for the period of 1994 2018 using 47 environmental variables shen et al 2020 the estimated data offer potentials for further investigation of ecosystem and biogeochemical processes at the continental scale although this study itself did not further examine the patterns and drivers of these nutrients our understanding on drivers of long term baseline mean nitrate concentrations at the continental scale therefore is still lacking here we ask the question how and to what extent do human climate and watershed characteristics regulate long term mean nitrate concentration at the continental scale here mean nitrate concentrations hereafter nitrate concentrations are defined and calculated as the multi year averages of instantaneous nitrate concentrations from individual rivers and streams they differ from instantaneous concentrations directly measured from sensors or grab water samples that reflect nitrate response to variations in short term weather conditions four machine learning models were trained to reproduce and predict nitrate concentration data from 2061 rivers in the contiguous united states conus each river has 32 watershed characteristic indexes including climate land use and soil properties among other characteristics we further analyzed data and model output to identify the most influential indexes drivers and explore the functional dependence of nitrate concentrations on individual drivers which is often missing in machine learning studies the trained model can be used to forecast mean baseline nitrate concentrations in chemically ungauged basins and under future climate and land use scenarios a much needed capability for present and future water management 2 methods 2 1 data nitrate concentration data were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs water data survey 2016 using the usgs r dataretrieval package hirsch and de cicco 2015 and usgs parameter 00618 nitrate in filtered water sample in mg l as nitrogen site characteristics pertaining to entire watersheds were obtained from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii database falcone 2011 nitrate data availability varies significantly from site to site in duration frequency and time periods a common challenge for water quality data li et al 2021 the temporal data coverage is from 1900 to 2020 less than 0 5 of data is from before 1940 fig s 1 about 90 of data are from 1960 onwards choosing sites with consistent period coverage from 2000 2020 for example would lead to only 792 sites which would be insufficient for model training the means calculated for between 1960 2020 and those for between 1980 2020 shows negligible difference fig s 2 this is not surprising although urban and agriculture lands are still expanding they have mostly stabilized in patterns since 1950s li et al 2022b fig s 3 detection limits differ across sites we compared arithmetic means with and without detection limit values except for a handful of sites the two sets of means fall on the 1 1 line indicating negligible impact of excluding data below detection limit fig s 4 we therefore used data in all years in each site excluding the below detection limit values to maximize the number of data sites and robust model training we also purposely chose to use arithmetic mean instead of commonly used discharge weighted mean concentrations because arithmetic mean gives equal weight to every data point river discharge typically vary by orders of magnitude such that discharge weighted means give more weight to concentrations at high discharge this could lead to biased mean concentrations especially when the timing and frequency of sampling are inconsistent across discharge regimes at different sites we did not choose to use geometric means as they do not have clear physical meanings 2 2 watershed characteristic indexes thirty two watershed characteristic indexes from the gages ii database were selected as candidate predictors these characteristics include categories of nitrogen input land cover climate geomorphological characteristics soil geology stream characteristics and topography table s 1 specifically measures of nitrogen input include indexes such as fertilizer and manure application rates hydrological disturbance index quantifies anthropogenic modifications land use parameters include the percent of forest agricultural and urban areas the climate variables include mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat mean annual number of rainy days snow percent of precipitation and precipitation seasonality index soil properties include soil thickness bulk density available water capacity sand clay and organic matter content dominant geology include gneiss granitic quaternary sedimentary ultramafic and volcanic bedrocks river network characteristics include stream density maximum strahler stream order base flow index topographic wetness index subsurface flow contact time index average stream runoff and percent length of first order stream topographical attributes include mean elevation and slope percent watershed drainage areas vary from 1 66 to 49 802 km2 mean 4 912 km2 standard deviation 8 679 km2 some small watersheds are nested within the same river basins characteristic indexes were derived from the delineated watershed for each site therefore representing the average of each watershed contributing to river flow at the gauge 2 3 model development we trained four models including boosted regression trees brt random forest rf neural network nnet and ensemble ensemble model the first three widely used varadharajan et al 2022 the fourth ensemble model combines the outputs of brt rf and nnet by generalized linear model with elastic net penalty it was expected to outperform the other three all indexes were used initially in model training the model performance was evaluated using testing data that were not used in the model training the four models have very similar performance and parameter ranking figs s 5 and s 6 in si the ensemble performed the best but only slightly and was closely followed by brt it however is considerably more complex with a much larger number of parameters we therefore only analyzed the brt model output to avoid model complexity and redundancy brt uses the decision tree classification and regression trees carts as base learners carts make recursive binary partitions that divide the predictor space into subregions with similar outputs the model output is calculated as the mean of outputs regression tree or majority class classification tree of training data in the subregion of predictor space where test data falls breiman et al 1984 brt fits several carts sequentially in a stage wise forward manner to training data using stochastic gradient descent method such that each successively added tree concentrates on improving poorly fit data points friedman 2001 the xgboost extreme gradient boosting package in r environment was used to build the model chen and guestrin 2016 nitrate concentration data were log base 10 transformed and randomly split into 80 training and 20 testing data in other words 80 of the 2061 sites were used for model training the model training processes does not see the 20 testing data the model was calibrated on training data using 10 fold cross validation with root mean square error rmse as the performance metric the prediction from the trained model was compared with testing data to validate the model in effect the model performance in the testing sites indicate the model prediction capabilities in chemically ungauged basins the calibrated brt model parameters are in table s 2 2 4 identifying and evaluating influential drivers although all watershed characteristics indexes were used for training influential indexes were analyzed by choosing independent relatively uncorrelated indexes with spearman s rank correlation less than 0 5 if two indexes represent similar characteristics they are mostly correlated discarding one of them will not affect the model much because the other index captures the pertinent characteristics we chose to use watershed indexes that are more relevant and commonly available when selecting one out of two or more correlated parameters figs s 7 in si for the extent of nitrogen input we tried both nrate and percent agricultural area aagri although nrate is highly correlated with aagri it is a better measure of nutrient input as it also accounts for fertilizer requirement of different crops and farming practices in different areas sites with the same aagri could have very different nrate and therefore nitrogen input the indexes were evaluated for their order of influence using forward selection backward selection and feature importance as detailed in si the influential indexes were ranked based on gain the average improvement in model performance when including the index chen et al 2019 a final model was built using only the five most important indexes drivers the brt model was fit and evaluated 1000 times on resampled training data and testing data respectively to ensure minimal influence of data splitting on model structure or performance all of them showed the same relative ranking of important predictors the model with median performance was chosen for further analysis to represent the average behavior individual conditional expectation ice plots and partial dependence plots pdp were used to visualize the dependence of nitrate concentrations on influential drivers friedman 2001 ice plots show how nitrate concentrations at individual sites would change as the value of a particular driver is varied while all others are held constant if different ice plots follow different trends it indicates possible interactions among drivers molnar 2019 the pdp is the average of ice plots for individual sites and represents the average response of nitrate concentration to variations of an individual driver to visualize interactions among drivers two way partial dependence plots pdp were also used where the model was run by varying two drivers at a time while keeping others constant 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of nitrate concentrations and continental scale brt model most of the 2061 sites are undeveloped nrate 5 000 kg km2 yr and aurban 20 fig 1 nitrate concentrations vary from 0 02 to 25 7 mg l the majority of the rivers have mean concentrations between 0 1 to 1 0 mg l high nitrate concentrations cluster in the mid west corn belt and in the northeastern us near the chesapeake bay fig 1 low nitrate concentrations occur in the relatively pristine western mountains and in southeast florida the highest nitrate concentration occurs in ottawa river ohio a site that drains an intensively cultivated watershed in allentown ohio the lookout creek in hj andrews experimental forest oregon has the lowest nitrate concentrations the trained brt model included five most influential drivers nitrogen application rates nrate percent urban area aurban mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat and percent sand content sand across the 1000 fitted models fig s 8 test r2 reported on log nitrate concentration varied from 0 59 to 0 76 and test rmse reported on log nitrate concentration ranged from 0 25 to 0 32 mg l predicted nitrate concentrations and model performance are shown in fig 2 where the model uses 5 indexes the training r2 is 0 89 the training rmse is 0 16 mg l the testing r2 is 0 69 the testing rmse is 0 29 mg l this is analogous to predicting nitrate concentrations in chemically ungauged basins without nitrate data the model with 32 indexes is only marginally better than the final model using only five drivers with an r2 of 0 73 and an rmse of 0 27 mg l in the testing sites the five drivers therefore can predict similarly as using all 32 suggesting their prominent role in controlling nitrate concentrations in other words given the values of the five drivers the trained model can predict nitrate concentration with about 70 accuracy in chemical ungauged sites and under future climate and land use conditions within the covered range of conditions the model captured intermediate concentrations well but overestimated the low end and underestimated the high end of the concentration range model residuals versus model predictions fig s 9 show no clear pattern this is common among machine learning models blanzeisky and cunningham 2021 arguably due to two reasons one is the data scarcity in high and low nitrate concentration regimes there are only 3 sites that have concentration above 5 mg l and 8 sites with concentration less than 0 1 mg l the distribution of nitrate concentration has a high positive skewness of 5 06 second the model captures the dominant drivers in data but misses subtle signals that can be important in predicting very high and very low concentrations blanzeisky and cunningham 2021 kamishima et al 2012 3 2 human n addition climate and sand content as the predominant drivers the top five influential drivers are of three major types in descending order human drivers climate drivers and soil properties their gain importance quantifies the extent to which each index improves the model performance with its addition fig 3a the human drivers nrate and aurban are most influential adding each of these two indexes improves the model by 35 and 26 respectively highlighting agriculture and urbanization as the predominant drivers the climate indexes follow with map and mat enhancing the model by 18 and 12 respectively sand is ranked the fifth enhancing performance by about 9 the strength of driver interactions was quantified using friedman s h statistic fig 3b friedman and popescu 2008 a higher h statistic means stronger dependence on other drivers if the h statistic for a driver is zero it means that the driver does not interact with other drivers the h statistic figure shows that aurban has the highest h statistic value indicating substantial interaction with other drivers in fact human and climate drivers interact substantially in determining nitrate concentrations the sand interacts with other drivers to the least degree 3 3 the differential influence of individual drivers partial dependence plots pdp and individual conditional expectation plots ice show that as nrate increases nitrate concentrations increase steadily until reaching a maximum at nrate 10 000 kg km2 yr fig 4a note that the number of sites having nrate 10 000 kg km2 yr is relatively small such that the model struggles to represent variation at this range and the plateau of values might have large uncertainties nitrate concentrations increase with aurban until reaching 25 beyond which nitrate concentrations level off with small variations fig 4b nitrate concentrations decrease with increasing map likely because high precipitation enhances nitrate exports fig 4c and reduces water residence time for nitrate accumulation and for processes such as denitrification nitrate concentrations remain relatively constant with temperature except between 5 15 c where maximum concentrations are reached between 9 10 c fig 4d sandy soils or increasing sand generally reduce nitrate concentration fig 4e deviation of individual ices from the pdp line indicates differences from average behavior in some sites for example multiple ice lines increase at low map fig 4c deviating from the general decreasing trend in pdp such behavior indicates other indexes may be more important than map at that map range for these sites also note that these trends are more trustworthy at driver values with ample training data there are less data points low density tick marks on x axis for pdps at extreme driver values e g nrate 10000 kg km2 yr aurban 50 and map 200 cm as a result patterns in these ranges have larger uncertainties 3 4 contrasting influence of human versus climate drivers two way pdps were used to further understand interactions among different drivers fig 5 as expected the highest concentrations occur at maximum agriculture nrate and urbanization aurban fig 5a suggesting human input as the most significant driver the contours indicate non linear relationships between nitrate concentrations and the extent of human influence at all nrate nitrate concentrations generally increase with aurban however the aurban value at which maximum concentration occurs varies with nrate for example at the nrate 2 500 kg km2 yr nitrate peaks at around aurban of 25 at the nrate range of 7 500 10 000 kg km2 yr highest concentrations occur at or below the aurban of 10 in other words as nrate increases higher concentrations occur at lower aurban indicating increasing dominance of agriculture compared to urbanization the impact of climate under different land uses are illustrated in the two way pdp plots fig 5b d sites of different land use were classified as follows undeveloped sites having nrate 500 kg km2 yr aurban 2 5 and aagri 2 5 agricultural sites having nrate 5000 kg km2 yr aagri 50 and aurban 10 and urban sites having aurban 50 nrate 2500 kg km2 yr and aagri 10 the criteria were chosen to ensure separation of sites with different land uses and sufficient number of sites for robust two way pdp analysis these criteria yield 210 undeveloped 129 agricultural and 81 urban sites in undeveloped sites highest concentrations cluster in arid and hot climates low map and high mat top left corner fig 5c in urban sites highest concentrations occur in low mat below 13 c and generally lower map left fig 5b lowest concentrations occur at intermediate mat and map conditions in agricultural sites concentrations are generally higher at low map 125 cm and low mat range peaking between 7 5 10 c left and bottom fig 5d conversely lowest concentrations occur at high map and high mat top right corner in fig 5d at map below 125 cm and mat higher than 10 c intermediate concentrations occur the data figure similarly shows the different dependence of mean concentrations on mean discharge under different land uses fig 6 note that mean concentrations versus mean discharge relationship across sites differ from the instantaneous concentration and discharge relationship in individual sites as the former represents more of the climate control whereas the latter reflects short term response to weather conditions botter et al 2020 zhi and li 2020 for water balanced watersheds mean discharge is generally the difference between water input precipitation and vegetation transpiration and atmospheric demand evaporation as water output it depends on mat map and vegetation cover and is generally considered as a long term climate measure under dry climates the ratios of annual potential evapotranspiration pet dependent on temperature and solar radiation to map are high most precipitated water lose via transpiration and evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration aet resulting in low annual discharges this aet map and pet map relationships is shown on the classic budyko curve fig s 10 it is therefore common to use mean annual discharge as a measure of climate combining effect of map and mat in undeveloped sites concentrations decrease with increasing mean discharge cmean no3 n 0 32 q 0 11 r2 0 17 p 0 001 under similar discharge conditions sandy sites generally have lower concentrations fig 6a this indicates that in minimally impacted sites high concentrations arise in arid places with low export capacity low discharge and low sand or low map but high mat fig 5c in urban sites there is no significant correlation between mean concentration and mean discharge fig 6b urban sites have a narrow range of mean annual discharges 10 100 cm fig 6b possibly due to human dwelling preference in sufficiently wet places fang et al 2018 it could also arise from water import and sewer systems in urban areas townsend small et al 2013 white and greer 2006 as the map range in urban sites is in fact wide ranging nitrate concentrations in agriculture sites with relatively low nrate small circles decrease with increasing mean discharge fig 6c resembling those in undeveloped sites fig 6a in other words when human influence is comparatively low climate emerges as the predominant driver low concentrations generally occur in wet and hot climates top right region of pdps under every land use conditions 4 discussion 4 1 agriculture and urbanization as the predominant drivers for long term baseline concentrations results confirm existing paradigm that human perturbations in particular urbanization and agriculture predominantly drive nitrate concentrations and override both climate and soil property drivers among other watershed characteristics clune et al 2020 mulholland et al 2008 anthropogenic nitrogen comes from multiple sources including synthetic fertilizer application fossil fuel combustion schlesinger 2009 and manure zhang et al 2017 in urban areas high nitrate concentrations arise from waste treatment plants jiang et al 2021 leaky sewers and septic tanks pennino et al 2016 atmospheric deposition from traffic decina et al 2020 and fertilizer application in green spaces and lawns hobbie et al 2017 these processes lead to high nitrogen stores that approach the maximum at about 10 000 kg km2 yr and 25 aurban respectively in agriculture and urban sites further increase beyond these levels appear to have little effect on nitrate concentrations such phenomena were similarly observed for other solutes for example total organic carbon and has been explained by watershed connectivity zarnetske et al 2018 the data and model also indicate that patterns of nitrate concentrations under different climates mat and map are shaped by human agriculture and dwelling preference for example the mat range of 7 5 10 c emerges as an apparent hot zone of elevated nitrate concentration fig 5b pdp further examination of the data in the condition regime indicates that it is not the temperature range that leads to unique conditions for high nitrate concentrations instead it is the presence of more intensive agriculture sites in this particular temperature regime that leads to high nitrate concentrations more agriculture sites also occur in the mean annual discharge range of 10 100 cm similarly urbanization mostly occurs in the preferential mean discharge range from 10 100 cm in places with relatively low application rates nrate 7 000 kg km2 yr nitrate decreases with increasing discharge similar to patterns in undeveloped sites this underscores the outsized role of human impacts on nitrate concentrations in other words human input dramatically elevates n sources often by orders of magnitude such that it obscures the effects of climate and other characteristics botter et al 2020 clune et al 2020 mulholland et al 2008 only under limited anthropogenic impacts the climate and soil drivers can manifest their influences 4 2 climate and soil properties modulate nitrate transport and transformation while nitrate concentrations generally decrease with increasing discharge in undeveloped sites such patterns are not observed in urban and agriculture sites fig 6 riverine nitrate from undeveloped lands is governed by hydroclimatic conditions particularly mean discharge mainly dependent on map and mat and sand both important regulators of nitrate transport and transformation riverine nitrate fluxes typically increase with precipitation howarth et al 2006 sinha and michalak 2016 whereas nitrate concentrations decrease with increasing mean discharge fig 6a decreasing pattern of mean concentrations with increasing mean discharge is not unique for nitrate this pattern in fact echoes those of 16 water quality solutes in undeveloped rivers in the contiguous united states including nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen and total nitrogen li et al 2022a a watershed reactor model indicates that this universal pattern arises from relatively large solute export compared to solute addition under humid climates li et al 2022a stewart et al 2022 nitrate application is the main driver of nitrate concentration in agriculture sites however no particular driver correlates significantly with nitrate concentrations in urban sites this potentially indicates comparable influence of different drivers such that no single one stands out as the most significant or the watershed characteristics used in this work do not include key characteristics that regulate mean nitrate in urban sites in addition to regulation by the human input and export fluxes mediated by climate conditions nitrate concentrations also depend on a wide range of processes including biotic uptake nitrification and denitrification these processes depend on ecosystem and biogeochemical function that in turn hinge on an array of climate vegetation and geology characteristics beaulieu et al 2011 mulholland et al 2008 wherry et al 2021 despite the distinct pdps and mean concentrations versus discharge patterns across different land uses low nitrate concentrations generally occur in humid and hot climates top right of pdps under every land use conditions fig 5b d this can arise from two possibilities one is the higher nitrate outfluxes due to higher hydrological connectivity at high map the other is the wetter and hot conditions that enhance anaerobic microbial activities and denitrification sand content emerges as an important watershed characteristic driver highlighting the dependence of nitrate on subsurface properties and flow paths under otherwise similar conditions high sand content facilitates fast discharge and flushing of nitrate to streams resulting in less accumulation and lower nitrate content in watersheds and ultimately lower concentrations sandy soils also promote groundwater recharge resulting in longer flow paths and residence times in groundwater aquifers that maximize denitrification before its ultimate re entry into streams and rivers burns et al 2009 tesoriero et al 2017 wherry et al 2021 in addition sandy soils indicate lower clay content which often sorb and store ammonia ammonia can readily become nitrate via nitrification the lower storage for ammonia in sandy soils also indicate easy loss of nitrogen and generally lower nitrate concentrations nitrate dependence on mean discharge indicates possible concentration increase under changing climate although map has been projected to remain at similar levels in many places warming will escalate water demand by the atmosphere evaporation and vegetation transpiration mastrotheodoros et al 2020 vadeboncoeur et al 2018 therefore reducing river discharge and elevating nitrate concentrations in undeveloped sites in other words even without human perturbation we expect rising nitrate concentrations in undeveloped lands as warming continues li et al 2022a ombadi and varadharajan 2022 it is challenging to directly project nitrate concentrations for future climate in agriculture and urban sites due to the complex interplay between human climate and subsurface property conditions the model however indicates higher nitrate concentration at the sites with increasing human input the developed model here also offers the capability to forecast nitrate concentrations with available values of the five drivers 4 3 data availability and model limitations this work shows the promise of using machine learning to reconstruct nitrate concentrations across conus and to examine their broad patterns and drivers under a constellation of entangled external and internal structure drivers it is interesting that out of 32 indexes five indexes are sufficient to predict 69 of the concentration variations across the enormous span of climate land use vegetation and geology conditions within the entire conus as long as the values of these drivers are available the model can be used to predict nitrate concentration under future climate and land use conditions and in rivers where nitrate concentrations are not available such ml approaches and accompanying analysis for influencing drivers can potentially be extended to other water quality measures it is important to note however that model was developed to predict long term mean concentrations with given indexes in the model it cannot predict short term variations such as daily concentration response to weather conditions and extensively studied concentration discharge relationships that reflect variations in hydrological conditions and flow paths ebeling et al 2021b zhi and li 2020 it also cannot be used to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as the restoration of wetlands and riparian zones farm management practices and stringent effluent standards among others the absence of riparian vegetation in the final five drivers does not undermine the importance of riparian vegetation as detailed in model training and feature selection in si riparian land use strongly correlates to general catchment land use the model identifies the most influential factors at the continental scale but not the unique subtle influence of local nuances the work also reveals inconsistent data coverage in different land uses nitrate concentrations are measured in a much larger number of undeveloped sites compared to human impacted sites especially the most intensive agriculture sites and mega cities with high n input fig 1 the disparate patterns and drivers of human impacted versus undeveloped sites suggests that human impacts have an outsized influence on nitrate concentrations this indicates that more intensive data collection in human impacted land use conditions are essential in addition separate models of different land use types may be necessary to accommodate nuances and uniqueness of their distinct features and to forecast more accurately and at higher spatial and temporal resolution in the face of increasing urbanization and agricultural expansion such forecasting capabilities are essential 5 conclusion this work collated nitrate data in 2 061 rivers and developed machine learning models to forecast the long term baseline nitrate concentrations in us rivers and to identify its influential drivers as expected nitrate concentrations peak in the us corn belt reaching as high as 25 mg l and are lowest in undeveloped sites with high precipitation and discharge of the 32 site characteristics indexes five indexes emerge as the most influential drivers and can explain about 69 of spatial variations in nitrate concentrations the values of these five indexes including nitrogen application rates percentage of urban area mean annual precipitation and temperature and sand content in soils are available for most us watersheds and rivers further analysis of data and model output revealed the interacting influence of climate versus human drivers in regulating riverine nitrate concentrations results here allude to a conceptual model that human drivers provide the outsized source inputs whereas climate and soil property drivers regulate the export and removal of nitrate via transport and transformation processes results here also indicate that as warming escalates water demand and reduce river discharge in many places mean baseline concentrations can increase even without additional human input direct inference of nitrate concentrations in future climate and land use conditions is challenging although the model indicates higher nitrate under high human influence conditions the model offers the capability to forecast long term mean nitrate concentrations in chemically ungaued rivers and in future climate and land use conditions as long as the values of the five drivers are available the estimation can potentially
