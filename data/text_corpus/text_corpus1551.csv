7755,study region the yellow river located in the north of china the most hyper concentrated sediment laden rivers in the world is featured by complicated spatiotemporal variation of river patterns study focus river patterns contribute to comprehending the spatial morphological evolution of rivers associated with hydrological processes however it is still a challenge to effectively discriminate different river patterns due to the dynamics and variability of rivers a solution is proposed to discriminate river patterns based on rough set theory via a holistic synthesis of multi dimensional morphological information first a hierarchical structure integrating the boundary and the interior was suggested to maximally describe the morphological feature of river patterns rough set theory was applied to select the main feature factors from multiple geometric indexes and landscape pattern indexes finally river pattern discriminant rules were generated based on the reduced feature subsets new hydrological insights for the region results demonstrate that 81 discriminant rules efficiently express the morphological feature of four river patterns compared with several competitive machine learning methods river pattern discriminant rules display good performance with the advantages of interpretability simple modelling and fewer training samples furthermore the established discriminant rules of river patterns have achieved an accuracy of 98 63 in the application of the lower yellow river which is expected to analyse the spatiotemporal evolution and geomorphological processes of different river patterns graphical abstract ga1 keywords river patterns rough set theory feature selection discriminant rule data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river patterns carrying a wealth of information on the cause morphology and evolution of riverbeds are the basic unit for studying the spatiotemporal evolution of rivers alexeevsky et al 2013 rust 1978 schumm 1985 discriminating different river patterns is an inherent point of fluvial geomorphological analysis considering the river planform as a key carrier of the array of attributes collected in conjunction with the river styles methodology nardini and brierley 2021 has become one of effective approaches to discriminate river patterns however it is still an open question how to rationally select the attributes that characterize the river planform and to use these attributes to discriminate accurately river patterns carling et al 2014 li et al 2022 therefore the goal of distinguishing river patterns is to efficiently excavate multi dimensional river information to express the relationship between river styles and their attributes the dynamics of river morphology under different water and sand conditions make it quite difficult to discriminate different river patterns wang et al 2020 kong et al 2020 previously several discriminant methods of river patterns have been proposed such as using sinuosity index to distinguish straight and meandering rivers spada et al 2018 using anabranching and braided indices to assess multi stream channels ashmore 2009 schumm 1985 ulloa et al 2018 and using fractal dimension to quantify the complexity of a channel benson et al 2013 haron et al 2019 actually it is inaccurate to use individual indices to discriminate multiple river patterns especially for complex multichannel rivers recent advances in artificial intelligence algorithms present an unprecedented capacity for the discrimination of river patterns for example nardini and brierley 2021 proposed a logical heuristic algorithm that combined many indicators e g length of channel width number of bars islands branches etc with corresponding linguistic descriptions to automatically identify the planar morphology of a river moreover the self organized map algorithm bizzi and lerner 2012 machine learning models e g random forest guillon et al 2020 have also been used for the extraction of river patterns although many indices quantify the characteristics of river patterns shaikh et al 2021 there may be high correlations between the feature factors leading to redundant information some factors that are insensitive to river patterns increase the difficulty of model learning and bring about dimensional disasters yu et al 2022 on the other hand the effectiveness of the most machine learning model is hampered by its high nonlinearity vast amount of training data and its limited practical applicability to more accurately discriminate river patterns on a river researchers typically first divide river segments i e the discrete river reaches and then classify river patterns i e river pattern discrimination agnihotri et al 2018 that is river reaches to be classified are predetermined for example river reaches are segmented according to the hydrological stations xia et al 2014 or the geographical location of the city yang et al 2015 or a fixed length e g 1 km saleh et al 2013 bora and goswami 2021 however these segmentation results face two challenges in the subsequent morphological feature analysis of rivers first different river patterns are often cross distributed between fixed hydrological stations and it is not accurate enough to roughly classify them into one river pattern second river reaches with fixed length tend to destroy the morphological structure of river patterns to solve these two issues it is crucial to explore an effective approach applicable to discriminating rivers from the morphological characteristics of the river pattern itself full coverage and continuous availability of real time data are prerequisites for the effective discrimination of river patterns grill et al 2019 li et al 2021a traditionally river patterns discriminant methods usually rely on field observation data xin et al 2018 yet the limited number of hydrological sites make it difficult to comprehensively reflect the morphological characteristics of rivers especially in river reaches where data are not available leading to great uncertainties and errors in river pattern discrimination cavallo et al 2021 in addition cross sectional data cannot reflect the morphological and structural characteristics of river patterns in detail existing remote sensing data and vector data sets e g globeland30 national basic information dataset global surface water dataset are rapidly updated and have extensive coverage and continuous access to full spatial data is no longer limited chen et al 2015 pekel et al 2016 providing reliable data support for accurate discrimination of river patterns the discrimination of different river patterns essentially requires the extraction of multidimensional information distributed along the river axis nardini and brierley 2021 the selected information i e various descriptive attributes should not only describe the characteristics of rivers comprehensively but also discriminate different river patterns efficiently as a machine learning modelling method rough set theory can discover the implicit properties in data samples without prior knowledge and form interpretable discriminant rules yan et al 2016 furthermore it simplifies the training sample set in the modelling process which can eliminate redundant data and then extract river morphological information efficiently ip et al 2007 zhang and guilbert 2013 therefore rough set theory can not only be employed to select the main morphological feature factors of river patterns but to acquire discriminant rule applicable to various river patterns the following are the primary contributions of this paper 1 a hierarchical structure is proposed to express the morphological feature of river patterns by combining landscape pattern indices and river morphological indices the internal boundary features can be quantified simultaneously 2 rough set theory is applied to select the main feature factors in the river patterns discrimination the reduction feature set can efficiently and accurately express the morphological characteristics of river patterns 3 river pattern discriminant rules based on rough set theory have shown effectiveness in extracting diverse river patterns providing theoretical support for future automated extraction and analysis of river information the rest of the paper is organized as follows the description of data and sample selection are presented in section 2 section 3 introduces the method of establishing the river pattern discriminant rules section 4 provides the experimental results the main results are discussed in section 5 finally the findings of this study are concluded in section 6 2 data description and sample selection 2 1 data description in this paper 30 m resolution globeland30 dataset is used for sample collection of river patterns the ratio of the training set to the test set is 7 3 the 1 250 000 water system vector dataset in the 2019 version of national basic geographic database nbgd released by the national basic geographic information centre is employed as the application and test data detailed datasets information is shown in table 1 2 2 sample selection historically the frequent diversions of the lower yellow river lyr have led to constant disasters due to the variable flow and sediment conditions river patterns in the lyr are still subjected to complicated spatiotemporal variation today xia et al 2021 as one of important development areas in china chen et al 2019 qin et al 2021 the discrimination and extraction of river patterns in the lyr is the basis of a great range of scientific and applied issues such as explaining the mechanism of river evolution zhang et al 2021 guo et al 2020 evaluating the impact of flow and sediment transfer from upstream reservoirs mainly xiaolangdi reservoir on downstream rivers liu et al 2021a kong et al 2020 planning and managing channels li et al 2021b wu et al 2022 therefore lyr is chosen as sample selection for river patterns fig 1a b river patterns are mostly divided into four categories straight meandering anabranched and braided in the lyr with the classification scheme proposed by qian 1985 and ni and zhang 1991 the definition and morphological characteristics of four river patterns are the criterion for sample selection i e straight patterns are single and straight channels of relatively uniform width meandering patterns are single curved channels anabranched patterns are multithreads and separated by some islands and braided patterns are multiple strands divided by relatively permanent vegetation islands and multiple scattered bars kleinhans 2010 kleinhans et al 2011 as shown in fig 1c finally training samples and testing samples of river patterns were selected from the lyr under the guidance of water conservancy experts fig 1d 3 methods 3 1 research framework although the characteristics of river patterns are accurately described in the existing studies schumm 1985 carling et al 2014 there is no clear boundary between different river patterns as a result the relationship between river patterns is fuzzy in this study we concentrate on investigating and acquiring morphological discriminant rules of river patterns using the benefit of rough set theory when handling uncertain problems ip et al 2007 first a hierarchical structure is proposed to express the morphological feature of river patterns based on their components i e channel external boundaries and internal bars and islands as shown in fig 2 landscape pattern indices are introduced to quantify the spatial distribution characteristics of internal bars and islands and are combined with the geometric morphology indices to collectively constitute the initial feature factors set of river patterns second rough set theory is applied for feature factors selection of river patterns a features subset of river patterns with a minimum number of factors is extracted by genetic algorithm reduction achieving the elimination of irrelevant and redundant feature factors and improving the efficiency of river patterns discrimination then river pattern discriminant rules are generated based on the reduced feature subsets through rough set theory to form a basic discriminant rules base of river patterns finally the minimum manhattan distance is proposed to match river pattern discriminant rules and to constantly refine the discriminant rule base in the future 3 2 initial feature factors set in fig 2 the planform of river patterns is described as a complex polygon with bars and islands inside and accordingly river patterns can be seen as a spatial arrangement and combination of river landscape elements i e channel boundaries bars and islands of varying size and shape therefore the landscape pattern index was introduced to quantitatively characterize the morphological structure of river patterns finally 12 factors from 8 elements were selected to establish the initial feature set of river patterns including geometric indices and landscape patterns indices i e s para frac circle np pd ai contag cohesion connect shdi shei all indices are shown in table 2 and the detailed calculation equations are given in appendix a 3 3 selection of feature factors the purpose of feature factor selection is to eliminate irrelevant redundant or noisy features from the initial set of feature factors to reduce the spatial dimensionality of the dataset and to choose the optimal subset that expresses the morphological feature of river patterns there are two issues when rough set theory is utilized for feature selection first rough set theory can only handle discrete data thus the values of continuous attributes must be discretized the second one is to select an appropriate method for reducing feature factors in this paper the natural breakpoints method and genetic algorithms are used to solve these two problems 3 3 1 rough set theory a knowledge expression system a knowledge system can be expressed as a four tuple in rough set theory pawlak 1982 eq 1 1 t u r v f where u is a non empty finite set i e the universe with n objects u 1 u 2 u n also known as the domain of discourse r is a finite set of characteristics that is nonempty v u r r v r is the set of attribute values the attribute value range for the r r is denoted by v r f u r v is an information function which corresponds to the attribute value of object x i e for x u r r there is f x r v r the decision table is the information knowledge expression system the attribute set is r c d the decision attribute set is d d while c is the condition attribute set conditional attributes and decision attributes make up the information system b indiscernibility relation the indiscernibility relation is essentially an equivalent relation that expresses the impossibility of distinguishing specific objects in an information system due to a certain lack of knowledge pawlak 1982 for b r the corresponding indiscernibility relation is as 2 ind b x y u u r b f x r f y r if x y ind b then x and y are indistinguishable from subset b of attribute set r this indiscernibility relation is an equivalence relation usually denoted as r b r b forms a division u r b over the universe u i e the equivalence classes set u r b x b x u where x b refers to the equivalence class established by the equivalence relation r b i e x b y u x y r b c approximation set for x u and an indiscernibility relation b the lower and upper approximation sets of x with respect to b are defined as 3 b x x u x b x 4 b x x u x b x x divides the universe u into three disjoint regions namely the positive domain pos b x the boundary domain bnd b x and the negative domain neg b x which are respectively defined as follows 5 pos b x b x 6 bnd b x b x b x 7 neg b x u b x 3 3 2 discretization based on the natural breakpoint method in essence discretization can be attributed to the division of a space consisting of conditional attributes by selected breakpoints zhang et al 2011 the natural breakpoints method also named jenks is designed in this paper for the discretization of conditional attribute data it aims at calculating the classification by continuous and successive iterations so as to minimize variation within levels of data and maximize variation between levels he et al 2021 jenks 1967 to ensure discernible relations in the knowledge expression system the breakpoints set is used to discretize the data with the smallest cardinality as an example fig 3 shows the attribute distribution of four indices in the knowledge expression system the statistical series of the index has a clear clustering distribution and the data has natural turning points and characteristic points therefore natural breakpoints can be considered as clear thresholds for interval division 3 3 3 attribute reduction algorithm genetic algorithm is intended to achieve global optimization through implicit parallelism mahesh et al 2015 the solution is to treat each individual in the population in a possible way and to find the smallest reduced set through continuous iterative optimization jaddi and abdullah 2013 majeed 2014 the specific steps of attribute reduction are as follows step 1 initialize the group pop t t 1 step 2 set population size as n calculate individual fitness value according to fitness function f t and find all the individuals with maximum fitness value step 3 perform selection choose at random a two point crossover operation s crossover probability between p c1 p c2 create a new population with a pop of t 1 and randomly choose the mutation probability for the mutation operation in the range of p m1 p m2 step 4 when the fitness value of a certain generation of individuals no longer changes or the number of iterations reaches the maximum m the algorithm terminates decode the output result of the chromosome corresponding to the maximum fitness function otherwise turn to step 3 3 4 river pattern discriminant rules 3 4 1 discriminant rules acquisition one of the most important functions of rough set theory is the generation of discriminant rules from decision tables leung et al 2008 yan et al 2019 c i and d j are utilized to represent each equivalence class in u c and u d respectively while e c i and e d j denote the descriptions of the equivalence classes c i and d j respectively i e the specific values of the equivalence classes c i and d j for each conditional attribute the discriminant rule is expressed as follows 8 r ij e c i e d i where d j c i the deterministic factor of the discriminant rule is defined as 9 μ c i d i c i d i c i 0 μ c i d i 1 when μ c i d i 1 the discriminant rule is definite when 0 μ c i d i 1 the discriminant rule is indefinite 3 4 2 discriminant rules matching and refinement in this paper the minimum manhattan distance is used for rule matching first match the actual values of river patterns with the discrete intervals and then perform rule matching according to the minimum manhattan distance min d ij in eq 10 10 min d ij k 1 p x ik x jk where the actual values of the unclassified sample and the rules in the decision table are represented by x i x i1 x i2 x ip and x j x j1 x j2 x jp respectively there are three situations in the matching process between unclassified samples and discriminant rules as follows situation 1 the unclassified sample matches the one rule or the multiple rules in the decision table have the same decision attributes that is min d ij 0 the rule has only one decision attribute and the discrimination of river patterns is definite situation 2 the unclassified sample matches the one or more uncertain rules in the decision table but the rules have different decision attributes that is although min d ij 0 there may be conflicts between rules in this case a rule with high support and high accuracy is chosen support represents the importance of the rules which is calculated based on the proportion of object in the decision table x u and x matches rule d x des x c des x d the support of the corresponding rule of object x is calculated in eq 11 11 supp x c d c x d x u highly supported rules lead to more reliable conclusions and are considered to be more adaptable each rule has a certain accuracy μ x i y j as defined in eq 12 12 μ x i y j y j x i x i where x i u ind c i 1 2 m and y j u ind d i 1 2 n represent each equivalence class in u c and u d respectively when μ x i y j 1 the discriminant rule is certain when 0 μ x i y j 1 the discriminant rule is uncertain then the rule with high accuracy as the decision attribute is matched situation 3 the unclassified sample matches no rules i e min d ij 0 the unclassified samples may be equidistant from multiple discriminant rules in this situation according to characteristics of river patterns and experimental analysis np pd contag and shdi index are more important than s index in river pattern discrimination then the weights q m of the five indices s np pd contag shdi are determined as 0 1 0 3 0 25 0 2 and 0 15 finally the minimum manhattan distance based on the weights matches river patterns as shown in eq 13 13 min d ij k 1 p m 1 r q m x ik x jk 3 4 3 discriminant rules evaluation three common metrics sensitivity specificity and accuracy zhang and weng 2016 are introduced as the evaluation criteria in order to assess the efficacy of the discriminant rule proposed in this research and to compare the performance with pertinent methodologies these metrics can be defined as follows 14 sensitivity tp tp fp 15 specificity ta ta fa 16 accuracy tp ta tp fp ta fa where fp is the number of samples that the river patterns is actually d i i 1 2 3 4 but is classified as non d i tp is the number of samples that river patterns is actually d i and is classified as d i ta is the number of samples in which the river patterns is actually non d i and is classified as non d i fa is the number of samples that river patterns is actually non d i but is classified as d i d i i 1 2 3 4 is for four river patterns 4 results 4 1 optimal feature factors for hierarchical expressions of river patterns taking 12 indices in table 2 as condition attributes and four river patterns as decision attributes a decision table was established as shown in table 3 these indices are also the initial feature factors set c 12 r 1 r 2 r 12 before genetic algorithm reduction table 4 shows the discretization results for continuous attributes based on the natural breakpoint method where the length of discrete intervals depends on the number of breakpoints in each index distribution afterwards these indices were reduced through a genetic algorithm to remove seven redundant indices to obtain the reduced set of feature factors that is c 5 r 1 r 5 r 6 r 8 r 11 corresponding to the indices of s np pd contag and shdi sequentially finally these five indices with 100 support were used to generate the discriminant rules of four river patterns table 5 4 2 acquisition of river pattern discriminant rules after reduction a new information system t u r v f was further established then according to rough set theory the effective rules were extracted based on the support and the accuracy in eq 11 and eq 12 finally 81 rules with high support and high accuracy were selected in table 5 including 4 rules for straight channels 12 rules for meandering channels 37 rules for anabranched channels 26 rules for braided channels and 2 uncertain rules the extraction rules have been further analyzed and transformed to facilitate their practical application the final expression model which these 81 rules constitute was established to discriminate four river patterns as defined in eq 17 17 t c i c d where t the set of conditional attributes in the decision table is the antecedent of the rules c is the condition attribute in the decision table d the set of decision attributes which consists of four river patterns is the postecedent of the rules d can be expressed in eq 18 18 d a b c d where a reprensents straight b reprensents meandering c reprensents anabranched and d reprensents braided a a 1 a 2 a 15 s1 np2 pd2 contag5 shdi2 s 1 np 2 pd2 contag1 shdi1 b b1 b2 b34 s4 np1 pd1 contag1 shdi1 s3 np3 pd4 contag5 shdi2 c c1 c2 c15 s2 np2 pd3 contag4 shdi3 s3 np2 pd2 contag4 shdi4 d d1 d2 d5 s1 np5 pd5 contag2 shdi5 s1 np5 pd2 contag3 shdi4 subscripts 1 2 3 4 5 represent discrete intervals of conditional attributes respectively by further analyzing the rules in table 6 it was found that there were the following three matches between the unclassified samples and the discriminant rules of river patterns rules from 1 to 79 the unclassified river pattern matches multiple deterministic rules with the same decision attributes these rules with an accuracy of 100 were able to be directly added to the discriminant rule base the total coverage of such matches is 96 5 rules 80 and 81 the unclassified river pattern matches a deterministic rule but corresponds to multiple decision attributes then the rule with the higher accuracy was chosen to discriminate river patterns for example rule 80 matches the anabranched river pattern with 89 accuracy which is greater than that of the braided river pattern therefore this rule was classified as the discriminant rule of the anabranched river pattern the unclassified river pattern does not match the rules in table 6 the minimum manhattan distance was calculated based on the weight according to eq 10 and eq 13 for rules matching and river pattern discrimination 4 3 application and test of river pattern discriminant rules to assess the applicability of discriminant rules the spatial sequences of river patterns were extracted in the lry below xiaolangdi based on the nbgd data fig 4 a total of 182 river pattern units were extracted including 74 straight river patterns 52 meandering river patterns 51 anabranched river patterns and 5 braided river patterns according to the evaluation matrix the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of discriminant rules were 97 25 99 08 and 98 63 respectively table 7 moreover the extraction effect of discriminant rules of river patterns with multichannel anabranched and braided was better than that of the single channel straight and meandering in addition according to the partially enlarged river reach fig 4b it can be seen that the river spatial morphology is composed of river pattern units which are used to segment river reaches 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with competitive machine learning methods to validate the performance of the proposed discriminant rules based on rough set theory several machine learning and cutting edge deep learning methods were implemented to discriminate river patterns the contrasting methods are summarized as follows 1 support vector machine svm liu et al 2021b 2 ensemble learning extreme gradient boosting xgboost wang et al 2022 ma et al 2021 3 deep neural networks set of 3 layers in this paper 3 l dnn heydari and mountrakis 2017 fig 5 shows the differences in sensitivity specificity and accuracy of four comparison methods firstly the feature factors after the reduction in this paper are effective for river pattern discrimination compared with before the reduction the accuracy of svm and xgboost did not decrease and the 3 l dnn decreased by 0 06 for river patterns the discriminant rules proposed in this paper differ less from the other three machine learning algorithms more specifically the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of the discriminant rule for river patterns were all 94 4 97 2 and 96 3 respectively in contrast to the xgboost with the highest performance the three evaluation indices decreased within 5 which met the needs of river pattern discrimination fig 6 is the evaluation matrix for the competitive models in terms of discriminating four river patterns there is no significant difference in the performance of the listed algorithms before and after the factor reduction in addition river patterns discriminant rules based on rough set theory have good performance in the discrimination of braided channels with three evaluation values of 97 5 98 8 and 98 3 more importantly the discriminant rules have the advantages of high interpretability simple modelling and few training samples which compete strongly with machine learning models 5 2 advantages of the proposed discriminant rules rough set theory was used to capture the morphological characteristics of river patterns scientifically systematically and comprehensively and to acquire the discrimination rules of river patterns in comparison with previous methods of discriminating river patterns eaton et al 2010 agnihotri et al 2018 the discriminant rule acquisition proposed in this paper has the following advantages firstly the discrimination of river patterns does not require prior manual segmentation this paper first identifies river patterns from the morphological characteristics of the river itself and then segments the river according to the results which differs from the traditional method of segmenting first and then identifying river patterns the change of research sequence ensures the continuity and integrity of the spatial distribution of different river patterns and is more in line with human perceptions of river patterns secondly rough set theory addresses the confusion and redundancy of indices in the expression of river patterns in previous studies the feature factor selection in this paper realizes the selection of the effective feature subset that most contributes to river pattern discrimination from the initial feature set the comparison results show that the discriminant rules have little difference in sensitivity specificity and accuracy from mentioned three machine learning algorithms moreover the reduced feature factors barely affect the model performance as a result the discriminant rules based on rough set theory capture the concept and core indicators of river patterns making the discrimination of river patterns more efficient finally river patterns discriminant rules are interpretable unlike the black box models of most machine learning algorithms liang et al 2021 the discriminant rules based on rough set are easy to understand highly readable and can be further interpreted interpreting the constituent factors in discriminant rules of river patterns it is concluded that the landscape pattern index can better describe the spatial distribution and variation of river morphological components than the traditional geometric index e g braided index the np index reflects the presence and number of bars or islands in the river the pd index reflects the fragmentation of river patterns the contag index indicates the spatial agglomeration state or extension trend of bars or islands within the river the shdi index reflects the richness and complexity of the spatial distribution of bars or islands therefore the quantification of river pattern using the landscape pattern index is expected to improve the theoretical system of river pattern expression which has significant theoretical value for the research on river typologies 5 3 potential for extensions the discriminant rules of river patterns provide a new approach for studying river morphological changes and evolutionary processes at a fine reach scale of rivers the three issues should be considered in the future for worthy research first the extraction availability of river patterns should be improved by combining with practical applications some shorter reaches in fig 4 might not be conducive to the practical river management and merging adjacent river patterns of the same type in subsequent studies require being considered second the river morphology discriminant rules will be applied to automatically extract the river morphology units which is pivotal to detect rapidly the river morphological changes finally the discriminant rules obtained in this paper were only tested on the lyr and their performance in other rivers remains further evaluated in future studies 6 conclusion this paper provides an innovative method to discriminate river patterns based on rough set theory the proposed hierarchical structure captures the morphological characteristics of river patterns more comprehensively and accurately a reduced feature subset s np pd contag shdi is eventually selected to generate 81 rules which discriminate four river patterns accurately straight meandering anabranched and braided in addition the proposed discriminant rules differ less from several excellent machine learning methods in discriminating river patterns yet it has the advantages of interpretability and few training samples that black box models do not have the discriminant rules show good applicability in extracting river pattern units in the lyr below xiaolangdi with sensitivity specificity and accuracy of 97 25 99 08 and 98 63 respectively in the future automatic extraction and analysis of river pattern units based on the discriminant rules will contribute to the further digital river construction and even geoscience

information efficiently ip et al 2007 zhang and guilbert 2013 therefore rough set theory can not only be employed to select the main morphological feature factors of river patterns but to acquire discriminant rule applicable to various river patterns the following are the primary contributions of this paper 1 a hierarchical structure is proposed to express the morphological feature of river patterns by combining landscape pattern indices and river morphological indices the internal boundary features can be quantified simultaneously 2 rough set theory is applied to select the main feature factors in the river patterns discrimination the reduction feature set can efficiently and accurately express the morphological characteristics of river patterns 3 river pattern discriminant rules based on rough set theory have shown effectiveness in extracting diverse river patterns providing theoretical support for future automated extraction and analysis of river information the rest of the paper is organized as follows the description of data and sample selection are presented in section 2 section 3 introduces the method of establishing the river pattern discriminant rules section 4 provides the experimental results the main results are discussed in section 5 finally the findings of this study are concluded in section 6 2 data description and sample selection 2 1 data description in this paper 30 m resolution globeland30 dataset is used for sample collection of river patterns the ratio of the training set to the test set is 7 3 the 1 250 000 water system vector dataset in the 2019 version of national basic geographic database nbgd released by the national basic geographic information centre is employed as the application and test data detailed datasets information is shown in table 1 2 2 sample selection historically the frequent diversions of the lower yellow river lyr have led to constant disasters due to the variable flow and sediment conditions river patterns in the lyr are still subjected to complicated spatiotemporal variation today xia et al 2021 as one of important development areas in china chen et al 2019 qin et al 2021 the discrimination and extraction of river patterns in the lyr is the basis of a great range of scientific and applied issues such as explaining the mechanism of river evolution zhang et al 2021 guo et al 2020 evaluating the impact of flow and sediment transfer from upstream reservoirs mainly xiaolangdi reservoir on downstream rivers liu et al 2021a kong et al 2020 planning and managing channels li et al 2021b wu et al 2022 therefore lyr is chosen as sample selection for river patterns fig 1a b river patterns are mostly divided into four categories straight meandering anabranched and braided in the lyr with the classification scheme proposed by qian 1985 and ni and zhang 1991 the definition and morphological characteristics of four river patterns are the criterion for sample selection i e straight patterns are single and straight channels of relatively uniform width meandering patterns are single curved channels anabranched patterns are multithreads and separated by some islands and braided patterns are multiple strands divided by relatively permanent vegetation islands and multiple scattered bars kleinhans 2010 kleinhans et al 2011 as shown in fig 1c finally training samples and testing samples of river patterns were selected from the lyr under the guidance of water conservancy experts fig 1d 3 methods 3 1 research framework although the characteristics of river patterns are accurately described in the existing studies schumm 1985 carling et al 2014 there is no clear boundary between different river patterns as a result the relationship between river patterns is fuzzy in this study we concentrate on investigating and acquiring morphological discriminant rules of river patterns using the benefit of rough set theory when handling uncertain problems ip et al 2007 first a hierarchical structure is proposed to express the morphological feature of river patterns based on their components i e channel external boundaries and internal bars and islands as shown in fig 2 landscape pattern indices are introduced to quantify the spatial distribution characteristics of internal bars and islands and are combined with the geometric morphology indices to collectively constitute the initial feature factors set of river patterns second rough set theory is applied for feature factors selection of river patterns a features subset of river patterns with a minimum number of factors is extracted by genetic algorithm reduction achieving the elimination of irrelevant and redundant feature factors and improving the efficiency of river patterns discrimination then river pattern discriminant rules are generated based on the reduced feature subsets through rough set theory to form a basic discriminant rules base of river patterns finally the minimum manhattan distance is proposed to match river pattern discriminant rules and to constantly refine the discriminant rule base in the future 3 2 initial feature factors set in fig 2 the planform of river patterns is described as a complex polygon with bars and islands inside and accordingly river patterns can be seen as a spatial arrangement and combination of river landscape elements i e channel boundaries bars and islands of varying size and shape therefore the landscape pattern index was introduced to quantitatively characterize the morphological structure of river patterns finally 12 factors from 8 elements were selected to establish the initial feature set of river patterns including geometric indices and landscape patterns indices i e s para frac circle np pd ai contag cohesion connect shdi shei all indices are shown in table 2 and the detailed calculation equations are given in appendix a 3 3 selection of feature factors the purpose of feature factor selection is to eliminate irrelevant redundant or noisy features from the initial set of feature factors to reduce the spatial dimensionality of the dataset and to choose the optimal subset that expresses the morphological feature of river patterns there are two issues when rough set theory is utilized for feature selection first rough set theory can only handle discrete data thus the values of continuous attributes must be discretized the second one is to select an appropriate method for reducing feature factors in this paper the natural breakpoints method and genetic algorithms are used to solve these two problems 3 3 1 rough set theory a knowledge expression system a knowledge system can be expressed as a four tuple in rough set theory pawlak 1982 eq 1 1 t u r v f where u is a non empty finite set i e the universe with n objects u 1 u 2 u n also known as the domain of discourse r is a finite set of characteristics that is nonempty v u r r v r is the set of attribute values the attribute value range for the r r is denoted by v r f u r v is an information function which corresponds to the attribute value of object x i e for x u r r there is f x r v r the decision table is the information knowledge expression system the attribute set is r c d the decision attribute set is d d while c is the condition attribute set conditional attributes and decision attributes make up the information system b indiscernibility relation the indiscernibility relation is essentially an equivalent relation that expresses the impossibility of distinguishing specific objects in an information system due to a certain lack of knowledge pawlak 1982 for b r the corresponding indiscernibility relation is as 2 ind b x y u u r b f x r f y r if x y ind b then x and y are indistinguishable from subset b of attribute set r this indiscernibility relation is an equivalence relation usually denoted as r b r b forms a division u r b over the universe u i e the equivalence classes set u r b x b x u where x b refers to the equivalence class established by the equivalence relation r b i e x b y u x y r b c approximation set for x u and an indiscernibility relation b the lower and upper approximation sets of x with respect to b are defined as 3 b x x u x b x 4 b x x u x b x x divides the universe u into three disjoint regions namely the positive domain pos b x the boundary domain bnd b x and the negative domain neg b x which are respectively defined as follows 5 pos b x b x 6 bnd b x b x b x 7 neg b x u b x 3 3 2 discretization based on the natural breakpoint method in essence discretization can be attributed to the division of a space consisting of conditional attributes by selected breakpoints zhang et al 2011 the natural breakpoints method also named jenks is designed in this paper for the discretization of conditional attribute data it aims at calculating the classification by continuous and successive iterations so as to minimize variation within levels of data and maximize variation between levels he et al 2021 jenks 1967 to ensure discernible relations in the knowledge expression system the breakpoints set is used to discretize the data with the smallest cardinality as an example fig 3 shows the attribute distribution of four indices in the knowledge expression system the statistical series of the index has a clear clustering distribution and the data has natural turning points and characteristic points therefore natural breakpoints can be considered as clear thresholds for interval division 3 3 3 attribute reduction algorithm genetic algorithm is intended to achieve global optimization through implicit parallelism mahesh et al 2015 the solution is to treat each individual in the population in a possible way and to find the smallest reduced set through continuous iterative optimization jaddi and abdullah 2013 majeed 2014 the specific steps of attribute reduction are as follows step 1 initialize the group pop t t 1 step 2 set population size as n calculate individual fitness value according to fitness function f t and find all the individuals with maximum fitness value step 3 perform selection choose at random a two point crossover operation s crossover probability between p c1 p c2 create a new population with a pop of t 1 and randomly choose the mutation probability for the mutation operation in the range of p m1 p m2 step 4 when the fitness value of a certain generation of individuals no longer changes or the number of iterations reaches the maximum m the algorithm terminates decode the output result of the chromosome corresponding to the maximum fitness function otherwise turn to step 3 3 4 river pattern discriminant rules 3 4 1 discriminant rules acquisition one of the most important functions of rough set theory is the generation of discriminant rules from decision tables leung et al 2008 yan et al 2019 c i and d j are utilized to represent each equivalence class in u c and u d respectively while e c i and e d j denote the descriptions of the equivalence classes c i and d j respectively i e the specific values of the equivalence classes c i and d j for each conditional attribute the discriminant rule is expressed as follows 8 r ij e c i e d i where d j c i the deterministic factor of the discriminant rule is defined as 9 μ c i d i c i d i c i 0 μ c i d i 1 when μ c i d i 1 the discriminant rule is definite when 0 μ c i d i 1 the discriminant rule is indefinite 3 4 2 discriminant rules matching and refinement in this paper the minimum manhattan distance is used for rule matching first match the actual values of river patterns with the discrete intervals and then perform rule matching according to the minimum manhattan distance min d ij in eq 10 10 min d ij k 1 p x ik x jk where the actual values of the unclassified sample and the rules in the decision table are represented by x i x i1 x i2 x ip and x j x j1 x j2 x jp respectively there are three situations in the matching process between unclassified samples and discriminant rules as follows situation 1 the unclassified sample matches the one rule or the multiple rules in the decision table have the same decision attributes that is min d ij 0 the rule has only one decision attribute and the discrimination of river patterns is definite situation 2 the unclassified sample matches the one or more uncertain rules in the decision table but the rules have different decision attributes that is although min d ij 0 there may be conflicts between rules in this case a rule with high support and high accuracy is chosen support represents the importance of the rules which is calculated based on the proportion of object in the decision table x u and x matches rule d x des x c des x d the support of the corresponding rule of object x is calculated in eq 11 11 supp x c d c x d x u highly supported rules lead to more reliable conclusions and are considered to be more adaptable each rule has a certain accuracy μ x i y j as defined in eq 12 12 μ x i y j y j x i x i where x i u ind c i 1 2 m and y j u ind d i 1 2 n represent each equivalence class in u c and u d respectively when μ x i y j 1 the discriminant rule is certain when 0 μ x i y j 1 the discriminant rule is uncertain then the rule with high accuracy as the decision attribute is matched situation 3 the unclassified sample matches no rules i e min d ij 0 the unclassified samples may be equidistant from multiple discriminant rules in this situation according to characteristics of river patterns and experimental analysis np pd contag and shdi index are more important than s index in river pattern discrimination then the weights q m of the five indices s np pd contag shdi are determined as 0 1 0 3 0 25 0 2 and 0 15 finally the minimum manhattan distance based on the weights matches river patterns as shown in eq 13 13 min d ij k 1 p m 1 r q m x ik x jk 3 4 3 discriminant rules evaluation three common metrics sensitivity specificity and accuracy zhang and weng 2016 are introduced as the evaluation criteria in order to assess the efficacy of the discriminant rule proposed in this research and to compare the performance with pertinent methodologies these metrics can be defined as follows 14 sensitivity tp tp fp 15 specificity ta ta fa 16 accuracy tp ta tp fp ta fa where fp is the number of samples that the river patterns is actually d i i 1 2 3 4 but is classified as non d i tp is the number of samples that river patterns is actually d i and is classified as d i ta is the number of samples in which the river patterns is actually non d i and is classified as non d i fa is the number of samples that river patterns is actually non d i but is classified as d i d i i 1 2 3 4 is for four river patterns 4 results 4 1 optimal feature factors for hierarchical expressions of river patterns taking 12 indices in table 2 as condition attributes and four river patterns as decision attributes a decision table was established as shown in table 3 these indices are also the initial feature factors set c 12 r 1 r 2 r 12 before genetic algorithm reduction table 4 shows the discretization results for continuous attributes based on the natural breakpoint method where the length of discrete intervals depends on the number of breakpoints in each index distribution afterwards these indices were reduced through a genetic algorithm to remove seven redundant indices to obtain the reduced set of feature factors that is c 5 r 1 r 5 r 6 r 8 r 11 corresponding to the indices of s np pd contag and shdi sequentially finally these five indices with 100 support were used to generate the discriminant rules of four river patterns table 5 4 2 acquisition of river pattern discriminant rules after reduction a new information system t u r v f was further established then according to rough set theory the effective rules were extracted based on the support and the accuracy in eq 11 and eq 12 finally 81 rules with high support and high accuracy were selected in table 5 including 4 rules for straight channels 12 rules for meandering channels 37 rules for anabranched channels 26 rules for braided channels and 2 uncertain rules the extraction rules have been further analyzed and transformed to facilitate their practical application the final expression model which these 81 rules constitute was established to discriminate four river patterns as defined in eq 17 17 t c i c d where t the set of conditional attributes in the decision table is the antecedent of the rules c is the condition attribute in the decision table d the set of decision attributes which consists of four river patterns is the postecedent of the rules d can be expressed in eq 18 18 d a b c d where a reprensents straight b reprensents meandering c reprensents anabranched and d reprensents braided a a 1 a 2 a 15 s1 np2 pd2 contag5 shdi2 s 1 np 2 pd2 contag1 shdi1 b b1 b2 b34 s4 np1 pd1 contag1 shdi1 s3 np3 pd4 contag5 shdi2 c c1 c2 c15 s2 np2 pd3 contag4 shdi3 s3 np2 pd2 contag4 shdi4 d d1 d2 d5 s1 np5 pd5 contag2 shdi5 s1 np5 pd2 contag3 shdi4 subscripts 1 2 3 4 5 represent discrete intervals of conditional attributes respectively by further analyzing the rules in table 6 it was found that there were the following three matches between the unclassified samples and the discriminant rules of river patterns rules from 1 to 79 the unclassified river pattern matches multiple deterministic rules with the same decision attributes these rules with an accuracy of 100 were able to be directly added to the discriminant rule base the total coverage of such matches is 96 5 rules 80 and 81 the unclassified river pattern matches a deterministic rule but corresponds to multiple decision attributes then the rule with the higher accuracy was chosen to discriminate river patterns for example rule 80 matches the anabranched river pattern with 89 accuracy which is greater than that of the braided river pattern therefore this rule was classified as the discriminant rule of the anabranched river pattern the unclassified river pattern does not match the rules in table 6 the minimum manhattan distance was calculated based on the weight according to eq 10 and eq 13 for rules matching and river pattern discrimination 4 3 application and test of river pattern discriminant rules to assess the applicability of discriminant rules the spatial sequences of river patterns were extracted in the lry below xiaolangdi based on the nbgd data fig 4 a total of 182 river pattern units were extracted including 74 straight river patterns 52 meandering river patterns 51 anabranched river patterns and 5 braided river patterns according to the evaluation matrix the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of discriminant rules were 97 25 99 08 and 98 63 respectively table 7 moreover the extraction effect of discriminant rules of river patterns with multichannel anabranched and braided was better than that of the single channel straight and meandering in addition according to the partially enlarged river reach fig 4b it can be seen that the river spatial morphology is composed of river pattern units which are used to segment river reaches 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with competitive machine learning methods to validate the performance of the proposed discriminant rules based on rough set theory several machine learning and cutting edge deep learning methods were implemented to discriminate river patterns the contrasting methods are summarized as follows 1 support vector machine svm liu et al 2021b 2 ensemble learning extreme gradient boosting xgboost wang et al 2022 ma et al 2021 3 deep neural networks set of 3 layers in this paper 3 l dnn heydari and mountrakis 2017 fig 5 shows the differences in sensitivity specificity and accuracy of four comparison methods firstly the feature factors after the reduction in this paper are effective for river pattern discrimination compared with before the reduction the accuracy of svm and xgboost did not decrease and the 3 l dnn decreased by 0 06 for river patterns the discriminant rules proposed in this paper differ less from the other three machine learning algorithms more specifically the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of the discriminant rule for river patterns were all 94 4 97 2 and 96 3 respectively in contrast to the xgboost with the highest performance the three evaluation indices decreased within 5 which met the needs of river pattern discrimination fig 6 is the evaluation matrix for the competitive models in terms of discriminating four river patterns there is no significant difference in the performance of the listed algorithms before and after the factor reduction in addition river patterns discriminant rules based on rough set theory have good performance in the discrimination of braided channels with three evaluation values of 97 5 98 8 and 98 3 more importantly the discriminant rules have the advantages of high interpretability simple modelling and few training samples which compete strongly with machine learning models 5 2 advantages of the proposed discriminant rules rough set theory was used to capture the morphological characteristics of river patterns scientifically systematically and comprehensively and to acquire the discrimination rules of river patterns in comparison with previous methods of discriminating river patterns eaton et al 2010 agnihotri et al 2018 the discriminant rule acquisition proposed in this paper has the following advantages firstly the discrimination of river patterns does not require prior manual segmentation this paper first identifies river patterns from the morphological characteristics of the river itself and then segments the river according to the results which differs from the traditional method of segmenting first and then identifying river patterns the change of research sequence ensures the continuity and integrity of the spatial distribution of different river patterns and is more in line with human perceptions of river patterns secondly rough set theory addresses the confusion and redundancy of indices in the expression of river patterns in previous studies the feature factor selection in this paper realizes the selection of the effective feature subset that most contributes to river pattern discrimination from the initial feature set the comparison results show that the discriminant rules have little difference in sensitivity specificity and accuracy from mentioned three machine learning algorithms moreover the reduced feature factors barely affect the model performance as a result the discriminant rules based on rough set theory capture the concept and core indicators of river patterns making the discrimination of river patterns more efficient finally river patterns discriminant rules are interpretable unlike the black box models of most machine learning algorithms liang et al 2021 the discriminant rules based on rough set are easy to understand highly readable and can be further interpreted interpreting the constituent factors in discriminant rules of river patterns it is concluded that the landscape pattern index can better describe the spatial distribution and variation of river morphological components than the traditional geometric index e g braided index the np index reflects the presence and number of bars or islands in the river the pd index reflects the fragmentation of river patterns the contag index indicates the spatial agglomeration state or extension trend of bars or islands within the river the shdi index reflects the richness and complexity of the spatial distribution of bars or islands therefore the quantification of river pattern using the landscape pattern index is expected to improve the theoretical system of river pattern expression which has significant theoretical value for the research on river typologies 5 3 potential for extensions the discriminant rules of river patterns provide a new approach for studying river morphological changes and evolutionary processes at a fine reach scale of rivers the three issues should be considered in the future for worthy research first the extraction availability of river patterns should be improved by combining with practical applications some shorter reaches in fig 4 might not be conducive to the practical river management and merging adjacent river patterns of the same type in subsequent studies require being considered second the river morphology discriminant rules will be applied to automatically extract the river morphology units which is pivotal to detect rapidly the river morphological changes finally the discriminant rules obtained in this paper were only tested on the lyr and their performance in other rivers remains further evaluated in future studies 6 conclusion this paper provides an innovative method to discriminate river patterns based on rough set theory the proposed hierarchical structure captures the morphological characteristics of river patterns more comprehensively and accurately a reduced feature subset s np pd contag shdi is eventually selected to generate 81 rules which discriminate four river patterns accurately straight meandering anabranched and braided in addition the proposed discriminant rules differ less from several excellent machine learning methods in discriminating river patterns yet it has the advantages of interpretability and few training samples that black box models do not have the discriminant rules show good applicability in extracting river pattern units in the lyr below xiaolangdi with sensitivity specificity and accuracy of 97 25 99 08 and 98 63 respectively in the future automatic extraction and analysis of river pattern units based on the discriminant rules will contribute to the further digital river construction and even geoscience

7756,study region choushui river alluvial fan in central taiwan study focus excessive land subsidence is occurring in the choushui alluvial fan taiwan groundwater pumping in the region is not monitored so pumping volumes are estimated from information based on electricity consumption groundwater pumping data alone cannot be used to accurately estimate the spatial rate and distribution of subsidence due to the low spatial correlation between estimated pumping volumes and subsidence from heterogeneous geologic materials time dependent spatial regression is a reliable tool for estimating the spatial distribution of annual rate of subsidence based on spatial mapping of pumped groundwater volumes and monitored land subsidence new hydrological insights for the region estimates of pumping quantities indicate that the locations of subsidence from overexploitation of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system is not always spatially correlated with major pumping areas or with the observed locations of maximum water level drawdown considering time dependent spatial regression models the average rmse of annual subsidence is 0 65 cm for the choushui alluvial fan indicating the high level of correlation between measured and estimated subsidence these findings show that annual subsidence can be reliably estimated and predicted under the field pumping conditions of the study site the influences of reduced withdrawals based on the relation between annual subsidence and pumping volumes can be evaluated for improved best management practices graphical abstract ga1 keywords time dependent spatial regression land subsidence groundwater pumping volume data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land subsidence associated with groundwater withdrawal is a world wide problem aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 famiglietti 2014 many subsidence investigations have been conducted on the basis of location the local maximum measured subsidence rates and measurement methods such as differential interferometry leveling global positioning systems and extensometers galloway and burbey 2011 notable world wide localities where extensive subsidence occurs owing to groundwater exploitation includes datong zhao et al 2011 changzhou wang et al 2009 in china houston texas buckley 2003 kolkata india chatterjee et al 2006 mashhad valley in iran motagh et al 2007 mexico city osmanoǧlu et al 2011 murcia in spain herrera et al 2010 semarang in indonesia lubis et al 2011 bangkok phien wej et al 2006 saga plain in japan miura et al 1995 yunlin in taiwan hung et al 2010 and jakarta abidin et al 2009 groundwater extraction for agriculture and aquaculture purposes is the main cause of land subsidence lin et al 2015 estimation of groundwater storage variations and groundwater depletion can be monitored and estimated from grace mehrnegar et al 2021 rateb et al 2020 insar rateb et al 2020 hung et al 2012a and flow modeling cao et al 2013 rashid et al 2015 with related hydrological data electrical power demand has served as a proxy for pumping activity but such measures are often aggregated over entire townships lacking adequate resolution for regional monitoring or planning purposes vasco et al 2019 an empirical formulation chu et al 2020 is investigated to estimate the monthly pumped volume from individual wells and generated 1 km2 resolution pumped volumes over a 10 year period based on electric power consumption data for changhua and yunlin counties taiwan the pumping volumes vary both temporally and spatially modeling studies provide tools to study the correlation between the spatiotemporal variations of pumping volume and subsidence accordingly a highly reliable method is developed for incorporating both spatially and temporally varying subsidence estimations based on pumping volumes in general the location of subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation of unconsolidated aquifer systems is often not highly spatially correlated with major pumping areas and the location of maximum water level drawdown galloway et al 2000 motagh et al 2007 thus models are developed to investigate the reliability of predictive tools using annual pumpage volume as the independent variable and annual subsidence as the dependent variable recent research has focused on simulation and prediction of land subsidence and evaluation of its impacts galloway and burbey 2011 nadiri et al 2018 conventional physical process simulations are challenging due to the large hydrogeological data requirements for model development and calibration sahoo et al 2017 furthermore a data based model is often used to make interpretations between cause and effect variables in environmental and ecological studies data based models e g regression and machine learning establishes empirical relationships and associations between evidential features predictor variables and target variables rodriguez galiano et al 2014 however the data based methods have limited applicability with respect to temporal or spatial scales qian et al 2017 for example linear regression cannot be adequately used to estimate the spatial distribution of subsidence based on the volume of pumped groundwater due to the low correlation between pumping volume cause and land subsidence effect instead spatial regression methods represent a simplified methodology for estimating spatial effect patterns in these types of settings fotheringham et al 1998 ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021 a spatial regression model can be used to estimate the distribution of subsidence from spatial patterns and processes such as the volume of pumped groundwater in this study the time dependent spatial regression method is used to simulate the spatial distribution of annual land subsidence rates based on the annual spatial distribution of pumped groundwater volumes from electricity consumption data this paper aims to derive the annual spatial subsidence distribution due to groundwater pumpage using the time dependent spatial regression model the areas of greatest groundwater pumping in the study region does not coincide with the areas of greatest land subsidence this difference is attributed to variations in hydrogeologic properties of the aquifer system that are largely unknown as a result of the natural heterogeneities of the hydrogeological properties and groundwater pumping variations in the study region subsidence and pumping volume exhibit a low spatial correlation the time dependent spatial regression model is shown to provide an improved mapping relationship between total subsidence and pumping volume and yields a reliable mapping of land subsidence for the study area when compared to actual subsidence observations in addition the impacts of reducing the pumping withdrawals of a 75 b 50 and c 25 of the 2015 pumping volumes are investigated for improved best management practices 1 1 study area groundwater is widely used in central taiwan fig 1 for irrigation tung and hu 2012 the study area is within the choushui river alluvial fan which encompasses an area of 1800 km2 in changhua and yunlin counties fig 1a serious land subsidence has been occurring along the high speed railway fig 1b in central taiwan in recent decades changhua county to the north is separated from yunlin county to the south by the choushui river which bisects the alluvial fan and flows from east to west the western boundary is represented by the south china sea and the eastern boundary is represented by the headwaters of the choushui river which lie about 100 m above sea level the bedrock in the upper eastern watershed of choushui river is composed of slate metamorphic quartzite shale sandstone and mudstone which creates sediments of the choushui river alluvial fan liu et al 2004 ali et al 2020 tatas et al 2021 excessive exploitation of groundwater in changhua and yunlin counties has resulted in land subsidence and is creating a potential hazard for infrastructures including the high speed rail that passes through the region from the northeast to the southern part of the study area ali et al 2020 fig 1b shows the leveling observation points for estimating annual subsidence fig 1c shows the hydrogeological profile of the yunlin area from west to east through the alluvial fan the unconsolidated fan deposits consist of four aquifers that are composed of gravel and coarse sand deposits these aquifers are thickest in the east and become thinner toward the coast in the west the hydrogeological profile of the choushui river alluvial fan is characterized by aquifers i ii 1 ii 2 iii and iv fig 1c as measured from the land surface downward aquitards t1 t3 separate the aquifers but are not laterally continuous particularly in the west aquitards are most prevalent in the distal fan and mid fan areas and gradually diminish in thickness toward the east the proximal fan represents the major recharge area of the aquifer system jang et al 2008 yu and chu 2010 the distribution of sediments in the alluvial fan transitions from largely gravel to sand in the proximal part of the fan east to largely clay in the distal part of the fan west geologic materials are not uniformly distributed clay containing sediments are more likely to compact with head reductions than sand and gravel formations thus land subsidence from groundwater pumping is more prone to occur in the eastern part of the study area 1 2 electric power consumption subsidence and rainfall data fig 2 shows the monthly rainfall obtained from the huwei rainfall station fig 1 over the period ranging from 2010 to 2016 the rainfall is concentrated during the summer months between may and august about 20 of annual rainfall occurs during the winter and early spring dry season groundwater pumping provides irrigated demand for agriculture especially during the dry season available electric power consumption records from 2010 to 2016 were obtained for 179 944 wells in the study area from the taiwan power company chu et al 2020 most wells are operated by an individual pump owner e g a farmer the water resources agency wra of taiwan requires users to report pump power and pump type monitored electrical consumption data is used only for groundwater pumping wells which have their own dedicated meters pumping volume is estimated from information on electricity consumption pump power and other types of well data obtained from the groundwater users within the study area based on field surveys the average pumping rate in the study area is 44 2 m 3 hr cmh max 130 9 cmh min 2 0 cmh the rmses of pumping rates are approximately 7 2 and 7 7 cmh in changhua and yunlin counties respectively the pumping rates in the study area seem reasonable but contain some uncertainty associated with field operations a levelling network was made for making land subsidence observations appendix a the number of observations has varied from year to year with approximately 500 observations available in 2007 and gradually increasing to more than 700 observations by 2016 the annual subsidence leveling survey is conducted each may the annual subsidence data from the leveling survey in 2010 2016 were used in this study 2 materials and study area the annual pumping volumes are not regulated and are unknown as such annual groundwater pumping volumes 1 km2 resolution were first estimated from electricity consumption data the spatially varying relationship between annual pumping volumes and land subsidence is then determined based on time dependent spatial regression one model for each year both the spatial and nonspatial regression results are compared finally the annual subsidence maps are estimated from the spatial and nonspatial models in addition the impacts of the pumping withdrawal reductions are simulated under the field conditions of the study site 2 1 study area pumping rate q in units of volume time is estimated from metered electricity usage records the extracted volume v m 3 is simply the pumping rate q m 3 hr multiplied by the operating time t hr operating time is estimated based on energy power time where electric power consumption e kw hr and pump power p p kw required by the water pump are used to estimate the pumped volume v the groundwater pumping volume is estimated as 1 v q e ε w p p where ε w is the pump efficiency which is related to hydraulic conductivity and varies from one type of pump to another the pump efficiency in eq 1 is derived from an empirical relation developed from field conditions includes the pipe diameter the pump power the well characteristics i e depth diameter aquifer hydraulic conductivity and electric power consumption thus eq 1 is applied for pumping volume estimation each individual well that is monitored in this investigation chu et al 2020 the details of these parameters and their application are discussed more fully chu et al 2020

land subsidence in the study area fig 3 shows the observed annual rate of subsidence and reveals that the highest subsidence values are located in the southern part of the study area with annual rates of between 6 and 8 cm the maximum subsidence is 7 63 cm in 2015 table 1 the figure shows that the maximum subsidence occurred in 2015 which is shown by a group of red dots in the southern part of the study area moderate rates of subsidence are shown by the dark yellow dots and are commonly observed in 2010 2011 2012 and 2014 with only a few occurring in 2013 and 2016 the 2011 data do not reveal any particular subsidence pattern low rates of land subsidence largely green dots occur in 2013 and 2016 with only a few yellow dots the highest overall average annual subsidence rate of 2 87 cm occurred in 2015 while the lowest rate of 0 63 cm occurred in 2013 table 1 fig 4 shows the estimated spatial distribution of groundwater pumping volume from 2010 to 2016 the horizontal belt in the middle is the choushui river which divides the area into northern changhua county and southern yunlin county parts the annual pumping patterns are similar for all years with the highest extraction volume of more than 3 million m3 per km2 0 6 million m3 per km2 in average occurring in the middle area closest to the choushui river in both the northern and southern parts the lowest estimated groundwater pumping volume of 1287 million m3 occurred in 2013 table 2 3 2 annual subsidence estimation and model performance tables 3 and 4 show the root mean square error rmse and auc results for

moran s i in both lr and spatial regression are 0 69 and 0 21 p value 0 01 0 01 respectively this implies that lr leads to greater spatial correlation of model residuals that similar residuals tend to occur together a more reliable annual subsidence rate pattern is produced from the spatial regression because spatial regression substantially decreases the spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals chu 2012 this suggests that the spatial regression represents a more robust and reliable method for estimating the spatial distribution of land subsidence based on pumping volume the lr cannot adequately explain the spatial heterogeneity pattern between subsidence and pumping volume the main cause of nonlinear correlations between subsidence and pumping volume is that subsidence is affected by groundwater pumping and the uniformly distributed geologic materials results suggest that the estimated subsidence from the lr method does not adequately match the observed data the calculated subsidence values with the lr method are between 2 cm and 6 cm a year equivalent to the maximum measured subsidence for each year fig 6 shows the annual subsidence patterns produced using the spatial regression approach with the light yellow dots representing the greatest amount of subsidence in the study area and the dark blue dots representing the least amount of subsidence in 2010 the greatest amount of subsidence occurred in the southern part of study area with values ranging from 2 cm to 6 cm a year even though some locations were shown to have values less than 1 cm a year in 2010 more than 4 5 cm of subsidence occurred in the study area and subsidence was not limited to just the southern area a widespread area of subsidence also occurred in the northern region in 2013 a large area of subsidence on the order of about 3 5 cm occurred in the south central part of the study 2014 is shown to be a year of extensive subsidence in the south with three separate subsidence bowls forming with annual rates of between 5 5 and 6 5 cm subsidence increased dramatically in 2015 with the smaller subsidence bowls combining to form one very large subsidence bowl in the south central part of the study area by contrast very little subsidence occurred in the eastern and northern parts of the study area the greatest volume of land subsidence over the 7 year investigation period occurred in 2015 the subsidence pattern of 2016 resembled the pattern of 2013 although the maximum rate was greater than that of 2013 decades of excessive subsidence due to groundwater overexploitation has been observed chen et al 2007 jang et al 2019 along coastal regions of western and southwestern taiwan especially in the choushui alluvial fan chen et al 2010 chu et al 2020 hung et al 2012b lin et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 subsidence estimation model data quantity and impacts of reduced pumping model simulations show that the time dependent spatial regression method produces more robust and accurate subsidence maps based on pumping volumes than lr in spite of the fact that the hydrologic properties of the aquifer system are not accurately known nguyen et al 2022 relative to traditional numerical models that require an accurate representation and parameterization of the hydrogeologic system jang et al 2008 spatial regression offers a reliable alternative methodology for quantifying subsidence rates in regions where scant hydrogeologic data are available clearly a more accurate characterization of the stress strain relationships across the study area would require a more thorough knowledge of the important and relevant hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer system characterizing the hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer system is the next critical step in accomplishing this goal liu et al 2004 in the meantime time dependent spatial regression techniques incorporating estimated pumping volumes mapped to observed surface deformations proves to be a powerful alternative approach for subsidence modeling the spatial regression model with the spatially varying parameters can include the spatial heterogeneity to reduce the uncertainty of the hydrogeological parameters numerical models still provide the best results for detailed subsidence modeling over other methods such as machine learning models because of the inclusion of physical mechanisms and properties that influence subsidence golestani kermani et al 2019 chen et al 2020 however numerical models typically require an inverse modeling component for robust calibration the methodology used in this study does not require model calibration even as neural network and machine learning approaches are becoming popular daliakopoulos et al 2005 sahoo et al 2017 knoll et al 2019 roshni et al 2020 they still usually require far more data than the spatial regression model used herein in this model the total number of observations does not need to be large here the data set is uniformly reduced to 10 of the available observations i e 50 60 the rmses under reduced observations increased to 0 54 0 82 cm fig 7 shows the predicted subsidence patterns produced by reducing the number of observations in the spatial regression model and clearly shows that the model is still tractable and produces reasonable results further investigation is required to determine the minimum number of observations needed to assure model efficacy the approach does not require a large number of data pairs for the regression model the effectiveness of the method could be compromised with a small number of annual subsidence and electricity data however the quantity of data model is also important and can be a limitation if insufficient measurements are available moreover the major outcome of this investigation is finding a mathematical nonlinear relation between subsidence and electricity consumption which is found to be dependent upon hydrogeologic properties precipitation patterns and agricultural activities the spatial regression model is shown to be a reliable tool for reducing uncertainty without the consideration of above factors and estimating the spatial distribution of subsidence based on only pumped groundwater volumes locations of subsidence are not highly spatially correlated with major pumping or maximum drawdown areas galloway et al 2000 the model could be improved by reducing this inconsistency and the effect of data uncertainty related to pumped volume estimation in addition we investigated the simulated impacts of reduced withdrawals for improved best management practices the method developed in this investigation can be used by water managers and government authorities to estimate the distribution of land subsidence if the pumping volume is reduced by 75 50 and 25 of the 2015 pumping volumes as shown in fig 8a c to mitigate subsidence hotspots lowering withdrawals at least by 25 would be warranted 4 2 pumping volume rainfall and subsidence this model could be achieved by providing a more robust correlation between pumping volume and electric power consumption and one that is dependent upon heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer system and climate variations chu et al 2020 the total maximum annual volume pumped groundwater from the study area is 1593 million m3 and the maximum annual pumping rate is about 3 6 million m3 per km2 table 2 this overexploitation of groundwater continues to cause compaction of the underlying aquifer systems within the alluvial fan fig 9 shows that the increase in pumping was followed by a subsequent increase in land subsidence the highest pumping volume occurred in 2015 and coincided with an increase in observed land subsidence this increased subsidence in 2015 was exacerbated by the lowest annual precipitation over the period of record the annual changes of regional pumping and rainfall can provide a summary for the temporal subsidence patterns i e annual variations and trends annual variations in rainfall and pumping result in groundwater changes that subsequently lead to changes in land subsidence rates the subsidence rate is highly correlated with rainfall in natural systems however the government in taiwan encourages farmers to stop irrigating in agricultural areas by providing subsidies during periods of drought to reduce land subsidence the data driven model is critical for quantifying data bias and uncertainty bias and uncertainty can be quantified in the model if meteorological and hydrologic data are considered rojas et al 2010 future studies will consider the effect of rainfall and water policies on overall subsidence patterns 5 conclusions the developed spatial regression time dependent data driven model estimates the annual spatial subsidence distribution in the study area on the basis of pumping volumes associated with electric power consumption data results indicate that the traditional lr method produces uncertain subsidence patterns that are more widespread throughout the region but greatest in the central part of the study area surrounding the choushui river by contrast the time dependent spatial regression approach produces spatial subsidence patterns that more accurately match the observed subsidence patterns which are shown to be largely in the southern part of the study area and away from the river the overall pattern of land subsidence reveals that the land subsidence hotspot occurs the southern area over the 2010 2016 study period the greatest and most widespread subsidence occurred in 2015 and was confirmed by the large volume of groundwater pumped during the year and accompanied by a low quantity of rainfall the maximum subsidence level reached 6 5 cm in the southern part of study area by contrast 2013 experienced the least amount of subsidence and with virtually less subsidence in northern and the western part of the study area in summary estimating spatial patterns of land subsidence using spatial regression is shown here to be significantly more accurate than the traditional nonspatial method of lr the time dependent spatial regression model presented in the study offers an improved mapping relationship between annual subsidence and pumping volume and yields a reliable land subsidence map for the study area when compared to actual subsidence observations this conclusion is not only based on visual comparison with observed spatial subsidence point data maps but also by annual rmse values the maximum annual rmse of the spatial regression is 0 76 cm so it can be concluded that spatial regression can more accurately estimate regional subsidence from groundwater pumping volumes we investigated the simulated impacts of reduced withdrawals and the effectiveness of spatial regression using fewer observations which showed that both can be done effectively and with reasonable outcomes water managers and government authorities can use the model to estimate the distribution of land subsidence if the pumping volume is reduced future work will include the effects of recharge and hotspot analysis insar and machine learning techniques will be used

7756,study region choushui river alluvial fan in central taiwan study focus excessive land subsidence is occurring in the choushui alluvial fan taiwan groundwater pumping in the region is not monitored so pumping volumes are estimated from information based on electricity consumption groundwater pumping data alone cannot be used to accurately estimate the spatial rate and distribution of subsidence due to the low spatial correlation between estimated pumping volumes and subsidence from heterogeneous geologic materials time dependent spatial regression is a reliable tool for estimating the spatial distribution of annual rate of subsidence based on spatial mapping of pumped groundwater volumes and monitored land subsidence new hydrological insights for the region estimates of pumping quantities indicate that the locations of subsidence from overexploitation of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system is not always spatially correlated with major pumping areas or with the observed locations of maximum water level drawdown considering time dependent spatial regression models the average rmse of annual subsidence is 0 65 cm for the choushui alluvial fan indicating the high level of correlation between measured and estimated subsidence these findings show that annual subsidence can be reliably estimated and predicted under the field pumping conditions of the study site the influences of reduced withdrawals based on the relation between annual subsidence and pumping volumes can be evaluated for improved best management practices graphical abstract ga1 keywords

et al 2013 rashid et al 2015 with related hydrological data electrical power demand has served as a proxy for pumping activity but such measures are often aggregated over entire townships lacking adequate resolution for regional monitoring or planning purposes vasco et al 2019 an empirical formulation chu et al 2020 is investigated to estimate the monthly pumped volume from individual wells and generated 1 km2 resolution pumped volumes over a 10 year period based on electric power consumption data for changhua and yunlin counties taiwan the pumping volumes vary both temporally and spatially modeling studies provide tools to study the correlation between the spatiotemporal variations of pumping volume and subsidence accordingly a highly reliable method is developed for incorporating both spatially and temporally varying subsidence estimations based on pumping volumes in general the location of subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation of unconsolidated aquifer systems is often not highly spatially correlated with major pumping areas and the location of maximum water level drawdown galloway et al 2000 motagh et al 2007 thus models are developed to investigate the reliability of predictive tools using annual pumpage volume as the independent variable and annual subsidence as the dependent variable recent research has focused on simulation and prediction of land subsidence and evaluation of its impacts galloway and burbey 2011 nadiri et al 2018 conventional physical process simulations are challenging due to the large hydrogeological data requirements for model development and calibration sahoo et al 2017 furthermore a data based model is often used to make interpretations between cause and effect variables in environmental and ecological studies data based models e g regression and machine learning establishes empirical relationships and associations between evidential features predictor variables and target variables rodriguez galiano et al 2014 however the data based methods have limited applicability with respect to temporal or spatial scales qian et al 2017 for example linear regression cannot be adequately used to estimate the spatial distribution of subsidence based on the volume of pumped groundwater due to the low correlation between pumping volume cause and land subsidence effect instead spatial regression methods represent a simplified methodology for estimating spatial effect patterns in these types of settings fotheringham et al 1998 ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021 a spatial regression model can be used to estimate the distribution of subsidence from spatial patterns and processes such as the volume of pumped groundwater in this study the time dependent spatial regression method is used to simulate the spatial distribution of annual land subsidence rates based on the annual spatial distribution of pumped groundwater volumes from electricity consumption data this paper aims to derive the annual spatial subsidence distribution due to groundwater pumpage using the time dependent spatial regression model the areas of greatest groundwater pumping in the study region does not coincide with the areas of greatest land subsidence this difference is attributed to variations in hydrogeologic properties of the aquifer system that are largely unknown as a result of the natural heterogeneities of the hydrogeological properties and groundwater pumping variations in the study region subsidence and pumping volume exhibit a low spatial correlation the time dependent spatial regression model is shown to provide an improved mapping relationship between total subsidence and pumping volume and yields a reliable mapping of land subsidence for the study area when compared to actual subsidence observations in addition the impacts of reducing the pumping withdrawals of a 75 b 50 and c 25 of the 2015 pumping volumes are investigated for improved best management practices 1 1 study area groundwater is widely used in central taiwan fig 1 for irrigation tung and hu 2012 the study area is within the choushui river alluvial fan which encompasses an area of 1800 km2 in changhua and yunlin counties fig 1a serious land subsidence has been occurring along the high speed railway fig 1b in central taiwan in recent decades changhua county to the north is separated from yunlin county to the south by the choushui river which bisects the alluvial fan and flows from east to west the western boundary is represented by the south china sea and the eastern boundary is represented by the headwaters of the choushui river which lie about 100 m above sea level the bedrock in the upper eastern watershed of choushui river is composed of slate metamorphic quartzite shale sandstone and mudstone which creates sediments of the choushui river alluvial fan liu et al 2004 ali et al 2020 tatas et al 2021 excessive exploitation of groundwater in changhua and yunlin counties has resulted in land subsidence and is creating a potential hazard for infrastructures including the high speed rail that passes through the region from the northeast to the southern part of the study area ali et al 2020 fig 1b shows the leveling observation points for estimating annual subsidence fig 1c shows the hydrogeological profile of the yunlin area from west to east through the alluvial fan the unconsolidated fan deposits consist of four aquifers that are composed of gravel and coarse sand deposits these aquifers are thickest in the east and become thinner toward the coast in the west the hydrogeological profile of the choushui river alluvial fan is characterized by aquifers i ii 1 ii 2 iii and iv fig 1c as measured from the land surface downward aquitards t1 t3 separate the aquifers but are not laterally continuous particularly in the west aquitards are most prevalent in the distal fan and mid fan areas and gradually diminish in thickness toward the east the proximal fan represents the major recharge area of the aquifer system jang et al 2008 yu and chu 2010 the distribution of sediments in the alluvial fan transitions from largely gravel to sand in the proximal part of the fan east to largely clay in the distal part of the fan west geologic materials are not uniformly distributed clay containing sediments are more likely to compact with head reductions than sand and gravel formations thus land subsidence from groundwater pumping is more prone to occur in the eastern part of the study area 1 2 electric power consumption subsidence and rainfall data fig 2 shows the monthly rainfall obtained from the huwei rainfall station fig 1 over the period ranging from 2010 to 2016 the rainfall is concentrated during the summer months between may and august about 20 of annual rainfall occurs during the winter and early spring dry season groundwater pumping provides irrigated demand for agriculture especially during the dry season available electric power consumption records from 2010 to 2016 were obtained for 179 944 wells in the study area from the taiwan power company chu et al 2020 most wells are operated by an individual pump owner e g a farmer the water resources agency wra of taiwan requires users to report pump power and pump type monitored electrical consumption data is used only for groundwater pumping wells which have their own dedicated meters pumping volume is estimated from information on electricity consumption pump power and other types of well data obtained from the groundwater users within the study area based on field surveys the average pumping rate in the study area is 44 2 m 3 hr cmh max 130 9 cmh min 2 0 cmh the rmses of pumping rates are approximately 7 2 and 7 7 cmh in changhua and yunlin counties respectively the pumping rates in the study area seem reasonable but contain some uncertainty associated with field operations a levelling network was made for making land subsidence observations appendix a the number of observations has varied from year to year with approximately 500 observations available in 2007 and gradually increasing to more than 700 observations by 2016 the annual subsidence leveling survey is conducted each may the annual subsidence data from the leveling survey in 2010 2016 were used in this study 2 materials and study area the annual pumping volumes are not regulated and are unknown as such annual groundwater pumping volumes 1 km2 resolution were first estimated from electricity consumption data the spatially varying relationship between annual pumping volumes and land subsidence is then determined based on time dependent spatial regression one model for each year both the spatial and nonspatial regression results are compared finally the annual subsidence maps are estimated from the spatial and nonspatial models in addition the impacts of the pumping withdrawal reductions are simulated under the field conditions of the study site 2 1 study area pumping rate q in units of

on energy power time where electric power consumption e kw hr and pump power p p kw required by the water pump are used to estimate the pumped volume v the groundwater pumping volume is estimated as 1

for pumping volume estimation each individual well that is monitored in this investigation chu et al 2020 the details of these parameters and their application are discussed more fully chu et al 2020

period occurred in 2015 the subsidence pattern of 2016 resembled the pattern of 2013 although the maximum rate was greater than that of 2013 decades of excessive subsidence due to groundwater overexploitation has been observed chen et al 2007 jang et al 2019 along coastal regions of western and southwestern taiwan especially in the choushui alluvial fan chen et al 2010 chu et al 2020 hung et al 2012b lin et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 subsidence estimation model data quantity and impacts of reduced pumping model simulations show that the time dependent spatial regression method produces more robust and accurate subsidence maps based on pumping volumes than lr in spite of the fact that the hydrologic properties of the aquifer system are not accurately known nguyen et al 2022 relative to traditional numerical models that require an accurate representation and parameterization of the hydrogeologic system jang et al 2008 spatial regression offers a reliable alternative methodology for quantifying subsidence rates in regions where scant hydrogeologic data are available clearly a more accurate characterization of the stress strain relationships across the study area would require a more thorough knowledge of the important and relevant hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer system characterizing the hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer system is the next critical step in accomplishing this goal liu et al 2004 in the meantime time dependent spatial regression techniques incorporating estimated pumping volumes mapped to observed surface deformations proves to be a powerful alternative approach for subsidence modeling the spatial regression model with the spatially varying parameters can include the spatial heterogeneity to reduce the uncertainty of the hydrogeological parameters numerical models still provide the best results for detailed subsidence modeling over other methods such as machine learning models because of the inclusion of physical mechanisms and properties that influence subsidence golestani kermani et al 2019 chen et al 2020 however numerical models typically require an inverse modeling component for robust calibration the methodology used in this study does not require model calibration even as neural network and machine learning approaches are becoming popular daliakopoulos et al 2005 sahoo et al 2017 knoll et al 2019 roshni et al 2020 they still usually require far more data than the spatial regression model used herein in this model the total number of observations does not need to be large here the data set is uniformly reduced to 10 of the available observations i e 50 60 the rmses under reduced observations increased to 0 54 0 82 cm fig 7 shows the predicted subsidence patterns produced by reducing the number of observations in the spatial regression model and clearly shows that the model is still tractable and produces reasonable results further investigation is required to determine the minimum number of observations needed to assure model efficacy the approach does not require a large number of data pairs for the regression model the effectiveness of the method could be compromised with a small number of annual subsidence and electricity data however the quantity of data model is also important and can be a limitation if insufficient measurements are available moreover the major outcome of this investigation is finding a mathematical nonlinear relation between subsidence and electricity consumption which is found to be dependent upon hydrogeologic properties precipitation patterns and agricultural activities the spatial regression model is shown to be a reliable tool for reducing uncertainty without the consideration of above factors and estimating the spatial distribution of subsidence based on only pumped groundwater volumes locations of subsidence are not highly spatially correlated with major pumping or maximum drawdown areas galloway et al 2000 the model could be improved by reducing this inconsistency and the effect of data uncertainty related to pumped volume estimation in addition we investigated the simulated impacts of reduced withdrawals for improved best management practices the method developed in this investigation can be used by water managers and government authorities to estimate the distribution of land subsidence if the pumping volume is reduced by 75 50 and 25 of the 2015 pumping volumes as shown in fig 8a c to mitigate subsidence hotspots lowering withdrawals at least by 25 would be warranted 4 2 pumping volume rainfall and subsidence this model could be achieved by providing a more robust correlation between pumping volume and electric power consumption and one that is dependent upon heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer system and climate variations chu et al 2020 the total maximum annual volume pumped groundwater from the study area is 1593 million m3 and the maximum annual pumping rate is about 3 6 million m3 per km2 table 2 this overexploitation of groundwater continues to cause compaction of the underlying aquifer systems within the alluvial fan fig 9 shows that the increase in pumping was followed by a subsequent increase in land subsidence the highest pumping volume occurred in 2015 and coincided with an increase in observed land subsidence this increased subsidence in 2015 was exacerbated by the lowest annual precipitation over the period of record the annual changes of regional pumping and rainfall can provide a summary for the temporal subsidence patterns i e annual variations and trends annual variations in rainfall and pumping result in groundwater changes that subsequently lead to changes in land subsidence rates the subsidence rate is highly correlated with rainfall in natural systems however the government in taiwan encourages farmers to stop irrigating in agricultural areas by providing subsidies during periods of drought to reduce land subsidence the data driven model is critical for quantifying data bias and uncertainty bias and uncertainty can be quantified in the model if meteorological and hydrologic data are considered rojas et al 2010 future studies will consider the effect of rainfall and water policies on overall subsidence patterns 5 conclusions the developed spatial regression time dependent data driven model estimates the annual spatial subsidence distribution in the study area on the basis of pumping volumes associated with electric power consumption data results indicate that the traditional lr method produces uncertain subsidence patterns that are more widespread throughout the region but greatest in the central part of the study area surrounding the choushui river by contrast the time dependent spatial regression approach produces spatial subsidence patterns that more accurately match the observed subsidence patterns which are shown to be largely in the southern part of the study area and away from the river the overall pattern of land subsidence reveals that the land subsidence hotspot occurs the southern area over the 2010 2016 study period the greatest and most widespread subsidence occurred in 2015 and was confirmed by the large volume of groundwater pumped during the year and accompanied by a low quantity of rainfall the maximum subsidence level reached 6 5 cm in the southern part of study area by contrast 2013 experienced the least amount of subsidence and with virtually less subsidence in northern and the western part of the study area in summary estimating spatial patterns of land subsidence using spatial regression is shown here to be significantly more accurate than the traditional nonspatial method of lr the time dependent spatial regression model presented in the study offers an improved mapping relationship between annual subsidence and pumping volume and yields a reliable land subsidence map for the study area when compared to actual subsidence observations this conclusion is not only based on visual comparison with observed spatial subsidence point data maps but also by annual rmse values the maximum annual rmse of the spatial regression is 0 76 cm so it can be concluded that spatial regression can more accurately estimate regional subsidence from groundwater pumping volumes we investigated the simulated impacts of reduced withdrawals and the effectiveness of spatial regression using fewer observations which showed that both can be done effectively and with reasonable outcomes water managers and government authorities can use the model to estimate the distribution of land subsidence if the pumping volume is reduced future work will include the effects of recharge and hotspot analysis insar and machine learning techniques will be used to measure fine temporal resolution seasonal or monthly subsidence patterns funding the study was supported by ministry of science and technology most taiwan 109 2621 m 006 003 and 2021 satu joint

operation of the great canyon division hydropower plant mitigating the risk of flooding and sustaining the water demand for waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation in downstream regions such

in water transportation in india and bangladesh this study examines the waterway flow requirement at the upper majuli island cross section of which the longitude is approximately 94 35 according to roy et al 2020 majuli island is the largest river island in the world and a significant node on india s national waterway no 2 of the brahmaputra we used the method outlined by the inland waterways authority of india iwai 2020 to calculate the minimum flow requirement for navigation which is 56 108 m3 per month for level 1 and level 2 waterway and 70 108 m3 per month for level 3 and level 4 waterway 2 2 2 operation scenarios in this study two groups of scenario analyses for multi objective optimization of the wef nexus in the yb river basin were conducted using the discharge time series simulated by the threw distributed hydrological model from 1983 to 2010 336 months in total in table 2 2 the categories of scenarios are presented five scenarios of reservoir storage have been subjected to multi objective optimization to determine the interlinkages and trade offs between hydropower navigation and agriculture in this study we evaluate three levels of reservoir total storage with varying ratios of total storage to natural annual runoff at the dam cross section a smaller ratio of storage to natural annual runoff indicates that the storage is closer to downstream section of the river for the same level of total reservoir storage a baseline scenario without reservoir storage in the yb river mainstream has also been considered in the general algebraic modeling system gams software the ε constraint method soroudi 2017 was used to generate the three dimensional pareto fronts for the multi objective optimization in table 2 2 in this study we give upstream irrigation water demand the highest priority in order to avoid the situation in which upstream regions support the hydropower or navigation of downstream regions by sacrificing their food production therefore we set the actual irrigation water uptake of china and india equals to their irrigation water demand making their irrigation assurance rate equal to 1 0 since there is no reservoir on the mainstream of the yb river in baseline scenario in table 2 2 it would be impossible to maintain full irrigation assurance for india as a trade off between irrigation assurance rate of india and bangladesh becomes inevitable there are two operating modes for each scenario of reservoir storage in the cascade hydropower system the benefit priority bp mode indicates that the cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage would not provide flood storage as s flood equals to s total the flood control priority fp mode reserves 50 of total storage for flood storage during the flood season thereby mitigating downstream flood damage selection between beneficial and flood control priority design or operation of the reservoir storage can usually be affected by multiple factors such as the preference of stakeholders or the relationship among riparian countries our research is aiming at providing effective references for stakeholders by showing a wide range of possibilities 2 3 operation for flood control on daily scale the flood control performance of the mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage in the yb river basin has been examined through daily scale flood control operations from june to october during the flood season as an initial input a designed daily discharge series with a 100 year return period from 1st june to 31st october has been implemented after the flood control regulation has been implemented the discharge process at pandu and bahadurabad will be inspected and then linked to the flood affected area in india and bangladesh respectively in this study we applied a simple linear conceptual model hou et al 2021 for simulating the daily flood control operation of cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the mainstream of the yb river basin the equations for slm are presented as follows 2 14a q out min s t 86400 q in q s q in q s 2 14b q out max q s q in s m s t 86400 q in q s q in inflow of reservoir q out outflow of

shows reliable performance in the yb river basin in fig 3 1a the nse of discharge at nuxia and bahadurabad station are 0 78 and 0 87 respectively during the calibration period from 1983 to 2000 while in validation period from 2001 to 2010 the nses at nuxia and bahadurbad are 0 79 and 0 8 pbias of discharge at nuxia and bahadurabad station are 2 04 during the calibration period from 1983 to 2000 while in validation period from 2001 to 2010 the pbias at nuxia and bahadurbad are 18 36 and 1 95 respectively rsr of discharge at nuxia and bahadurabad station are 0 46 and 0 36 respectively during the calibration period from 1983 to 2000 while in validation period from 2001 to 2010 the pbias at nuxia and bahadurbad are 0 34 and 0 32 respectively nse pbias and rsr are deemed satisfactory with respect to the requirement of nse 0 5 pbias within 25 and rsr 0 7 yang et al 2016 moriasi et al 2007 performance of the threw model in streamflow simulation is comparable to another model hymod ds which has also been applied to the yb river basin by yang et al 2016 which is the first quantitative research building hydrological model in the whole yb river basin for wef nexus analysis the hymod ds shows relatively higher nse of modeled streamflow 0 87 at nuxia 0 94 at bahadurbad in calibration while the threw model provides smaller pbias 2 for nuxia and bahadurabad in calibration the rsrs of this study are also comparable to yang et al 2016 in addition to discharge we validated the fraction of snow cover obtained from the threw model using snow cover data from tpsce chen et al 2018 as shown in figure 3 1b the rmse is 0 04 during the calibration period and 0 06 during the validation period fig 3 1 3 2 beneficial operation on month scale pareto front analysis fig 3 2 depicts the three dimensional pareto fronts of the intersectoral multi objective optimization of hydropower generation waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation under the five reservoir storage scenarios scenarios i v in table 2 2 with beneficial priority bp operation and flood control priority fp operation the three dimension of the coordinate axis in fig 3 1 are basin wide hydropower generation hpbasin 108 kw h month minimum discharge on upper majuli island cross section qminmjl 108 m3 month and the average irrigation assurance rate of bangladesh irrarbgd table 3 1 lists the endpoints of the three dimensional pareto fronts in fig 3 2 which are the solutions with highest hydropower generation hp highest qmin at upper majuli island cross section and highest irrigation assurance rate of bangladesh respectively 1 hydropower benefit the constructed hydropower system with cascade reservoir storage can bring approximately 33 7 75 0 more hydropower productivity for each month compared to the scenario with no reservoir storage over the mainstream of the yb river basin the position of reservoir storage shows varying impacts on hydropower output between different levels of storage size for total storage of 750 108 m3 scenarios with lower ratio of storage to yearly runoff in which the reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system is closer to downstream regions provides up to 4 more hydropower productivity however for relatively smaller reservoir storage such as 500 108 m3 distributing more storage in upstream regions brings up to 10 more hydropower output when comparing among optimization objectives hydropower generation in the arirr best highest irrigation assurance rate in bangladesh solution is greater than the value in the qmin best solution indicating that there is less competition between hydropower generation and bangladesh s irrigation than between hydropower generation and waterway navigation 2 waterway navigation condition competition is more significant between mainstream hydropower generation and downstream waterway navigation than between hydropower generation and irrigation in bangladesh qmin under the hp best solutions indicates that when operating with the objective of optimizing hydropower generation reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system could be distributed closer to downstream in order to prevent additional loss to minimum flow at the upper majuli island cross section nevertheless when agriculture irrigation assurance rate in bangladesh becomes the first priority objective of mainstream reservoir operation which corresponds to arirr best solutions larger reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system would aid in increasing the qmin for enhancing waterway navigability agriculture first solution can provide a balance between hydropower first and navigation first solutions with less than 1 reduction in basin hydropower generation the number of navigable months in the mainstream waterway of the brahmaputra in assam from majuli island would increase by two to three months per year with level 1 and 2 waterway standard and by one to four month per year with level 3 and 4 waterway standard given that the three dimensional pareto fronts in fig 3 2 are continuous there are a significant number of solutions capable of maintaining a balance between hydropower generation and waterway navigation in addition to the hydropower best solution at the extreme end of the spectrum for transboundary cooperation rational solutions can be determined using multi objective decision approaches such as the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation liu et al 2019 which is able to select the most suitable solution based on the weights assigned to various objectives and the degree of membership function 3 irrigation assurance rate under the beneficial priority bp mode of mainstream reservoir operation the bangladeshi irrigation assurance rate is not in competition with the other two objectives on the other hand under flood control priority fp mode of reservoir operation mainstream cascade hydropower system with larger storage capacity would contribute more to irrigation assurance in bangladesh with flood control priority and hydropower first operation of the hydropower system the assurance rate of bangladesh in scenario 750 0 56 is greater than that of scenario 750 0 74 indicating that the position of storage of the cascade hydropower system could be moved closer to the downstream section of the river in order to improve downstream agriculture benefits in bangladesh 4 scenario without reservoir storage when there is no reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system in the mainstream of the yb river basin hydropower generation and minimum flow at upper majuli island will be at their lowest levels the irrigation assurance in india which should have been set to 1 0 as outlined in section 3 2 2 cannot be kept at 1 0 because it will compete with the irrigation assurance in bangladesh in order to increase the irrigation assurance in bangladesh from 0 84 to 0 93 the irrigation assurance in india will decline by 31 from 1 to 0 69 3 3 flood control performance during flood season the flood control effect of the mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the yb river basin was studied using five scenarios under flood control priority fp mode of reservoir operation with a 100 year return period time series of flood discharge in the upstream of the great canyon of yarlung tsangpo from june 1 to october 31 blue line in fig 3 3a fig 3 3b and 3 3a present the performance of five scenarios of mainstream reservoir flood storage scenario i v in table 2 2 in reducing the peak flow at the pandu and bahadurabad cross section as well as the contribution of flood control operations in reducing the flood affected area faa in india and bangladesh with the construction of cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the mainstream of the yb river basin flood damage can be effectively mitigated in both india and bangladesh withs faa reduced by 15 13 32 56 in india and 13 09 14 8 in bangladesh in fig 3 3a there is no major flood peak before august near both upstream and downstream of the great canyon of yarlung tsangpo this means that the first flood peak in july at the pandu and bahadurabad cross section which are shown in fig 3 3b and 3 3c originates in the downstream region after the great canyon therefore the mainstream reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system located in the great canyon only has the ability of mitigating the second peak of the flood discharge rising from august 3 4 potential for transboundary cooperation significance of transboundary cooperation on water resources development in the yb river basin has been frequently emphasized in literatures both scientific researchers and medias show great concerns about the possible impacts of future mainstream hydropower and reservoir construction on the pattern of benefits over the basin among riparian countries with the quantitative analysis on the wef nexus of the yb river basin the results of this study significantly reveal the potential and opportunities of transboundary cooperation hydropower system in the great canyon of yarlung tsangpo with cascade reservoir storage can bring approximately 33 7 75 0 more hydropower productivity for each month compared to the scenario with no reservoir storage over the mainstream there is no strong competition between upstream hydropower generation and downstream water transport and agricultural irrigation according to table 3 1 to make the mainstream waterway in india have full year navigability 12 month navigability on average or provide full time irrigation assurance arirr close to 1 0 for bangladesh the decline in monthly hydropower generation is around 0 1 0 2 billion kw h which is less than 1 of the total hydropower productivity per month even if the reservoir storage is operated giving first priority to hydropower generation downstream navigation number of months with navigability per year and irrigation arirr condition can still be significantly improved when compared to the no reservoir scenario construction of cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage brings enormous chances for transboundary cooperation rather than hotspot of conflicts in benefits cascade reservoir storage on mainstream of the yb river also provides transboundary cooperation opportunities on flood control under fp flood control priority mode of reservoir operation 50 of total storage can be used for reducing flood peaks and mitigating flood related damages in downstream regions in india and bangladesh table 3 1 shows that with approximately 10 decline in monthly hydropower production the flood affected areas in india and bangladesh can be reduced by 32 56 and 14 8 respectively the results indicate the possibility of flood control cooperation along the mainstream of the yb river the reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system has the ability of effectively mitigating flood related damages in downstream countries and limit the negative influences on upstream hydropower benefits 4 conclusions the mainstream of the yb river flows through three countries performing vital functions in hydropower generation waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation together with the downstream requirements of waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation hydropower development on the mainstream of the yb river makes the yb river basin a new focal point for transboundary cooperation and competition on integrated water resources management from the perspective of wef nexus this article examines the effect of mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the benefit distribution over the yb river basin three dimensional trade off exists among the objectives of mainstream hydropower generation waterway navigation and downstream irrigation in bangladesh the three water use sections across the yb river can be balanced through optimal operation of the mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage the number of months during which the brahmaputra in assam is navigable from majuli island would increase by one to four months per year if the irrigation best solution presented in section 3 1 were implemented with less than 1 reduction in basin hydropower generation irrigation assurance rate in bangladesh would be able to reach 100 reservoir storage of the mainstream cascade hydropower system in the yb river basin also shows significant ability of mitigating flood damage in india and bangladesh with about 10 decline in upstream monthly hydropower generation flood affected area within india would be reduced by up to 32 56 in bangladesh the flood affected area would shrinks for up to 14 8 with flood storage provided by the mainstream cascade hydropower system the ultimate conclusion of this study is that the construction of mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage would have enormous benefits for hydropower development waterway navigation and agricultural production in the yb river basin although intersectoral trade offs would add complexity to the wef nexus within the basin there are more chances for transboundary cooperation the basin wide mutual benefits would be significantly enhanced by the coordinated management of water resources in the yb river basin which requires the cooperation of all riparian nations in this study impact of mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage in the yb river basin has been evaluated using scenario analysis of reservoir storage and operation modes influence of future climate change has not been included due to limitation in climate change scenarios capturing extreme values of precipitation and discharge which are of great significance to flood control performance evaluation of reservoir storage in the mainstream hydropower system construction of high reliability scenarios of climate change impact with realistic estimation of extreme precipitation and discharge would be a crucial step of future research on the hydropower development and wef nexus in the yb river basin from the perspective of the wef nexus our paper describes the advantages of transboundary cooperation brought about by hydropower development in a broad river basin with competing water use industries and riparian nations the favorable findings and conclusions of this study indicate the potential for transforming transboundary rivalries or even conflicts into possibilities for mutual benefit and collaboration this would stimulate further research into integrated water management

hydropower generation reservoir operation agricultural irrigation and flood mitigation in the yb river basin from the perspective of wef nexus by investigating trade offs and synergies among different water use sectors in countries along the mainstream of the yb river the objective of this study is to identify opportunities for basin wide transboundary cooperation on energy and food production as well as flood control results of quantitative analysis of the wef nexus in the yb basin would assist in transforming challenges into opportunities for coordinated development 2 methods and material a modeling framework of wef nexus in the yb river basin has been established based on hydrological simulation via the threw tsinghua representative elementary watershed model and scenario analysis of mainstream hydropower development fig 2 1 the calibrated threw model generates simulated time series for the discharge in the yb river basin under natural conditions the wef nexus has been modeled using mainstream hydropower development scenarios featuring cascade hydropower plants with reservoir storage in sections 2 2 and 2 3 scenario analysis reveals the intersectoral trade offs between hydropower generation waterway navigation and downstream irrigation as well as the effects of mainstream reservoir storage of cascade hydropower system on flood damage mitigation 2 1 threw distributed

people cn 2020 this study considers a cascade hydropower system that includes reservoir storage and a division hydropower plant hpdiv across the great canyon of yarlung tsangpo for future mainstream hydropower development the division hydropower plant located across the great canyon utilizes the extremely high water head reservoir storage enables the regulation of runoff ensuring the steady operation of the great canyon division hydropower plant mitigating the risk of flooding and sustaining the water demand for waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation in downstream regions such

in water transportation in india and bangladesh this study examines the waterway flow requirement at the upper majuli island cross section of which the longitude is approximately 94 35 according to roy et al 2020 majuli island is the largest river island in the world and a significant node on india s national waterway no 2 of the brahmaputra we used the method outlined by the inland waterways authority of india iwai 2020 to calculate the minimum flow requirement for navigation which is 56 108 m3 per month for level 1 and level 2 waterway and 70 108 m3 per month for level 3 and level 4 waterway 2 2 2 operation scenarios in this study two groups of scenario analyses for multi objective optimization of the wef nexus in the yb river basin were conducted using the discharge time series simulated by the threw distributed hydrological model from 1983 to 2010 336 months in total in table 2 2 the categories of scenarios are presented five scenarios of reservoir storage have been subjected to multi objective optimization to determine the interlinkages and trade offs between hydropower navigation and agriculture in this study we evaluate three levels of reservoir total storage with varying ratios of total storage to natural annual runoff at the dam cross section a smaller ratio of storage to natural annual runoff indicates that the storage is closer to downstream section of the river for the same level of total reservoir storage a baseline scenario without reservoir storage in the yb river mainstream has also been considered in the general algebraic modeling system gams software the ε constraint method soroudi 2017 was used to generate the three dimensional pareto fronts for the multi objective optimization in table 2 2 in this study we give upstream irrigation water demand the highest priority in order to avoid the situation in which upstream regions support the hydropower or navigation of downstream regions by sacrificing their food production therefore we set the actual irrigation water uptake of china and india equals to their irrigation water demand making their irrigation assurance rate equal to 1 0 since there is no reservoir on the mainstream of the yb river in baseline scenario in table 2 2 it would be impossible to maintain full irrigation assurance for india as a trade off between irrigation assurance rate of india and bangladesh becomes inevitable there are two operating modes for each scenario of reservoir storage in the cascade hydropower system the benefit priority bp mode indicates that the cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage would not provide flood storage as s flood equals to s total the flood control priority fp mode reserves 50 of total storage for flood storage during the flood season thereby mitigating downstream flood damage selection between beneficial and flood control priority design or operation of the reservoir storage can usually be affected by multiple factors such as the preference of stakeholders or the relationship among riparian countries our research is aiming at providing effective references for stakeholders by showing a wide range of possibilities 2 3 operation for flood control on daily scale the flood control performance of the mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage in the yb river basin has been examined through daily scale flood control operations from june to october during the flood season as an initial input a designed daily discharge series with a 100 year return period from 1st june to 31st october has been implemented after the flood control regulation has been implemented the discharge process at pandu and bahadurabad will be inspected and then linked to the flood affected area in india and bangladesh respectively in this study we applied a simple linear conceptual model hou et al 2021 for simulating the daily flood control operation of cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the mainstream of the yb river basin the equations for slm are presented as follows 2 14a q out min s t 86400 q in q s q in q s 2 14b q out max q s q in s m s t 86400 q in q s q in inflow of reservoir q out outflow of

shows reliable performance in the yb river basin in fig 3 1a the nse of discharge at nuxia and bahadurabad station are 0 78 and 0 87 respectively during the calibration period from 1983 to 2000 while in validation period from 2001 to 2010 the nses at nuxia and bahadurbad are 0 79 and 0 8 pbias of discharge at nuxia and bahadurabad station are 2 04 during the calibration period from 1983 to 2000 while in validation period from 2001 to 2010 the pbias at nuxia and bahadurbad are 18 36 and 1 95 respectively rsr of discharge at nuxia and bahadurabad station are 0 46 and 0 36 respectively during the calibration period from 1983 to 2000 while in validation period from 2001 to 2010 the pbias at nuxia and bahadurbad are 0 34 and 0 32 respectively nse pbias and rsr are deemed satisfactory with respect to the requirement of nse 0 5 pbias within 25 and rsr 0 7 yang et al 2016 moriasi et al 2007 performance of the threw model in streamflow simulation is comparable to another model hymod ds which has also been applied to the yb river basin by yang et al 2016 which is the first quantitative research building hydrological model in the whole yb river basin for wef nexus analysis the hymod ds shows relatively higher nse of modeled streamflow 0 87 at nuxia 0 94 at bahadurbad in calibration while the threw model provides smaller pbias 2 for nuxia and bahadurabad in calibration the rsrs of this study are also comparable to yang et al 2016 in addition to discharge we validated the fraction of snow cover obtained from the threw model using snow cover data from tpsce chen et al 2018 as shown in figure 3 1b the rmse is 0 04 during the calibration period and 0 06 during the validation period fig 3 1 3 2 beneficial operation on month scale pareto front analysis fig 3 2 depicts the three dimensional pareto fronts of the intersectoral multi objective optimization of hydropower generation waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation under the five reservoir storage scenarios scenarios i v in table 2 2 with beneficial priority bp operation and flood control priority fp operation the three dimension of the coordinate axis in fig 3 1 are basin wide hydropower generation hpbasin 108 kw h month minimum discharge on upper majuli island cross section qminmjl 108 m3 month and the average irrigation assurance rate of bangladesh irrarbgd table 3 1 lists the endpoints of the three dimensional pareto fronts in fig 3 2 which are the solutions with highest hydropower generation hp highest qmin at upper majuli island cross section and highest irrigation assurance rate of bangladesh respectively 1 hydropower benefit the constructed hydropower system with cascade reservoir storage can bring approximately 33 7 75 0 more hydropower productivity for each month compared to the scenario with no reservoir storage over the mainstream of the yb river basin the position of reservoir storage shows varying impacts on hydropower output between different levels of storage size for total storage of 750 108 m3 scenarios with lower ratio of storage to yearly runoff in which the reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system is closer to downstream regions provides up to 4 more hydropower productivity however for relatively smaller reservoir storage such as 500 108 m3 distributing more storage in upstream regions brings up to 10 more hydropower output when comparing among optimization objectives hydropower generation in the arirr best highest irrigation assurance rate in bangladesh solution is greater than the value in the qmin best solution indicating that there is less competition between hydropower generation and bangladesh s irrigation than between hydropower generation and waterway navigation 2 waterway navigation condition competition is more significant between mainstream hydropower generation and downstream waterway navigation than between hydropower generation and irrigation in bangladesh qmin under the hp best solutions indicates that when operating with the objective of optimizing hydropower generation reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system could be distributed closer to downstream in order to prevent additional loss to minimum flow at the upper majuli island cross section nevertheless when agriculture irrigation assurance rate in bangladesh becomes the first priority objective of mainstream reservoir operation which corresponds to arirr best solutions larger reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system would aid in increasing the qmin for enhancing waterway navigability agriculture first solution can provide a balance between hydropower first and navigation first solutions with less than 1 reduction in basin hydropower generation the number of navigable months in the mainstream waterway of the brahmaputra in assam from majuli island would increase by two to three months per year with level 1 and 2 waterway standard and by one to four month per year with level 3 and 4 waterway standard given that the three dimensional pareto fronts in fig 3 2 are continuous there are a significant number of solutions capable of maintaining a balance between hydropower generation and waterway navigation in addition to the hydropower best solution at the extreme end of the spectrum for transboundary cooperation rational solutions can be determined using multi objective decision approaches such as the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation liu et al 2019 which is able to select the most suitable solution based on the weights assigned to various objectives and the degree of membership function 3 irrigation assurance rate under the beneficial priority bp mode of mainstream reservoir operation the bangladeshi irrigation assurance rate is not in competition with the other two objectives on the other hand under flood control priority fp mode of reservoir operation mainstream cascade hydropower system with larger storage capacity would contribute more to irrigation assurance in bangladesh with flood control priority and hydropower first operation of the hydropower system the assurance rate of bangladesh in scenario 750 0 56 is greater than that of scenario 750 0 74 indicating that the position of storage of the cascade hydropower system could be moved closer to the downstream section of the river in order to improve downstream agriculture benefits in bangladesh 4 scenario without reservoir storage when there is no reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system in the mainstream of the yb river basin hydropower generation and minimum flow at upper majuli island will be at their lowest levels the irrigation assurance in india which should have been set to 1 0 as outlined in section 3 2 2 cannot be kept at 1 0 because it will compete with the irrigation assurance in bangladesh in order to increase the irrigation assurance in bangladesh from 0 84 to 0 93 the irrigation assurance in india will decline by 31 from 1 to 0 69 3 3 flood control performance during flood season the flood control effect of the mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the yb river basin was studied using five scenarios under flood control priority fp mode of reservoir operation with a 100 year return period time series of flood discharge in the upstream of the great canyon of yarlung tsangpo from june 1 to october 31 blue line in fig 3 3a fig 3 3b and 3 3a present the performance of five scenarios of mainstream reservoir flood storage scenario i v in table 2 2 in reducing the peak flow at the pandu and bahadurabad cross section as well as the contribution of flood control operations in reducing the flood affected area faa in india and bangladesh with the construction of cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the mainstream of the yb river basin flood damage can be effectively mitigated in both india and bangladesh withs faa reduced by 15 13 32 56 in india and 13 09 14 8 in bangladesh in fig 3 3a there is no major flood peak before august near both upstream and downstream of the great canyon of yarlung tsangpo this means that the first flood peak in july at the pandu and bahadurabad cross section which are shown in fig 3 3b and 3 3c originates in the downstream region after the great canyon therefore the mainstream reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system located in the great canyon only has the ability of mitigating the second peak of the flood discharge rising from august 3 4 potential for transboundary cooperation significance of transboundary cooperation on water resources development in the yb river basin has been frequently emphasized in literatures both scientific researchers and medias show great concerns about the possible impacts of future mainstream hydropower and reservoir construction on the pattern of benefits over the basin among riparian countries with the quantitative analysis on the wef nexus of the yb river basin the results of this study significantly reveal the potential and opportunities of transboundary cooperation hydropower system in the great canyon of yarlung tsangpo with cascade reservoir storage can bring approximately 33 7 75 0 more hydropower productivity for each month compared to the scenario with no reservoir storage over the mainstream there is no strong competition between upstream hydropower generation and downstream water transport and agricultural irrigation according to table 3 1 to make the mainstream waterway in india have full year navigability 12 month navigability on average or provide full time irrigation assurance arirr close to 1 0 for bangladesh the decline in monthly hydropower generation is around 0 1 0 2 billion kw h which is less than 1 of the total hydropower productivity per month even if the reservoir storage is operated giving first priority to hydropower generation downstream navigation number of months with navigability per year and irrigation arirr condition can still be significantly improved when compared to the no reservoir scenario construction of cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage brings enormous chances for transboundary cooperation rather than hotspot of conflicts in benefits cascade reservoir storage on mainstream of the yb river also provides transboundary cooperation opportunities on flood control under fp flood control priority mode of reservoir operation 50 of total storage can be used for reducing flood peaks and mitigating flood related damages in downstream regions in india and bangladesh table 3 1 shows that with approximately 10 decline in monthly hydropower production the flood affected areas in india and bangladesh can be reduced by 32 56 and 14 8 respectively the results indicate the possibility of flood control cooperation along the mainstream of the yb river the reservoir storage of the cascade hydropower system has the ability of effectively mitigating flood related damages in downstream countries and limit the negative influences on upstream hydropower benefits 4 conclusions the mainstream of the yb river flows through three countries performing vital functions in hydropower generation waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation together with the downstream requirements of waterway navigation and agricultural irrigation hydropower development on the mainstream of the yb river makes the yb river basin a new focal point for transboundary cooperation and competition on integrated water resources management from the perspective of wef nexus this article examines the effect of mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage on the benefit distribution over the yb river basin three dimensional trade off exists among the objectives of mainstream hydropower generation waterway navigation and downstream irrigation in bangladesh the three water use sections across the yb river can be balanced through optimal operation of the mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage the number of months during which the brahmaputra in assam is navigable from majuli island would increase by one to four months per year if the irrigation best solution presented in section 3 1 were implemented with less than 1 reduction in basin hydropower generation irrigation assurance rate in bangladesh would be able to reach 100 reservoir storage of the mainstream cascade hydropower system in the yb river basin also shows significant ability of mitigating flood damage in india and bangladesh with about 10 decline in upstream monthly hydropower generation flood affected area within india would be reduced by up to 32 56 in bangladesh the flood affected area would shrinks for up to 14 8 with flood storage provided by the mainstream cascade hydropower system the ultimate conclusion of this study is that the construction of mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage would have enormous benefits for hydropower development waterway navigation and agricultural production in the yb river basin although intersectoral trade offs would add complexity to the wef nexus within the basin there are more chances for transboundary cooperation the basin wide mutual benefits would be significantly enhanced by the coordinated management of water resources in the yb river basin which requires the cooperation of all riparian nations in this study impact of mainstream cascade hydropower system with reservoir storage in the yb river basin has been evaluated using scenario analysis of reservoir storage and operation modes influence of future climate change has not been included due to limitation in climate change scenarios capturing extreme values of precipitation and discharge which are of great significance to flood control performance evaluation of reservoir storage in the mainstream hydropower system construction of high reliability scenarios of climate change impact with realistic estimation of extreme precipitation and discharge would be a crucial step of future research on the hydropower development and wef nexus in the yb river basin from the perspective of the wef nexus our paper describes the advantages of transboundary cooperation brought about by hydropower development in a broad river basin with competing water use industries and riparian nations the favorable findings and conclusions of this study indicate the potential for transforming transboundary rivalries or even conflicts into possibilities for mutual benefit and collaboration this would stimulate further research into integrated water management

proposed variable i e vapor pressure which was not taken into account by hs equation and leads to the errors in the et o estimation in different climate zones of adrb in central asia the modified hs equation adopted with vapor pressure variable adjusted et o estimates to the reference universal standard fao 56 pm et o the modified hs equation can be used instead of fao 56 pm when there are fewer conventional variables i e temperatures solar radiation and vapor pressure which can be obtained from the alternative sources e g satellite reanalysis to yield a satisfactory estimation of et o 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was carried out on the amu darya river adr originated from the glaciers and snow fields of the western tian shan and pamir mountains of tajikistan the study area is a vast region of four distinct climate zones arid including subzones bwh bwk bsh and bsk temperate csa cold including subzones dsa dsb dsc and dfc and polar including subzones et and ef according to köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 fig 1 amu darya is the main river of adrb with a total length of 2400 km approximately the total area of amu darya river basin adrb is approximately 590 939 km2 accounting for 58 92 of the total aral sea basin expanded over afghanistan 16 2 kyrgyzstan 0 8 tajikistan 12 3 turkmenistan 35 1 and uzbekistan 35 6 approximately 4 3 million hectares area used for agriculture production jalilov et al 2016 adrb provides water and food for around 43 million inhabitants accounting for two thirds of aral sea total runoff agal tseva et al 2011 the adrb is distributed in two unequal parts a plain dominated north western part called lower adrb where elevation is not greater than 200 m and the south eastern part called upper adrb which is situated at high mountainous terrains of pamir and tian shan altitude ranges from 5000 to 6000 m a s l 2 2 data integrity and quality assessment the quality of climate data is significantly important than reference evapotranspiration estimates with unsuitable data the available ground observational climatic data is very limited due to a fewer meteorological stations settled over high mountainous terrains several stations have been dysfunctional since 1990 due to the collapse of the soviet union and decades long political unrest in afghanistan sorg et al 2012 hence alternative sources of climate data e g satellite reanalysis are used to fill the missing gaps in the ground based 114 observational meteorological stations data collected from two data sources namely nwara afghanistan and central asia temperature and precipitation data 1879 2003 version 1 williams 2008 the climate data includes daily maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin mean temperature tmean vapor pressure vp relative humidity rh solar radiation rn and wind speed ws at two meter height in this study it was attempted to fill the missing data by using recently released more suitable datasets such as ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation era5 copernicus climate change service c3s c3s 2017 modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 gelaro et al 2017 climatic research unit cru ts version 4 01 harris et al 2020 climate and climate water balance dataset for terrestrial surfaces terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 and asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 these datasets were evaluated with meteorological stations data using statistical indices i e coefficient of determination r2 correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse the terraclimate vp ws and rn variables and cfsr relative humidity datasets were used fuka et al 2014 in addition percentage of the daylength was calculated for each station using geosphere package in r language forsythe et al 1995 2 3 calibration and validation of hargreaves samani equation coefficient c the pm model et o estimation has been considered as a universal standard but parameters necessary for pm equation are not available for such a vast basin hence the adjustment of hargreaves samani hs equation or empirical coefficient c is an alternative way to improve the hs equation et o estimates ravazzani et al 2012 in addition calibrated hs et o equation allows more accurate approximation of universal standard fao 56 pm et o instead of relying on uncalibrated hs equation gavilán et al 2006 therefore in this study hs equation and empirical coefficient were calibrated using local calibration and linear regression with a new proposed variable vp at 114 meteorological stations using following equations the fao 56 pm equation eq 1 for estimating daily et o allen et al 1998a 1 pm

8 0 software in monthly time steps and adjusted to a daily scale for analysis the original hargreaves samani equation coefficient was calibrated eqs 3 4 1984 1990 and validated 2000 2005 using monthly and yearly data while pm et o was used as reference 3 x hs et o pm et o where x is the linear slope factor by pm et o and hs et o finally the hs equation coefficient was corrected at monthly and yearly scales as follows 4 c corr 0 0023 x where c corr is corrected hs equation coefficient x is the linear slope factor calculated by eq 3 2 4 statistical evaluation indicators the conventional statistical evaluation indicators including pearson correlation coefficient cc coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute error

rss and tss illustrate standard deviation sum of squares of residuals and the total sum of squares respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 data integrity and quality assessment based on performance criteria of highest r2 and cc and lowest rmse against the ground based meteorological stations data as demonstrated in table 1 the terraclimate dataset was nominated to fill the missing data for tmax tmin and tmean furthermore aphrodite datasets for adrb proposed by author sidike et al 2016 found terraclimate dataset to be more suitable than aphrodite in the same way the terraclimate dataset has higher spatial and temporal resolution than aphrodite and the overall average performance of terraclimate was found significantly higher than other latest datasets in this region as shown in table 1 for instance in fig 2 at murghab meteorological station lat 38 17 long 73 97 highest r2 with ground observed weather station data was found for tmax tmin and tmean variables 3 2 comparison of pm verses hs equations for reference evapotranspiration estimation hargreaves samani hs method hs s equation is inadequate in humid regions as it overestimates et o temesgen et al 2005 trajkovic 2005 and underestimates et o in a very dry and windy regions fooladmand and haghighat 2007 popova et al 2006 therefore the hs equation underestimates et o at all stations in adrb at some stations underestimation of hs was found almost about to two times comparable to pm et o as shown in fig 3 however it was found highly correlated with pm et o estimates at most of the stations high underestimates of hs et o were found at the lower adrb where exist tropical and subtropical desert climates with high vapor pressure in contrast smaller underestimation of et o were found at the upper adrb as it advanced toward humid region and hs equation produced smaller error in humid region as in the similar study by martinez and thepadia 2010 this is probably due to the vapor pressure difference at the lower and upper reaches of adrb which directly affects hs et o estimates hargreaves and allen 2003 in comparison of et o estimates obtained from the between the uncalibrated hs equation and pm equation average rmse nse mae was found 1 84 mm day 0 27 and 0 61 mm day respectively thus it can be observed that the uncalibrated hs equation inadequately estimated the et o compared to other observations in the study region khaydar et al 2021 schieder 2011 shi et al 2007 3 3 local calibration of hargreaves samani equation coefficient the hs et o equation have been frequently used as an alternative of fao 56 pm et o to estimate crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling for arid and semiarid regions in the world elbeltagi et al 2020 2021 moeletsi et al 2013 patel et al 2014 however the calibrated hs et o equation allows more accurate approximation of universal standard fao 56 pm et o gavilán et al 2006 in this study hs et o equation and empirical coefficient c was calibrated and the modified hs equation using monthly mean data from 1984 to 1990 the validation was performed with independently estimated pm et o using monthly data during 2000 2005 the calibrated hs equation coefficient were found ranging from 0 0025 to 0 0186 due to hyper aridity conditions as reported in other similar climatic regions almorox and grieser 2016 azzam et al 2022 raziei and pereira 2013 the corrected hs coefficient was varied during different months of the year as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 however the corrected hs coefficient c corr for yearly data fig 5 was found higher about 0 0047 at the lower adrb region which is probably resulted from higher underestimation of hs et o due to very dry windy and high vapor pressure region fooladmand and haghighat 2007 popova et al 2006 while it was found about 0 0033 at upper adrb toward humid region of adrb where hs et o estimates were affected as reported previously by temesgen et al 2005 and trajkovic 2005 3 4 linear regression analysis between vapor pressure and hs eto to pm eto ratio the linear regression analysis between vapor pressure and hs to pm et o ratio provided a significant insight of hs equation associated with the vapor pressure variable the correlation between vapor pressure and hs et o to pm et o ratio was investigated for all stations of the study area significant correlation was found between vapor pressure and hs to pm eto ratio as illustrated for navoi station and khorezm station in fig 6 in the other words higher the vapor pressure results in higher relative humidity difference which directly impacts hs equation et o estimates as investigated in other similar studies hargreaves and allen 2003 heydari and heydari 2014 thus hs equation without taking vapor pressure explicitly into account leads to estimation error similarly in adrb high vapor pressure was observed at the lower adrb where tropical and subtropical desert climate predominates while low vapor pressure was found at upper adrb which represents a tundra climatic zone 3 5 modified hargreaves samani equation in different climate zones the modified hs equation was investigated at three major distinct climate zones i e arid and temperate cold and polar climate zone linear regression analysis between hs pm et o ratio and vapor pressure played a significant rule in the improvement of hs equation coefficient the derived modified hs equation for meteorological station in arid and temperate zone eq 10 is as follows 10 hs et o 0 0028 vp 0 0073 r n t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 where vp vapor pressure is introduced as a new variable for the adjustment of hs equation with pm equation as reference similarly eq 11 was derived for the meteorological stations in cold climate zone and eq 12 was obtained for the polar climate zone in adrb 11 hs et o 0 000046 vp 0 0021 r n t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 12 hs et o 0 000174 vp 0 0053 r n t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 where hs eq 2 coefficient c for each climatic zone was replaced by newly calibrated coefficient using monthly mean data tmean tmax tmin rn and vp from different meteorological stations in each climate zone of adrb from 1984 to 1990 the obtained modified hs equations were validated with independently estimated pm eto using monthly data from 2000 to 2005 at difference meteorological stations of adrb as shown in fig 6 and satisfactory results advocate the application of modified equations 3 6 validation of the modified hargreaves samani equation and the calibrated hs coefficient the estimated et o using modified hs equation coefficient in two ways compared the estimated et o obtained by the modified hs equation with the pm equation using cropwat model and ground observations khaydar et al 2021 schieder 2011 shi et al 2007 the modified equation for arid and temperate climate zone was tested for 78 different meteorological stations and the error between hs et o estimates and pm et o estimates was significantly reduced about 60 67 and 57 53 of rmse and mae respectively the average cc r2 rmse nse mae was found 0 97 0 95 0 77 mm day 0 86 0 09 mm day respectively similarly the modified hs equation for cold climate zone was tested at 22 meteorological stations rmse and mae was found reduced to 43 38 38 84 in average respectively the average cc r2 rmse nse mae was 0 94 0 89 0 77 0 80 0 09 respectively furthermore the derived equation for polar climate zone was tested at 13 meteorological stations and satisfied results were achieved average cc r2 rmse nse mae was about 0 99 0 98 0 64 0 81 0 07 respectively the reduction in rmse and mae was found at 42 20 and 37 57 respectively to illustrate the validity of the modified hs equation two aforementioned stations for each upper adrb navoi station lat 40 13 long 65 35 and khorezm station lat 41 45 long 61 03 and lower adrb stations murghab station lat 38 17 long 73 97 and lyakhsh station lat 38 32 long 71 25 showed highest correlation lowest rmse and highest nse in fig 7 according to landson classification excellent nse 0 93 and good 0 8 nse 0 93 performance nse was achieved the results reveal that the modified hs equation based on vapor pressure variables would be more appropriate to estimate et o for each climate zone in adrb central asia 4 conclusions the main objective of this research was to test the modified hs equation for each climatic zone of adrb using a new variable i e vapor pressure affecting hs et o estimates reported by hargreaves and allen the locally calibrated hs equation coefficient c were found variated widely across the climatic conditions and months ranging from 0 0025 to 0 0186 due to hyper aridity conditions in the study area the original hs equation which does not explicitly take into account for vapor pressure leads to the estimation errors of approximately 1 84 mm day 0 27 and 0 61 mm day for rmse nse and mae respectively high estimation errors were found in the regions of high vapor pressure and low wind speed while estimation errors were found to decrease as advanced to the regions of low vapor pressure and high wind speed this suggests that vapor pressure has a considerable influence on the eto estimate which was not accounted by the original hs equation the modified equations based on vapor pressure were effectively tested and validated at 78 21 13 meteorological stations in the arid and temperate cold and polar climate zone of the adrb respectively a significantly reduction of average rmse and mae was found for each climate zone i e arid and temperate 60 67 57 53 cold climate zone 43 38 38 84 and polar 42 20 and 37 57 respectively based on achieved results in the present study and reported by other similar studies the modified hs equation based on each climatic zone were found to be more accurate and comprehensive than by geographical location thus using the newly proposed variable i e vapor pressure in the modified hs equation for each climate zone is more efficient and provides a better approximation of the standard fao 56 pm equation for each climate zone of adrb in central asia therefore the modified hs equation can be used instead of fao 56 pm when there are fewer conventional variables i e temperatures solar radiation and vapor pressure which can be obtained from the alternative sources e g satellite reanalysis to yield a satisfactory estimation of eto credit

the original hs equation hosseinzadeh talaee 2014 different studies modified hs equation by different additional explanatory variables in the original hs equation such as wind speed cobaner et al 2017 precipitation hosseinzadeh talaee 2014 windspeed and daily temperature range heydari and heydari 2014 and elevation ravazzani et al 2012 etc therefore it is significantly important to investigate other influential variables such as vapor pressure to reduce the estimation error of the original hs equation under different climatic conditions in present study new modified hs equations based on actual vapor pressure was evaluated with fao 56 pm et o as reference eto using maximum temperature minimum temperature humidity wind speed and percentage of the daylength at monthly time steps and adjusted to a daily scale for analysis using cropwat 8 0 software 1 3 research objectives novelty and contribution the main objective of this research is to modify the original hs equation with a new proposed variable i e vapor pressure which was not taken into account by hs equation and leads to the errors in the et o estimation in different climate zones of adrb in central asia the modified hs equation adopted with vapor pressure variable adjusted et o estimates to the reference universal standard fao 56 pm et o the modified hs equation can be used instead of fao 56 pm when there are fewer conventional variables i e temperatures solar radiation and vapor pressure which can be obtained from the alternative sources e g satellite reanalysis to yield a satisfactory estimation of et o 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was carried out on the amu darya river adr originated from the glaciers and snow fields of the western tian shan and pamir mountains of tajikistan the study area is a vast region of four distinct climate zones arid including subzones bwh bwk bsh and bsk temperate csa cold including subzones dsa dsb dsc and dfc and polar including subzones et and ef according to köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 fig 1 amu darya is the main river of adrb with a total length of 2400 km approximately the total area of amu darya river basin adrb is approximately 590 939 km2 accounting for 58 92 of the total aral sea basin expanded over afghanistan 16 2 kyrgyzstan 0 8 tajikistan 12 3 turkmenistan 35 1 and uzbekistan 35 6 approximately 4 3 million hectares area used for agriculture production jalilov et al 2016 adrb provides water and food for around 43 million inhabitants accounting for two thirds of aral sea total runoff agal tseva et al 2011 the adrb is distributed in two unequal parts a plain dominated north western part called lower adrb where elevation is not greater than 200 m and the south eastern part called upper adrb which is situated at high mountainous terrains of pamir and tian shan altitude ranges from 5000 to 6000 m a s l 2 2 data integrity and quality assessment the quality of climate data is significantly important than reference evapotranspiration estimates with unsuitable data the available ground observational climatic data is very limited due to a fewer meteorological stations settled over high mountainous terrains several stations have been dysfunctional since 1990 due to the collapse of the soviet union and decades long political unrest in afghanistan sorg et al 2012 hence alternative sources of climate data e g satellite reanalysis are used to fill the missing gaps in the ground based 114 observational meteorological stations data collected from two data sources namely nwara afghanistan and central asia temperature and precipitation data 1879 2003 version 1 williams 2008 the climate data includes daily maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin mean temperature tmean vapor pressure vp relative humidity rh solar radiation rn and wind speed ws at two meter height in this study it was attempted to fill the missing data by using recently released more suitable datasets such as ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation era5 copernicus climate change service c3s c3s 2017 modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 gelaro et al 2017 climatic research unit cru ts version 4 01 harris et al 2020 climate and climate water balance dataset for terrestrial surfaces terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 and asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 these datasets were evaluated with meteorological stations data using statistical indices i e coefficient of determination r2 correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse the terraclimate vp ws and rn variables and cfsr relative humidity datasets were used fuka et al 2014 in addition percentage of the daylength was calculated for each station using geosphere package in r language forsythe et al 1995 2 3 calibration and validation of hargreaves samani equation coefficient c the pm model et o estimation has been considered as a universal standard but parameters necessary for pm equation are not available for such a vast basin hence the adjustment of hargreaves samani hs equation or empirical coefficient c is an alternative way to improve the hs equation et o estimates ravazzani et al 2012 in addition calibrated hs et o equation allows more accurate approximation of universal standard fao 56 pm et o instead of relying on uncalibrated hs equation gavilán et al 2006 therefore in this study hs equation and empirical coefficient were calibrated using local calibration and linear regression with a new proposed variable vp at 114 meteorological stations using following equations the fao 56 pm equation eq 1 for estimating daily et o allen et al 1998a 1 pm

and yearly data while pm et o was used as reference 3 x hs et o pm et o where x is the linear slope factor by pm et o and hs et o finally the hs equation coefficient was corrected at monthly and yearly scales as follows 4 c corr 0 0023 x where c corr is corrected hs equation coefficient x is the linear slope factor calculated by eq 3 2 4 statistical evaluation indicators the conventional statistical evaluation indicators including pearson correlation coefficient cc coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute error

criteria of highest r2 and cc and lowest rmse against the ground based meteorological stations data as demonstrated in table 1 the terraclimate dataset was nominated to fill the missing data for tmax tmin and tmean furthermore aphrodite datasets for adrb proposed by author sidike et al 2016 found terraclimate dataset to be more suitable than aphrodite in the same way the terraclimate dataset has higher spatial and temporal resolution than aphrodite and the overall average performance of terraclimate was found significantly higher than other latest datasets in this region as shown in table 1 for instance in fig 2 at murghab meteorological station lat 38 17 long 73 97 highest r2 with ground observed weather station data was found for tmax tmin and tmean variables 3 2 comparison of pm verses hs equations for reference evapotranspiration estimation hargreaves samani hs method hs s equation is inadequate in humid regions as it overestimates et o temesgen et al 2005 trajkovic 2005 and underestimates et o in a very dry and windy regions fooladmand and haghighat 2007 popova et al 2006 therefore the hs equation underestimates et o at all stations in adrb at some stations underestimation of hs was found almost about to two times comparable to pm et o as shown in fig 3 however it was found highly correlated with pm et o estimates at most of the stations high underestimates of hs et o were found at the lower adrb where exist tropical and subtropical desert climates with high vapor pressure in contrast smaller underestimation of et o were found at the upper adrb as it advanced toward humid region and hs equation produced smaller error in humid region as in the similar study by martinez and thepadia 2010 this is probably due to the vapor pressure difference at the lower and upper reaches of adrb which directly affects hs et o estimates hargreaves and allen 2003 in comparison of et o estimates obtained from the between the uncalibrated hs equation and pm equation average rmse nse mae was found 1 84 mm day 0 27 and 0 61 mm day respectively thus it can be observed that the uncalibrated hs equation inadequately estimated the et o compared to other observations in the study region khaydar et al 2021 schieder 2011 shi et al 2007 3 3 local calibration of hargreaves samani equation coefficient the hs et o equation have been frequently used as an alternative of fao 56 pm et o to estimate crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling for arid and semiarid regions in the world elbeltagi et al 2020 2021 moeletsi et al 2013 patel et al 2014 however the calibrated hs et o equation allows more accurate approximation of universal standard fao 56 pm et o gavilán et al 2006 in this study hs et o equation and empirical coefficient c was calibrated and the modified hs equation using monthly mean data from 1984 to 1990 the validation was performed with independently estimated pm et o using monthly data during 2000 2005 the calibrated hs equation coefficient were found ranging from 0 0025 to 0 0186 due to hyper aridity conditions as reported in other similar climatic regions almorox and grieser 2016 azzam et al 2022 raziei and pereira 2013 the corrected hs coefficient was varied during different months of the year as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 however the corrected hs coefficient c corr for yearly data fig 5 was found higher about 0 0047 at the lower adrb region which is probably resulted from higher underestimation of hs et o due to very dry windy and high vapor pressure region fooladmand and haghighat 2007 popova et al 2006 while it was found about 0 0033 at upper adrb toward humid region of adrb where hs et o estimates were affected as reported previously by temesgen et al 2005 and trajkovic 2005 3 4 linear regression analysis between vapor pressure and hs eto to pm eto ratio the linear regression analysis between vapor pressure and hs to pm et o ratio provided a significant insight of hs equation associated with the vapor pressure variable the correlation between vapor pressure and hs et o to pm et o ratio was investigated for all stations of the study area significant correlation was found between vapor pressure and hs to pm eto ratio as illustrated for navoi station and khorezm station in fig 6 in the other words higher the vapor pressure results in higher relative humidity difference which directly impacts hs equation et o estimates as investigated in other similar studies hargreaves and allen 2003 heydari and heydari 2014 thus hs equation without taking vapor pressure explicitly into account leads to estimation error similarly in adrb high vapor pressure was observed at the lower adrb where tropical and subtropical desert climate predominates while low vapor pressure was found at upper adrb which represents a tundra climatic zone 3 5 modified hargreaves samani equation in different climate zones the modified hs equation was investigated at three major distinct climate zones i e arid and temperate cold and polar climate zone linear regression analysis between hs pm et o ratio and vapor pressure played a significant rule in the improvement of hs equation coefficient the derived modified hs equation for meteorological station in arid and temperate zone eq 10 is as follows 10 hs et o 0 0028 vp 0 0073 r n t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 where vp vapor pressure is introduced as a new variable for the adjustment of hs equation with pm equation as reference similarly eq 11 was derived for the meteorological stations in cold climate zone and eq 12 was obtained for the polar climate zone in adrb 11 hs et o 0 000046 vp 0 0021 r n t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 12 hs et o 0 000174 vp 0 0053 r n t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 where hs eq 2 coefficient c for each climatic zone was replaced by newly calibrated coefficient using monthly mean data tmean tmax tmin rn and vp from different meteorological stations in each climate zone of adrb from 1984 to 1990 the obtained modified hs equations were validated with independently estimated pm eto using monthly data from 2000 to 2005 at difference meteorological stations of adrb as shown in fig 6 and satisfactory results advocate the application of modified equations 3 6 validation of the modified hargreaves samani equation and the calibrated hs coefficient the estimated et o using modified hs equation coefficient in two ways compared the estimated et o obtained by the modified hs equation with the pm equation using cropwat model and ground observations khaydar et al 2021 schieder 2011 shi et al 2007 the modified equation for arid and temperate climate zone was tested for 78 different meteorological stations and the error between hs et o estimates and pm et o estimates was significantly reduced about 60 67 and 57 53 of rmse and mae respectively the average cc r2 rmse nse mae was found 0 97 0 95 0 77 mm day 0 86 0 09 mm day respectively similarly the modified hs equation for cold climate zone was tested at 22 meteorological stations rmse and mae was found reduced to 43 38 38 84 in average respectively the average cc r2 rmse nse mae was 0 94 0 89 0 77 0 80 0 09 respectively furthermore the derived equation for polar climate zone was tested at 13 meteorological stations and satisfied results were achieved average cc r2 rmse nse mae was about 0 99 0 98 0 64 0 81 0 07 respectively the reduction in rmse and mae was found at 42 20 and 37 57 respectively to illustrate the validity of the modified hs equation two aforementioned stations for each upper adrb navoi station lat 40 13 long 65 35 and khorezm station lat 41 45 long 61 03 and lower adrb stations murghab station lat 38 17 long 73 97 and lyakhsh station lat 38 32 long 71 25 showed highest correlation lowest rmse and highest nse in fig 7 according to landson classification excellent nse 0 93 and good 0 8 nse 0 93 performance nse was achieved the results reveal that the modified hs equation based on vapor pressure variables would be more appropriate to estimate et o for each climate zone in adrb central asia 4 conclusions the main objective of this research was to test the modified hs equation for each climatic zone of adrb using a new variable i e vapor pressure affecting hs et o estimates reported by hargreaves and allen the locally calibrated hs equation coefficient c were found variated widely across the climatic conditions and months ranging from 0 0025 to 0 0186 due to hyper aridity conditions in the study area the original hs equation which does not explicitly take into account for vapor pressure leads to the estimation errors of approximately 1 84 mm day 0 27 and 0 61 mm day for rmse nse and mae respectively high estimation errors were found in the regions of high vapor pressure and low wind speed while estimation errors were found to decrease as advanced to the regions of low vapor pressure and high wind speed this suggests that vapor pressure has a considerable influence on the eto estimate which was not accounted by the original hs equation the modified equations based on vapor pressure were effectively tested and validated at 78 21 13 meteorological stations in the arid and temperate cold and polar climate zone of the adrb respectively a significantly reduction of average rmse and mae was found for each climate zone i e arid and temperate 60 67 57 53 cold climate zone 43 38 38 84 and polar 42 20 and 37 57 respectively based on achieved results in the present study and reported by other similar studies the modified hs equation based on each climatic zone were found to be more accurate and comprehensive than by geographical location thus using the newly proposed variable i e vapor pressure in the modified hs equation for each climate zone is more efficient and provides a better approximation of the standard fao 56 pm equation for each climate zone of adrb in central asia therefore the modified hs equation can be used instead of fao 56 pm when there are fewer conventional variables i e temperatures solar radiation and vapor pressure which can be obtained from the alternative sources e g satellite reanalysis to yield a satisfactory estimation of eto credit

7759,study region seventeen watersheds distributed throughout china study focus climate and land use changes result in significant impacts on watershed water yields the water yield response to climate and land use changes differs due to variations in watershed geographical climatic and socioeconomic characteristics effects of watershed characteristics on water yield response remain unclear in this study the invest model is used to simultaneously assess water yields of 17 typical watersheds distributed throughout china with widely differing characteristics and specific scenario simulations are conducted to compare similarities and differences among different watersheds in the water yield response to climate and land use changes new hydrological insights for the region results show that about three quarters of the investigated watersheds are characterized by increasing water yields from 1990 to 2020 the impact of climate change on water yield is similar in these watersheds however water yield response to land use changes exhibits significant spatial differences which is affected by watershed geographical and climatic characteristics the mean annual water yield of hai river watershed with two megacities beijing and tianjin is lowest among investigated watersheds which is only 0 14 of that in the min river watershed in southeastern china this implies that the mismatch of regional socioeconomic development and water availability remains a big challenge in china and requires rational cross watershed management strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change

availability of watersheds lu et al 2013 belete et al 2020 evapotranspiration and precipitation primarily influence watershed water yield which can be defined as the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration in a watershed stednick 1996 yifru et al 2021 climate and land use both have significant effects on water yields global warming and rapid urban expansion cause a transformational effect in evapotranspiration and precipitation which may potentially lead to lower overall water yields caldwell et al 2016 pessacg 2020 hu et al 2021 liang et al 2021 quantifying the impacts of climate and land use changes on water yields is important for the conservation and rational allocation of water resources within and between regions ercan et al 2019 ndhlovu and woyessa 2020 yin et al 2020 gomes et al 2021 many studies have explored the impacts of climate and land use changes on water yields at various scales zhou et al 2015 analyzed global patterns of climate and land cover effects on hydrological cycles they found that forestation generally decreased watershed water yields and the impacts were larger in smaller watersheds within non humid regions using the regional average as an example forestation reduced the water yield by 50 in the semi arid loss plateau region in northern china and 30 in the tropical southern region of china sun et al 2006 along with changes in forestland cropland expansion and urban sprawl influence water yields kundu et al 2017 ahiablame et al 2018 land use conversion from forestland to cropland was shown to significantly increase water yields in dry areas of iran aghsaei et al 2020 urban sprawl could also increase water yields dijk et al 2012 li et al 2018 and the impact was more pronounced in regions with larger precipitation forest cover and wetland areas li et al 2020a deforestation cropland expansion and urban sprawl generally decrease vegetation area thereby contributing to the decrease of water loss via evapotranspiration besides effects of changes in vegetated area on water yields are influenced by climate zhou et al 2015 mankin et al 2019 and the contribution of climate change to water yield variations differ in different zones over the north south transect of eastern china for example water yields respond stronger to precipitation and temperature changes in humid areas compared to arid areas lu et al 2013 taylor et al 2019 in addition climate change could result in opposite effects even in the same region which resulted in a water yield decrease in 7 area of the loss plateau but an increase in 35 area of the region feng et al 2012 although land use or climate change can significantly affect water yields the magnitude and direction of change vary considerably from one watershed to another a few studies zhou et al 2015 robinet et al 2018 cavalcante et al 2019 showed that deforestation increased water yields considerably in arid regions but less so in humid regions shirmohammadi et al 2020 found that water yield showed a 22 increase as a result of 10 increase in precipitation in a watershed of iran hamel and guswa 2015 found that a 10 increase in precipitation resulted in a 30 increase in water yield at a watershed of north carolina these studies have demonstrated that watershed characteristics e g geographical and climatic characteristics influence the water yield response to climate and land use changes how water yields respond is heterogeneous in different watersheds with different and varying characteristics however few studies have analyzed similarities and differences among climate and land use change impacts on water yields within various watersheds simultaneously two potential reasons could explain this first although many studies have typically used the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest model due to its proven ability to estimate watershed water yield farley et al 2005 bai et al 2019 liang et al 2021 pathak et al 2021 the model lacks a suitable method to calculate watershed specific parameters for different watersheds second the challenge of collecting and processing data from multiple watersheds exists assessment of watershed water yield variation requires extensive data from various sources data quality should be ensured because it affects the assessment accuracy different types of data usually come in different forms and these forms should be transmuted into a uniform format that meets model requirements this study aims to assess water yield variations of typical watersheds distributed throughout china and compare similarities and differences in the water yield response to climate and land use changes following previous studies conaway and garen 2009 runoff at the watershed outlet is used to represent watershed water yield this study collects abundant data from multiple studies and public sources peng et al 2019 sharp et al 2019 hamel et al 2020 and establishes databases according to various types e g climate soil and land use the invest model is selected to assess watershed water yields li et al 2021 walston et al 2021 and an optimal method proposed by donohue et al 2012 is adopted to calculate a watershed specific parameter for each watershed water yield variations in 17 watersheds with differing characteristics are assessed and the impacts of climate and land use changes are analyzed through scenario simulations 2 methods section 2 1 introduces the invest water yield model section 2 2 describes the data demands and sources of the model section 2 3 describes statistical indicators used to evaluate the model performance and analyze the impacts of climate and land use changes on water yield section 2 4 characterizes the scenarios on climate and land use changes 2 1 invest water yield model the invest water yield model is selected to estimate water yields in 17 typical watersheds throughout china sharp et al 2019 many studies have previously used this model to estimate water yields delphin et al 2016 butsic et al 2017 pathak et al 2021 specifically the model is a free open source and widely used model used for estimating water yields kareiva et al 2011 sahle et al 2019 dou et al 2021 most input data used in this model are available through remote sensing and geographic information system gis source analysis the model obtains quantitative water yield outputs at a watershed scale the outputs can be compared with measured runoff at watershed outlets for model calibration and validation the invest model estimates annual water yields based on water balances specifically the model calculates the amount of water that runs off each pixel as precipitation subtracted by the fraction of water loss via evapotranspiration the model does not differentiate between surface subsurface and baseflow but it assumes that all pixelated water yields reach the point of interest by one of these pathways the model algorithm is as follows 1 y x 1 a e t x p x p x where y x is the annual water yield of each pixel x aet x is the annual actual evapotranspiration of pixel x and p x is the annual precipitation of pixel x the invest model correlates aet x to potential evapotranspiration pet which is inherently easier to model the approach is based on the budyko curve budyko 1974 which is later adapted by fu 1981 and zhang et al 2004 to calculate aet as shown in eq 2 2 a e t x p x 1 p e t x p x 1 p e t x p x ω 1 ω where ω is a non physical parameter that characterizes natural climatic soil properties and is defined by the expression donohue et al 2012 shown in eq 3 3 ω x z a w c x p x 1 25 where awc x is the volumetric plant available water content mm z is an empirical constant that captures local precipitation patterns and hydrogeological characteristics with typical values ranging from 1 to 30 following studies by donohue et al 2012 and redhead et al 2016 z is estimated as 0 2 n where n is the number of rain events per year potential evapotranspiration pet x is estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration et 0 and the crop coefficient k c eq 4 4 p e t x k c x e t 0 x where et 0 x is the reference evapotranspiration from pixel x determined by the modified hargreaves equation droogers and allen 2002 k c x is the plant evapotranspiration coefficient associated with land use type on pixel x k c adjusts et 0 values to the crop or vegetation type of each pixel within the land use map for a more detailed description of the model readers are referred to the invest user guide https naturalcapitalproject stanford edu software invest 2 2 data collection and preprocessing data demand can be divided into two categories one category includes land use precipitation temperature average annual reference evapotranspiration water demand and runoff data these data are collected from the past 30 years 1990 2020 5 year interval for evaluating the climate change effects the other category includes information on the root restrictive layer depth the plant available water fraction the biophysical table and the watersheds themselves because the data in the second category changes only slightly over time this study assumes that these data are constant throughout the study period thus the most recent information on these data is collected the sources and resolution of data used in this study are introduced in table 1 root restrictive layer depth data are obtained from the soil map of china based on the harmonized world soil database ver 1 1 fischer et al 2008 land use data are obtained from the resource and environment science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences annual reference evapotranspiration is calculated by using monthly average grids of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures peng et al 2019 the parameter z in eq 3 is calculated by using daily gridded precipitation data as shown in table 2 the data is obtained from a dataset provided by the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc huffman et al 2001 the water demand table is the consumptive water used for agriculture urban and rural residents and industry these water use data are obtained from chinese statistical yearbooks 1990 2020 the plant available water fraction is calculated using soil physical and chemical properties zhou et al 2005 which are also obtained from the harmonized world soil database the biophysical table contains the land use type code the descriptive name of the land use type the maximum root depth for vegetated land use classes and the plant evapotranspiration coefficient k c root depth and k c are both referenced from the invest sample table observed runoff data are obtained from hydrographic statistical yearbooks which are published by the local hydrographic office 2 3 statistic indicators 2 3 1 correlation indicators 2 3 1 1 pearson correlation coefficient r the r is used to measure the linear relationships between water yields and influencing factors sarah and watters 2008 it is calculated based on covariance and the formula for r is shown below 5 r n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 where y and x are the water yield and influencing factor n is the sample number of x or y if r is negative there is a negative correlation between two variables if r is positive there is a positive correlation an r value that is close to 1 or 1 indicates a strong relationship whereas a value near 0 indicates either a weak relationship or no correlation 2 3 1 2 coefficient of determination r 2 the r 2 is a statistical indicator used to measure how much variation of water yield is explained by the influencing factor it indicates the strength of linear relationships between water yield and influencing factors the formula for r 2 is shown below 6 r 2 1 i y ˆ i y i 2 i y y i 2 where ŷ i is the water yield y i is the influencing factor y is the average of y i and i is the number of samples r 2 0 denotes that the water yield is unable to be explained by the factor r 2 1 denotes that there exists a perfect relationship between water yield and the influencing factor 2 3 2 model evaluation indicators 2 3 2 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the nse is a normalized indicator used to measure how well the observed runoff is fitted by simulated results nash and sutcliffe 1970 it is used to describe the reliability of the water yield model the formula is shown below 7 n e s 1 i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 i 1 n o b s i o b s 2 where obs i is the observed water yield sim i is the simulated water yield and o b s is the average of observed values nse 1 reflects good simulation performance nse 0 indicates that the model simulations are close to the mean of observed data 2 3 2 2 percent bias pbias the pbias measures the difference between simulated and observed water yields it is calculated via the eq 8 8 pbias t 1 n s i m i o b s i t 1 n o b s i 100 where obs i is the observed water yield sim i is the simulated water yield and n is the number of samples the optimal pbias value is 0 0 positive pbias values indicate the model bias toward overestimation whereas negative values indicate a bias toward underestimation 2 4 climate and land use scenarios 2 4 1 climate scenarios under real world conditions both climate and land use changed from 1990 to 2020 to evaluate the impact of land use or climate change on watershed water yield the one factor at a time approach suggested by li et al 2009 is used the approach has been widely used in evaluating the effects of climate and land use changes which allows changing one factor at a time while fixing the other conditions bekele and knapp 2010 luo et al 2016 kumar et al 2022 based on the approach climate scenarios are designed in which climate conditions are different and other conditions remain the same as shown in table 3 climate data i e precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 are input into the model respectively while the land use condition remains constant and is based on data from 1990 the simulated water yield in 1990 is used as a base value the impact of climate change is assessed by the water yield difference between stimulated results under the climate scenarios and the base value through referencing published research zhang et al 2018 konapala et al 2020 karimi et al 2021 existing studies on evaluating the effect of climate change on water yield mostly focused on precipitation and temperature changes precipitation affects watershed water yield directly while temperature has a significant influence on evapotranspiration this study accounts for these factors to clarify the response of water yield to climate change this study analyzes the spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation temperature and water yield variations during 1990 2020 and assesses the effects of precipitation and temperature changes on water yield through correlation analysis then scenario simulations are conducted via the invest model to quantify the water yield response to dominant influencing factor 2 4 2 land use scenarios land is classed into 11 land use types in this study including cropland forest shrub orchard grassland water wetland residential industrial and barren areas such land use classification schemes are designed by referring to a classification system developed by the united states geological survey usgs li and liu 2019 according to research needs land use types within the level 1 and part of level 2 of the usgs classification are applied in this study agriculture area is divided into cropland and orchards including groves vineyards nurseries and ornamental horticultural areas these types of land use can bring economic benefits in addition residential and industrial areas are used as two land use types as well as grassland and shrubs there are obvious differences in water yield on these types of land due to their different vegetation characteristics following existing literature lópez moreno et al 2011 kumar et al 2022 this study adopts the one factor at a time approach to design typical land use change scenarios and analyzes the water yield response to the conversion from one land use type to another the detailed scenario creation process is as follows first land use changes that occurred frequently at all watersheds from 1990 to 2020 are identified based on the land transfer matrix second according to the typical land use changes the land use change scenario includes 8 sub scenarios forest to cropland forest to orchard wetland to cropland orchard to cropland orchard to forest barren to forest barren to grassland and barren to shrub sub scenarios it is assumed that all forests in 2005 are converted to cropland in the forest to cropland sub scenario the other sub scenarios are set up similarly 2005 is the middle year from 1990 to 2020 which can describe the mean state of land use during this 30 year period thus the land use data in 2005 is selected as the base data for the change in the sub scenarios these sub scenarios are divided into two categories one is that such land use conversion can help people protect or restore ecological environment such as orchard to forest barren to forest barren to grassland barren to shrub sub scenarios the other is that such land use conversion can bring people economic benefits such as forest to cropland forest to orchard wetland to cropland orchard to cropland sub scenarios under the sub scenarios the corresponding land use data are input into the model respectively other model inputs are kept constant annual average precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1990 to 2020 are calculated and keep them unchanged as climate background last differences in water yield for land use scenarios are calculated through using water yields from the 8 sub scenarios subtracted by the base value respectively the base water yield is calculated by inputting land use data in 2005 and climate background data into the model 3 case study to explore similarities and differences in the relationship between water yield and climate and land use 17 typical watersheds throughout china with known population economical topographical and climatic differences are selected this is done to avoid similar results caused by similarities in socioeconomic geographical and climatic characteristics second universal results based on data from typical watersheds are representative and can provide a reference for other areas with similar characteristics the following criteria are used for the selection of these typical watersheds 1 there is sufficient observed runoff data at the watershed outlet 2 watersheds are only selected from upstream areas of river systems i e there is little inflow from adjacent watersheds 3 watersheds have distinct population economic topographical and climatic conditions particularly precipitation table 4 among these typical watersheds the first criterion is selected to calibrate and validate the model the second criterion is selected to support the assumption that watersheds water yield equals the runoff at watershed outlets the third criterion is selected to ensure that these watersheds are in fact typical based on these criteria a total of 17 watershed sites are selected to use to reflect water resource conditions in areas with similar characteristics throughout china fig 1 provides the location of these 17 watersheds as well as their corresponding outlets hydrological stations 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the water yield model is calibrated and validated for each watershed using available data from 2005 to 2020 the data from 2005 2010 and 2013 are used for model calibration and data from 2015 2017 and 2020 are used for validation the nse coefficient percent bias pbias and absolute error are used to describe the reliability and accuracy of the model table 5 the absolute error nse coefficient and pbias in calibration and validation periods for these watersheds range from 4 05 104 2 46 104 m3 km2 0 66 1 0 and 12 31 28 78 respectively referring to existing studies adopting these statistical indicators to describe model error perez gutierrez and kumar 2019 measho et al 2020 yin et al 2020 the performance of the model presented in this study is generally satisfactory the simulated result of hai river watershed is 24 higher than the observed runoff data this might be caused by serious groundwater overexploitation in the watershed where the large drop of groundwater level results in an amount of surface water replenishing groundwater jiang 2009 4 2 water yield variation characteristics 4 2 1 temporal water yield trends annual water yields in 1990 1995 2000 2010 2015 and 2020 for all watersheds are compared and the mean annual change rates from 1990 to 2020 are calculated fig 2 the results of water yield change rates suggest that temporal water yield trends vary greatly by area among the 17 watersheds annual water yield increases in 12 watersheds from 1990 to 2020 the huai river and wu river watersheds present the most significant increase with an average increasing rate of 12 87 108 and 12 53 108 m3 year respectively the water yields of dongting lake han river and jialing river watersheds also show an increase with an annual change rate of 10 1 108 9 03 108 and 8 12 108 m3 year respectively annual water yields of the remaining 5 watersheds show decreasing trends the nen river watershed presents the most significant decrease in water yield from 1990 to 2020 with an average decreasing rate of 1 41 108 m3 year these results indicate that water yields increase in some areas of southeastern china and decrease in some areas of southwestern china this is consistent with previous findings reported by liu et al 2013 through analyzing precipitation temperature and water yield during 1990 2020 in different watersheds it is found that the correlation coefficient r between precipitation and water yield ranges from 0 6 to 0 98 which shows a strong correlation the variation trend of water yield is consistent with the change in precipitation in all selected watersheds fig 3 a precipitation increased significantly during the three decades in some watersheds e g wu river huai river dongting lake min river and han river and these watersheds also presented significant increases in water yield similarly water yields decreased as precipitation in some other watersheds such as hai river songhua river nen river and yu river on the other hand the correlation coefficient between water yield and temperature ranges from 0 61 0 4 in studied watersheds this reveals that the correlation between water yield and temperature is much weaker than that between water yield and precipitation as shown in fig 3 b the variation trends of temperature in watersheds differ from those of water yield temperature increased from 1990 to 2020 in all watersheds but water yield did not show similar variation characteristics during the period the results demonstrate that the impact of precipitation change on water yield is much more significant in selected watersheds of this study during the past three decades it is notable that the impact of temperature may be as significant as precipitation in some other watersheds with larger coverage of glaciers and permafrost such as the tibet plateau in china han et al 2019 li et al 2020b 4 2 2 spatial water yield patterns mean annual water yields of the investigated watersheds from 1990 to 2020 fig 4 a and water yielding capacity water yield per unit area fig 4 b are calculated among all watersheds mean annual water yields of the yeerqiang river hei river hai river and liao river watersheds are the lowest namely 2 04 108 23 53 108 62 08 108 and 106 36 108 m3 respectively these watersheds are primarily distributed throughout northern china the min tuo river watershed located in southwest china is the watershed with the highest total water yield i e 1017 72 108 m3 it is important to note that the relevance of comparing total water yields among watersheds is limited due to the different area size of watersheds based on the simulated results higher total water yield does not indicate that a watershed has a stronger water yielding capacity such as the min tuo river watershed similar results have been found in existing studies benra et al 2021 daneshi et al 2021 wang et al 2022b as shown in fig 4 b the water yielding capacity generally decreases with increasing latitude among investigated watersheds based on the correlation analysis the water yielding capacity is negatively correlated with the watershed latitude r 0 9 r 2 0 8 this is because water yield is defined as the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration in a watershed with increasing latitude precipitation decreases and evapotranspiration increases fu et al 2022 details on spatial distribution of watershed water yield are described below the watersheds with lower water yielding capacity such as the hai river nen river second songhua river and hei river watersheds are distributed throughout northern china the water yielding capacity of the hai river watershed is the lowest overall with a value of 0 16 104 m3 km2 watersheds with greater water yielding capacity such as the min river bei river and dong river watersheds are primarily distributed throughout southeastern china the min river has the highest water yielding capacity with a value of 111 68 104 m3 km2 combined with temporal trend analysis of water yields from all watersheds some watersheds are found to have poor water yielding capacities such as the nen river and second songhua river watersheds moreover their annual water yields have decreased significantly over the past decade other watersheds such as the dongting lake watershed exhibit strong water yielding capacities and their annual water yields increase significantly over the past decade these findings show that some areas in china need to conserve water owing to their poor water yielding capacities and decreases in annual total water yields conversely some other areas need to strengthen the construction of flood and water logging prevention projects owing to their high water yielding capacities and increases in total annual water yields such as those located in southern china 4 3 water yields along altitude gradients altitudes of these watersheds range from 0 to 7000 m a s l the mean water yielding capacity is calculated at each watershed using the same altitude interval 200 m change trends of the water yielding capacity with altitude is heterogeneous in all watersheds and the rates of change are also various with increase in altitude water yielding capacities of 14 investigated watersheds generally increase fig 5 a while water yielding capacities of the remaining 3 watersheds decrease the water yielding capacities change rapidly with altitude in several watersheds the water yielding capacities in min river and liao river increase by approximately 3 95 102 m3 km2 for every 1 m increase in altitude while the water yielding capacities in yu river and wu river decrease at a change rate of approximately 2 2 102 m3 km2 per meter the water yielding capacities in jialing river and min tuo river are not monotonically increasing or decreasing with the increase in altitude but first decrease and then increase differences in climate and land use are responsible for these changes in water yielding capacity with altitude precipitation is the main factor driving the changes in fig 5 b first the variation trend of water yielding capacity with altitude is similar to that of precipitation with altitude in all 17 watersheds for example the water yielding capacity and the precipitation all increase with the altitude in some watersheds such as min river bei river etc second there is a significant correlation between precipitation and water yields in 14 watersheds r 0 8 from 0 to 7000 m a s l in the remaining 3 watersheds correlation coefficients are relatively small and the change of water yielding capacity with altitude may be mainly caused by the difference in the area proportion of land use types aghsaei et al 2020 in nen river watershed fig 6 area of cropland grassland and forest varies greatly among the altitudes the decrease in cropland area and the increase in forest area is an important reason explaining the change of water yielding capacity with altitude in nen river 4 4 water yield response to climate change according to the results of correlation analysis between water yield and climatic factors precipitation and temperature introduced in section 4 2 1 the impacts of precipitation on water yields are much more significant in selected watersheds here the water yield response to precipitation change is further quantified through scenario simulations first in fig 7 we consider 17 watersheds as a whole and find that water yield variations in the watersheds significantly and positively correlated to precipitation change r 0 98 r 2 0 94 this indicates that precipitation is an important factor that affects water yields this finding is consistent with a previous study which reported that the contribution of climate change to water yield was greater than 92 hu et al 2020 second the individual response of water yield to precipitation change is analyzed for each watershed as shown in table 6 the correlation coefficients between water yield and precipitation in all watersheds are within 0 81 0 99 the significant positive correlations are similar in all watersheds i e water yields increase with precipitation this significant correlation also indicates that equivalent precipitation changes can cause similar water yield changes in different watersheds we are thus able to establish a quantitative relationship between these two factors in the different watersheds investigated fig 7 as the average annual precipitation increases or decreased by 100 mm the water yielding capacity increases or decreases by approximately 9 56 103 11 6 103 m3 km2 this relationship can be useful for water resource management and regulation for example when meteorological departments forecast precipitation trends over the upcoming years water resource management departments can correspondingly adjust reservoir storage capacities in advance i e increase the reservoir storage capacity or flood discharge according to the relationship between water yield versus precipitation 4 5 water yield response to land use change in addition to climate water yield is influenced by land use condition as shown in table 7 under the same climatic conditions water yield of different land use types varies greatly the rows in table 7 demonstrates that the water yield of the same land use type exhibits spatial heterogeneity for example cropland yields water 6 7 m3 km2 in yeerqiang river while such water yielding capacity of cropland can be up to 1229 9 103 m3 km2 in min river the difference in water yielding capacity of cropland is obvious among all the watersheds therefore we conclude that the land use types and locations of watersheds both have significant influence on watershed water yielding capacity the water yielding capacity is determined by the conditions of surface soil and vegetation of the land on the one hand the canopy coverage and roots of vegetation increase evapotranspiration soil and water retention and water infiltration along with the capacity of plants to capture the moisture arunyawat and shrestha 2016 xu et al 2020 vegetated land produces lower water yielding capacity compared with built up barren water snow areas additionally different vegetation might cause changes in water yield if the root of the vegetation is deep and developed the vegetated land may produce less water such as forest and grassland as impervious surfaces reduce the infiltration and concentration time more water can be produced by built up areas such as residential and industrial areas on the other hand climatic variables such as precipitation are spatially unevenly distributed and have a close relationship with water yield as a result water yielding capacity of the same land use type differs greatly in all watersheds for example cropland produces more water per unit area in the humid watersheds such as bei river dong river and min river but the water yielding capacity is less in the arid watersheds such as yeerqiang river and hei river in the land use change scenario the response of water yielding capacity to land use changes is spatially heterogeneous the simulation results of four sub scenarios are shown in fig 8 a and land use changes in these sub scenarios can help achieve the goal of protecting or restoring the ecological environment the water yielding capacity generally decreases in all watersheds under the four sub scenarios and the decreasing degree under the same sub scenario varies across watersheds for example in the barren to forest sub scenario the water yielding capacity decreases by 35 29 103 m3 km2 in longyangxia followed by 11 66 103 m3 km2 in hei river and 10 38 103 m3 km2 in nen river the negligible decreases in the water yielding capacity under the sub scenarios are 16 9 m3 km2 in huai river and 27 4 m3 km2 in bei river this indicates that the response of water yielding capacity to these land use changes for ecological protection differs among all watersheds and such negative impact on water yielding capacity is relatively significant in arid watersheds fig 8 b involves four sub scenarios on economic development based on the land use changes under the sub scenarios people can gain income from crops and fruits planted on the land and promote local economic development in fig 8 b it shows that the response of water yielding capacity to the land use changes under the sub scenarios is generally positive and spatially heterogeneous for example under the unchanged climate condition increases in water yielding capacity from converting forest to cropland are significant in bei river min river and dong river with values of 210 21 103 m3 km2 182 26 103 m3 km2 and 176 97 103 m3 km2 the increasing value of longyangxia and hei river is relatively small which is 8 27 102 m3 km2 and 8 60 102 m3 km2 respectively this implies that under the same climatic e g temperature and precipitation and soil conditions replacing forest with cropland has a potential to increase water yielding capacity this finding is consistent with previous literature stating that the high evapotranspiration in forests typically decreases watershed water yield owuor et al 2016 kurzweil et al 2021 in real world condition the situation of land changes is diverse and complex for example as set in the sub scenarios some land use changes increase the water yielding capacity while the others decrease it sustainable development requires both the protection of ecological environment and the development of social economy this means land use changes may both have positive and negative impact on water yielding capacity the final change in water yielding capacity is a comprehensive response to the overall land use changes therefore rational land use planning strategies should be taken to achieve the win win goal of ecological and economic development while keeping the water yielding capacity in a relatively balanced state 4 6 invest model limitations the invest model is used in this study to calculate water yields from 17 typical watersheds throughout china observational data is used to validate simulated results errors between observed and simulated water yields are within an acceptable range although results are validated and the accuracy of input data is carefully considered uncertainties and limitations of the model itself exist first the model assumes that all pixelated water yields have a point of interest while the model does not distinguish between surface and subsurface water this lack of discrimination may result in overestimation of water yields against observed surface runoff data in watersheds experiencing groundwater overexploitation e g the hai river watershed presented in this study second the model assumes that water consumption from agriculture industry and urban sectors are distributed equally to each pixel in their corresponding land use type cropland industrial and residential however due to differences in socioeconomic development water consumption levels of agriculture industry and urban sectors vary among areas this variability will lead to a slight water yield overestimation in areas with dense populations and areas undergoing extensive agricultural and industrial development additionally this study adopts an annual scale model which is unable to reflect the sub annual e g seasonal monthly or daily patterns of water yield variation annual scale models have been widely used in evaluation of the effects of climate and land use changes zhou et al 2015 daneshi et al 2021 which are also helpful in directing decision making on land use adjustment and cross watersheds water transfer projects gong et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 however sub annual modelling is needed for directing intra annual water resources management which requires more data last the invest model is essentially a black box model which hinders the analysis of error sources within the model further improvements to the invest model are worthy of efforts nevertheless these limitations do not conspicuously affect the conclusions of this study 5 conclusions this study reveals variable water yield characteristics of 17 watersheds in china and finds that the changes in water yield with time and space differ significantly among watersheds about three quarters of the investigated watersheds are characterized by an increasing trend in water yield from 1990 to 2020 it is found that the correlation between water yield and precipitation is much stronger than that between water yield and temperature meanwhile the spatio temporal variation trends of water yield can be well explained by precipitation which demonstrates that precipitation is the dominant climatic factor affecting water yield in these watersheds the influence of precipitation is similar in all watersheds i e a 100 mm increase or decrease in annual precipitation causes an increase or decrease in the water yielding capacity of approximately 10 0 103 m3 km2 besides the water yielding capacity generally decreases with increasing latitude and altitude the impacts of land use changes on water yields differ because the water yielding capacity of a specific land use type varies among watersheds with various geographical and climatic characteristics for watersheds in arid area replacing barren by forest and grassland leads to a significant decrease in water yielding capacity for watersheds in humid area replacing forest by cropland causes an obvious increase in water yielding capacity the water yield model developed in this study and the research results can offer a decision making platform and implications for future water resources management and water security guarantee the relationship between water yield and precipitation found in this study will help to predict water yield variation under climate change to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources various land use plans and water conservation policies are needed in these watersheds the simulated water yield can be combined with the water shortage indicator determined by water supply and consumption which helps to assess and classify water security of different watersheds this will be useful for directing decision making on land use plans water conservation policies and cross watershed water transfer projects in addition the simulated water yield of cropland can be used as a constraint in crop planting structure adjustment through considering multiple factors including available water crop types crop prices available planting area and irrigation water use efficiency optimization models can be further developed in the future to optimize agricultural crop planning and obtain higher economic benefits

7759,study region seventeen watersheds distributed throughout china study focus climate and land use changes result in significant impacts on watershed water yields the water yield response to climate and land use changes differs due to variations in watershed geographical climatic and socioeconomic characteristics effects of watershed characteristics on water yield response remain unclear in this study the invest model is used to simultaneously assess water yields of 17 typical watersheds distributed throughout china with widely differing characteristics and specific scenario simulations are conducted to compare similarities and differences among different watersheds in the water yield response to climate and land use changes new hydrological insights for the region results show that about three quarters of the investigated watersheds are characterized by increasing water yields from 1990 to 2020 the impact of climate change on water yield is similar in these watersheds however water yield response to land use changes exhibits significant spatial differences which is affected by watershed geographical and climatic characteristics the mean annual water yield of hai river watershed with two megacities beijing and tianjin is lowest among investigated watersheds which is only 0 14 of that in the min river watershed in southeastern china this implies that the mismatch of regional socioeconomic development and water availability remains a big challenge in china and requires rational cross watershed management strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change

and evapotranspiration in a watershed stednick 1996 yifru et al 2021 climate and land use both have significant effects on water yields global warming and rapid urban expansion cause a transformational effect in evapotranspiration and precipitation which may potentially lead to lower overall water yields caldwell et al 2016 pessacg 2020 hu et al 2021 liang et al 2021 quantifying the impacts of climate and land use changes on water yields is important for the conservation and rational allocation of water resources within and between regions ercan et al 2019 ndhlovu and woyessa 2020 yin et al 2020 gomes et al 2021 many studies have explored the impacts of climate and land use changes on water yields at various scales zhou et al 2015 analyzed global patterns of climate and land cover effects on hydrological cycles they found that forestation generally decreased watershed water yields and the impacts were larger in smaller watersheds within non humid regions using the regional average as an example forestation reduced the water yield by 50 in the semi arid loss plateau region in northern china and 30 in the tropical southern region of china sun et al 2006 along with changes in forestland cropland expansion and urban sprawl influence water yields kundu et al 2017 ahiablame et al 2018 land use conversion from forestland to cropland was shown to significantly increase water yields in dry areas of iran aghsaei et al 2020 urban sprawl could also increase water yields dijk et al 2012 li et al 2018 and the impact was more pronounced in regions with larger precipitation forest cover and wetland areas li et al 2020a deforestation cropland expansion and urban sprawl generally decrease vegetation area thereby contributing to the decrease of water loss via evapotranspiration besides effects of changes in vegetated area on water yields are influenced by climate zhou et al 2015 mankin et al 2019 and the contribution of climate change to water yield variations differ in different zones over the north south transect of eastern china for example water yields respond stronger to precipitation and temperature changes in humid areas compared to arid areas lu et al 2013 taylor et al 2019 in addition climate change could result in opposite effects even in the same region which resulted in a water yield decrease in 7 area of the loss plateau but an increase in 35 area of the region feng et al 2012 although land use or climate change can significantly affect water yields the magnitude and direction of change vary considerably from one watershed to another a few studies zhou et al 2015 robinet et al 2018 cavalcante et al 2019 showed that deforestation increased water yields considerably in arid regions but less so in humid regions shirmohammadi et al 2020 found that water yield showed a 22 increase as a result of 10 increase in precipitation in a watershed of iran hamel and guswa 2015 found that a 10 increase in precipitation resulted in a 30 increase in water yield at a watershed of north carolina these studies have demonstrated that watershed characteristics e g geographical and climatic characteristics influence the water yield response to climate and land use changes how water yields respond is heterogeneous in different watersheds with different and varying characteristics however few studies have analyzed similarities and differences among climate and land use change impacts on water yields within various watersheds simultaneously two potential reasons could explain this first although many studies have typically used the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest model due to its proven ability to estimate watershed water yield farley et al 2005 bai et al 2019 liang et al 2021 pathak et al 2021 the model lacks a suitable method to calculate watershed specific parameters for different watersheds second the challenge of collecting and processing data from multiple watersheds exists assessment of watershed water yield variation requires extensive data from various sources data quality should be ensured because it affects the assessment accuracy different types of data usually come in different forms and these forms should be transmuted into a uniform format that meets model requirements this study aims to assess water yield variations of typical watersheds distributed throughout china and compare similarities and differences in the water yield response to climate and land use changes following previous studies conaway and garen 2009 runoff at the watershed outlet is used to represent watershed water yield this study collects abundant data from multiple studies and public sources peng et al 2019 sharp et al 2019 hamel et al 2020 and establishes databases according to various types e g climate soil and land use the invest model is selected to assess watershed water yields li et al 2021 walston et al 2021 and an optimal method proposed by donohue et al 2012 is adopted to calculate a watershed specific parameter for each watershed water yield variations in 17 watersheds with differing characteristics are assessed and the impacts of climate and land use changes are analyzed through scenario simulations 2 methods section 2 1 introduces the invest water yield model section 2 2 describes the data demands and sources of the model section 2 3 describes statistical indicators used to evaluate the model performance and analyze the impacts of climate and land use changes on water yield section 2 4 characterizes the scenarios on climate and land use changes 2 1 invest water yield model the invest water yield model is selected to estimate water yields in 17 typical watersheds throughout china sharp et al 2019 many studies have previously used this model to estimate water yields delphin et al 2016 butsic et al 2017 pathak et al 2021 specifically the model is a free open source and widely used model used for estimating water yields kareiva et al 2011 sahle et al 2019 dou et al 2021 most input data used in this model are available through remote sensing and geographic information system gis source analysis the model obtains quantitative water yield outputs at a watershed scale the outputs can be compared with measured runoff at watershed outlets for model calibration and validation the invest model estimates annual water yields based on water balances specifically the model calculates the amount of water that runs off each pixel as precipitation subtracted by the fraction of water loss via evapotranspiration the model does not differentiate between surface subsurface and baseflow but it assumes that all pixelated water yields reach the point of interest by one of these pathways the model algorithm is as follows 1 y x 1 a e t x p x p x where y x is the annual water yield of each pixel x aet x is the annual actual evapotranspiration of pixel x and p x is the annual precipitation of pixel x the invest model correlates aet x to potential evapotranspiration pet which is inherently easier to model the approach is based on the budyko curve budyko 1974 which is later adapted by fu 1981 and zhang et al 2004 to calculate aet as shown in eq 2 2 a e t x p x 1 p e t x p x 1 p e t x p x ω 1 ω where ω is a non physical parameter that characterizes natural climatic soil properties and is defined by the expression donohue et al 2012 shown in eq 3 3 ω x z a w c x p x 1 25 where awc x is the volumetric plant available water content mm z is an empirical constant that captures local precipitation patterns and hydrogeological characteristics with typical values ranging from 1 to 30 following studies by donohue et al 2012 and redhead et al 2016 z is estimated as 0 2 n where n is the number of rain events per year potential evapotranspiration pet x is estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration et 0 and the crop coefficient k c eq 4 4 p e t x k c x e t 0 x where et 0 x is the reference evapotranspiration from pixel x determined by the modified hargreaves equation droogers and allen 2002 k c x is the plant evapotranspiration coefficient associated with land use type on pixel x k c adjusts et 0 values to the crop or vegetation type of each pixel within the land use map for a more detailed description of the model readers are referred to the invest user guide https naturalcapitalproject stanford edu software invest 2 2 data collection and preprocessing data demand can be divided into two categories one category includes land use precipitation temperature average annual reference evapotranspiration water demand and runoff data these data are collected from the past 30 years 1990 2020 5 year interval for evaluating the climate change effects the other category includes information on the root restrictive layer depth the plant available water fraction the biophysical table and the watersheds themselves because the data in the second category changes only slightly over time this study assumes that these data are constant throughout the study period thus the most recent information on these data is collected the sources and

relationships between water yields and influencing factors sarah and watters 2008 it is calculated based on covariance and the formula for r is shown below 5 r n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 where y and x are the water yield and influencing factor n is the sample number of x or y if r is negative there is a negative correlation between two variables if r is positive there is a positive correlation an r value that is close to 1 or 1 indicates a strong relationship whereas a value near 0 indicates either a weak relationship or no correlation 2 3 1 2 coefficient of determination r 2

indicate a bias toward underestimation 2 4 climate and land use scenarios 2 4 1 climate scenarios under real world conditions both climate and land use changed from 1990 to 2020 to evaluate the impact of land use or climate change on watershed water yield the one factor at a time approach suggested by li et al 2009 is used the approach has been widely used in evaluating the effects of climate and land use changes which allows changing one factor at a time while fixing the other conditions bekele and knapp 2010 luo et al 2016 kumar et al 2022 based on the approach climate scenarios are designed in which climate conditions are different and other conditions remain the same as shown in table 3 climate data i e precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 are input into the model respectively while the land use condition remains constant and is based on data from 1990 the simulated water yield in 1990 is used as a base value the impact of climate change is assessed by the water yield difference between stimulated results under the climate scenarios and the base value through referencing published research zhang et al 2018 konapala et al 2020 karimi et al 2021 existing studies on evaluating the effect of climate change on water yield mostly focused on precipitation and temperature changes precipitation affects watershed water yield directly while temperature has a significant influence on evapotranspiration this study accounts for these factors to clarify the response of water yield to climate change this study analyzes the spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation temperature and water yield variations during 1990 2020 and assesses the effects of precipitation and temperature changes on water yield through correlation analysis then scenario simulations are conducted via the invest model to quantify the water yield response to dominant influencing factor 2 4 2 land use scenarios land is classed into 11 land use types in this study including cropland forest shrub orchard grassland water wetland residential industrial and barren areas such land use classification schemes are designed by referring to a classification system developed by the united states geological survey usgs li and liu 2019 according to research needs land use types within the level 1 and part of level 2 of the usgs classification are applied in this study agriculture area is divided into cropland and orchards including groves vineyards nurseries and ornamental horticultural areas these types of land use can bring economic benefits in addition residential and industrial areas are used as two land use types as well as grassland and shrubs there are obvious differences in water yield on these types of land due to their different vegetation characteristics following existing literature lópez moreno et al 2011 kumar et al 2022 this study adopts the one factor at a time approach to design typical land use change scenarios and analyzes the water yield response to the conversion from one land use type to another the detailed scenario creation process is as follows first land use changes that occurred frequently at all watersheds from 1990 to 2020 are identified based on the land transfer matrix second according to the typical land use changes the land use change scenario includes 8 sub scenarios forest to cropland forest to orchard wetland to cropland orchard to cropland orchard to forest barren to forest barren to grassland and barren to shrub sub scenarios it is assumed that all forests in 2005 are converted to cropland in the forest to cropland sub scenario the other sub scenarios are set up similarly 2005 is the middle year from 1990 to 2020 which can describe the mean state of land use during this 30 year period thus the land use data in 2005 is selected as the base data for the change in the sub scenarios these sub scenarios are divided into two categories one is that such land use conversion can help people protect or restore ecological environment such as orchard to forest barren to forest barren to grassland barren to shrub sub scenarios the other is that such land use conversion can bring people economic benefits such as forest to cropland forest to orchard wetland to cropland orchard to cropland sub scenarios under the sub scenarios the corresponding land use data are input into the model respectively other model inputs are kept constant annual average precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1990 to 2020 are calculated and keep them unchanged as climate background last differences in water yield for land use scenarios are calculated through using water yields from the 8 sub scenarios subtracted by the base value respectively the base water yield is calculated by inputting land use data in 2005 and climate background data into the model 3 case study to explore similarities and differences in the relationship between water yield and climate and land use 17 typical watersheds throughout china with known population economical topographical and climatic differences are selected this is done to avoid similar results caused by similarities in socioeconomic geographical and climatic characteristics second universal results based on data from typical watersheds are representative and can provide a reference for other areas with similar characteristics the following criteria are used for the selection of these typical watersheds 1 there is sufficient observed runoff data at the watershed outlet 2 watersheds are only selected from upstream areas of river systems i e there is little inflow from adjacent watersheds 3 watersheds have distinct population economic topographical and climatic conditions particularly precipitation table 4 among these typical watersheds the first criterion is selected to calibrate and validate the model the second criterion is selected to support the assumption that watersheds water yield equals the runoff at watershed outlets the third criterion is selected to ensure that these watersheds are in fact typical based on these criteria a total of 17 watershed sites are selected to use to reflect water resource conditions in areas with similar characteristics throughout china fig 1 provides the location of these 17 watersheds as well as their corresponding outlets hydrological stations 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the water yield model is calibrated and validated for each watershed using available data from 2005 to 2020 the data from 2005 2010 and 2013 are used for model calibration and data from 2015 2017 and 2020 are used for validation the nse coefficient percent bias pbias and absolute error are used to describe the reliability and accuracy of the model table 5 the absolute error nse coefficient and pbias in calibration and validation periods for these watersheds range from 4 05 104 2 46 104 m3 km2 0 66 1 0 and 12 31 28 78 respectively referring to existing studies adopting these statistical indicators to describe model error perez gutierrez and kumar 2019 measho et al 2020 yin et al 2020 the performance of the model presented in this study is generally satisfactory the simulated result of hai river watershed is 24 higher than the observed runoff data this might be caused by serious groundwater overexploitation in the watershed where the large drop of groundwater level results in an amount of surface water replenishing groundwater jiang 2009 4 2 water yield variation characteristics 4 2 1 temporal water yield trends annual water yields in 1990 1995 2000 2010 2015 and 2020 for all watersheds are compared and the mean annual change rates from 1990 to 2020 are calculated fig 2 the results of water yield change rates suggest that temporal water yield trends vary greatly by area among the 17 watersheds annual water yield increases in 12 watersheds from 1990 to 2020 the huai river and wu river watersheds present the most significant increase with an average increasing rate of 12 87 108 and 12 53 108 m3 year respectively the water yields of dongting lake han river and jialing river watersheds also show an increase with an annual change rate of 10 1 108 9 03 108 and 8 12 108 m3 year respectively annual water yields of the remaining 5 watersheds show decreasing trends the nen river watershed presents the most significant decrease in water yield from 1990 to 2020 with an average decreasing rate of 1 41 108 m3 year these results indicate that water yields increase in some areas of southeastern china and decrease in some areas of southwestern china this is consistent with previous findings reported by liu et al 2013 through analyzing precipitation temperature and water yield during 1990 2020 in different watersheds it is found that the correlation coefficient r between precipitation and water yield ranges from 0 6 to 0 98 which shows a strong correlation the variation trend of water yield is consistent with the change in precipitation in all selected watersheds fig 3 a precipitation increased significantly during the three decades in some watersheds e g wu river huai river dongting lake min river and han river and these watersheds also presented significant increases in water yield similarly water yields decreased as precipitation in some other watersheds such as hai river songhua river nen river and yu river on the other hand the correlation coefficient between water yield and temperature ranges from 0 61 0 4 in studied watersheds this reveals that the correlation between water yield and temperature is much weaker than that between water yield and precipitation as shown in fig 3 b the variation trends of temperature in watersheds differ from those of water yield temperature increased from 1990 to 2020 in all watersheds but water yield did not show similar variation characteristics during the period the results demonstrate that the impact of precipitation change on water yield is much more significant in selected watersheds of this study during the past three decades it is notable that the impact of temperature may be as significant as precipitation in some other watersheds with larger coverage of glaciers and permafrost such as the tibet plateau in china han et al 2019 li et al 2020b 4 2 2 spatial water yield patterns mean annual water yields of the investigated watersheds from 1990 to 2020 fig 4 a and water yielding capacity water yield per unit area fig 4 b are calculated among all watersheds mean annual water yields of the yeerqiang river hei river hai river and liao river watersheds are the lowest namely 2 04 108 23 53 108 62 08 108 and 106 36 108 m3 respectively these watersheds are primarily distributed throughout northern china the min tuo river watershed located in southwest china is the watershed with the highest total water yield i e 1017 72 108 m3 it is important to note that the relevance of comparing total water yields among watersheds is limited due to the different area size of watersheds based on the simulated results higher total water yield does not indicate that a watershed has a stronger water yielding capacity such as the min tuo river watershed similar results have been found in existing studies benra et al 2021 daneshi et al 2021 wang et al 2022b as shown in fig 4 b the water yielding capacity generally decreases with increasing latitude among investigated watersheds based on the correlation analysis the water yielding capacity is negatively correlated with the watershed latitude r 0 9 r 2 0 8 this is because water yield is defined as the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration in a watershed with increasing latitude precipitation decreases and evapotranspiration increases fu et al 2022 details on spatial distribution of watershed water yield are described below the watersheds with lower water yielding capacity such as the hai river nen river second songhua river and hei river watersheds are distributed throughout northern china the water yielding capacity of the hai river watershed is the lowest overall with a value of 0 16 104 m3 km2 watersheds with greater water yielding capacity such as the min river bei river and dong river watersheds are primarily distributed throughout southeastern china the min river has the highest water yielding capacity with a value of 111 68 104 m3 km2 combined with temporal trend analysis of water yields from all watersheds some watersheds are found to have poor water yielding capacities such as the nen river and second songhua river watersheds moreover their annual water yields have decreased significantly over the past decade other watersheds such as the dongting lake watershed exhibit strong water yielding capacities and their annual water yields increase significantly over the past decade these findings show that some areas in china need to conserve water owing to their poor water yielding capacities and decreases in annual total water yields conversely some other areas need to strengthen the construction of flood and water logging prevention projects owing to their high water yielding capacities and increases in total annual water yields such as those located in southern china 4 3 water yields along altitude gradients altitudes of these watersheds range from 0 to 7000 m a s l the mean water yielding capacity is calculated at each watershed using the same altitude interval 200 m change trends of the water yielding capacity with altitude is heterogeneous in all watersheds and the rates of change are also various with increase in altitude water yielding capacities of 14 investigated watersheds generally increase fig 5 a while water yielding capacities of the remaining 3 watersheds decrease the water yielding capacities change rapidly with altitude in several watersheds the water yielding capacities in min river and liao river increase by approximately 3 95 102 m3 km2 for every 1 m increase in altitude while the water yielding capacities in yu river and wu river decrease at a change rate of approximately 2 2 102 m3 km2 per meter the water yielding capacities in jialing river and min tuo river are not monotonically increasing or decreasing with the increase in altitude but first decrease and then increase differences in climate and land use are responsible for these changes in water yielding capacity with altitude precipitation is the main factor driving the changes in fig 5 b first the variation trend of water yielding capacity with altitude is similar to that of precipitation with altitude in all 17 watersheds for example the water yielding capacity and the precipitation all increase with the altitude in some watersheds such as min river bei river etc second there is a significant correlation between precipitation and water yields in 14 watersheds r 0 8 from 0 to 7000 m a s l in the remaining 3 watersheds correlation coefficients are relatively small and the change of water yielding capacity with altitude may be mainly caused by the difference in the area proportion of land use types aghsaei et al 2020 in nen river watershed fig 6 area of cropland grassland and forest varies greatly among the altitudes the decrease in cropland area and the increase in forest area is an important reason explaining the change of water yielding capacity with altitude in nen river 4 4 water yield response to climate change according to the results of correlation analysis between water yield and climatic factors precipitation and temperature introduced in section 4 2 1 the impacts of precipitation on water yields are much more significant in selected watersheds here the water yield response to precipitation change is further quantified through scenario simulations first in fig 7 we consider 17 watersheds as a whole and find that water yield variations in the watersheds significantly and positively correlated to precipitation change r 0 98 r 2 0 94 this indicates that precipitation is an important factor that affects water yields this finding is consistent with a previous study which reported that the contribution of climate change to water yield was greater than 92 hu et al 2020 second the individual response of water yield to precipitation change is analyzed for each watershed as shown in table 6 the correlation coefficients between water yield and precipitation in all watersheds are within 0 81 0 99 the significant positive correlations are similar in all watersheds i e water yields increase with precipitation this significant correlation also indicates that equivalent precipitation changes can cause similar water yield changes in different watersheds we are thus able to establish a quantitative relationship between these two factors in the different watersheds investigated fig 7 as the average annual precipitation increases or decreased by 100 mm the water yielding capacity increases or decreases by approximately 9 56 103 11 6 103 m3 km2 this relationship can be useful for water resource management and regulation for example when meteorological departments forecast precipitation trends over the upcoming years water resource management departments can correspondingly adjust reservoir storage capacities in advance i e increase the reservoir storage capacity or flood discharge according to the relationship between water yield versus precipitation 4 5 water yield response to land use change in addition to climate water yield is influenced by land use condition as shown in table 7 under the same climatic conditions water yield of different land use types varies greatly the rows in table 7 demonstrates that the water yield of the same land use type exhibits spatial heterogeneity for example cropland yields water 6 7 m3 km2 in yeerqiang river while such water yielding capacity of cropland can be up to 1229 9 103 m3 km2 in min river the difference in water yielding capacity of cropland is obvious among all the watersheds therefore we conclude that the land use types and locations of watersheds both have significant influence on watershed water yielding capacity the water yielding capacity is determined by the conditions of surface soil and vegetation of the land on the one hand the canopy coverage and roots of vegetation increase evapotranspiration soil and water retention and water infiltration along with the capacity of plants to capture the moisture arunyawat and shrestha 2016 xu et al 2020 vegetated land produces lower water yielding capacity compared with built up barren water snow areas additionally different vegetation might cause changes in water yield if the root of the vegetation is deep and developed the vegetated land may produce less water such as forest and grassland as impervious surfaces reduce the infiltration and concentration time more water can be produced by built up areas such as residential and industrial areas on the other hand climatic variables such as precipitation are spatially unevenly distributed and have a close relationship with water yield as a result water yielding capacity of the same land use type differs greatly in all watersheds for example cropland produces more water per unit area in the humid watersheds such as bei river dong river and min river but the water yielding capacity is less in the arid watersheds such as yeerqiang river and hei river in the land use change scenario the response of water yielding capacity to land use changes is spatially heterogeneous the simulation results of four sub scenarios are shown in fig 8 a and land use changes in these sub scenarios can help achieve the goal of protecting or restoring the ecological environment the water yielding capacity generally decreases in all watersheds under the four sub scenarios and the decreasing degree under the same sub scenario varies across watersheds for example in the barren to forest sub scenario the water yielding capacity decreases by 35 29 103 m3 km2 in longyangxia followed by 11 66 103 m3 km2 in hei river and 10 38 103 m3 km2 in nen river the negligible decreases in the water yielding capacity under the sub scenarios are 16 9 m3 km2 in huai river and 27 4 m3 km2 in bei river this indicates that the response of water yielding capacity to these land use changes for ecological protection differs among all watersheds and such negative impact on water yielding capacity is relatively significant in arid watersheds fig 8 b involves four sub scenarios on economic development based on the land use changes under the sub scenarios people can gain income from crops and fruits planted on the land and promote local economic development in fig 8 b it shows that the response of water yielding capacity to the land use changes under the sub scenarios is generally positive and spatially heterogeneous for example under the unchanged climate condition increases in water yielding capacity from converting forest to cropland are significant in bei river min river and dong river with values of 210 21 103 m3 km2 182 26 103 m3 km2 and 176 97 103 m3 km2 the increasing value of longyangxia and hei river is relatively small which is 8 27 102 m3 km2 and 8 60 102 m3 km2 respectively this implies that under the same climatic e g temperature and precipitation and soil conditions replacing forest with cropland has a potential to increase water yielding capacity this finding is consistent with previous literature stating that the high evapotranspiration in forests typically decreases watershed water yield owuor et al 2016 kurzweil et al 2021 in real world condition the situation of land changes is diverse and complex for example as set in the sub scenarios some land use changes increase the water yielding capacity while the others decrease it sustainable development requires both the protection of ecological environment and the development of social economy this means land use changes may both have positive and negative impact on water yielding capacity the final change in water yielding capacity is a comprehensive response to the overall land use changes therefore rational land use planning strategies should be taken to achieve the win win goal of ecological and economic development while keeping the water yielding capacity in a relatively balanced state 4 6 invest model limitations the invest model is used in this study to calculate water yields from 17 typical watersheds throughout china observational data is used to validate simulated results errors between observed and simulated water yields are within an acceptable range although results are validated and the accuracy of input data is carefully considered uncertainties and limitations of the model itself exist first the model assumes that all pixelated water yields have a point of interest while the model does not distinguish between surface and subsurface water this lack of discrimination may result in overestimation of water yields against observed surface runoff data in watersheds experiencing groundwater overexploitation e g the hai river watershed presented in this study second the model assumes that water consumption from agriculture industry and urban sectors are distributed equally to each pixel in their corresponding land use type cropland industrial and residential however due to differences in socioeconomic development water consumption levels of agriculture industry and urban sectors vary among areas this variability will lead to a slight water yield overestimation in areas with dense populations and areas undergoing extensive agricultural and industrial development additionally this study adopts an annual scale model which is unable to reflect the sub annual e g seasonal monthly or daily patterns of water yield variation annual scale models have been widely used in evaluation of the effects of climate and land use changes zhou et al 2015 daneshi et al 2021 which are also helpful in directing decision making on land use adjustment and cross watersheds water transfer projects gong et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 however sub annual modelling is needed for directing intra annual water resources management which requires more data last the invest model is essentially a black box model which hinders the analysis of error sources within the model further improvements to the invest model are worthy of efforts nevertheless these limitations do not conspicuously affect the conclusions of this study 5 conclusions this study reveals variable water yield characteristics of 17 watersheds in china and finds that the changes in water yield with time and space differ significantly among watersheds about three quarters of the investigated watersheds are characterized by an increasing trend in water yield from 1990 to 2020 it is found that the correlation between water yield and precipitation is much stronger than that between water yield and temperature meanwhile the spatio temporal variation trends of water yield can be well explained by precipitation which demonstrates that precipitation is the dominant climatic factor affecting water yield in these watersheds the influence of precipitation is similar in all watersheds i e a 100 mm increase or decrease in annual precipitation causes an increase or decrease in the water yielding capacity of approximately 10 0 103 m3 km2 besides the water yielding capacity generally decreases with increasing latitude and altitude the impacts of land use changes on water yields differ because the water yielding capacity of a specific land use type varies among watersheds with various geographical and climatic characteristics for watersheds in arid area replacing barren by forest and grassland leads to a significant decrease in water yielding capacity for watersheds in humid area replacing forest by cropland causes an obvious increase in water yielding capacity the water yield model developed in this study and the research results can offer a decision making platform and implications for future water resources management and water security guarantee the relationship between water yield and precipitation found in this study will help to predict water yield variation under climate change to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources various land use plans and water conservation policies are needed in these watersheds the simulated water yield can be combined with the water shortage indicator determined by water supply and consumption which helps to assess and classify water security of different watersheds this will be useful for directing decision making on land use plans water conservation policies and cross watershed water transfer projects in addition the simulated water yield of cropland can be used as a constraint in crop planting structure adjustment through considering multiple factors including available water crop types crop prices available planting area and irrigation water use efficiency optimization models can be further developed in the future to optimize agricultural crop planning and obtain higher economic benefits
