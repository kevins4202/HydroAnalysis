2310,peatland vegetation requires water logged conditions for peat forming plant communities to survive changes in water regimes have been found to alter the soil environment and cause shifts in species composition occasionally the spatial and chronological constraints in water table monitoring impede the correct evaluation of the status of these sensitive ecohydrological systems therefore it is important to combine in situ and remote sensing methods to assess ecohydrological diversity over large areas of threatened peatland ecosystems the present study assessed the relationship between hydrological indicators the in situ water table fluctuations of 57 measurement wells and five study plots in the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons botanical indicators in situ species composition in three raised bog habitat types namely bog woodland a semi open raised bog and an open raised bog and spectral indices ndvi normalised difference vegetation index and ndwi normalised difference water index 2015 2020 sentinel 2 for the evaluation of heterogeneous raised bog spatial patterns and temporal change there were statistically significant relationships between vegetation and water table depth in different raised bog habitat types deeper water tables prevailed in woodland habitats trees green mosses rhododendron tomentosum and vice versa in areas where open raised bog plants sphagnum occupied the surface moderate relationships r 0 4 p 05 were detected between some of the botanical and hydrological indicators and spectral indices the application of high resolution remote sensing data may be useful for raised bog measurements and changes in vegetation cover and related spectral indices may become hydroclimatic indicators keywords peatland hydrology raised bog habitat ndvi ndwi čepkeliai raised bog data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction raised bogs are distinctive ecohydrological systems that contribute towards various habitats the major driving force behind these habitats is the hydrological cycle which is reflected in the condition and composition of raised bog vegetation xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 vegetation itself influences the surrounding environment as well as the hydrological regime water storage and vegetation are inextricably linked as raised bogs require water logged conditions for peat forming plant communities to survive mackin et al 2015 neefjes 1989 large areas of peatlands are threatened by climate change and human activities bhaga et al 2020 novoa et al 2020 xie et al 2017 agriculture forestry and peat extraction exert tremendous pressure on the hydrological functioning of northern peatlands including changes in water table depth d acunha et al 2018 middleton et al 2012 these changes may be triggering the release of greenhouse gases and degrading vulnerable open raised bog habitats european commission 2013 several studies dyderski et al 2015 edvardsson et al 2015 frelechoux et al 2003 šimanauskienė et al 2019 smiljanić et al 2014 have noted that european peatland complexes including those in pristine condition are affected by the encroachment of woody vegetation this has prompted a debate on how climate change is impacting vulnerable ecosystems taminskas et al 2018 for instance it has been suggested that conservation and management require continuous hydrological monitoring bonn et al 2016 because traditional hydrological surveys which provide accurate results närhi et al 2010 are less than effective in measuring the spatial extent of large peatland areas over time pullens et al 2018 querner et al 2010 talbot et al 2010 whitfield et al 2009 cost effective remote sensing technology can be used to assess ecohydrological diversity over large areas of threatened peatland ecosystems consequently it has become one of the most popular tools in wetland research during the past few decades czapiewski and szumińska 2022 mahdavi et al 2019 pettorelli et al 2017 changes in vegetation allow for the evaluation of changes in peatland hydrological conditions and vice versa segah et al 2010 previous remote sensing applications have been used for the detection of hydrology and vegetation

moisture monitoring bechtold et al 2020 torbick et al 2012 and the estimation of water content in plants lees et al 2020 they have been widely discussed in the context of different climatic regions from the tropical miettinen et al 2012 to the subarctic and boreal bourgeau chavez et al 2017 neta et al 2010 torabi haghighi et al 2018 meanwhile researchers have called for satellite imagery based studies of water table depth monitoring in a range of peatland habitats chasmer et al 2020a 2020b räsänen et al 2022 spectral detection of near surface moisture content and water table positions along with their relationship to peat forming vegetation e g sphagnum spp in northern peatland ecosystems has been the focus of a number of studies bubier et al 1997 harris 2008 letendre et al 2008 meingast et al 2014 as has satellite based peatland forest cover analyses meneses tovar 2011 pflugmacher et al 2007 have argued that peatland pines were proxies for water table levels recent investigations into the relationship between water table depth and tree density e g spruce and pine mires as well as open mire habitats have confirmed that it is possible to track water table changes using vegetation indices as predictors räsänen et al 2022 however there is still a gap in the literature on the subject of transitional semi open raised bog habitats that are highly dependent on water table depth and extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in moisture moreover tree habitats are usually characterised by stable vegetation cover and spectral values taminskas et al 2020 whereas phenological changes in semi open raised bog habitat vegetation are expected to show prevailing trends in water table fluctuations as well as overall raised bog evolution spectral indices ndvi ndwi etc based on shortwave infrared swir and near infrared nir optical bands are reported to have had variable success in monitoring peatland water table depth for various mire types räsänen et al 2022 spectral indices retrieved from high resolution optical images sentinel 2 could serve as useful proxies for plant health and photosynthesis ndvi as well as for moisture content in raised bog surfaces ndwi bhatnagar et al 2020 lees et al 2020 many studies have shown the effectiveness of these indices in wetlands ashok et al 2021 lv et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the tracking of vegetation conditions in wetlands with an ndvi index principally related to canopy chlorophyll content kogan 1997 has been widely investigated jing et al 2017 wu et al 2014 moreover a combination of ndvi and ndwi offers us more information about vegetation and water and therefore more complex analyses of peatland conditions water table depth which influences surface soil moisture in peatlands is considered one of the primary factors in plant recruitment and survival crosslé and brock 2002 species composition laitinen et al 2007 närhi et al 2010 and plant health lees et al 2020 changes in water regimes have been found to alter the soil environment and cause shifts in species composition when water tables are low and moisture content in vegetation is reduced the variety of species and photosynthesis rates decrease laine et al 2021 peatland water regimes and the spatial distribution of their water table depth based on point measurements have been assessed in previous studies howie and van meerveld 2013 2019 however most of these are based on measurements that have spatial and chronological constraints e g they were taken at one time and in one place and therefore cannot be used to evaluate the seasonal or long term processes of complex peatland ecosystems when observing natural and human influenced peatland water regimes we frequently encounter difficulties selecting characteristic sites inappropriate monitoring points may reflect very particular conditions that is they are not representative of the entire peatland complex the need for a wider network of point measurements that are reliably representative of surrounding areas has been widely reported howie and van meerveld 2013 2019 continuous water table measurements in a wider monitoring network could serve as a basis for the evaluation of phenomena in different raised bog types according to previous studies it is expected that water table depth would be lower in treed raised bog habitats smiljanić et al 2014 and higher in open raised bog habitats dominated by sphagnum spp grosvernier et al 1997 studies showing the position of water table depth in semi open raised bog habitats are needed since semi open habitats of a transitional trophic and moisture status might be a key factor in the next stage of the evolution of raised bogs sotek et al 2019 the main goal of the present study was to identify and evaluate the hydrology of different raised bog habitat types using remote sensing methods it comprises a an evaluation of the vertical structure of raised bog vegetation and the distinctiveness of raised bog habitat types in relation to tree cover b an analysis of raised bog hydrology using in situ measurements c an analysis of the relationship between hydrology and raised bog habitat types and d an evaluation of hydrology and raised bog habitat types according to spectral indices ndvi and ndwi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area čepkeliai 54 00 n 24 30 e is one of the largest peatlands in lithuania 5 858 ha and one of the very few remaining pristine raised bogs in the baltic region taminskas et al 2012 the čepkeliai peatland complex consists of raised bogs 82 of the total area fens 16 transition mires 2 several mineral substrate islands and 21 small lakes we studied the raised bog part of the čepkeliai peatland the average depth of the peat is about 2 3 m but organic deposits can be as deep as 16 m locally with the peat up to 6 m deep and gyttja below stančikaitė et al 2019 the surface of the raised bog is slightly undulating 128 5 134 4 m above sea level asl and divided into several parts with different drainage conditions the nemunas river catchment streams ūla grūda and katra collect water from open drainage sub basins while surplus water from closed drainage sub basins is lost by ground water exchange or evapotranspiration taminskas et al 2018 the average annual temperature is 6 8 c average monthly temperatures fluctuate from 3 7 c in january to 17 9 c in july average annual precipitation is 700 mm snow cover occurs for 90 days annual net precipitation is 220 mm varėna ws meteorological data 1981 2010 the main area of the čepkeliai peatland has been a strict state nature reserve since 1975 it was included in the ramsar site list as a wetland of international importance in 1993 the čepkeliai peatland is also part of the european union ecological network natura 2000 territory the open raised bog and semi open raised bog areas we investigated are classified as priority 7110 active raised bog habitats according to the criteria of habitats of eu importance european commission 2013 rašomavičius 2012 bog woodland is also classified as priority habitats of eu importance 91d0 bog woodland 2 2 data and methods 2 2 1 hydrological indicators to assess water table fluctuations 57 water table measurement wells were installed in various locations throughout the čepkeliai raised bog at five study plots a e with nine or 15 wells in each fig 1 since the measurements were carried out manually the locations of the study plots were selected to perform measurements at all points in one day the wells were installed using 1 4 m long 3 cm diameter perforated plastic pipes that were inserted 1 m into a peat layer in some cases less if the peat layer was thinner thom et al 2019 the elevation of the peatland surface was measured outside the well from the top of the pipe to the top of the moss layer water table elevation and peatland surface elevation measurements were taken during the 2019 2020 growing seasons 2019 05 10 10 10 and 2020 04 10 09 20 every 10 days measurements were taken in study plot a in the no 1 9 and no 52 57 wells and every month measurements were taken in study plots b c d and e in the no 10 51 wells water table depth was calculated using water table and surface elevation measurements in some shallower wells study plot c no 19 25 and no 27 study plot e no 44 45 and 50 the water table dropped below the borehole bottom 40 60 cm below bog surface so the data were not analysed correlation analysis was performed using the average minimum and maximum water table depth values found in 46 wells from 2019 to 2020 since 2002 water table measurements from april to october have been taken in wells located in the western part of the čepkeliai peatland fig 1 5a and 6a since 2007 raised bog surface measurements have been taken near the same wells their data were used to evaluate the trends in water table depth fluctuation in the čepkeliai raised bog over the last 15 years 2 2 2 botanical indicators for the vegetation assessment 10 10 m trial plots were shaped around the water table measuring wells fig 1 vegetation descriptions of these trial plots were performed in july 2019 the species composition of the tree shrubs dwarf shrubs referred to in the text as the shrub layer grass and moss layers as well as the percentage cover of each species were determined rašomavičius 2012 these trial plots are classified as three raised bog habitat types according to the character of tree growth bog woodland semi open raised bog and open raised bog the features of these habitats have been described in several studies kunskas 2005 seibutis 1958 tupčiauskaitė 2012 but clear criteria distinguishing raised bog habitats were not always explained for the present study we applied the following criteria for raised bog habitats the trees in the bog woodland habitat reached a height of more than 5 m and their coverage exceeded 40 in semi open raised bog the trees were smaller than 5 m and their coverage ranged between 21 and 40 in the open raised bog the trees reached up to 1 m and they covered up to 20 table 1 the ecological forms of scots pine that grow in raised bogs also serve as a criterion of the raised bog habitat types they differ according to the habitat conditions pinus sylvestris f uliginosa abolin 8 15 m tall the least altered pine p sylvestris f litwinowii sukaczew 1 6 m tall with a slightly oval shape p sylvestris f willkommii sukaczew 1 3 m tall spruce shaped p sylvestris f pumila abolin a 0 75 1 5 m tall shrub pine the most decayed pine abolin 1915 tupčiauskaitė 2012 three pines of three ecological types were discovered in the area under study f uliginosa f litvinowii f willkommii table 1 the nomenclature of the bryophytes was based on an annotated checklist of bryophytes of europe macaronesia and cyprus hodgetts et al 2020 the nomenclature of the other plant species was applied following the euro med plantbase euro med 2006 2 2 3 spectral indices for the evaluation of vegetation status and moisture content in the plants two main indices were used the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi and the normalised difference water index ndwi the former focuses on the difference between the red and nir zones of the reflectance spectrum ndvi nir red nir red in this expression nir and red denote the reflectance of band 8 and band 4 used in sentinel 2 ndvi values lie between 1 0 and 1 0 very low ndvi values represent non vegetated or bare soil surfaces whereas values higher than zero identify the vegetation cover with different photosynthetic capacities the higher the values the higher the density of green vegetation kogan 1997 the latter uses the difference between nir and swir to assess leaf water content at the canopy level ndwi nir swir nir swir in this expression nir and swir denote the reflectance of band 8 and band 12 used in sentinel 2 the amount of water available in the internal leaf structure largely control the spectral reflectance in the swir interval of the electromagnetic spectrum gao 1996 vegetation internal structure and leaf dry mass controls the reflectance in the nir interval the combination of these channels allows us to distinguish the water content in vegetation ceccato et al 2001 the ndwi values lie between 1 and 1 depending on the leaf water content high values correspond to high vegetation water content and high vegetation fraction cover low ndwi values correspond to low vegetation water content and low vegetation fraction cover in periods of water stress ndwi values decrease ceccato et al 2001 the previously mentioned 10 10 m 1 pixel trial plots adjacent to the water table wells fig 1 were also used to estimate ndvi and ndwi from satellite data sentinel 2 satellite images which have been available since 2015 with a spatial resolution of 10 m were obtained from esa copernicus open access hub copernicus sentinel data 2015 2020 retrieved from asf daac processed by esa images taken from april october were used in the study the values of both indices ndvi and ndwi were determined for each trial plot the number of usable images obtained each year varied due to cloud cover one image in 2015 aug 4 three in 2016 aug 5 29 oct 19 three in 2017 apr 2 may 12 aug 8 16 in 2018 apr 7 10 20 may 7 10 12 20 27 30 jun 1 jul 31 aug 10 23 oct 9 12 14 10 in 2019 apr 2 17 30 may 12 jun 9 19 sept 9 oct 14 22 and 7 in 2020 apr 6 11 jun 8 25 aug 7 14 sept 16 due to large data gaps trial plot no 29 was excluded from the ndvi and ndwi analysis the 8 day modis composites mod09q1 of surface reflections nir and red with a spatial resolution of 250 m for 21 years 2000 2020 were obtained from nasa s laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov according to the modis images the average ndvi during the growing season average monthly temperature 10 c may september was calculated for the entire čepkeliai raised bog these ndvi values were treated as auxiliary data and due to different spatial resolutions modis 250 m sentinel 2 10 m are presented separately fig 4 as sentinel 2 data series have only been available since 2015 ndvi from modis provides additional information about long term ndvi changes at the site snap erdas and arcmap software were used for calculations and analysis of the sentinel 2 and terra modis images 2 2 4 statistical analysis pearson s linear correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationships between hydrological botanical and spectral indices this measures the similarity between changes in two variables altman and krzywinski 2015 and is often used when analysing the interrelationships between environmental elements hydrological meteorological geological biological etc bloomfield et al 2011 burdun et al 2019 kim et al 2021 peña gallardo et al 2019 to analyse the synchronism of hydrological indicators or spectral index fluctuations in all trial and study plots correlation matrixes based on chronological measurement data series were created see tables 5 and 7 the data were processed using ms excel software and a p value 0 05 was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the pearson correlation the shapiro wilk test using the real statistics resource pack xrealstats was performed to check the normal distribution of variables the average minimum and maximum values of water table depth 2019 2020 the ndvi and ndwi 2015 2020 of each trial plot and the percentage cover of vegetation species layers were used to examine the relationship between the spatial distribution of hydrological botanical and spectral indices the values of 56 trial plots were used to assess the relationships between ndvi ndwi and vegetation cover and the values of 45 trial plots were used to assess the relationships between ndvi ndwi and water table depth excluding trial plots with no water table depth or ndvi ndwi data to analyse the chronological relationship between the water table depth and the spectral indices ndvi and ndwi the measurements of the nearest dates of these indicators were selected the difference in measurement dates ranged from 1 to 5 days for each trial plot 10 study plot a where water table measurements were taken every 10 days or six study plots b e where water table measurements were taken once a month pairs of simultaneous data were obtained and correlations analysis between water table depth and ndvi and water table depth and ndwi were performed 3 results 3 1 raised bog vegetation the trial plots 1 57 were divided into three groups according to raised bog habitat type see table 1 vegetation met semi open raised bog habitat criteria in 25 trial plots at least two criteria out of three see table 1 bog woodland habitat criteria in 23 trial plots and open raised bog habitat criteria in 9 trial plots study plot b comprised bog woodland and study plot c semi open raised bog study plot e was divided clearly into two sections an open raised bog appeared in the western part after the 1992 fire its growth was also disturbed by animals destroying new shoots while a bog woodland formed in the eastern part which was unaffected by the fire trial plots assigned to both bog woodland and semi open bog habitats were found in study plots a and d table 2 the percentage cover of different vegetation layers varied greatly across the 57 trial plots tree cover ranged from 8 77 shrub cover 1 67 grass 2 47 green moss 1 63 and sphagnum 30 90 of the five study plots a e trial plots b and c had the greatest average tree cover tables 2 and 3 they also have the highest average percentage of green moss cover and the lowest of sphagnum cover the other three study plots a d and e had lower average tree cover lower green moss cover and higher sphagnum cover a similar relation was found in the shrub and grass layers as the cover of the shrubs increased the cover of grass decreased and vice versa study plot c had a particularly low shrub cover and a high grass cover tables 2 and 3 the sphagnum layer has the largest percentage cover in all types of raised bog habitat table 3 the percentage cover of other vegetation layers revealed differences between the raised bog habitats the trial plots assigned to the bog woodland habitat had the greatest percentage of tree and green moss cover when compared with the other types of raised bog the semi open raised bog trial plots had a greater grass and sphagnum percentage cover by contrast shrub layer percentage cover was greatest in the open raised bog trial plots table 3 differences in the species composition were also evident in the vegetation layers tree layer in the bog woodland trial plots comprised various ecological forms of pines rhododendron tomentosum prevailed in shrub layer grass layer were dominated by eriophorum vaginatum moss layer were dominated by pleurozium schreberi and sphagnum magellanicum prevailed in the sphagnum layer young pines 1 5 m height predominated in the tree layer of semi open raised bog trial plots calluna vulgaris and vaccinium oxycoccos were the most common in the shrub layer andromeda polifolia was most abundant in the shrub layer of semi open raised bog compared to other raised bog habitat types in the grass layer eriophorum vaginatum was accompanied by molinia coerulea and carex nigra and in study plot c which was characterised by a thin peat layer 40 cm and was periodically flooded drosera rotundifolia and carex rostrata polytrichum strictum predominated amongst green mosses while acutifolia predominated amongst sphagnum lichens were also common in the semi open raised bog trial plots tree layer of open raised bog trial plots were dominated by pine trees up to 1 m in height betula pendula betula pubescens were more common there than in the other types of raised bog habitats picea abies occurred in open raised bogs trial plots however it should be stressed that the trial plots were located in an open raised bog that appeared after the fire in 1992 so tree species composition was influenced by the higher content of nutrients in the soil no spruces were found in the other open raised bog areas of čepkeliai calluna vulgaris and vaccinium uliginosum were more abundant in the shrub layer of open raised bog than the trial plots of other habitat types grass layer were sparse with eriophorum vaginatum being the most common aulacomnium palustre prevailed amongst green mosses while cuspidata predominated amongst sphagnum 3 2 raised bog hydrology the years 2019 2020 were classified as dry according to data from the lithuanian hydrometeorological service precipitation in varėna ws located 27 km to the north of čepkeliai reached 489 2 mm in 2019 524 5 mm in 2020 which was 70 75 of climate normal 701 mm growing season precipitation was 64 69 of climate normal the first half of the growing season was particularly dry in 2019 precipitation in april was only 1 and in may june 24 28 of climate normal april was the driest month in 2020 when precipitation was 21 of the climate normal july and september were also dry 22 and 34 respectively the water table for 2019 2020 was impacted by particularly dry years the elevation of the average annual water table in wells used for long term measurements reached its lowest point since measurements began in addition the water table was the lowest or one of the lowest in 14 years fig 2 in some wells 19 25 27 43 45 and 50 the water table dropped below the well s bottom these data could not be used for analysis the measurements in 2019 2020 revealed the characteristics of water table fluctuations in a greater number of measuring wells spread across the entire čepkeliai peatland water table elevation in the wells studied ranged between 129 85 and 133 33 m asl with an average of 131 42 m however it was also affected by peatland surface elevation therefore the wells in study plot a which were located at the highest elevation in the peatland s western area were distinct from the others the water table ranged from 132 78 to 133 33 m asl in the remaining study plots these values were closer ranging between 129 85 and 130 99 m asl water table depth values allowed us to compare the data from wells located at different elevations making it better suited for comparing individual study plots the minimum water table depth in the wells was recorded in april june and the maximum in august the depth decreased again in early autumn according to the assessment of seasonal variations based on long term monitoring of the wells 2019 2020 differed from previous years by having a deep water table and a high annual fluctuation amplitude 0 32 0 42 m while average amplitude was 0 22 0 25 m and the lowest amplitude was 0 10 0 11 m fig 3 the water table was highest in study plot a ranging between 0 06 and 0 63 m below the surface average 0 33 m water table was lowest in the study plot c wells eight had dried out and 0 79 m below the surface 0 5 m on average in the remaining well the amplitude of water table depth fluctuations was lowest in the study plot a wells 0 34 m and highest in the study plot c wells 0 63 m table 4 the average for all wells was 0 42 m however the differences in depth between the wells during the same measurement were significant ranging from 0 20 to 0 52 m with the average being 0 36 m the correlation matrix revealed that the fluctuations of water table depth in the wells were not identical the pearson correlation coefficient ranged from 0 59 to 1 00 even wells 50 200 m apart in the same study plot had different water table fluctuations according to the correlation matrix data the water table depth fluctuated most evenly in the study plot b wells and most unevenly in the study plot a wells table 5 the difference in water table depth during the same measurement in the wells of study plot b was 8 24 cm an average of 14 cm whereas the difference in the study plot a wells was 18 30 cm an average of 23 cm the water table depth fluctuations in the study plot a wells correlated least with the fluctuations in the other study plots with the exception of study plot c where only one of the nine wells remained undried 3 3 remote sensing indices ndvi and ndwi long term data modis 2000 2020 analysis shows that the inter annual variation of average annual ndvi for the entire čepkeliai peatland after 2016 became smaller and closer to the 2000 2020 average 0 76 however the amplitude of intra annual variations of ndvi increased one of the largest being in 2020 it was concluded that the status of raised bog vegetation changed significantly during the growing season fig 4 the status of vegetation differed significantly from a spatial perspective according to higher resolution images from sentinel 2 the differences in ndvi values of trial plots calculated from one satellite image range from 0 15 to 0 30 the amplitude of ndvi in each trial plot ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 in 2015 2020 the differences in the values of ndwi corresponding to plant moisture content were even greater differences between the trial plots ranged between 0 2 and 0 4 in one satellite image whereas the change amplitude in each trial plot was 0 2 0 5 over the study period 2015 2020 however even though we could not estimate the temporal variability of the satellite indices in detail due to the limited set of existing values and their uneven distribution over time the spatial variability in ndvi and ndwi trends was clear and served as the basis for spatial grouping of the trial plots across the different study plots table 6 the highest average ndvi and ndwi values and the lowest amplitudes were observed in study plot b study plot c was distinguished by the lowest average values and the greatest amplitudes there were two distinct areas in study plot e western with lower ndvi and ndwi values and wider variation and eastern with high values with the values even higher than those in study plot b but smaller variation table 6 a similar but less pronounced difference could be seen in study plot a the eastern part had lower ndvi and ndwi values while the highest ndvi and ndwi values and lowest variation were observed in the western part excluding trial plots no 1 4 and 7 which were located in raised bog lagg the same trends were observed in previous years 2015 2018 a summary of the trends in ndvi and ndwi values according to raised bog habitat types shows that bog woodland had the highest values but the lowest variation in both average values and variation in amplitude for semi open and open raised bog habitats were similar however a similar distribution in all trial plots was observed in open raised bog whereas wide distribution in values among separate trial plots prevailed in semi open raised bog table 6 fig 5 variations in ndvi values in the trial plots of some study plots were simultaneous while in others the state of vegetation changes differently even in neighbouring trial plots according to the correlation matrix the lowest correlation coefficients when comparing the trial plots of the same study plot and the trial plots of other study plots were found for the trial plots no 1 4 56 and 27 and were determined by local hydrological conditions the generalised data of the correlation matrix table 7 show that in study plot b ndvi variation was even in all trial plots as well as in study plots e and e in other study plots including the entire study plot e the correlation between the individual fields was weaker study plots b and e were characterised by exceptionally high ndvi correlation all coefficients were 0 9 table 7 lower correlations were observed in the ndwi correlation matrix table 7 variation in the vegetation water content of trial plots no 1 and 4 situated in the bog s lagg was weakly correlated with the same index values of the other trial plots the pearson correlation coefficient reached only 0 1 0 6 the ndwi correlation was low or moderate in study plot c which was characterised by a significant fall in the water table depth the most of the wells had dried up a very high ndwi correlation was detected amongst study plot b and study plot e trial plots the eastern and western sub sites were assessed individually 3 4 relationship between vegetation cover groundwater table and remote sensing variables the relationships between water table depth ndvi and ndwi indicators and vegetation cover in individual study points i e wells and trial plots in many cases the indicators were characterised by a weak and statistically insignificant correlation r 0 4 p 05 some indicators showed a moderate positive or negative statistically significant correlation table 8 the species more common to open raised bog sphagnum appeared in the trial plots where the water table was closer to the surface the species more common to bog woodland green moss rhododendron tomentosum and trees were characteristic of the trial plots where a deeper water table was observed the changes in vegetation state and moisture content were most visible in the trial plots with a higher percentage of grass cover the values of ndvi and ndwi fell the most and the amplitude of their variability was larger than in other trial plots they were also related to water table depth with the lowest index values more common for trial plots where water was located closer to the surface seasonal variation is ordinarily reflected in water table depth and ndvi ndwi indices so a correlation analysis was performed between simultaneous measurements of these indicators the difference between the measurements was 1 5 days the correlation between ndvi and water table depth was found to be very different at individual study points the pearson coefficient varied between 0 10 and 0 93 with an average of 0 57 however the limited data sets meant that a statistically significant correlation was found in only 25 of the trial plots the relationship between ndwi and water table depth was stronger in individual trial plots the pearson coefficient attained values between 0 42 and 0 95 average 0 77 and 80 of the coefficient values were statistically significant in terms of the relationship between water table depth and ndvi in study plots a e statistically significant coefficients were obtained except for study plot c where only one well was suitable showing a moderate correlation in study plots a and e with a strong correlation in the western part of study plot e and weak one in the eastern part and a weak correlation in study plots b and d meanwhile the correlation of water table depth with ndwi was strongest in those study plots b and e with the weakest correlation with ndvi water table depth was strongly correlated with both indices in study plot e table 9 when the different raised bog habitat types were compared a strong correlation of water table depth with both indices was found in the open raised bog table 9 the highest statistically significant coefficients showing a strong and very strong correlation between water table depth and ndvi ndwi in individual trial plots were found for open raised bog habitats a weak correlation between water table depth and ndvi ndwi was observed in semi open raised bog habitats though there was a high correlation in some individual trial plots ndvi was weakly correlated with water table depth in bog woodland while there was a moderate correlation between water table depth and ndwi the correlation coefficients between water table depth and ndvi in individual trial plots in the bog woodland were statistically insignificant in most cases and significant in the case of ndwi in most trial plots in all cases a positive correlation was found between water table depth and ndvi ndwi indicating that the deeper water table encouraged vegetative vigour of plants leaves with high chlorophyll and moisture content this may also be due to the seasonal patterns of vegetation development the growth of plant biomass increases during the vegetation period when plants accumulate more moisture in a canopy and thus ndvi and ndwi values increase meanwhile the water table depth increases during the warm season as the amount of net precipitation decreases taminskas et al 2018 lower water tables were more common in bog woodland ndvi ndwi values were highest but their variation in individual trial plots was the smallest when compared with other raised bog habitat types table 10 semi open raised bog was characterised by a diversity in water table depth amongst the different wells although in some individual cases the water table depth varied the least when compared with other raised bog habitat types therefore the local conditions in the semi open raised bog were the most diverse summarising the water table depth measurements of the open raised bog the opposite distribution was observed that is the amplitude of water table fluctuation was the largest at individual wells in comparison with other raised bog habitat types however the range of water table depth data measured in the open raised bog was the narrowest this may have been because the trial plots assigned to the open raised bog habitat were all located in the same study plot whereas the trial plots of other raised bog habitat types were scattered over several study plots with different peat layer thicknesses and other peatland properties semi open raised bog trial plots had a wider variation in ndvi values whereas open raised bog habitat had a wider variation in ndwi values table 10 significant differences were found between raised bog habitat types in terms of the correlation between satellite indices ndvi and ndwi values in the period 2015 2020 the pearson coefficient showed that there was a weak correlation 0 38 in only two trial plots whereas a negligible r 0 18 correlation was found in the other 20 trial plots in bog woodland habitats a moderate correlation between ndvi and ndwi was detected in all trial plots of open raised bog pearson coefficient values varied between 0 53 and 0 65 the correlation between ndvi and ndwi was very different in semi open raised bog trial plots half of the fields were characterised by a weak correlation a third of the trial plots by a moderate correlation and four of the trial plots by a negligible correlation thus fluctuations in vegetation states expressed by ndvi and moisture content in plants expressed by ndwi in the open raised bog where lower layers of vegetation were prevalent were simultaneous and reflected seasonal growth patterns fluctuations in these indices were only marginally interconnected in the bog woodland where a tree layer predominated local hydrological and botanical conditions for each trial plot determined the relationship between spectral indices in semi open raised bog 4 discussion remote sensing offers an affordable alternative approach for studying sensitive and difficult to assess areas such as wetlands high resolution and long chronological data sets enable a reliable analysis of these vast territories response to anthropogenic climate change and other impacts as well as a more accurate evaluation of the importance of raised bog for the stability of hydroclimatic systems however to apply and interpret remote sensing data special attention should be paid to understanding the relationships between processes taking place in the raised bog and spectral reflections recorded from space moreover the raised bog itself is a combination of two closely related and interacting elements water and vegetation frequently the interaction between these elements is significantly supplemented by anthropogenic factors e g drainage forestry and peat mining thus large peatland complexes that have been protected for many decades such as the čepkeliai peatland provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationships of natural processes and refine the interpretation of spectral indices vegetation succession especially the expansion or decline of woody vegetation is often the clearest indication of long term trends in peatland ecosystem change the specific raised bog environment forces pines to adapt to constantly changing groundwater tables low minerals and oxygen levels and large temperature fluctuations in the root zone sinkevičius 2001 the roots of raised bog plants are concentrated in the upper layer of peat up to 20 30 cm deep sometimes even in the living sphagnum layer as a result raised bog pines are more sensitive to changes in groundwater table than those growing in mineral soils as a result of climate change drainage and the disappearance of traditional extensive agricultural activities in peatlands the colonisation of lithuanian raised bogs by woody vegetation have been observed during the last decades edvardsson et al 2015 tree expansion has also been observed in other boreal peatlands berg et al 2009 cedro and lamentowicz 2008 čugunovs et al 2016 according to data from forest management projects carried out in the čepkeliai state nature reserve the areas of open raised bog steadily declined in the last decades of the 20th century 400 ha of new forests were inventoried in 1988 and 1 600 ha in 2002 whereas open raised bogs remain only in 2 500 ha i e 43 of the raised bog area stončius et al 2004 the trend of increasing forested areas continued at the beginning of the 21st century as well on the other hand amplifications of seasonal and interannual variations of temperature and precipitation hannah et al 2002 rimkus et al 2020 valiukas 2017 and drought events put peatlands under even greater stress and provided ideal conditions for fires they also served to shape post fire patterns of shrub expansion in burnt peatland and assumed great ecological importance in preventing the extensive expansion of forest therefore open raised bog habitats increased in area manton et al 2022 the structure and species composition of the vegetation in our study plots confirmed that this open raised bog habitat study plot e was the product of 1992 fire it has been transformed due to the establishment of shrubs birches and spruces which appeared after the fires provided nutrients in an otherwise nutrient poor environment guêné nanchen et al 2021 kelly et al 2018 semi open raised bog habitat may be considered to be an indicator of tree expansion that begins at the ecotone between forested and open peatlands with changes presaging landscape level responses ratcliffe et al 2017 an increase in the area of such a habitat reveals a trend towards the formation of bog woodland there is no single clearly defined central section in the čepkeliai peatland it is a complex peatland with four main peat formation cores and an undulating bottom kibirkštis 2002 previous studies taminskas et al 2018 have shown that water exchange is not uniform across the čepkeliai peatland but rather manifests in several open or closed drainage sub basins in the present study the groundwater measurements network located in various study plots in the čepkeliai raised bog revealed that the water table depth was unevenly distributed between different raised bog parts as well as between neighbouring wells located at a distance of 50 200 m water table depth differences between wells in one study plot varied between 0 08 and 0 31 m during the same measurement the uneven distribution of raised bog water table depth has been confirmed in other studies howie and van meerveld 2013 2019 in the present study continuous water table measurements were carried out during two warm seasons correlation analysis of these longer data sets allowed us to compare simultaneous water table differences as well as synchronic changes in water tables in different raised bog study plots the correlation matrix shows that the water table depth fluctuations in the wells were not identical the pearson correlation coefficient varied between 0 59 and 1 00 thus measurements at one point could not represent the water regime of even a small raised bog this requires an optimal research network that reflects water regime characteristics of different raised bog habitat types the distribution of water tables and differences in raised bog vegetation are closely related and interacting processes a fall in the water table in the raised bog influences favourable environmental conditions for woody vegetation establishment bönsel and sonneck 2012 jarašius et al 2015 matulevičiūtė and rašomavičius 2007 sinyutkina 2021 trees due to rainfall interception and soil water transpiration promote further falls in the water table van seters and price 2002 increases in woody vegetation are observed not only in drained peatlands but also in pristine peatlands such as čepkeliai this shift is triggered by both direct anthropogenic impact and natural changes in more complex systems for example changing peatland tree cover is likely to be an important feedback between peatlands and climate ratcliffe et al 2017 the present study revealed statistically significant relationships between vegetation and water table depth in different raised bog habitat types in areas with deeper water tables bog woodland vegetation trees green mosses and rhododendron tomentosum prevailed and vice versa in areas with higher water tables open raised bog plants sphagnum occupied the surface thus by observing an increase in forested areas we can predict a long term lowering of raised bog water tables the spatial and temporal regularities of spectral indices in three raised bog habitat types indicated in the present study suggest that high resolution satellite imagery data can be used to identify raised bog habitat types and to study their succession especially when long time series of such data are collected this accords with previous studies showing that remote sensing provides invaluable information to characterise and measure the conditions of wetlands and their functioning bhatnagar et al 2018 indeed remote sensing provides a robust and spatially explicit means to assess not only vegetation structure and function but also their relationships with climatic variables eamus et al 2015 determining the connections between raised bog water table depth vegetation types and ndvi ndwi provides an opportunity to assess changes in hydroclimatic conditions and their effects on regional hydrology according to spectral indices the future application of spectral indices in loss and succession of peatlands influenced by climate change and human activities require more similar research in wider territorial and temporal context in addition simultaneous data of water table depth and spectral indices reveal that seasonal cycles may influence long term trends in variation or spatial regularities the results which have shown positive correlations between water table depth and spectral indices lead us to the conclusion that the status of raised bog plants and their moisture content is higher when the water table is deeper especially in the open raised bog habitat where the correlation is strongest this conclusion is inconsistent with the spatial patterns of water table depth and vegetation distribution found in previous studies and the present one the explanation for this contradiction might be explained by the seasonality of water table depth and vegetation change at the beginning and the end of the growing season when the temperature and evapotranspiration are lowest the water table is closest to the surface in the raised bog in the middle of the growing season as temperatures and evapotranspiration rise the water table decreases meanwhile the greening of vegetation and the peak of plant biomass occurs in the middle of the growing season when temperatures are warm enough for normal enzyme activity and photosynthesis d acunha et al 2018 the cycles of water table and vegetation change are most pronounced and more strongly correlated in open raised bog habitats where lower layer vegetation is common in the bog woodland habitat the seasonal water table cycle is better reflected by ndwi which shows the amount of water in the vegetation cover thus the increasing volume of such cover during the growing season the seasonal variation of chlorophyll content in trees particularly pines reflected by ndvi is less pronounced in semi open raised bog habitats with a mosaic of hydrological and botanical features the correlation between simultaneous indicators is weak on the other hand the present study was conducted in dry years 2019 2020 a factor that might have led to exclusive patterns of water table depth and variations in spectral indices in such dry years even in a healthy peatland the water table in wells can drop below 1 m all of these aspects are important in planning both in situ measurements and the use of remote sensing data the assessment of raised bog habitat type distribution and the boundaries of sub basins before the installation of water measurement networks would be useful in evaluating water table variation intervals and variety from a chronological point of view it is important to know the period of remote sensing and in situ data in terms of seasonal and long term water cycles and assess the potential impact of these seasonal variations on data interactions 5 conclusions 1 to obtain representative results raised bogs should be regarded as heterogenous areas that are marked by spatial and temporal changes in hydrological and botanical indicators and related spectral indices 2 similarities in water table depth and spectral indices fluctuations depend more on raised bog habitat types than on the propinquity of measuring points 3 correlations between certain botanical and hydrological indicators and spectral indices allow the application of high resolution remote sensing data as an additional instrument for raised bog measurements 4 close relationships between hydrology and the botany of raised bogs suggest that changes in vegetation cover and related spectral indices may become hydroclimatic

2310,peatland vegetation requires water logged conditions for peat forming plant communities to survive changes in water regimes have been found to alter the soil environment and cause shifts in species composition occasionally the spatial and chronological constraints in water table monitoring impede the correct evaluation of the status of these sensitive ecohydrological systems therefore it is important to combine in situ and remote sensing methods to assess ecohydrological diversity over large areas of threatened peatland ecosystems the present study assessed the relationship between

raised bog data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction raised bogs are distinctive ecohydrological systems that contribute towards various habitats the major driving force behind these habitats is the hydrological cycle which is reflected in the condition and composition of raised bog vegetation xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 vegetation itself influences the surrounding environment as well as the hydrological regime water storage and vegetation are inextricably linked as raised bogs require water logged conditions for peat forming plant communities to survive mackin

tremendous pressure on the hydrological functioning of northern peatlands including changes in water table depth d acunha et al 2018 middleton et al 2012 these changes may be triggering the release of

smiljanić et al 2014 have noted that european peatland complexes including those in pristine condition are affected by the encroachment of woody vegetation this has prompted a debate on how climate change is impacting vulnerable ecosystems taminskas et al 2018 for instance it has been suggested that conservation and management require continuous hydrological monitoring bonn et al 2016 because traditional hydrological surveys which provide accurate results närhi et al 2010 are less than effective in measuring the spatial extent of large peatland areas over time pullens et al 2018 querner et

with their relationship to peat forming vegetation e g sphagnum spp in northern peatland ecosystems has been the focus of a number of studies bubier et al 1997 harris 2008 letendre et al 2008 meingast

into the relationship between water table depth and tree density e g spruce and pine mires as well as open mire habitats have confirmed that it is possible to track water table changes using vegetation indices as predictors räsänen et al 2022 however there is still a gap in the literature on the subject of transitional semi open raised bog habitats that are highly dependent on water table depth and extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in moisture moreover tree habitats are usually characterised by stable vegetation cover and spectral values taminskas et al 2020 whereas phenological changes in semi open raised bog habitat vegetation are expected to show prevailing trends in water table fluctuations as well as overall raised bog evolution spectral indices ndvi ndwi etc based on shortwave infrared swir and near infrared nir optical bands are reported to have had variable success in monitoring peatland water table depth for various mire types räsänen et al 2022 spectral indices retrieved from high resolution optical images sentinel 2 could serve as useful proxies for plant health and photosynthesis ndvi as well as for moisture content in raised bog surfaces ndwi bhatnagar et al 2020 lees et al 2020 many studies have shown the effectiveness of these indices in wetlands ashok et al 2021 lv et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the tracking of vegetation conditions in wetlands with an ndvi index principally related to canopy chlorophyll content kogan 1997 has been widely investigated jing et al 2017 wu et al 2014 moreover a combination of ndvi and ndwi offers us more information about vegetation and water and therefore more complex analyses of peatland conditions water table depth which influences surface soil moisture in peatlands is considered one of the primary factors in plant recruitment and survival crosslé and brock 2002 species composition laitinen et al 2007 närhi et al 2010 and plant health lees et al 2020 changes in water regimes have been found to alter the soil environment and cause shifts in species composition when water tables are low and moisture content in vegetation is reduced the variety of species and photosynthesis rates decrease laine et al 2021 peatland water regimes and the spatial distribution of their water table depth based on point measurements have been assessed in previous studies howie and van meerveld 2013 2019 however most of these are based on measurements that have spatial and chronological constraints e g they were taken at one time and in one place and therefore cannot be used to evaluate the seasonal or long term processes of complex peatland ecosystems when observing natural and human influenced peatland water regimes we frequently encounter difficulties selecting characteristic sites inappropriate monitoring points may reflect very particular conditions that is they are not representative of the entire peatland complex the need for a wider network of point measurements that are reliably representative of surrounding areas has been widely reported howie and van meerveld 2013 2019 continuous water table measurements in a wider monitoring network could serve as a basis for the evaluation of phenomena in different raised bog types according to previous studies it is expected that water table depth would be lower in treed raised bog habitats smiljanić et al 2014 and higher in open raised bog habitats dominated by sphagnum spp grosvernier et al 1997 studies showing the position of water table depth in semi open raised bog habitats are needed since semi open habitats of a transitional trophic and moisture status might be a key factor in the next stage of the evolution of raised bogs sotek et al 2019 the main goal of the present study was to identify and evaluate the hydrology of different raised bog habitat types using remote sensing methods it comprises a an evaluation of the vertical structure of raised bog vegetation and the distinctiveness of raised bog habitat types in relation to tree cover b an analysis of raised bog hydrology using in situ measurements c an analysis of the relationship between hydrology and raised bog habitat types and d an

network natura 2000 territory the open raised bog and semi open raised bog areas we investigated are classified as priority 7110 active raised bog habitats according to the criteria of habitats of eu

assess water table fluctuations 57 water table measurement wells were installed in various locations throughout the čepkeliai raised bog at five study plots a e with nine or 15 wells in each fig 1 since the measurements were carried out manually the locations of the study plots were selected to perform measurements at all points in one day the wells were installed using 1 4 m long 3 cm diameter perforated plastic pipes that were inserted 1 m into a peat layer in some cases less if the peat layer was thinner thom et al 2019 the elevation of the peatland surface was measured outside the well from the top of the pipe to the top of the moss layer water table elevation and peatland surface elevation measurements were taken during the 2019 2020 growing seasons 2019 05 10 10 10 and 2020 04 10 09 20 every 10 days measurements were taken in study plot a in the no 1 9 and no 52 57 wells and every month measurements were taken in study plots b c d and e in the no 10 51 wells water table depth was calculated using water table and surface elevation measurements in some shallower wells study plot c no 19 25 and no 27 study plot e no 44 45 and 50 the water table dropped below the borehole bottom 40 60 cm below bog surface so the data were not analysed correlation analysis was performed using the average minimum and maximum water table depth values found in 46 wells from 2019 to 2020 since 2002 water table measurements from april to october have been taken in wells located in the western part of the čepkeliai peatland fig 1 5a and 6a since 2007 raised bog surface measurements have been taken near the same wells their data were used to evaluate the trends in water table depth fluctuation in the čepkeliai raised bog over the last 15 years 2 2 2 botanical indicators for the vegetation assessment 10 10 m trial plots were shaped around the water table measuring wells fig 1 vegetation descriptions of these trial plots were performed in july 2019 the species composition of the tree shrubs dwarf shrubs referred to in the text as the shrub layer grass and moss layers as well as the percentage cover of each species were determined rašomavičius 2012 these trial plots are classified as three raised bog habitat types according to the character of tree growth bog woodland semi open raised bog and open raised bog the features of these habitats have been described in several studies kunskas 2005 seibutis 1958 tupčiauskaitė 2012 but clear criteria distinguishing raised bog habitats were not always explained for the present study we applied the following criteria for raised bog habitats the trees in the bog woodland habitat reached a height of more than 5 m and their coverage exceeded 40 in semi open raised bog the trees were smaller than 5 m and their coverage ranged between 21 and 40 in the open raised bog the trees reached up to 1 m and they covered up to 20 table 1 the ecological forms of scots pine that grow in raised bogs also serve as a criterion of the raised bog habitat types they differ according to the habitat conditions pinus sylvestris f uliginosa abolin 8 15 m tall the least altered pine p sylvestris f litwinowii sukaczew 1 6 m tall with a slightly oval shape p sylvestris f willkommii sukaczew 1 3 m tall spruce shaped p sylvestris f pumila abolin a 0 75 1 5 m tall shrub pine the most decayed pine abolin 1915 tupčiauskaitė 2012 three pines of three ecological types were discovered in the area under study f uliginosa f litvinowii f willkommii table 1 the nomenclature of the bryophytes was based on an annotated checklist of bryophytes of europe macaronesia and cyprus hodgetts et al 2020 the nomenclature of the other plant species was applied following the euro med plantbase euro med 2006 2 2 3 spectral indices for the evaluation of vegetation status and moisture content in the plants two main indices were used the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi and the normalised difference water index ndwi the former focuses on the difference between the red and nir zones of the reflectance spectrum ndvi nir red nir red in this expression nir and red denote the reflectance of band 8 and band 4 used in sentinel 2 ndvi values lie between 1 0 and 1 0 very low ndvi values represent non vegetated or bare soil surfaces whereas values higher than zero identify the vegetation cover with different photosynthetic capacities the higher the values the higher the density of green vegetation kogan 1997 the latter uses the difference between nir and swir to assess leaf water content at the canopy level ndwi nir swir nir swir in this expression nir and swir denote the reflectance of band 8 and band 12 used in sentinel 2 the amount of water available in the internal leaf structure largely control the spectral reflectance in the swir interval of the electromagnetic spectrum gao 1996 vegetation internal structure and leaf dry mass controls the reflectance in the nir interval the combination of these channels allows us to distinguish the water content in vegetation ceccato et al 2001 the ndwi values lie between 1 and 1 depending on the leaf water content high values correspond to high vegetation water content and high vegetation fraction cover low ndwi values correspond to low vegetation water content and low vegetation fraction cover in periods of water stress ndwi values decrease ceccato et al 2001 the previously mentioned 10 10 m 1 pixel trial plots adjacent to the water table wells fig 1 were also used to estimate ndvi and ndwi from satellite data sentinel 2 satellite images which have been available since 2015 with a spatial resolution of 10 m were obtained from esa copernicus open access hub copernicus sentinel data 2015 2020 retrieved from asf daac processed by esa images taken from april october were used in the study the values of both indices ndvi and ndwi were determined for each trial plot the number of usable images obtained each year varied due to cloud cover one

sept 9 oct 14 22 and 7 in 2020 apr 6 11 jun 8 25 aug 7 14 sept 16 due to large data gaps trial plot no 29 was excluded from the ndvi and ndwi analysis the 8 day modis composites mod09q1 of surface reflections nir and red with a spatial resolution of 250 m for 21 years 2000 2020 were obtained from nasa s laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov according to the modis images the average ndvi during the growing season average monthly temperature 10 c may september was calculated for the entire čepkeliai raised bog these ndvi values were treated as auxiliary data and due to different spatial resolutions modis 250 m sentinel 2 10 m are presented separately fig 4 as sentinel 2 data series have only been available since 2015 ndvi from modis provides additional information about long term ndvi changes at the site snap erdas and arcmap software were used for calculations and analysis of the sentinel 2 and terra modis images 2 2 4 statistical analysis pearson s linear correlation

often used when analysing the interrelationships between environmental elements hydrological meteorological geological biological etc bloomfield et al 2011 burdun et al 2019 kim et al 2021 peña gallardo et al 2019 to analyse the synchronism of hydrological indicators or spectral index fluctuations in all trial and study plots correlation matrixes based on chronological measurement data series were created see tables 5 and 7 the data were processed using ms excel software and a p value 0 05 was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the pearson correlation the shapiro wilk test using the real statistics resource pack xrealstats was performed to check the normal distribution of variables the average minimum and maximum values of water table depth 2019 2020 the ndvi and ndwi 2015 2020 of each trial plot and the percentage cover of vegetation species layers were used to examine the relationship between the spatial distribution of hydrological botanical and spectral indices the values of 56 trial plots were used to assess the relationships between ndvi ndwi and vegetation cover and the values of 45 trial plots were used to assess the relationships between ndvi ndwi and water table depth excluding trial plots with no water table depth or ndvi ndwi data to analyse the chronological relationship between the water table depth and the spectral indices ndvi and ndwi the measurements of the nearest dates of these indicators were selected the difference in measurement dates ranged from 1 to 5 days for each trial plot 10 study plot a where water table measurements were taken every 10 days or six study plots b e where water table measurements were taken once a month pairs of simultaneous data were obtained and correlations analysis between water table depth and ndvi and water table depth and ndwi were performed 3 results 3 1 raised bog vegetation the trial plots 1 57 were divided into three groups according to raised bog habitat type see

both bog woodland and semi open bog habitats were found in study plots a and d table 2 the percentage cover of different vegetation layers varied greatly across the 57 trial plots tree cover ranged from 8 77 shrub cover 1 67 grass 2 47 green moss 1 63 and sphagnum 30 90 of the five study plots a e trial plots b and c had the greatest average tree cover tables 2 and 3 they also have the highest average percentage of green moss cover and the lowest of sphagnum cover the other three study plots a d and e had lower average tree cover lower green moss cover and higher sphagnum cover a similar relation was found in the shrub and grass layers as the cover of the shrubs increased the cover of grass decreased and vice versa study plot c had a particularly low shrub cover and a high grass cover tables 2 and 3 the sphagnum layer has the largest percentage cover in all types of raised bog habitat table 3 the percentage cover of other vegetation layers revealed differences between the raised bog habitats the trial plots assigned to the bog woodland habitat had the greatest percentage of tree and green moss cover when compared with the other types of raised bog the semi open raised bog trial plots had a greater grass and sphagnum percentage cover by contrast shrub layer percentage cover was greatest in the open raised bog trial plots table 3 differences in the species composition were also evident in the vegetation layers tree layer in the bog woodland trial plots comprised various ecological forms of pines rhododendron tomentosum prevailed in shrub layer grass layer were dominated by eriophorum vaginatum moss layer were dominated by pleurozium schreberi and sphagnum magellanicum prevailed in the sphagnum layer young pines 1 5 m height predominated in the tree layer of semi open raised bog trial plots calluna vulgaris and vaccinium oxycoccos were the most common in the shrub layer andromeda polifolia was most abundant in the shrub layer of semi open raised bog compared to other raised bog habitat types in the grass layer eriophorum vaginatum was accompanied by molinia coerulea and carex nigra and in study plot c which was characterised by a thin peat layer 40 cm and was periodically flooded drosera rotundifolia and carex rostrata polytrichum strictum predominated amongst green mosses while acutifolia predominated amongst sphagnum lichens were also common in the semi open raised bog trial plots tree layer of open raised bog trial plots were dominated by pine trees up to 1 m in height betula pendula betula pubescens were more common there than in the other types of raised bog habitats picea abies occurred in open raised bogs trial plots however it should be stressed that the trial plots were located in an open raised bog that appeared after the fire in 1992 so tree species composition was influenced by the higher content of nutrients in the soil no spruces were found in the other open raised bog areas of čepkeliai calluna vulgaris and vaccinium uliginosum were more abundant in the shrub layer of open raised bog than the trial plots of other habitat types grass layer were sparse with eriophorum vaginatum being the most common aulacomnium palustre prevailed amongst green mosses while cuspidata predominated amongst sphagnum 3 2 raised bog hydrology the years 2019 2020 were classified as dry according to data from the lithuanian hydrometeorological service precipitation in varėna ws located 27 km to the north of čepkeliai reached 489 2 mm in 2019 524 5 mm in 2020 which was 70 75 of climate normal 701 mm growing season precipitation was 64 69 of climate normal the first half of the growing season was particularly dry in 2019 precipitation in april was only 1 and in may june 24 28 of climate normal april was the driest month in 2020 when precipitation was 21 of the climate normal july and september were also dry 22 and 34 respectively the water table for 2019 2020 was impacted by particularly dry years the elevation of the average annual water table in wells used for long term measurements reached its lowest point since measurements began in addition the water table was the lowest or one of the lowest in 14 years fig 2 in some wells 19 25 27 43 45 and 50 the water table dropped below the well s bottom these data could not be used for analysis the measurements in 2019 2020 revealed the characteristics of water table fluctuations in a greater number of measuring wells spread across the entire čepkeliai peatland water table elevation in the wells studied ranged between 129 85 and 133 33 m asl with an average of 131 42 m however it was also affected by peatland surface elevation therefore the wells in study plot a which were located at the highest elevation in the peatland s western area were distinct from the others the water table ranged from 132 78 to 133 33 m asl in the remaining study plots these values were closer ranging between 129 85 and 130 99 m asl water table depth values allowed us to compare the data from wells located at different elevations making it better suited for comparing individual study plots the minimum water table depth in the wells was recorded in april june and the maximum in august the depth decreased again in early autumn according to the assessment of seasonal variations based on long term monitoring of the wells 2019 2020 differed from previous years by having a deep water table and a high annual fluctuation amplitude 0 32 0 42 m while average amplitude was 0 22 0 25 m and the lowest amplitude was 0 10 0 11 m fig 3 the water table was highest in study plot a ranging between 0 06 and 0 63 m below the surface average 0 33 m water table was lowest in the study plot c wells eight had dried out and 0 79 m below the surface 0 5 m on average in the remaining well the amplitude of water table depth fluctuations was lowest in the study plot a wells 0 34 m and highest in the study plot c wells 0 63 m table 4 the average for all wells was 0 42 m however the differences in depth between the wells during the same measurement were significant ranging from 0 20 to 0 52 m with the average being 0 36 m the correlation matrix revealed that the fluctuations of water table depth in the wells were not identical the pearson correlation coefficient ranged from 0 59 to 1 00 even wells 50 200 m apart in the same study plot had different water table fluctuations according to the correlation matrix data the water table depth fluctuated most evenly in the study plot b wells and most unevenly in the study plot a wells table 5 the difference in water table depth during the same measurement in the wells of study plot b was 8 24 cm an average of 14 cm whereas the difference in the study plot a wells was 18 30 cm an average of 23 cm the water table depth fluctuations in the study plot a wells correlated least with the fluctuations in the other study plots with the exception of study plot c where only one of the nine wells remained undried 3 3 remote sensing indices ndvi and ndwi long term data modis 2000 2020 analysis shows that the inter annual variation of average annual ndvi for the entire čepkeliai peatland after 2016 became smaller and closer to the 2000 2020 average 0 76 however the amplitude of intra annual variations of ndvi increased one of the largest being in 2020 it was concluded that the status of raised bog vegetation changed significantly during the growing season fig 4 the status of vegetation differed significantly from a spatial perspective according to higher resolution images from sentinel 2 the differences in ndvi values of trial plots calculated from one satellite image range from 0 15 to 0 30 the amplitude of ndvi in each trial plot ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 in 2015 2020 the differences in the values of ndwi corresponding to plant moisture content were even greater differences between the trial plots ranged between 0 2 and 0 4 in one satellite image whereas the change amplitude in each trial plot was 0 2 0 5 over the study period 2015 2020 however even though we could not estimate the temporal variability of the satellite indices in detail due to the limited set of existing values and their uneven distribution over time the spatial variability in ndvi and ndwi trends was clear and served as the basis for spatial grouping of the trial plots across the different study plots table 6 the highest average ndvi and ndwi values and the lowest amplitudes were observed in study plot b study plot c was distinguished by the lowest average values and the greatest amplitudes there were two distinct areas in study plot e western with lower ndvi and ndwi values and wider variation and eastern with high values with the values even higher than those in study plot b but smaller variation table 6 a similar but less pronounced difference could be seen in study plot a the eastern part had lower ndvi and ndwi values while the highest ndvi and ndwi values and lowest variation were observed in the western part excluding trial plots no 1 4 and 7 which were located in raised bog lagg the same trends were observed in previous years 2015 2018 a summary of the trends in ndvi and ndwi values according to raised bog habitat types shows that bog woodland had the highest values but the lowest variation in both average values and variation in amplitude for semi open and open raised bog habitats were similar however a similar distribution in all trial plots was observed in open raised bog whereas wide distribution in values among separate trial plots prevailed in semi open raised bog table 6 fig 5 variations in ndvi values in the trial plots of some study plots were simultaneous while in others the state of vegetation changes differently even in neighbouring trial plots according to the correlation matrix the lowest correlation coefficients when comparing the trial plots of the same study plot and the trial plots of other study plots were found for the trial plots no 1 4 56 and 27 and were determined by local hydrological conditions the generalised data of the correlation matrix table 7 show that in study plot b ndvi variation was even in all trial plots as well as in study plots e and e in other study plots including the entire study plot e the correlation between the individual fields was weaker study plots b and e were characterised by exceptionally high ndvi correlation all coefficients were 0 9 table 7 lower correlations were observed in the ndwi correlation matrix table 7 variation in the vegetation water content of trial plots no 1 and 4 situated in the bog s lagg was weakly correlated with the same index values of the other trial plots the pearson correlation coefficient reached only 0 1 0 6 the ndwi correlation was low or moderate in study plot c which was characterised by a significant fall in the water table depth the most of the wells had dried up a very high ndwi correlation was detected amongst study plot b and study plot e trial plots the eastern and western sub sites were assessed individually 3 4 relationship between vegetation cover groundwater table and remote sensing variables the relationships between water table depth ndvi and ndwi indicators and vegetation cover in individual study points i e wells and trial plots in many cases the indicators were characterised by a weak and statistically insignificant correlation r 0 4 p 05 some indicators showed a moderate positive or negative statistically significant correlation table 8 the species more common to open raised bog sphagnum appeared in the trial plots where the water table was closer to the surface the species more common to bog woodland green moss rhododendron tomentosum and trees were characteristic of the trial plots where a deeper water table was observed the changes in vegetation state and moisture content were most visible in the trial plots with a higher percentage of grass cover the values of ndvi and ndwi fell the most and the amplitude of their variability was larger than in other trial plots they were also related to water table depth with the lowest index values more common for trial plots where water was located closer to the surface seasonal variation is ordinarily reflected in water table depth and ndvi ndwi indices so a correlation analysis was performed between simultaneous measurements of these indicators the difference between the measurements was 1 5 days the correlation between ndvi and water table depth was found to be very different at individual study points the pearson coefficient varied between 0 10 and 0 93 with an average of 0 57 however the limited data sets meant that a statistically significant correlation was found in only 25 of the trial plots the relationship between ndwi and water table depth was stronger in individual trial plots the pearson coefficient attained values between 0 42 and 0 95 average 0 77 and 80 of the coefficient values were statistically significant in terms of the relationship between water table depth and ndvi in study plots a e statistically significant coefficients were obtained except for study plot c where only one well was suitable showing a moderate correlation in study plots a and e with a strong correlation in the western part of study plot e and weak one in the eastern part and a weak correlation in study plots b and d meanwhile the correlation of water table depth with ndwi was strongest in those study plots b and e with the weakest correlation with ndvi water table depth was strongly correlated with both indices in study plot e table 9 when the different raised bog habitat types were compared a strong correlation of water table depth with both indices was found in the open raised bog table 9 the highest statistically significant coefficients showing a strong and very strong correlation between water table depth and ndvi ndwi in individual trial plots were found for open raised bog habitats a weak correlation between water table depth and ndvi ndwi was observed in semi open raised bog habitats though there was a high correlation in some individual trial plots ndvi was weakly correlated with water table depth in bog woodland while there was a moderate correlation between water table depth and ndwi the correlation coefficients between water table depth and ndvi in individual trial plots in the bog woodland were statistically insignificant in most cases and significant in the case of ndwi in most trial plots in all cases a positive correlation was found between water table depth and ndvi ndwi indicating that the deeper water table encouraged vegetative vigour of plants leaves with high chlorophyll and moisture content this may also be due to the seasonal patterns of vegetation development the growth of plant biomass increases during the vegetation period when plants accumulate more moisture in a canopy and thus ndvi and ndwi values increase meanwhile the water table depth increases during the warm season as the amount of net precipitation decreases taminskas et al 2018 lower water tables were more common in bog woodland ndvi ndwi values were highest but their variation in individual trial plots was the smallest when compared with other raised bog habitat types table 10 semi open raised bog was characterised by a diversity in water table depth amongst the different wells although in some individual cases the water table depth varied the least when compared with other raised bog habitat types therefore the local conditions in the semi open raised bog were the most diverse summarising the water table depth measurements of the open raised bog the opposite distribution was observed that is the amplitude of water table fluctuation was the largest at individual wells in comparison with other raised bog habitat types however the range of water table depth data measured in the open raised bog was the narrowest this may have been because the trial plots assigned to the open raised bog habitat were all located in the same study plot whereas the trial plots of other raised bog habitat types were scattered over several study plots with different peat layer thicknesses and other peatland properties semi open raised bog trial plots had a wider variation in ndvi values whereas open raised bog habitat had a wider variation in ndwi values table 10 significant differences were found between raised bog habitat types in terms of the correlation between satellite indices ndvi and ndwi values in the period 2015 2020 the pearson coefficient showed that there was a weak correlation 0 38 in only two trial plots whereas a negligible r 0 18 correlation was found in the other 20 trial plots in bog woodland habitats a moderate correlation between ndvi and ndwi was detected in all trial plots of open raised bog pearson coefficient values varied between 0 53 and 0 65 the correlation between ndvi and ndwi was very different in semi open raised bog trial plots half of the fields were characterised by a weak correlation a third of the trial plots by a moderate correlation and four of the trial plots by a negligible correlation thus fluctuations in vegetation states expressed by ndvi and moisture content in plants expressed by ndwi in the open raised bog where lower layers of vegetation were prevalent were simultaneous and reflected seasonal growth patterns fluctuations in these indices were only marginally interconnected in the bog woodland where a tree layer predominated local hydrological and botanical conditions for each trial plot determined the relationship between spectral indices in semi open raised bog 4 discussion remote sensing offers an affordable alternative approach for studying sensitive and difficult to assess areas such as wetlands high resolution and long chronological data sets enable a reliable analysis of these vast territories response to anthropogenic climate change and other impacts as well as a more accurate evaluation of the importance of raised bog for the stability of hydroclimatic systems however to apply and interpret remote sensing data special attention should be paid to understanding the relationships between processes taking place in the raised bog and spectral reflections recorded from space moreover the raised bog itself is a combination of two closely related and interacting elements water and vegetation frequently the interaction between these elements is significantly supplemented by anthropogenic factors e g drainage forestry and peat mining thus large peatland complexes that have been protected for many decades such as the čepkeliai peatland provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationships of natural processes and refine the interpretation of spectral indices vegetation succession especially the expansion or decline of woody vegetation is often the clearest indication of long term trends in peatland ecosystem change the specific raised bog environment forces pines to adapt to constantly changing groundwater tables low minerals and oxygen levels and large temperature fluctuations in the root zone sinkevičius 2001 the roots of raised bog plants are concentrated in the upper layer of peat up to 20 30 cm deep sometimes even in the living sphagnum layer as a result raised bog pines are more sensitive to changes in groundwater table than those growing in mineral soils as a result of climate change drainage and the disappearance of traditional extensive agricultural activities in peatlands the colonisation of lithuanian raised bogs by woody vegetation have been observed during the last decades edvardsson et al 2015 tree expansion has also been observed in other boreal peatlands berg et al 2009 cedro and lamentowicz 2008 čugunovs et al 2016 according to data from forest management projects carried out in the čepkeliai state nature reserve the areas of open raised bog steadily declined in the last decades of the 20th century 400 ha of new forests were inventoried in 1988 and 1 600 ha in 2002 whereas open raised bogs remain only in 2 500 ha i e 43 of the raised bog area stončius et al 2004 the trend of increasing forested areas continued at the beginning of the 21st century as well on the other hand amplifications of seasonal and interannual variations of temperature and precipitation hannah et al 2002 rimkus et al 2020 valiukas 2017 and drought events put peatlands under even greater stress and provided ideal conditions for fires they also served to shape post fire patterns of shrub expansion in burnt peatland and assumed great ecological importance in preventing the extensive expansion of forest therefore open raised bog habitats increased in area manton et al 2022 the structure and species composition of the vegetation in our study plots confirmed that this open raised bog habitat study plot e was the product of 1992 fire it has been transformed due to the establishment of shrubs birches and spruces which appeared after the fires provided nutrients in an otherwise nutrient poor environment guêné nanchen et al 2021 kelly et al 2018 semi open raised bog habitat may be considered to be an indicator of tree expansion that begins at the ecotone between forested and open peatlands with changes presaging landscape level responses ratcliffe et al 2017 an increase in the area of such a habitat reveals a trend towards the formation of bog woodland there is no single clearly defined central section in the čepkeliai peatland it is a complex peatland with four main peat formation cores and an undulating bottom kibirkštis 2002 previous studies taminskas et al 2018 have shown that water exchange is not uniform across the čepkeliai peatland but rather manifests in several open or closed drainage sub basins in the present study the groundwater measurements network located in various study plots in the čepkeliai raised bog revealed that the water table depth was unevenly distributed between different raised bog parts as well as between neighbouring wells located at a distance of 50 200 m water table depth differences between wells in one study plot varied between 0 08 and 0 31 m during the same measurement the uneven distribution of raised bog water table depth has been confirmed in other studies howie and van meerveld 2013 2019 in the present study continuous water table measurements were carried out during two warm seasons correlation analysis of these longer data sets allowed us to compare simultaneous water table differences as well as synchronic changes in water tables in different raised bog study plots the correlation matrix shows that the water table depth fluctuations in the wells were not identical the pearson correlation coefficient varied between 0 59 and 1 00 thus measurements at one point could not represent the water regime of even a small raised bog this requires an optimal research network that reflects water regime characteristics of different raised bog habitat types the distribution of water tables and differences in raised bog vegetation are closely related and interacting processes a fall in the water table in the raised bog influences favourable environmental conditions for woody vegetation establishment bönsel and sonneck 2012 jarašius et al 2015 matulevičiūtė and rašomavičius 2007 sinyutkina 2021 trees due to rainfall interception and soil water transpiration promote further falls in the water table van seters and price 2002 increases in woody vegetation are observed not only in drained peatlands but also in pristine peatlands such as čepkeliai this shift is triggered by both direct anthropogenic impact and natural changes in more complex systems for example changing peatland tree cover is likely to be an important feedback between peatlands and climate ratcliffe et al 2017 the present study revealed statistically significant relationships between vegetation and water table depth in different raised bog habitat types in areas with deeper water tables bog woodland vegetation trees green mosses and rhododendron tomentosum prevailed and vice versa in areas with higher water tables open raised bog plants sphagnum occupied the surface thus by observing an increase in forested areas we can predict a long term lowering of raised bog water tables the spatial and temporal regularities of spectral indices in three raised bog habitat types indicated in the present study suggest that high resolution satellite imagery data can be used to identify raised bog habitat types and to study their succession especially when long time series of such data are collected this accords with previous studies showing that remote sensing provides invaluable information to characterise and measure the conditions of wetlands and their functioning bhatnagar et al 2018 indeed remote sensing provides a robust and spatially explicit means to assess not only vegetation structure and function but also their relationships with climatic variables eamus et al 2015 determining the connections between raised bog water table depth vegetation types and ndvi ndwi provides an opportunity to assess changes in hydroclimatic conditions and their effects on regional hydrology according to spectral indices the future application of spectral indices in loss and succession of peatlands influenced by climate change and human activities require more similar research in wider territorial and temporal context in addition simultaneous data of water table depth and spectral indices reveal that seasonal cycles may influence long term trends in variation or spatial regularities the results which have shown positive correlations between water table depth and spectral indices lead us to the conclusion that the status of raised bog plants and their moisture content is higher when the water table is deeper especially in the open raised bog habitat where the correlation is strongest this conclusion is inconsistent with the spatial patterns of water table depth and vegetation distribution found in previous studies and the present one the explanation for this contradiction might be explained by the seasonality of water table depth and vegetation change at the beginning and the end of the growing season when the temperature and evapotranspiration are lowest the water table is closest to the surface in the raised bog in the middle of the growing season as temperatures and evapotranspiration rise the water table decreases meanwhile the greening of vegetation and the peak of plant biomass occurs in the middle of the growing season when temperatures are warm enough for normal enzyme activity and photosynthesis d acunha et al 2018 the cycles of water table and vegetation change are most pronounced and more strongly correlated in open raised bog habitats where lower layer vegetation is common in the bog woodland habitat the seasonal water table cycle is better reflected by ndwi which shows the amount of water in the vegetation cover thus the increasing volume of such cover during the growing season the seasonal variation of chlorophyll content in trees particularly pines reflected by ndvi is less pronounced in semi open raised bog habitats with a mosaic of hydrological and botanical features the correlation between simultaneous indicators is weak on the other hand the present study was conducted in dry years 2019 2020 a factor that might have led to exclusive patterns of water table depth and variations in spectral indices in such dry years even in a healthy peatland the water table in wells can drop below 1 m all of these aspects are important in planning both in situ measurements and the use of remote sensing data the assessment of raised bog habitat type distribution and the boundaries of sub basins before the installation of water measurement networks would be useful in evaluating water table variation intervals and variety from a chronological point of view it is important to know the period of remote sensing and in situ data in terms of seasonal and long term water cycles and assess the potential impact of these seasonal variations on data interactions 5 conclusions 1 to obtain representative results raised bogs should be regarded as heterogenous areas that are marked by spatial and temporal changes in hydrological and botanical indicators and related spectral indices 2 similarities in water table depth and spectral indices fluctuations depend more on raised bog habitat types than on the propinquity of measuring points 3 correlations between certain botanical and hydrological indicators and spectral indices allow the application of high resolution remote sensing data as an additional instrument for raised bog measurements 4 close relationships between hydrology and the botany of raised bogs suggest that changes in vegetation cover and related spectral indices may become hydroclimatic

2311,studies of climate change impacts in the colorado river basin have focused on the upper basin finding that warming has exacerbated streamflow declines since 2000 presently it is unclear if the predicted high degree of interannual precipitation variability across the basin could overwhelm impacts of future warming and how this might vary in space to address this we employed an updated variable infiltration capacity model framework to generate streamflow projections across the entire basin meteorological data were drawn from downscaled historical and future climate projections of eight climate models that best represent climatology results showed a high confidence of far future 2066 2095 mean annual streamflow declines relative to the baseline 1976 2005 at the upper basin lower basin and basin wide scales ensemble median trends of 5 to 25 streamflow declines were attributed to warming that diminished snowfall and melt during april to september and year round increased soil evaporation from the upper basin and overall precipitation declines in the lower basin widespread reductions in annual runoff and baseflow efficiencies indicated that precipitation increases did not offset the noted warming effects spatial coherence tests indicated that streamflow correlations among subbasins remained relatively constant in the future scenarios though correlations with the green river increased this spatial attribution analysis is providing actionable information for water management in the colorado river basin under current and future conditions keywords land surface model southwestern united states climate projections water supply runoff efficiency spatial variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the colorado river basin crb see text s1 for all acronyms encompasses portions of seven us states wy ut co nv az nm and ca and the mexican states of sonora and baja california known as the lifeblood of the southwestern us the crb serves as a major water resource supplying freshwater to nearly 40 million people greater than 4 200 mw of power and irrigation for nearly 4 5 million acres bureau of reclamation 2012 2015 2018 the majority of the crb has an arid and semiarid climate with mean annual precipitation and naturalized streamflow of 400 and 40 mm yr 1 respectively christensen et al 2004 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 cl2007 hereafter nearly 90 of streamflow originates from snow in the upper basin above lees ferry az fig 1 interannual variations in streamflow are also high with naturalized amounts in the upper basin ranging from 6 5 to 29 6 billion cubic meters bcm per year and averaging 19 bcm yr 1 in the 20th century christensen et al 2004 the crb is often plagued by drought and has experienced widespread and severe multidecadal events in the past four centuries driven by sea surface temperature and atmospheric variability e g el niño southern and pacific decadal oscillations cayan et al 1999 hidalgo et al 2000 mccabe et al 2004 woodhouse et al 2006 gangopadhyay et al 2022 water supplies during drought have been supported by reservoirs that provide a large amount of storage capacity roughly four times the annual average flow at lees ferry rajagopalan et al 2009 climate change since the 1970 s has led to large streamflow reductions outside of the estimated natural variability dawadi and ahmad 2012 hoerling et al 2019 in addition human induced warming in recent years 1980 to 2014 has caused substantial reductions in upper basin runoff efficiency woodhouse et al 2016 mccabe et al 2017 hoerling et al 2019 the millennium drought that began in 2000 has already included the worst 15 year deficit in instrumental records possibly the worst drought over the southwest us in 1 200 years gangopadhyay et al 2022 with a 19 reduction in upper basin streamflow udall and overpeck 2017 roughly half of the streamflow reductions during the millennium drought are attributable to anomalously warm temperatures xiao et al 2018 previous studies agree that warming has exacerbated upper basin streamflow conditions since 2000 but the estimated magnitude of this effect has varied ranging from 15 9 to 2 5 of average annual streamflow decline per 1 c of warming vano et al 2012 2014 udall and overpeck 2017 xiao et al 2018 hoerling et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 analysis of naturalized estimates of streamflow indicate that interannual variability is primarily dependent on cool season oct through mar precipitation variability and secondarily on warm season apr through sep temperature woodhouse et al 2016 mcafee et al 2017 mccabe et al 2017 this suggests that higher warm season evaporative losses linked to warming as well as cool season precipitation reductions have driven observed streamflow declines mccabe and wolock 2011 das et al 2011 harpold et al 2012 foster et al 2016 mccabe et al 2017 prior streamflow projections in the crb have been primarily based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model using forcings from general circulation models gcms of the climate model intercomparison project 3 cmip3 e g cl2007 bureau of reclamation 2012 hereafter br2012 these studies used a bias corrected spatial disaggregation method bcsd to translate coarse climate projections to the higher resolution vic model however bcsd has been shown to impart a wettening effect with larger precipitation increases than the underlying gcms alder and hostetler 2019 more recently projections from phase 5 of cmip cmip5 have become available and analyses have indicated critical differences in precipitation changes relative to cmip3 ayers et al 2016 ficklin et al 2016 for instance in cmip5 precipitation variability is projected to increase lukas et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2017 and could potentially overwhelm the warming effects in the region harding et al 2012 contrasting conditions in subbasins fig 2 a can often dominate the crb response to climate variability during the millennium drought for instance the contributions of different subbasins shifted along with the change to a more temperature driven regime xiao et al 2018 while all subbasins in the lower basin suffered widespread runoff declines runoff patterns in the upper basin were more complex due to interactions between precipitation evapotranspiration and snowmelt xiao et al 2018 hoerling et al 2019 in particular the green river which experienced high precipitation and runoff was unable to offset streamflow declines in other subbasins this represents an unprecedented behavior with respect to paleo reconstructions since year 1520 which indicate a tendency for upper basin flows to depend more on conditions in the green river than elsewhere woodhouse et al 2006 indeed the reconstructions highlight that streamflow sensitivity to climate variations can vary spatially across the crb and cause differential impacts to larger budgets woodhouse et al 2006 woodhouse et al 2016 the relative contributions of each subbasin are thus important to project under climate change due to decision making processes guided by spatial variations in runoff efficiency br2012 stern and sheikh 2019 in this study we used the vic model to evaluate the impacts of precipitation and temperature changes on the spatial variability of the hydrologic response in the crb specifically we addressed how precipitation variability and warming interact to determine future changes in hydrologic processes including streamflow and compare these projections to the millennium drought and hydrologic conditions during the historical record vic has been applied previously in the crb yielding scientific guidance that has influenced water management e g christensen et al 2004 cl2007 mote et al 2005 2018 br2012 vano et al 2012 2014 xiao et al 2018 here we incorporated recent advancements in statistical downscaling model physics and land surface parameterizations to update the model projections under two emissions scenarios and a set of cmip5 models we analyzed subbasin contributions to the basin wide water budget and investigated how these relations could evolve under climate change a largely unexplored aspect in prior studies e g christensen et al 2004 cl2007 br2012 ficklin et al 2013 throughout the effort we explicitly tracked the hydrologic mechanisms through which climate change could affect streamflow across different seasons and within regions of the crb this spatial attribution analysis cramer et al 2014 can provide water managers with actionable knowledge on how climate change might affect the relative contributions of individual subbasins as this information is used directly for decision making 2 material and methods 2 1 study domain and analysis subbasins

usgs 2016a as shown in fig 1b land cover maps assembled by bohn and vivoni 2019 reveal that most land areas are characterized by shrub ecosystems 60 followed by various forest types 24 the study domain included the crb above imperial dam plus the gila river subbasin in arizona we subdivided the crb into eight analysis subbasins upper colorado green glen canyon san juan grand canyon little colorado lower colorado and gila corresponding to sub divisions by the usgs table 1 fig 2a in addition we combined the little colorado and grand canyon subbasins into the middle colorado since this area is used in management decisions in the lower basin we used flow directions from the 30 m national elevation dataset ned usgs gaging stations and hydrologic unit codes as guides for subbasin and channel network delineation fig 2b usgs 2016a 2016b usgs 2019 three subbasins glen canyon grand canyon and lower colorado were defined as those areas draining to reaches between up and down stream gages table 1 and thus have streamflow values obtained by differencing which can be subject to more observational uncertainty 2 2 model framework we employed a modeling framework with vic version 5 0 hamman et al 2018 at 1 16th degree 6 km resolution fig 3 vic is a macroscale model that solves the water and energy balance on a regular grid where each cell is divided into land cover tiles atop a multi layer soil column liang et al 1994 we used the capability to simulate the full water energy balance at the hourly timestep with results aggregated to daily outputs all tiles were modeled independently for snow water equivalent swe and evapotranspiration et components snow sublimation es canopy evaporation ec transpiration tv and soil evaporation esoil andreadis et al 2009 cherkauer and lettenmaier 2003 vic accounts for heterogeneity in infiltration capacities and runoff r in a grid cell by applying an equation dependent on soil storage capacity and antecedent conditions soil moisture sm moves vertically through the top two soil layers and is factored into baseflow bf in the third layer using a non linear recession curve total fluxes for each grid cell were computed by summing across all tiles r and bf were subsequently routed as streamflow q using the r vic channel routing model lohmann et al 1996 lohmann et al 1998 although groundwater is not explicitly depicted rosenberg et al 2013 found that use of a groundwater formulation had little impact on simulated streamflow in the crb 2 3 historical and projected meteorological forcings we derived meteorological forcings from gridded datasets of daily precipitation p and minimum and maximum air temperature tn and tx fig 3 from livneh et al 2013 l2013 hereafter over the 1950 2005 period this selection of the period was driven by the evaluation performed by gautam and mascaro 2018 of historical cmip5 simulations ending in 2005 while l2013 is available up to the year 2013 we did not use the historical observations beyond 2005 we performed a ground truthing exercise to substantiate l2013 text s2 and found a good agreement with independent data from the us climate reference network diamond et al 2013 including correlation coefficients greater than 0 85 fig s1 we estimated unobserved forcings and diurnal cycles of all meteorological variables using metsim bennett et al 2020 bohn et al 2013 fig 3 we used a scheme for disaggregating daily p as triangular shaped events ptri with storm peaks and durations based on climatological monthly data bohn et al 2019 as opposed to dividing p uniformly in a day puni to avoid biases in snow accumulation we used a hybrid scheme pmix with puni applied on days when tn was below freezing and ptri at other times precipitation phase was obtained from temperature based partitioning 0 5 and 0 5 c thresholds for snow and rain using hourly air temperature t derived by metsim we obtained climate projections over the period 2006 2099 from cmip5 products using representative concentration pathways 4 5 r45 and 8 5 r85 taylor et al 2012 at the time of their development cmip5 products estimated emissions beginning in 2006 leading to a convenient selection of the demarcation between historical and future periods a subset of the eight gcms that best reproduced historical behavior in the crb were employed gautam and mascaro 2018 table s2 these products were statistically downscaled to 1 16th degree via the locally constructed analogs loca technique pierce et al 2014 2015 fig 3 comparisons of projected changes show that loca imparts a lower wettening effect as compared to bcsd alder and hostetler 2019 we also used loca forcings over the 30 yr period of 1976 to 2005 of the same eight gcms to obtain baseline values and compute gcm specific changes during future periods here we focus on the far future between 2066 and 2095 to match the baseline period length we compared basin averaged and subbasin mean annual p and t between each gcm and l2013 finding good agreement for t and moderate agreement for p see text s3 2 4 model parameterization we made improvements in vegetation and soil parameters and performed sensitivity experiments to evaluate the impact of these changes relative to vano et al 2012 see text s4 first we used the vegetation dataset of bohn and vivoni 2019 for land cover fractions and monthly varying leaf area index lai canopy area fraction fv and albedo obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis fig 3 second we replaced the gtopo30 elevation product eros 1997 with elevations from ned usgs 2016a to specify internal elevations and elevation bands for computing lapse rates andreadis et al 2009 third we used r vic parameters from bennett et al 2018a 2018b to correct biases of monthly streamflow at major subbasin outlets to improve streamflow performance we further calibrated soil layer depths and parameters that define bf rates based on xiao et al 2018 2022 other parameters were obtained from livneh et al 2015 using soil characteristics from the state soil geographic database soil survey staff 1994 and vegetation parameters from nijssen et al 2001 we assessed model performance of simulated annual and monthly streamflow 1950 to 2013 against naturalized streamflow estimates table 1 finding good performance see text s5 for model comparisons to historical estimates at key gaging sites larger biases occurred for subbasins where q was computed using the differencing approach e g glen canyon table s7 however these lower performing subbasins had a smaller impact on the overall basin wide or upper basin water budgets text s8 s9 relative to the better performing and more impactful subbasins in the upper basin and so the overall model performance was deemed acceptable as shown in fig s3 while we also carried out a bias correction procedure wood et al 2004 at the annual and monthly scale text s5 we opted not to apply this for the climate change experiments due to the good performance of the calibrated model 2 5 climate change experiments we focused the analyses on streamflow simulations forced with the loca downscaled gcm historical 1950 2005 and projected 2006 2099 datasets model states at the end of the historical period were used as initial conditions for the two emissions scenarios we computed several spatiotemporal and ensemble aggregations from the simulations for each grid cell we calculated cool season oct to mar warm season apr to sep and annual metrics using a hydrologic calendar year oct to sep we derived seasonal and annual climatological means in the historical period of 1976 through 2005 baseline and the future period of 2066 through 2095 far future at the grid scale and averaged across each source area for hydrologic fluxes we obtained seasonal and annual means as total amounts for each year e g total precipitation over each year whereas hydrologic states were calculated as average quantities e g mean snow water equivalent over each year including zero amounts this should be accounted for when comparing hydrologic fluxes and states in tabular and map formats we computed far future mean seasonal or annual changes δ relative to the baseline period and obtained ensemble statistics of climatological averages and changes across gcms for each emissions scenario we also developed a method to characterize the spatial coherence of streamflow from source areas to determine changes in the geographical extent of high and low flow conditions time series of annual q in the historical period were converted to percentiles future annual q were converted to percentile values based on the historical distribution by interpolating the future q value in any given year into the empirical probability distribution of historical q we calculated pearson s product moment correlation coefficients ρ between the percentiles of annual q from the different source areas annual ρ values were calculated in the baseline and far future changes over time in annual ρ values between any two source areas would imply changes in the geographic extent of high and low flow conditions by quantifying shifts in this correlation structure we identified if increases in streamflow in certain subbasins were able to offset streamflow reductions elsewhere an important outcome for water management 3 results 3 1 baseline simulations confirm important role of high elevation zones we first compared the baseline mean annual values of air temperature and the water balance components using the ensemble median see texts s6 to s9 for justification we present gcm specific results and the influence of ensemble uncertainty where appropriate fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the water balance components and table 2 summarizes the average quantities over different source areas vic derived mean annual outputs using l2013 over the baseline period yielded similar patterns to those in fig 4 mean annual temperature t has strong latitudinal variations in the crb as well as an elevation gradient mean annual precipitation p exhibited increases with elevation in the crb especially in the upper colorado e g ranging from 161 to 1 406 mm yr 1 most of p was lost to mean annual et across the domain 50 mm yr 1 difference between p and et for 88 of the crb area increases in p with elevation above 1 062 m outpaced increases in et and led tomean annual sm above 128 mm and mean annual r and bf yields rbf greater than 40 mm yr 1 suggesting a transition to more energy limited conditions mean annual rbf was largest in northern headwaters due to greater annual average snowpack available for melt m e g rbf of 126 mm yr 1 swe of 49 mm and m of 281 mm yr 1 across the upper colorado where also snow sublimation es was larger table 2 larger values of et p in southern subbasins 0 96 to 0 99 led to smaller amounts of mean annual rbf 5 to 12 mm yr 1 which had spatial patterns that varied substantially from those of mean annual p these patterns indicated that high elevations in the crb determined the overall availability of swe and sm and that elevated sites have relatively less et and thus more rbf production in particular for the upper basin annual differences among high elevation subbasins reflected seasonal patterns in water balance components that are explored in more detail in the following sections 3 2 far future changes confirm high certainty of basin wide streamflow decline projected changes were first assessed with respect to meteorological forcings fig 5 a b show the basin wide average of yearly changes in precipitation δp and air temperature δt relative to the mean baseline conditions including the median and interquartile range iqr over the ensemble for context historical forcings from livneh et al 2013 are shown these have higher interannual variability than ensemble forcings due to averaging over loca downscaled products fig 6 summarizes the hydrologic outcomes through ensemble median basin averaged responses in the far future relative to baseline overall downscaled gcm projections indicated a warming trend in the crb with far future ensemble median trends of 2 c in r45 and 3 c in r85 in contrast basin averaged p trends were relatively minor due to the high variability across the gcms fig s5a and for individual years fig 5a precipitation also exhibited large differences between the two emissions scenarios with most 5 out of 8 gcms projecting p increases under r45 median of 2 and iqr of 3 to 9 and all but two gcms projecting p declines under r85 median of 4 and iqr of 11 to 1 by the far future see text s6 the high variability in p among the selected gcms was expected lukas et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2017 and useful for assessing a range of plausible hydrologic outcomes under the varying levels of warming imposed by the r45 and r85 scenarios hydrologic response trends were first evaluated in terms of yearly changes δ for the basin averaged values and q at the crb outlet fig 5c h and the ensemble median of far future mean annual changes fig 6 see text s6 for gcm specific and ensemble iqr trends for context annual model outcomes using livneh et al 2013 are shown during the historical period swe declined under all gcms median trends of 8 mm in r45 11 mm in r85 primarily due to the decline in snowfall ps by 24 to 42 while snowpack loss mechanisms also played an important role annual snowfall reductions were due more to precipitation phase changes under r45 and to overall p reductions under r85 annual bf also declined across most gcms with greater certainty across the ensemble in r85 median of 18 iqr of 31 to 12 than in r45 median of 9 iqr of 23 to 8 due to declines in sm in the soil column which controls water released as baseflow however et and r trends were more dependent upon p variability than either the warming trends or the soil moisture status higher et and r was obtained under r45 median of 1 et and 1 r iqr of 0 6 to 8 et and 16 to 16 r while r85 led to reduced values median of 2 et and 13 r iqr of 9 to 2 et and 28 to 2 r though r increased for some gcms annual q at the crb outlet declined under most gcms with median q declines of 6 and 18 increased rainfall pr 9 in r45 and r85 was not enough to significantly increase annual r at the basin averaged scale due to higher esoil 3 in r45 2 in r85 and decreased m 17 in r45 31 in r85 relative to baseline the stronger decline in bf than r suggested a detectable temperature effect on vertical soil moisture transport that impacted q variations in basin averaged trends for the emissions scenarios suggested the need for a detailed spatial evaluation as performed next 3 3 annual trends indicate varying mechanisms of snowpack reduction across the domain grid scale results highlighted spatial gradients in meteorological forcings and hydrologic responses that underlie the noted contrasts in the emissions scenarios the mean annual δt was fairly similar across subbasins with some additional warming noted in the upper basin for r85 fig 7 in contrast the ensemble median mean annual δp displayed a strong opposing trend between the upper and lower basins across the domain the median p increased by as much as 142 mm yr 1 14 in the northwest and fell by 166 mm yr 1 25 in the southeast under r85 in line with earlier findings lukas and payton 2020 this north south gradient was primarily due to cool season changes seager and vecchi 2010 while the east west gradient was a warm season effect lin et al 2008 gutzler et al 2005 fig s8 mean annual et trends followed the p spatial patterns as expected given the water limited conditions in the crb vivoni et al 2008 except in high elevations of the upper colorado subbasin at these sites higher cool season p fig s8 resulted in et increases across the entire year due to seasonal moisture carry over over a vast area mean annual rbf trends showed little to no changes e g 83 of the crb had changes 5 mm yr 1 under r85 at high elevations in the crb however mean annual rbf changes greater than 10 mm yr 1 occurred and the sign of these changes followed the mean annual sm this included median trends of sm increase up to 86 mm at elevations between 1 152 m to 3 060 m but reduced sm as low as 88 mm at higher elevations where swe declined and et increased under r45 more widespread sm declines as low as to 332 mm occurred under r85 due to larger et increases and swe reductions fig 8 shows ensemble median values of far future grid cell trends that further diagnose the role of warming on annual snowpack budgets in the crb changes in rainfall fractions were more drastic in the upper basin e g increase of 0 12 in r85 for the upper basin vs 0 07 in the lower basin given its higher initial snowfall amounts mean annual snowfall reductions were more significant in r85 than r45 even across the northwest e g median far future trends of snowfall in the green of 23 in r85 vs 16 in r45 where total p increases in r85 outpaced the r45 scenario fig 7b h the larger snowfall reductions under r85 were due to 1 a more significant snow to rain transition in the upper basin and 2 larger declines in total p elsewhere as compared to r45 mean annual sublimation es followed spatial patterns in snowfall with larger sublimation reductions across the upper basin under r85 than r45 20 vs 7 mm yr 1 and smaller rates of sublimation decline across the lower basin 2 mm yr 1 in r45 4 mm yr 1 in r85 these sublimation declines indicated that et increases in the northwest fig 7c i were due to increased esoil and tv snowmelt m also declined for most mid to high elevations e g 25 mm yr 1 under r45 and 43 mm yr 1 for elevations 1 052 m except for the highest elevations of the green subbasin where enough snowpack remained to increase mean annual m this suggested that average annual swe reductions were largely due to reductions in snowfall in headwater regions and reductions in total p elsewhere as explored more next 3 4 monthly trends confirm key roles of warming driven snow to rain shift and baseflow decline we further determined relative roles of warming and precipitation shifts on mean monthly air temperature and water balance components across the upper basin in fig 9 a low seasonal variability was noted inδt with higher monthly values for r85 as compared to r45 the temperature effect on precipitation partitioning and snowmelt rates were clear with less snowfall in the far future particularly for the cool season oct through mar this led to less swe on average for all months sufficient upper basin snowpack remained for warming to increase m during the late winter to spring months of the far future e g median m 43 in dec through mar under r45 and 60 under r85 increases in both m and rainfall during these months minimized the changes in soil moisture and produced higher r bf and q yields rainfall and cool season m increases were thus enough to offset warming impacts e g snowfall reductions and esoil and tv increases and increase streamflow across the upper basin in spring to early summer however such trends were not noted during late summer when m was reduced and rainfall changes were less substantial across the region these results indicated a dual role of increased cool season m and year round snowfall decline snow to rain transition in r45 as well as overall total p decline in r85 on the far future swe reductions in the upper basin peak m did not shift to an earlier month m was greatest in april in baseline and far future in 7 out of 8 gcms for both r45 and r85 fig 9 and the timing of peak monthly r remained constant as a result meanwhile peak monthly bf and q shifted one month earlier jun in the baseline may in far future due to the combined increase in rainfall in the cool season and esoil and tv reductions in june that reduced vertical moisture transport and q at the mean annual scale upper basin r trends were mixed between the gcms and emissions scenarios fig 10 including r decline in 50 of gcms under r45 23 to 35 median of 1 and most gcms under r85 37 to 35 median of 11 meanwhile upper basin bf and q declined in most gcms and in both emissions scenarios median of 7 bf and 5 q in r45 15 bf and 14 q in r85 this indicated that while rainfall and m increases in the late winter to spring months offset the warming effects in terms of mean annual r in r45 the rainfall and m declines during other months combined with increased et losses in most months played a dominant role to reduce mean annual bf and then q from the upper basin in r45 and r85 these variable climate change effects across months and scenarios were less significant in the lower basin where r bf and q yields declined in most months for most gcms e g median monthly declines of 0 02 to 0 16 mm mon 1 r 0 09 to 0 46 mm mon 1 bf and 0 04 to 0 23 km3 mon 1 q in r85 due to the near elimination of snowpack e g median monthly swe of 0 to 0 3 mm in r85 and smaller rainfall changes e g median monthly changes of 49 to 37 in r85 overall these results indicated that basin wide mean annual q decline was driven largely by reductions in bf shifts across the upper basin in r45 and by more widespread mean annual declines in both bf and r in r85 3 5 warm season efficiency declines overshadow cool season efficiency increases we next performed analyses of the spatial variability in runoff and baseflow yields and the resulting impacts to q from each region first we compared relative changes in far future runoff and baseflow rbf efficiency fig 11 warming impacts were greater in the warm season declines across 90 of the domain vs 73 in the cool season due to the near elimination of snowfall and swe larger rbf efficiency changes in either season occurred at higher elevations and especially in the upper basin including warm season declines e g 0 15 at elevations 2 275 m in r85 in northern subbasins due to et increases that outpaced p increases fig s8 opposing trends occurred in the cool season for high elevations in the green e g increases up to 0 15 in r85 and upper colorado subbasins e g declines as low as 0 15 in r85 overall mean annual rbf efficiency trends were more reflective of the warm season changes with reductions across much of the crb reductions across 85 of the domain in r45 96 in r85 and accelerated declines in upper basin headwaters 0 03 in r45 and 0 06 in r85 on average across elevations 1953 m this further verified the increasing role of warming to reduce rbf yields from the upper basin near elimination of mean warm season snowfall and swe and increased mean esoil and tv in most months except for minor warm season rbf efficiency increases in some southwestern regions where p increased seasonal declines were relatively small in the lower basin due to lower initial rbf efficiencies in the baseline period we next assessed r and bf efficiency trends separately to track the role of seasonal changes fig 12 trends in r efficiency were more diverse between seasons and across regions than bf efficiency most of the upper basin 65 of area experienced a combined increase in cool season r efficiency and decline in warm season r efficiency with more prevalent cool season increase in the green and warm season decline in the san juan subbasins this was due to cool season rainfall and m increases following p increases that were enough to fuel both et and r in the more energy limited conditions at high elevations but more modest warm season rainfall increases leading to widespread warm season r efficiency decline in contrast r efficiency decreased in both seasons across the lower basin including warm season cool season declines across 70 52 of the area in r45 and across 99 88 in r85 cool season r efficiency trends over the entire crb were more variable between emissions scenarios than in the warm season due to the stronger spatial gradient of cool season p trends meanwhile vast areas had bf efficiency decline in both seasons 78 of the upper basin 81 of the lower basin annual rbf efficiency reductions in fig 11 were thus largely due to bf efficiency declines in both seasons in both emissions scenarios as well as r efficiency declines in the warm season under r85 hence cool season increases in r efficiency across the northwest were not enough to overcome declines in both r and bf efficiency for both seasons elsewhere we next compared the average annual efficiency trends across each source area to assess the relative effects of bf and r on q across the domain table 3 mean annual r efficiency declined on average across northeast subbasins by 3 to 10 across the upper colorado san juan and little colorado and increased elsewhere under r45 but had widespread decline under r85 by 1 to 21 for all subbasins except the grand canyon due to warm season reductions table s9 in the cases that r efficiency increases e g lower basin for r45 annual values were dominated by cool season conditions where p increased at a faster rate than et increases overall mean annual r efficiency declined across the upper basin in most gcms for both emissions scenarios but displayed opposite trends across lower basin between r45 and r85 median trends of 5 vs 4 fig s12 mean annual bf efficiency declined everywhere with larger declines towards the northeast than the northwest median trends of 13 in r45 and 23 in r85 in the upper colorado vs 9 and 20 in the green subbasin and stronger southward declines 24 to 60 across lower basin similarly mean annual rbf efficiency declined on average across all subbasins for both emissions scenarios overall bf and rbf efficiency declines led to mean annual q reductions from the upper basin 5 in r45 14 in r85 lower basin 11 in r45 25 in r85 and basin wide 6 in r45 18 in r85 warm season changes will thus have a sizable impact to reduce annual r efficiency from key upper basin headwaters that overshadow cool season increases during the far future with more widespread warm season impacts under higher emissions widespread bf efficiency and q declines in both emissions scenarios also indicated a more prevalent role of the warming driven decline in vertical moisture transport across much of the year 3 6 basin wide budget remained more contingent upon subbasins with the largest flow declines we next compared the relative roles of each subbasin in determining the basin wide streamflow budget in baseline conditions and how those roles evolved in the far future fig 13 shows the ensemble median of mean annual r and bf contributions to q at the crb outlet c or total r and bf in each grid cell per q as a percentage changes in mean annual c generally followed trends in mean annual p with increasing c towards the northwest but declines in the southeast e g average grid cell trend of 3 and 28 across the green and gila subbasins under r85 increases in c were largely confined to high elevations of the northwest e g 5 at 2 000 m across the green subbasins vs 22 at 2 000 m across all subbasins under r85 while low elevations had large c reductions due to declines in rbf efficiency the main contributors in the baseline were the upper colorado green san juan and gila and the lowest contributors were the lower colorado and little colorado subbasins total c bar plots in fig 13 far future changes in total c under r45 and r85 followed changes in mean annual p including increase across the green subbasin 2 and 4 decline across the upper colorado 1 and 2 while southward subbasins had less significant trends as a result the green subbasin became a slightly larger contributor in the far future over the upper colorado subbasin in both r45 and r85 total c of 35 and 38 in the green 35 and 36 in the upper colorado while other subbasins held the same rankings in both r45 and r85 strong gcm agreement in these trends indicated that northern subbasins continued as the major controls for the basin wide budget under climate change text s8 to explore this further we computed the annual pearson s correlation coefficients ρ between quantiles of annual q from different source areas see analyses for each gcm in text s9 fig 14 shows the annual ρ in the baseline and far future under r45 and r85 in the baseline flows at the crb outlet were most correlated with from highest to lowest ρ the upper colorado glen canyon and san juan subbasins in the far future potentials for high and low flows became increasingly synchronized with conditions in the northwest e g increases in ρ values computed between q from the green and other source areas for most gcms fig s18 and less synchronized with the northeast e g declines in ρ values computed between q from the upper colorado and other source areas for most gcms fig s19 correlation changes among subbasins were amplified for individual gcms as compared to the ensemble median text s9 this indicated an increasing probability for streamflow across the basin to reflect yearly high or low flow conditions in the green subbasin however flows from the upper and lower basins were still most correlated with eastern subbasins e g ρ value of 0 95 between upper basin and upper colorado q vs 0 92 between the upper basin and green q that experienced more substantial flow declines table 3 thus the capacity of any multi year pluvial events to replenish reservoirs will likely be diminished by warmer temperatures that reduce long term r and bf efficiencies and streamflow across most regions and especially in the northeast 4 discussion most climate change studies of the colorado river basin have focused on the upper basin due to the large amount of streamflow originating from this source area often emphasizing the streamflow sensitivity to changes in temperature and or precipitation prior studies have yielded a wide range of estimated climate impacts but most have showed a tendency towards reduced streamflow from the drying effects of warming lukas and payton 2020 in this study we tracked the hydrologic impacts of co occurring precipitation and temperature changes across the crb with an emphasis on the spatiotemporal processes leading to the streamflow declines by inspecting the transformation of meteorological forcing changes into different water balance components we attributed the streamflow declines in a spatially explicit fashion discussed next 4 1 spatial variations in snowpack reduction runoff efficiency and streamflow prior assessments across the western us have concluded that historical warming has reduced swe by increasing the frequency and duration of melt mote et al 2005 mote 2006 clow 2010 and by reducing the likelihood of snowfall knowles et al 2006 we found diminished swe due primarily to the snow to rain transition in northwest regions of the upper basin combined with overall precipitation declines elsewhere average monthly melt in the upper basin increased towards the end of the cool season indicating that warming enhanced m and contributed to swe declines this is in line with earlier findings of the strong negative influence of cool season melt events on swe across the southwestern us in the 20th century mote et al 2005 our results show a continuation of these trends into the future such that temperature enhanced snowmelt during the cool season and year round snowfall reductions could lead to larger reductions in snowpack from key headwater regions in the upper basin furthermore the occurrence of snowpack in the lower basin is at much greater risk than in the upper basin due to year round snowfall declines in a region with less substantial swe these findings are consistent with previous gcm based vic efforts cl2007 br2012 and from cmip5 projections that were bias corrected using snowpack observations lute et al 2015 prior analyses also observed runoff efficiency declines in the upper basin e g mccabe et al 2017 nowak et al 2012 hoerling et al 2019 we confirmed future declines on average across the upper basin in most gcms for both emissions scenarios but found opposite trends in runoff efficiency in the lower basin e g increase in r45 decrease in r85 our analysis of seasonal runoff efficiency enabled a deeper understanding of the differing behavior between the regions cool season runoff efficiency increased across much of the crb and by greater amounts in northern subbasins green upper colorado with some decline southward under r85 warm season runoff efficiency on the other hand decreased in most regions and with larger declines in the northeast upper colorado san juan this suggests that precipitation shifts in the warm season will lead to substantial reductions in annual runoff efficiency from key source areas of the upper basin with more widespread impacts under higher emissions at the basin wide scale we also found that snowmelt declines combined with increased bare soil evaporation led to widespread declines in baseflow efficiencies which in turn caused total annual rbf efficiency to decline in both emissions scenarios this indicated an increasing role of warming temperatures to reduce r and bf yields from key regions of the upper basin this is consistent with observed reductions in snowfall fractions during 20th century warming with the largest reductions in march which has historically been the major snow producing month knowles et al 2006 recent findings of milly and dunne 2020 similarly concluded that total r across the upper basin has been declining due to warming enhanced et mainly driven by snow loss and consequent decrease of reflection of solar radiation their assessment reflected future changes in temperature not changes in precipitation hence the sensitivity of total runoff in the crb will be additionally dependent on warm season precipitation changes 4 2 spatial attributes of basin wide streamflow decline to inform management we also identified that the relative importance of each subbasin in terms of runoff and baseflow contributions to the basin wide streamflow remained similar between the baseline and far future periods contributions increased the most in headwater subbasins green and upper colorado due to mean annual p increases despite the larger snow to rain transition similar to the millennium drought 2000 2012 xiao et al 2018 northeast subbasins green upper colorado and san juan rivers were the top contributors in the baseline and far future and largely responsible for the basin wide q decline due to snowpack reductions and evaporative increases for most gcms and in both emissions scenarios paleo reconstructions suggested that multi year periods of high flows in either the san juan or green river subbasins can offset low flows in the other areas of the crb woodhouse et al 2006 given our results showing multidecadal q declines simulated in northeast subbasins however the spatial attributes of the millennium drought are likely to be reinforced during the 21st century pearson correlation coefficients between time series of streamflow quantiles from different source areas confirmed the spatial attribution of streamflow declines we found an increase in correlations between conditions in the green river and other source areas for most gcms indicating an increased influence of this subbasin on streamflow elsewhere under climate change despite these trends q from the upper and lower basin and at the basin wide outlet were still most correlated with flows from the upper colorado subbasin that experienced more substantial flow declines this indicated that even with the more widespread synchronization to the green subbasin the capacity of high flow periods in this region to replenish reservoirs and offset losses elsewhere will be diminished by warming temperatures that reduce total runoff efficiencies and diminish long term streamflow amounts our results suggest that conditions in the green and upper colorado subbasins will remain as reliable indicators of basin wide water supply in any given year to help inform basin management decisions by considering the spatial contrasts of runoff and baseflow efficiencies water managers can better plan for anticipated subbasin responses as the future unfolds in the crb spatial attributions of streamflow changes also help to clarify which hydrologic processes e g warm season snowfall reductions enhanced evaporative losses changes in seasonal runoff efficiency were responsible for the streamflow declines under warming in specific subbasins strong contrasts are evident through the spatially distributed approach used here across different regions for instance among high elevation areas in the green and upper colorado rivers resulting from variations in underlying process interactions this information can be used to provide guidance to the decision making processes in the colorado river including determining the necessity and degree of climate change mitigation and adaptation cramer et al 2014 as an example the hydrologic outcomes from subbasins in the upper basin have been incorporated in the modeling and analysis efforts of the arizona reconsultation committee arc to support decision making e g adaptive management strategies on the risks vulnerabilities and impacts to arizona s colorado river supply the arc formed to assess and address the renegotiation of severe drought shortage plans in the lower basin and is composed of delegates representing arizona s water users and policy makers including elected officials from many sectors and interests e g members of arizona legislature chambers agricultural municipal and industrial sector representatives tribal nations the arizona water banking authority and non government organizations of the central arizona groundwater replenishment district 5 conclusions we employed a simulation framework using the variable infiltration capacity model that incorporated a number of recent improvements based on satellite and in situ observations and climate forcings derived from statistically downscaled outputs of selected general circulation models modeling improvements allowed for good simulation performance over the historical record with respect to naturalized streamflow estimates in different subbasins as with other modeling activities however uncertainties remain with respect to internal hydrologic conditions for which we did not conduct extensive comparisons to observations nonetheless xiao et al 2022 extended this effort to include comparisons with remotely sensed snow cover and land surface temperature finding good agreement that build confidence in the vic simulations of the crb hydrology based on our modeling framework we identified differential climate change impacts across the colorado river basin linked to future warming trends and spatial gradients in seasonal precipitation shifts the major conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows 1 results indicated a high level of confidence of widespread streamflow declines in future scenarios this was due to an increasing role of warming temperatures in reducing runoff and baseflow yields from headwaters areas through the eradication of warm season snowfall and year round increase in evaporative losses snowfall reductions were largely due to snow to rain transition in the upper basin and overall precipitation decline across the lower basin 2 subbasin contributions to the mean annual streamflow budget did not appreciably change under future scenarios when present anomalously high precipitation and runoff in northwestern regions green and glen canyon subbasins did not offset declines in mean annual runoff and baseflow efficiency elsewhere thus leading to basin wide streamflow reductions 3 the potential for high or low flows in any given year became increasingly correlated with the conditions in the green subbasin where rainfall was projected to significantly increase but streamflow from the upper and lower basins and at the main crb outlet were still more synchronized with the upper colorado subbasin that had more substantial streamflow declines 4 the spatial attributions of streamflow declines identified in this study were similar to conditions during the millennium drought when wetter conditions in northwestern regions did not offset drier conditions elsewhere leading to overall streamflow declines this suggests that a reinforcement of these relations will occur under future climate scenarios overall our results indicated that while there could be an increased probability for streamflow to reflect any multi year pluvial events in the northwest the capacity of these events to replenish reservoirs and offset losses elsewhere will be diminished by warmer temperatures that reduce long term streamflow efficiency nonetheless the individual subbasin roles on the overall water budget did not change under projected climate conditions indicating that managers can expect that the green and upper colorado subbasins will continue as useful predictors of downstream water resources in any given year as a result the spatial attributions identified here can provide critical information for water management in the colorado river basin further the methodology can be applied for climate change impact studies in other large river basins 6 data availability statement python code for the ptri

2311,studies of climate change impacts in the colorado river basin have focused on the upper basin finding that warming has exacerbated streamflow declines since 2000 presently it is unclear if the predicted high degree of interannual precipitation variability across the basin could overwhelm impacts of future warming and how this might vary in space to address this we employed an updated variable infiltration capacity model framework to generate streamflow projections across the entire basin meteorological data were drawn from downscaled historical and future climate projections of eight climate models that best represent climatology results showed a high confidence of far future 2066 2095 mean annual streamflow declines relative to the baseline 1976 2005 at the upper basin lower basin and basin wide scales ensemble median trends of 5 to 25 streamflow declines were attributed to warming that diminished snowfall and melt during april to september and year round increased soil evaporation from the upper basin and overall precipitation declines in the lower basin widespread reductions in annual runoff and baseflow efficiencies indicated that precipitation increases did not offset the noted warming effects spatial coherence tests indicated that streamflow correlations among subbasins remained relatively constant in the future scenarios though correlations with the green river increased this spatial attribution analysis is providing actionable information for water management in the colorado river basin under current and future conditions keywords land surface model southwestern united states climate projections water supply runoff efficiency spatial variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the colorado river basin crb see text s1 for all acronyms encompasses portions of seven us states wy ut co nv az nm and ca and the mexican states of sonora and baja california known as the lifeblood of the southwestern us the crb serves as a major water resource supplying freshwater to nearly 40 million people greater than 4 200 mw of power and irrigation for nearly 4 5 million acres bureau of reclamation 2012 2015 2018 the majority of the crb has an arid and semiarid climate with mean annual precipitation and naturalized streamflow of 400 and 40 mm yr 1 respectively christensen et al 2004 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 cl2007 hereafter nearly 90 of streamflow originates from snow in the upper basin above lees ferry az fig 1 interannual variations in streamflow are also high with naturalized amounts in the upper basin ranging from 6 5 to 29 6 billion cubic meters bcm per year and averaging 19 bcm yr 1 in the 20th century christensen et al 2004 the crb is often plagued by drought and has experienced widespread and severe multidecadal events in the past four centuries driven by sea surface temperature and atmospheric variability e g el niño southern and pacific decadal oscillations cayan et al 1999 hidalgo et al 2000 mccabe et al 2004 woodhouse et al 2006 gangopadhyay et al 2022 water supplies during drought have been supported by reservoirs that provide a large amount of storage capacity roughly four times the annual average flow at lees ferry rajagopalan et al 2009 climate change since the 1970 s has led to large streamflow reductions outside of the estimated natural variability dawadi and ahmad 2012 hoerling et al 2019 in addition human induced warming in recent years 1980 to 2014 has caused substantial reductions in upper basin runoff efficiency woodhouse et al 2016 mccabe et al 2017 hoerling et al 2019 the millennium drought that began in 2000 has already included the worst 15 year deficit in instrumental records possibly the worst drought over the southwest us in 1 200 years gangopadhyay et al 2022 with a 19 reduction in upper basin streamflow udall and overpeck 2017 roughly half of the streamflow reductions during the millennium drought are attributable to anomalously warm temperatures xiao et al 2018 previous studies agree that warming has exacerbated upper basin streamflow conditions since 2000 but the estimated magnitude of this effect has varied ranging from 15 9 to 2 5 of average annual streamflow decline per 1 c of warming vano et al 2012 2014 udall and overpeck 2017 xiao et al 2018 hoerling et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 analysis of naturalized estimates of streamflow indicate that interannual variability is primarily dependent on cool season oct through mar precipitation variability and secondarily on warm season apr through sep temperature woodhouse et al 2016 mcafee et al 2017 mccabe et al 2017 this suggests that higher warm season evaporative losses linked to warming as well as cool season precipitation reductions have driven observed streamflow declines mccabe and wolock 2011 das et al 2011 harpold et al 2012 foster et al 2016 mccabe et al 2017 prior streamflow projections in the crb have been primarily based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model using forcings from general circulation models gcms of the climate model intercomparison project 3 cmip3 e g cl2007 bureau of reclamation 2012 hereafter br2012 these studies used a bias corrected spatial disaggregation method bcsd to translate coarse climate projections to the higher resolution vic model however bcsd has been shown to impart a wettening effect with larger precipitation increases than the underlying gcms alder and hostetler 2019 more recently projections from phase 5 of cmip cmip5 have become available and analyses have indicated critical differences in precipitation changes relative to cmip3 ayers et al 2016 ficklin et al 2016 for instance in cmip5 precipitation variability is projected to increase lukas et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2017 and could potentially overwhelm the warming effects in the region harding et al 2012 contrasting conditions in subbasins fig 2 a can often dominate the crb response to climate variability during the millennium drought for instance the contributions of different subbasins shifted along with the change to a more temperature driven regime xiao et al 2018 while all subbasins in the lower basin suffered widespread runoff declines runoff patterns in the upper basin were more complex due to interactions between precipitation evapotranspiration and snowmelt xiao et al 2018 hoerling et al 2019 in particular the green river which experienced high precipitation and runoff was unable to offset streamflow declines in other subbasins this represents an unprecedented behavior with respect to paleo reconstructions since year 1520 which indicate a tendency for upper basin flows to depend more on conditions in the green river than elsewhere woodhouse et al 2006 indeed the reconstructions highlight that streamflow sensitivity to climate variations can vary spatially across the crb and cause differential impacts to larger budgets woodhouse et al 2006 woodhouse et al 2016 the relative contributions of each subbasin are thus important to project under climate change due to decision making processes guided by spatial variations in runoff efficiency br2012 stern and sheikh 2019 in this study we used the vic model to evaluate the impacts of precipitation and temperature changes on the spatial variability of the hydrologic response in the crb specifically we addressed how precipitation variability and warming interact to determine future changes in hydrologic processes including streamflow and compare these projections to the millennium drought and hydrologic conditions during the historical record vic has been applied previously in the crb yielding scientific guidance that has influenced water management e g christensen et al 2004 cl2007 mote et al 2005 2018 br2012 vano et al 2012 2014 xiao et al 2018 here we incorporated recent advancements in statistical downscaling model physics and land surface parameterizations to update the model projections under two emissions scenarios and a set of cmip5 models we analyzed subbasin contributions to the basin wide water budget and investigated how these relations could evolve under climate change a largely unexplored aspect in prior studies e g christensen et al 2004 cl2007 br2012 ficklin et al 2013 throughout the effort we explicitly tracked the hydrologic mechanisms through which climate change could affect streamflow across different seasons and within regions of the crb this spatial attribution analysis cramer et al 2014 can provide water managers with actionable knowledge on how climate change might affect the relative contributions of individual subbasins as this information is used directly for decision making 2 material and methods 2 1 study domain and analysis subbasins the crb headwaters originate in colorado and flow through the main channel for about 2 253 km to northern méxico elevation ranges from 35 to 4391 m with most high elevations in the upper basin fig 1a usgs 2016a as shown in fig 1b land cover maps assembled by bohn and vivoni 2019 reveal that most land areas are characterized by shrub ecosystems 60 followed by various forest types 24 the study domain included the crb above imperial dam plus the gila river subbasin in arizona we subdivided the crb into eight analysis subbasins upper colorado green glen canyon san juan grand canyon little colorado lower colorado and gila corresponding to sub divisions by the usgs table 1 fig 2a in addition we combined the little colorado and grand canyon subbasins into the middle colorado since this area is used in management decisions in the lower basin we used flow directions from the 30 m national elevation dataset ned usgs gaging stations and hydrologic unit codes as guides for subbasin and channel network delineation fig 2b usgs 2016a 2016b usgs 2019 three subbasins glen canyon grand canyon and lower colorado were defined as those areas draining to reaches between up and down stream gages table 1 and thus have streamflow values obtained by differencing which can be subject to more observational uncertainty 2 2 model framework we employed a modeling framework with vic version 5 0 hamman et al 2018 at 1 16th degree 6 km resolution fig 3 vic is a macroscale model that solves the water and energy balance on a regular grid where each cell is divided into land cover tiles atop a multi layer soil column liang et al 1994 we used the capability to simulate the full water energy balance at the hourly timestep with results aggregated to daily outputs all tiles were modeled independently for snow water equivalent swe and evapotranspiration et components snow sublimation es canopy evaporation ec transpiration tv and soil evaporation esoil andreadis et al 2009 cherkauer and lettenmaier 2003 vic accounts for heterogeneity in infiltration capacities and runoff r in a grid cell by applying an equation dependent on soil storage capacity and antecedent conditions soil moisture sm moves vertically through the top two soil layers and is factored into baseflow bf in the third layer using a non linear recession curve total fluxes for each grid cell were computed by summing across all tiles r and bf were subsequently routed as streamflow q using the r vic channel routing model lohmann et al 1996 lohmann et al 1998 although groundwater is not explicitly depicted rosenberg et al 2013 found that use of a groundwater formulation had little impact on simulated streamflow in the crb 2 3 historical and projected meteorological forcings we derived meteorological forcings from gridded datasets of daily precipitation p and minimum and maximum air temperature tn and tx fig 3 from livneh et al 2013 l2013 hereafter over the 1950 2005 period this selection of the period was driven by the evaluation performed by gautam and mascaro 2018 of historical cmip5 simulations ending in 2005 while l2013 is available up to the year 2013 we did not use the historical observations beyond 2005 we performed a ground truthing exercise to substantiate l2013 text s2 and found a good agreement with independent data from the us climate reference network diamond et al 2013 including correlation coefficients greater than 0 85 fig s1 we estimated unobserved forcings and diurnal cycles of all meteorological variables using metsim bennett et al 2020 bohn et al 2013 fig 3 we used a scheme for disaggregating daily p as triangular shaped events ptri with storm peaks and durations based on climatological monthly data bohn et al 2019 as opposed to dividing p uniformly in a day puni to avoid biases in snow accumulation we used a hybrid scheme pmix with puni applied on days when tn was below freezing and ptri at other times precipitation phase was obtained from temperature based partitioning 0 5 and 0 5 c thresholds for snow and rain using hourly air temperature t derived by metsim we obtained climate projections over the period 2006 2099 from cmip5 products using representative concentration pathways 4 5 r45 and 8 5 r85 taylor et al 2012 at the time of their development cmip5 products estimated emissions beginning in 2006 leading to a convenient selection of the demarcation between historical and future periods a subset of the eight gcms that best reproduced historical behavior in the crb were employed gautam and mascaro 2018 table s2 these products were statistically downscaled to 1 16th degree via the locally constructed analogs loca technique pierce et al 2014 2015 fig 3 comparisons of projected changes show that loca imparts a lower wettening effect as compared to bcsd alder and hostetler 2019 we also used loca forcings over the 30 yr period of 1976 to 2005 of the same eight gcms to obtain baseline values and compute gcm specific changes during future periods here we focus on the far future between 2066 and 2095 to match the baseline period length we compared basin averaged and subbasin mean annual p and t between each gcm and l2013 finding good agreement for t and moderate agreement for p see text s3 2 4 model parameterization we made improvements in vegetation and soil parameters and performed sensitivity experiments to evaluate the impact of these changes relative to vano et al 2012 see text s4 first we used the vegetation dataset of bohn and vivoni 2019 for land cover fractions and monthly varying leaf area index lai canopy area fraction fv and albedo obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis fig 3 second we replaced the gtopo30 elevation product eros 1997 with elevations from ned usgs 2016a to specify internal elevations and elevation bands for computing lapse rates andreadis et al 2009 third we used r vic parameters from bennett et al 2018a 2018b to correct biases of monthly streamflow at major subbasin outlets to improve streamflow performance we further calibrated soil layer depths and parameters that define bf rates based on xiao et al 2018 2022 other parameters were obtained from livneh et al 2015 using soil characteristics from the state soil geographic database soil survey staff 1994 and vegetation parameters from nijssen et al 2001 we assessed model performance of simulated annual and monthly streamflow 1950 to 2013 against naturalized streamflow estimates table 1 finding good performance see text s5 for model comparisons to historical estimates at key gaging sites larger biases occurred for subbasins where q was computed using the differencing approach e g glen canyon table s7 however these lower performing subbasins had a smaller impact on the overall basin wide or upper basin water budgets text s8 s9 relative to the better performing and more impactful subbasins in the upper basin and so the overall model performance was deemed acceptable as shown in fig s3 while we also carried out a bias correction procedure wood et al 2004 at the annual and monthly scale text s5 we opted not to apply this for the climate change experiments due to the good performance of the calibrated model 2 5 climate change experiments we focused the analyses on streamflow simulations forced with the loca downscaled gcm historical 1950 2005 and projected 2006 2099 datasets model states at the end of the historical period were used as initial conditions for the two emissions scenarios we computed several spatiotemporal and ensemble aggregations from the simulations for each grid cell we calculated cool season oct to mar warm season apr to sep and annual metrics using a hydrologic calendar year oct to sep we derived seasonal and annual climatological means in the historical period of 1976 through 2005 baseline and the future period of 2066 through 2095 far future at the grid scale and averaged across each source area for hydrologic fluxes we obtained seasonal and annual means as total amounts for each year e g total precipitation over each year whereas hydrologic states were calculated as average quantities e g mean snow water equivalent over each year including zero amounts this should be accounted for when comparing hydrologic fluxes and states in tabular and map formats we computed far future mean seasonal or annual changes δ relative to the baseline period and obtained ensemble statistics of climatological averages and changes across gcms for each emissions scenario we also developed a method to characterize the spatial coherence of streamflow from source areas to determine changes in the geographical extent of high and low flow conditions time series of annual q in the historical period were converted to percentiles future annual q were converted to percentile values based on the historical distribution by interpolating the future q value in any given year into the empirical probability distribution of historical q we calculated pearson s product moment correlation coefficients ρ between the percentiles of annual q from the different source areas annual ρ values were calculated in the baseline and far future changes over time in annual ρ values between any two source areas would imply changes in the geographic extent of high and low flow conditions by quantifying shifts in this correlation structure we identified if increases in streamflow in certain subbasins were able to offset streamflow reductions elsewhere an important outcome for water management 3 results 3 1 baseline simulations confirm important role of high elevation zones we first compared the baseline mean annual values of air temperature and the water balance components using the ensemble median see texts s6 to s9 for justification we present gcm specific results and the influence of ensemble uncertainty where appropriate fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the water balance components and table 2 summarizes the average quantities over different source areas vic derived mean annual outputs using l2013 over the baseline period yielded similar patterns to those in fig 4 mean annual temperature t has strong latitudinal variations in the crb as well as an elevation gradient mean annual precipitation p exhibited increases with elevation in the crb especially in the upper colorado e g ranging from 161 to 1 406 mm yr 1 most of p was lost to mean annual et across the domain 50 mm yr 1 difference between p and et for 88 of the crb area increases in p with elevation above 1 062 m outpaced increases in et and led tomean annual sm above 128 mm and mean annual r and bf yields rbf greater than 40 mm yr 1 suggesting a transition to more energy limited conditions mean annual rbf was largest in northern headwaters due to greater annual average snowpack available for melt m e g rbf of 126 mm yr 1 swe of 49 mm and m of 281 mm yr 1 across the upper colorado where also snow sublimation es was larger table 2 larger values of et p in southern subbasins 0 96 to 0 99 led to smaller amounts of mean annual rbf 5 to 12 mm yr 1 which had spatial patterns that varied substantially from those of mean annual p these patterns indicated that high elevations in the crb determined the overall availability of swe and sm and that elevated sites have relatively less et and thus more rbf production in particular for the upper basin annual differences among high elevation subbasins reflected seasonal patterns in water balance components that are explored in more detail in the following sections 3 2 far future changes confirm high certainty of basin wide streamflow decline projected changes were first assessed with respect to meteorological forcings fig 5 a b show the basin wide average of yearly changes in precipitation δp and air temperature δt relative to the mean baseline conditions including the median and interquartile range iqr over the ensemble for context historical forcings from livneh et al 2013 are shown these have higher interannual variability than ensemble forcings due to averaging over loca downscaled products fig 6 summarizes the hydrologic outcomes through ensemble median basin averaged responses in the far future relative to baseline overall downscaled gcm projections indicated a warming trend in the crb with far future ensemble median trends of 2 c in r45 and 3 c in r85 in contrast basin averaged p trends were relatively minor due to the high variability across the gcms fig s5a and for individual years fig 5a precipitation also exhibited large differences between the two emissions scenarios with most 5 out of 8 gcms projecting p increases under r45 median of 2 and iqr of 3 to 9 and all but two gcms projecting p declines under r85 median of 4 and iqr of 11 to 1 by the far future see text s6 the high variability in p among the selected gcms was expected lukas et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2017 and useful for assessing a range of plausible hydrologic outcomes under the varying levels of warming imposed by the r45 and r85 scenarios hydrologic response trends were first evaluated in terms of yearly changes δ for the basin averaged values and q at the crb outlet fig 5c h and the ensemble median of far future mean annual changes fig 6 see text s6 for gcm specific and ensemble iqr trends for context annual model outcomes using livneh et al 2013 are shown during the historical period swe declined under all gcms median trends of 8 mm in r45 11 mm in r85 primarily due to the decline in snowfall ps by 24 to 42 while snowpack loss mechanisms also played an important role annual snowfall reductions were due more to precipitation phase changes under r45 and to overall p reductions under r85 annual bf also declined across most gcms with greater certainty across the ensemble in r85 median of 18 iqr of 31 to 12 than in r45 median of 9 iqr of 23 to 8 due to declines in sm in the soil column which controls water released as baseflow however et and r trends were more dependent upon p variability than either the warming trends or the soil moisture status higher et and r was obtained under r45 median of 1 et and 1 r iqr of 0 6 to 8 et and 16 to 16 r while r85 led to reduced values median of 2 et and 13 r iqr of 9 to 2 et and 28 to 2 r though r increased for some gcms annual q at the crb outlet declined under most gcms with median q declines of 6 and 18 increased rainfall pr 9 in r45 and r85 was not enough to significantly increase annual r at the basin averaged scale due to higher esoil 3 in r45 2 in r85 and decreased m 17 in r45 31 in r85 relative to baseline the stronger decline in bf than r suggested a detectable temperature effect on vertical soil moisture transport that impacted q variations in basin averaged trends for the emissions scenarios suggested the need for a detailed spatial evaluation as performed next 3 3 annual trends indicate varying mechanisms of snowpack reduction across the domain grid scale results highlighted spatial gradients in meteorological forcings and hydrologic responses that underlie the noted contrasts in the emissions scenarios the mean annual δt was fairly similar across subbasins with some additional warming noted in the upper basin for r85 fig 7 in contrast the ensemble median mean annual δp displayed a strong opposing trend between the upper and lower basins across the domain the median p increased by as much as 142 mm yr 1 14 in the northwest and fell by 166 mm yr 1 25 in the southeast under r85 in line with earlier findings lukas and payton 2020 this north south gradient was primarily due to cool season changes seager and vecchi 2010 while the east west gradient was a warm season effect lin et al 2008 gutzler et al 2005 fig s8 mean annual et trends followed the p spatial patterns as expected given the water limited conditions in the crb vivoni et al 2008 except in high elevations of the upper colorado subbasin at these sites higher cool season p fig s8 resulted in et increases across the entire year due to seasonal moisture carry over over a vast area mean annual rbf trends showed little to no changes e g 83 of the crb had changes 5 mm yr 1 under r85 at high elevations in the crb however mean annual rbf changes greater than 10 mm yr 1 occurred and the sign of these changes followed the mean annual sm this included median trends of sm increase up to 86 mm at elevations between 1 152 m to 3 060 m but reduced sm as low as 88 mm at higher elevations where swe declined and et increased under r45 more widespread sm declines as low as to 332 mm occurred under r85 due to larger et increases and swe reductions fig 8 shows ensemble median values of far future grid cell trends that further diagnose the role of warming on annual snowpack budgets in the crb changes in rainfall fractions were more drastic in the upper basin e g increase of 0 12 in r85 for the upper basin vs 0 07 in the lower basin given its higher initial snowfall amounts mean annual snowfall reductions were more significant in r85 than r45 even across the northwest e g median far future trends of snowfall in the green of 23 in r85 vs 16 in r45 where total p increases in r85 outpaced the r45 scenario fig 7b h the larger snowfall reductions under r85 were due to 1 a more significant snow to rain transition in the upper basin and 2 larger declines in total p elsewhere as compared to r45 mean annual sublimation es followed spatial patterns in snowfall with larger sublimation reductions across the upper basin under r85 than r45 20 vs 7 mm yr 1 and smaller rates of sublimation decline across the lower basin 2 mm yr 1 in r45 4 mm yr 1 in r85 these sublimation declines indicated that et increases in the northwest fig 7c i were due to increased esoil and tv snowmelt m also declined for most mid to high elevations e g 25 mm yr 1 under r45 and 43 mm yr 1 for elevations 1 052 m except for the highest elevations of the green subbasin where enough snowpack remained to increase mean annual m this suggested that average annual swe reductions were largely due to reductions in snowfall in headwater regions and reductions in total p elsewhere as explored more next 3 4 monthly trends confirm key roles of warming driven snow to rain shift and baseflow decline we further determined relative roles of warming and precipitation shifts on mean monthly air temperature and water balance components across the upper basin in fig 9 a low seasonal variability was noted inδt with higher monthly values for r85 as compared to r45 the temperature effect on precipitation partitioning and snowmelt rates were clear with less snowfall in the far future particularly for the cool season oct through mar this led to less swe on average for all months sufficient upper basin snowpack remained for warming to increase m during the late winter to spring months of the far future e g median m 43 in dec through mar under r45 and 60 under r85 increases in both m and rainfall during these months minimized the changes in soil moisture and produced higher r bf and q yields rainfall and cool season m increases were thus enough to offset warming impacts e g snowfall reductions and esoil and tv increases and increase streamflow across the upper basin in spring to early summer however such trends were not noted during late summer when m was reduced and rainfall changes were less substantial across the region these results indicated a dual role of increased cool season m and year round snowfall decline snow to rain transition in r45 as well as overall total p decline in r85 on the far future swe reductions in the upper basin peak m did not shift to an earlier month m was greatest in april in baseline and far future in 7 out of 8 gcms for both r45 and r85 fig 9 and the timing of peak monthly r remained constant as a result meanwhile peak monthly bf and q shifted one month earlier jun in the baseline may in far future due to the combined increase in rainfall in the cool season and esoil and tv reductions in june that reduced vertical moisture transport and q at the mean annual scale upper basin r trends were mixed between the gcms and emissions scenarios fig 10 including r decline in 50 of gcms under r45 23 to 35 median of 1 and most gcms under r85 37 to 35 median of 11 meanwhile upper basin bf and q declined in most gcms and in both emissions scenarios median of 7 bf and 5 q in r45 15 bf and 14 q in r85 this indicated that while rainfall and m increases in the late winter to spring months offset the warming effects in terms of mean annual r in r45 the rainfall and m declines during other months combined with increased et losses in most months played a dominant role to reduce mean annual bf and then q from the upper basin in r45 and r85 these variable climate change effects across months and scenarios were less significant in the lower basin where r bf and q yields declined in most months for most gcms e g median monthly declines of 0 02 to 0 16 mm mon 1 r 0 09 to 0 46 mm mon 1 bf and 0 04 to 0 23 km3 mon 1 q in r85 due to the near elimination of snowpack e g median monthly swe of 0 to 0 3 mm in r85 and smaller rainfall changes e g median monthly changes of 49 to 37 in r85 overall these results indicated that basin wide mean annual q decline was driven largely by reductions in bf shifts across the upper basin in r45 and by more widespread mean annual declines in both bf and r in r85 3 5 warm season efficiency declines overshadow cool season efficiency increases we next performed analyses of the spatial variability in runoff and baseflow yields and the resulting impacts to q from each region first we compared relative changes in far future runoff and baseflow rbf efficiency fig 11 warming impacts were greater in the warm season declines across 90 of the domain vs 73 in the cool season due to the near elimination of snowfall and swe larger rbf efficiency changes in either season occurred at higher elevations and especially in the upper basin including warm season declines e g 0 15 at elevations 2 275 m in r85 in northern subbasins due to et increases that outpaced p increases fig s8 opposing trends occurred in the cool season for high elevations in the green e g increases up to 0 15 in r85 and upper colorado subbasins e g declines as low as 0 15 in r85 overall mean annual rbf efficiency trends were more reflective of the warm season changes with reductions across much of the crb reductions across 85 of the domain in r45 96 in r85 and accelerated declines in upper basin headwaters 0 03 in r45 and 0 06 in r85 on average across elevations 1953 m this further verified the increasing role of warming to reduce rbf yields from the upper basin near elimination of mean warm season snowfall and swe and increased mean esoil and tv in most months except for minor warm season rbf efficiency increases in some southwestern regions where p increased seasonal declines were relatively small in the lower basin due to lower initial rbf efficiencies in the baseline period we next assessed r and bf efficiency trends separately to track the role of seasonal changes fig 12 trends in r efficiency were more diverse between seasons and across regions than bf efficiency most of the upper basin 65 of area experienced a combined increase in cool season r efficiency and decline in warm season r efficiency with more prevalent cool season increase in the green and warm season decline in the san juan subbasins this was due to cool season rainfall and m increases following p increases that were enough to fuel both et and r in the more energy limited conditions at high elevations but more modest warm season rainfall increases leading to widespread warm season r efficiency decline in contrast r efficiency decreased in both seasons across the lower basin including warm season cool season declines across 70 52 of the area in r45 and across 99 88 in r85 cool season r efficiency trends over the entire crb were more variable between emissions scenarios than in the warm season due to the stronger spatial gradient of cool season p trends meanwhile vast areas had bf efficiency decline in both seasons 78 of the upper basin 81 of the lower basin annual rbf efficiency reductions in fig 11 were thus largely due to bf efficiency declines in both seasons in both emissions scenarios as well as r efficiency declines in the warm season under r85 hence cool season increases in r efficiency across the northwest were not enough to overcome declines in both r and bf efficiency for both seasons elsewhere we next compared the average annual efficiency trends across each source area to assess the relative effects of bf and r on q across the domain table 3 mean annual r efficiency declined on average across northeast subbasins by 3 to 10 across the upper colorado san juan and little colorado and increased elsewhere under r45 but had widespread decline under r85 by 1 to 21 for all subbasins except the grand canyon due to warm season reductions table s9 in the cases that r efficiency increases e g lower basin for r45 annual values were dominated by cool season conditions where p increased at a faster rate than et increases overall mean annual r efficiency declined across the upper basin in most gcms for both emissions scenarios but displayed opposite trends across lower basin between r45 and r85 median trends of 5 vs 4 fig s12 mean annual bf efficiency declined everywhere with larger declines towards the northeast than the northwest median trends of 13 in r45 and 23 in r85 in the upper colorado vs 9 and 20 in the green subbasin and stronger southward declines 24 to 60 across lower basin similarly mean annual rbf efficiency declined on average across all subbasins for both emissions scenarios overall bf and rbf efficiency declines led to mean annual q reductions from the upper basin 5 in r45 14 in r85 lower basin 11 in r45 25 in r85 and basin wide 6 in r45 18 in r85 warm season changes will thus have a sizable impact to reduce annual r efficiency from key upper basin headwaters that overshadow cool season increases during the far future with more widespread warm season impacts under higher emissions widespread bf efficiency and q declines in both emissions scenarios also indicated a more prevalent role of the warming driven decline in vertical moisture transport across much of the year 3 6 basin wide budget remained more contingent upon subbasins with the largest flow declines we next compared the relative roles of each subbasin in determining the basin wide streamflow budget in baseline conditions and how those roles evolved in the far future fig 13 shows the ensemble median of mean annual r and bf contributions to q at the crb outlet c or total r and bf in each grid cell per q as a percentage changes in mean annual c generally followed trends in mean annual p with increasing c towards the northwest but declines in the southeast e g average grid cell trend of 3 and 28 across the green and gila subbasins under r85 increases in c were largely confined to high elevations of the northwest e g 5 at 2 000 m across the green subbasins vs 22 at 2 000 m across all subbasins under r85 while low elevations had large c reductions due to declines in rbf efficiency the main contributors in the baseline were the upper colorado green san juan and gila and the lowest contributors were the lower colorado and little colorado subbasins total c bar plots in fig 13 far future changes in total c under r45 and r85 followed changes in mean annual p including increase across the green subbasin 2 and 4 decline across the upper colorado 1 and 2 while southward subbasins had less significant trends as a result the green subbasin became a slightly larger contributor in the far future over the upper colorado subbasin in both r45 and r85 total c of 35 and 38 in the green 35 and 36 in the upper colorado while other subbasins held the same rankings in both r45 and r85 strong gcm agreement in these trends indicated that northern subbasins continued as the major controls for the basin wide budget under climate change text s8 to explore this further we computed the annual pearson s correlation coefficients ρ between quantiles of annual q from different source areas see analyses for each gcm in text s9 fig 14 shows the annual ρ in the baseline and far future under r45 and r85 in the baseline flows at the crb outlet were most correlated with from highest to lowest ρ the upper colorado glen canyon and san juan subbasins in the far future potentials for high and low flows became increasingly synchronized with conditions in the northwest e g increases in ρ values computed between q from the green and other source areas for most gcms fig s18 and less synchronized with the northeast e g declines in ρ values computed between q from the upper colorado and other source areas for most gcms fig s19 correlation changes among subbasins were amplified for individual gcms as compared to the ensemble median text s9 this indicated an increasing probability for streamflow across the basin to reflect yearly high or low flow conditions in the green subbasin however flows from the upper and lower basins were still most correlated with eastern subbasins e g ρ value of 0 95 between upper basin and upper colorado q vs 0 92 between the upper basin and green q that experienced more substantial flow declines table 3 thus the capacity of any multi year pluvial events to replenish reservoirs will likely be diminished by warmer temperatures that reduce long term r and bf efficiencies and streamflow across most regions and especially in the northeast 4 discussion most climate change studies of the colorado river basin have focused on the upper basin due to the large amount of streamflow originating from this source area often emphasizing the streamflow sensitivity to changes in temperature and or precipitation prior studies have yielded a wide range of estimated climate impacts but most have showed a tendency towards reduced streamflow from the drying effects of warming lukas and payton 2020 in this study we tracked the hydrologic impacts of co occurring precipitation and temperature changes across the crb with an emphasis on the spatiotemporal processes leading to the streamflow declines by inspecting the transformation of meteorological forcing changes into different water balance components we attributed the streamflow declines in a spatially explicit fashion discussed next 4 1 spatial variations in snowpack reduction runoff efficiency and streamflow prior assessments across the western us have concluded that historical warming has reduced swe by increasing the frequency and duration of melt mote et al 2005 mote 2006 clow 2010 and by reducing the likelihood of snowfall knowles et al 2006 we found diminished swe due primarily to the snow to rain transition in northwest regions of the upper basin combined with overall precipitation declines elsewhere average monthly melt in the upper basin increased towards the end of the cool season indicating that warming enhanced m and contributed to swe declines this is in line with earlier findings of the strong negative influence of cool season melt events on swe across the southwestern us in the 20th century mote et al 2005 our results show a continuation of these trends into the future such that temperature enhanced snowmelt during the cool season and year round snowfall reductions could lead to larger reductions in snowpack from key headwater regions in the upper basin furthermore the occurrence of snowpack in the lower basin is at much greater risk than in the upper basin due to year round snowfall declines in a region with less substantial swe these findings are consistent with previous gcm based vic efforts cl2007 br2012 and from cmip5 projections that were bias corrected using snowpack observations lute et al 2015 prior analyses also observed runoff efficiency declines in the upper basin e g mccabe et al 2017 nowak et al 2012 hoerling et al 2019 we confirmed future declines on average across the upper basin in most gcms for both emissions scenarios but found opposite trends in runoff efficiency in the lower basin e g increase in r45 decrease in r85 our analysis of seasonal runoff efficiency enabled a deeper understanding of the differing behavior between the regions cool season runoff efficiency increased across much of the crb and by greater amounts in northern subbasins green upper colorado with some decline southward under r85 warm season runoff efficiency on the other hand decreased in most regions and with larger declines in the northeast upper colorado san juan this suggests that precipitation shifts in the warm season will lead to substantial reductions in annual runoff efficiency from key source areas of the upper basin with more widespread impacts under higher emissions at the basin wide scale we also found that snowmelt declines combined with increased bare soil evaporation led to widespread declines in baseflow efficiencies which in turn caused total annual rbf efficiency to decline in both emissions scenarios this indicated an increasing role of warming temperatures to reduce r and bf yields from key regions of the upper basin this is consistent with observed reductions in snowfall fractions during 20th century warming with the largest reductions in march which has historically been the major snow producing month knowles et al 2006 recent findings of milly and dunne 2020 similarly concluded that total r across the upper basin has been declining due to warming enhanced et mainly driven by snow loss and consequent decrease of reflection of solar radiation their assessment reflected future changes in temperature not changes in precipitation hence the sensitivity of total runoff in the crb will be additionally dependent on warm season precipitation changes 4 2 spatial attributes of basin wide streamflow decline to inform management we also identified that the relative importance of each subbasin in terms of runoff and baseflow contributions to the basin wide streamflow remained similar between the baseline and far future periods contributions increased the most in headwater subbasins green and upper colorado due to mean annual p increases despite the larger snow to rain transition similar to the millennium drought 2000 2012 xiao et al 2018 northeast subbasins green upper colorado and san juan rivers were the top contributors in the baseline and far future and largely responsible for the basin wide q decline due to snowpack reductions and evaporative increases for most gcms and in both emissions scenarios paleo reconstructions suggested that multi year periods of high flows in either the san juan or green river subbasins can offset low flows in the other areas of the crb woodhouse et al 2006 given our results showing multidecadal q declines simulated in northeast subbasins however the spatial attributes of the millennium drought are likely to be reinforced during the 21st century pearson correlation coefficients between time series of streamflow quantiles from different source areas confirmed the spatial attribution of streamflow declines we found an increase in correlations between conditions in the green river and other source areas for most gcms indicating an increased influence of this subbasin on streamflow elsewhere under climate change despite these trends q from the upper and lower basin and at the basin wide outlet were still most correlated with flows from the upper colorado subbasin that experienced more substantial flow declines this indicated that even with the more widespread synchronization to the green subbasin the capacity of high flow periods in this region to replenish reservoirs and offset losses elsewhere will be diminished by warming temperatures that reduce total runoff efficiencies and diminish long term streamflow amounts our results suggest that conditions in the green and upper colorado subbasins will remain as reliable indicators of basin wide water supply in any given year to help inform basin management decisions by considering the spatial contrasts of runoff and baseflow efficiencies water managers can better plan for anticipated subbasin responses as the future unfolds in the crb spatial attributions of streamflow changes also help to clarify which hydrologic processes e g warm season snowfall reductions enhanced evaporative losses changes in seasonal runoff efficiency were responsible for the streamflow declines under warming in specific subbasins strong contrasts are evident through the spatially distributed approach used here across different regions for instance among high elevation areas in the green and upper colorado rivers resulting from variations in underlying process interactions this information can be used to provide guidance to the decision making processes in the colorado river including determining the necessity and degree of climate change mitigation and adaptation cramer et al 2014 as an example the hydrologic outcomes from subbasins in the upper basin have been incorporated in the modeling and analysis efforts of the arizona reconsultation committee arc to support decision making e g adaptive management strategies on the risks vulnerabilities and impacts to arizona s colorado river supply the arc formed to assess and address the renegotiation of severe drought shortage plans in the lower basin and is composed of delegates representing arizona s water users and policy makers including elected officials from many sectors and interests e g members of arizona legislature chambers agricultural municipal and industrial sector representatives tribal nations the arizona water banking authority and non government organizations of the central arizona groundwater replenishment district 5 conclusions we employed a simulation framework using the variable infiltration capacity model that incorporated a number of recent improvements based on satellite and in situ observations and climate forcings derived from statistically downscaled outputs of selected general circulation models modeling improvements allowed for good simulation performance over the historical record with respect to naturalized streamflow estimates in different subbasins as with other modeling activities however uncertainties remain with respect to internal hydrologic conditions for which we did not conduct extensive comparisons to observations nonetheless xiao et al 2022 extended this effort to include comparisons with remotely sensed snow cover and land surface temperature finding good agreement that build confidence in the vic simulations of the crb hydrology based on our modeling framework we identified differential climate change impacts across the colorado river basin linked to future warming trends and spatial gradients in seasonal precipitation shifts the major conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows 1 results indicated a high level of confidence of widespread streamflow declines in future scenarios this was due to an increasing role of warming temperatures in reducing runoff and baseflow yields from headwaters areas through the eradication of warm season snowfall and year round increase in evaporative losses snowfall reductions were largely due to snow to rain transition in the upper basin and overall precipitation decline across the lower basin 2 subbasin contributions to the mean annual streamflow budget did not appreciably change under future scenarios when present anomalously high precipitation and runoff in northwestern regions green and glen canyon subbasins did not offset declines in mean annual runoff and baseflow efficiency elsewhere thus leading to basin wide streamflow reductions 3 the potential for high or low flows in any given year became increasingly correlated with the conditions in the green subbasin where rainfall was projected to significantly increase but streamflow from the upper and lower basins and at the main crb outlet were still more synchronized with the upper colorado subbasin that had more substantial streamflow declines 4 the spatial attributions of streamflow declines identified in this study were similar to conditions during the millennium drought when wetter conditions in northwestern regions did not offset drier conditions elsewhere leading to overall streamflow declines this suggests that a reinforcement of these relations will occur under future climate scenarios overall our results indicated that while there could be an increased probability for streamflow to reflect any multi year pluvial events in the northwest the capacity of these events to replenish reservoirs and offset losses elsewhere will be diminished by warmer temperatures that reduce long term streamflow efficiency nonetheless the individual subbasin roles on the overall water budget did not change under projected climate conditions indicating that managers can expect that the green and upper colorado subbasins will continue as useful predictors of downstream water resources in any given year as a result the spatial attributions identified here can provide critical information for water management in the colorado river basin further the methodology can be applied for climate change impact studies in other large river basins 6 data availability statement python code for the ptri

2312,the implementation of best management practices bmps is crucial for protecting and restoring watersheds from nonpoint source nps pollution bmp placement plans with a high pollution reduction to cost ratio are highly desired by decision makers nevertheless few studies tackled such a ratio optimization problem in their efforts to identify bmp placement plans bmp planning also faces challenges in handling inherent uncertainties and estimating nps pollution loads to address these gaps a simulation based inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming sicmfp model was proposed for supporting the placement of bmps this model was developed by integrating the export coefficient model ecm compound topographic index cti inexact programming and mixed integer programming within a fractional programming framework sicmfp extends the capability of previous bmp placement models by optimizing the ratio of conflicting objectives and handling uncertain parameters based on interval theory and credibility measure it can also conveniently simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution loads through the ecm and efficiently identify potential wetland sites using cti sicmfp was applied to plan bmp placement in the luan river basin located in northern china the results showed that sicmfp could provide bmp placement plans with the optimal system efficiency between pollution reductions and cost savings under different credibility levels these plans could help decision makers gain in depth insights into the tradeoffs between expected system efficiency and the risk of constraint violation as the credibility level rises from 0 6 to 0 9 the optimal ratio between pollution reduction and cost declined from 0 88 1 66 kg 103 yuan to 0 70 1 15 kg 103yuan whereas the costs and pollution reductions increased compared with the least cost single objective model sicmfp could lead to more pollution reductions and higher system efficiency the developed sicmfp approach can also be extended to address the ratio optimization problems of water pollution management in other watersheds abbreviations bmp best management practice cti compound topographic index dem

uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water eutrophication caused by excess nutrient inputs threatens ecological integrity drinking water safety and socio economic development in watersheds qiu et al 2019 lintern et al 2020 xue et al 2022 nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus originate from either point or nonpoint sources because point source pollution is well controlled in many countries nonpoint source nps pollution has become a key cause of the deterioration of water environments cai et al 2018 li et al 2022 best management practices bmps such as parallel terraces and constructed wetlands are effective approaches for preventing nps pollution from entering water bodies lee et al 2002 qi altinakar 2011 liu et al 2018 rallapalli et al 2022 nevertheless the identification of the optimal bmp placement schemes faces many challenges one challenge is to analyze the tradeoff between pollution reductions and cost savings in bmp planning another challenge is to deal with uncertainties which can be derived from the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of pollutants the subjectivity of decision makers and deviations in data measurement and collection wang huang 2015 tan et al 2016 therefore it is desirable to develop an efficient systematic approach that can balance conflicting goals and handle uncertainties in the planning of bmp placement many researchers have made efforts to provide bmp placement plans by optimal methods zhang chui 2018 lintern et al 2020 liu et al 2020 for example dai et al 2016 proposed an inexact programming model for bmp optimization to control the nutrient inputs in lake dianchi in southwest china at the lowest cost cai et al 2018 developed a multi objective programming model based on the export coefficient to obtain the optimal bmp placement plan and land use pattern most of the previous studies have reflected both economic and environmental concerns in bmp placement some of these studies considered economic costs as an objective function and simply transformed environmental goals into constraints dai et al 2016 others relied on multi objective programming mop approaches to balance multiple targets such as cost saving and pollution reduction maringanti et al 2009 cai et al 2018 geng et al 2019 the mop models were usually solved by turning multiple objectives into a single measure or by generating a pareto front with various solutions turning multiple objectives into a single measure often encountered difficulties in weighting multiple objectives meanwhile generating a pareto front with various solutions was computationally expensive and created additional difficulties for decision makers in selecting an implementation plan from solutions more importantly previous bmp placement studies primarily focused on cost inputs and or environmental benefit outputs these studies lose their advantages when the objective is to maximize system efficiency which is represented as the ratio of environmental benefit outputs to cost inputs fractional programming fp is an effective method for tackling ratio optimization problems where the objective is the quotient of two functions such as cost time cost volume or output input stancu minasian 1999 zhu et al 2014 salary pour sharif abad et al 2020 it can provide an unprejudiced measure of system efficiency represented as output input ratios and effectively optimize marginal system benefits in recent years fp has been successfully applied in many fields e g resource management financial planning and production planning because of its advantage of balancing conflicting objectives zhou et al 2018 ren et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2018 balanced economic growth against climate change mitigation by an inexact fractional programming model meanwhile tan and zhang 2018 optimized agricultural water use efficiency using a robust fractional programming method these studies proved that fp was effective in measuring system efficiency and could be a promising tool for optimizing the system efficiency of bmp placement nevertheless to ensure that the discharged pollution load does not exceed the allowable amount simulation models are also needed in bmp planning to estimate the pollution load among simulation models the export coefficient model is popular and has the potential to be incorporated into the fp framework due to its low data requirements and high computational efficiency ding et al 2010 rong et al 2017 moreover there are many uncertain parameters in bmp placement such as nutrient discharge permits bmp costs and nutrient reduction efficiency recently researchers have proposed many inexact optimization methods to support environmental management under uncertainty tan et al 2010 wang huang 2013 dong et al 2015 li et al 2019 among them interval linear programming ilp is a useful approach for dealing with uncertainties as it does not require distributional information for input parameters huang et al 1995 fan 2012 tan et al 2017 additionally fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp can handle epistemic uncertainties represented as fuzzy membership functions which effectively reveals the satisfaction degrees of fuzzy constraints zhang huang 2011 dai et al 2016 the ilp and fccp methods have been successfully applied to water resource and environmental management including bmp placement rong et al 2017 ma et al 2020 in addition to the uncertain parameters some decision variables in bmp placement models such as the number of rural sewage treatment stations and biogas digesters may only be represented as integers it is necessary to address both uncertainties and mixed integer optimization problems in bmp placement however few studies have identified the optimal placement of bmps from the perspective of system efficiency optimization while handling the inherent uncertainty in practice bmp placement plans with high system efficiency between pollution reduction and cost are of great interest to decision makers this is because these plans tend to have higher marginal environmental benefits and are more cost effective moreover complex issues involving uncertainties ratio objectives and mixed integer variables are prevalent in bmp placement and other real world cases there was a lack of methods that could simultaneously tackle ratio optimization problems with mixed integer variables and handle uncertainties represented as fuzzy sets and interval numbers in addition determining the spatiotemporal distribution of nps pollution loads and allowable bmp placement levels is an essential step in bmp placement optimization few methods could effectively incorporate the nps pollution simulation model and the identification methods of bmp i e wetlands into the optimization framework to remedy the above mentioned deficiencies an inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming icmfp method was first proposed by coupling ilp mixed integer programming fccp and fp it can balance the dual objectives of two aspects reflecting the system optimal ratio while handling uncertainties and mixed integer optimization problems subsequently a simulation based inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming sicmfp model for bmp placement was developed by integrating the export coefficient model ecm and compound topographic index cti into the icmfp framework sicmfp improved over previous bmp placement models by optimizing system efficiency represented as the ratio objective and handling uncertain parameters in both simulation and optimization sicmfp could also effectively simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution loads using ecm and identify potential wetland sites by cti to demonstrate its effectiveness the developed method was applied to bmp placement in the luan river basin with the aim of mitigating nps pollution and saving costs the solutions generated can help decision makers to identify the bmp placement plan with the highest system efficiency between pollution reductions and cost savings it can also provide a detailed analysis of the tradeoff between system efficiency and the risks of constraint violation 2 complexities of non point source pollution management as an important source of nutrients nps pollution has a profoundly negative impact on the health and economic productivity of aquatic ecosystems the management of nps pollution is complicated because it is associated with multiple systems e g agriculture hydrology economy and requires reasonable placement of various pollution control measures conflicting goals among various stakeholders and inherent uncertainties further complicate the management of nps pollution to handle these complexities the following problems must be addressed what measures can effectively mitigate nps pollution how to balance the conflicting goals of multiple stakeholders how can one deal with the inherent uncertainties in natural and economic systems bmps are effective tools in mitigating nps pollution and can be divided into the categories of structural and nonstructural measures fig 1 shows the sources of nps pollution and the implementation of bmps in watersheds nps pollution primarily originates from rural living livestock breeding and the use of land e g farmland forest and grassland nonstructural bmps such as fertilizer management and tillage management are used to reduce nps pollution loads at the source structural bmps such as vegetative filter strips and wetlands are used to control the migration of pollutants after they leave the source areas the implementation of bmps has been challenged by conflicting economic social and environmental implications on the one hand the implementation of bmps can improve the water quality in watersheds and maintain ecological balance in water bodies on the other hand their implementation imposes additional costs on the watershed managers and or agricultural producers there are also significant differences in the costs and environmental benefits of different bmps and their combinations these differences further increase the complexity of bmp placement if these complexities are not considered uneconomical bmp placement plans may be developed making it difficult to achieve the given water quality targets with limited budgets moreover there is inherent uncertainty in bmp placement these uncertainties are caused by complex hydro meteorological and biochemical processes as well as by spatial variability in pollutant transport and transformation uncertainties in bmp placement are primarily reflected in the objective function and constraint coefficients which are closely associated with realistic economic and environmental issues for instance the effects of bmps on pollution reduction and the export coefficients of nps pollution vary with topographic and hydrological conditions bmp costs fluctuate with the implementation location and market prices the allowable discharge permit also varies with the environmental capacity and the preferences of the decision makers meanwhile in bmp placement planning some decision variables such as the number of rural sewage treatment stations and septic tanks may be integers uncertainties and mixed integer variables increase the challenges of bmp placement and the risk of failure in decision making given the complexities and challenges involved in bmp planning the key issue in this study is how to determine the optimal placement plan of bmps under uncertainty to achieve maximum system efficiency between pollution reduction and cost to address this issue a systematic approach is highly desired to balance these conflicting goals and identify cost effective bmp placement plans under uncertainty 3 methodology an icmfp method is first developed by integrating the ilp mixed integer programming and fccp into the fp framework icmfp can address ratio optimization problems with mixed integer variables it can also tackle multiple uncertainties in the form of fuzzy sets and intervals thereafter a sicmfp model for bmp placement is proposed by coupling the icmfp model ecm and cti the ecm is used to simulate nps pollution loads and the cti is adopted to obtain the allowable placement level of wetlands the results of ecm and cti are incorporated into the icmfp model as constraint coefficients after determining the coefficients using ecm and cti the icmfp model is adopted to generate cost effective bmp placement plans under uncertainty the framework of this methodology is presented in fig 2 3 1 inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming previously the interval fractional programming ifp method integrated fp with ilp was proposed by zhu et al 2014 to tackle ratio optimizations under uncertainty where the parameter distribution information is unknown and could merely exist as interval values nevertheless in real world problems some of the decision variables are integers which could not be handled by ifp moreover some parameters such as available water and allowable pollution discharge amount are related to environmental loading capacities which may subject to human judgments they are more suitable for the expression of fuzzy membership functions rather than interval numbers xu qin 2010 to address these issues an icmfp method is developed to optimize the system efficiency represented as output input ratios tackle mixed integer optimization problems and handle fuzzy and interval uncertainties the icmfp model can be written as 1a max f j 1 t p j x j j t 1 k p j y j α j 1 t c j x j j t 1 k c j y j β subject to 1b c r j 1 t a ij x ij j t 1 k a ij y ij b

a fuzzy number on the right side of the credibility constraints eq 1b and λ i is the predetermined credibility level that reveals the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy constraint assume that b i is

a significant credibility level should be larger than 0 5 thus the credibility constraints can be calculated as 3 2 b i b i r i 2 b i b i λ i which can be transformed into an equivalent equation as

icmfp model under a certain credibility level λ i using the branch and bound algorithm step 5 repeat step 2 4 under different credibility levels and generate the final solutions 3 2 sicmfp for bmp placement a sicmfp model for bmp placement is developed to mitigate nps pollution this model includes ecm for simulating pollution loads cti for identifying potential wetland locations and an icmfp method for optimizing ratio objectives the sicmfp model aims to obtain a bmp implementation plan with an optimal pollution reduction to cost ratio under interval and fuzzy uncertainties 3 2 1 improved export coefficient model the ecm is based on the idea that the pollution loads exported from a watershed equal to the sum of the losses from individual sources it can be used for simulating the annual nitrogen and phosphorus loads from nps pollution johnes 1996 the improved ecm proposed by ding et al 2010 can reflect the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of pollutant load per unit area exported from the same sources according to the improved ecm the tn and tp loads from nps pollution can be calculated as 7 f n k j α β e n j k a j k 8 f p k j α β e p j k a j k where j is the index for npss f n k and f p k respectively denote the annual tn load and tp load discharged from npss in sub basin k kg e n j k and e p j k are respectively the nitrogen export coefficient and phosphorus export coefficient of

head bird or person α is the precipitation factor β is the terrain factor α and β are associated with the spatial grid which is set to be 28 m 28 m according to the digital elevation map dem the precipitation factor is equal to the spatial impact factor α s times the temporal impact factor α t and the nitrogen and phosphorus loads exported to rivers are positively correlated with precipitation therefore the α is calculated as follows 9 α α s α t r a r l l r a r f r a f r m where l is the pollutant discharge for a given year kg l is the multi year average pollutant discharge of the watershed kg r denotes the annual average precipitation of the watershed in a certain year mm r a denotes the precipitation in the spatial grid a in a certain year mm r m is the multi year average precipitation of the whole watershed mm f r is a function representing the correlation between precipitation and pollutant discharge which is obtained from the precipitation and water quality data the terrain factor β can be defined as 10 β m θ a m θ 11 m θ a m θ e θ a f e θ f θ a f θ f where θ a is the slope of the grid a θ is the average slope of the whole watershed m θ a represents the relationship between pollution load and slope e and f are regression parameters which are respectively estimated as 0 1881 and 0 6104 ding et al 2010 3 2 2 identification of potential wetland locations agricultural and unused lands that can collect runoff have been identified as suitable sites for wetland construction babbar sebens et al 2013 the cti identifies areas prone to water accumulation based on topographic features gessler et al 2000 the cti is a steady state wetness index that is a function of the slope and specific upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction it is defined as 12 cti i n a s tan θ where θ is the slope and a s is the special basin area sites with high cti values are considered potential locations for wetlands because they contribute to water accumulation there are several steps to identifying potential wetland locations for each sub basin i extract the river network and divide the sub basins based on dem ii calculate the cti values based on gis technology iii create a new layer with cti pixels located only on agricultural and unused land iv convert the new raster layer into polygons and remove the polygons whose size is below the minimum area and v obtain potential locations and allowable placement levels of wetlands in each sub basin which will be input into the optimization model 3 2 3 optimal model formulation based on the simulation results of nps pollution loads and the allowable placement levels of wetlands an optimization model for bmp placement is developed the decision variables are the placement levels of different bmps the objective function is to maximize the ratio of nps pollution reduction to cost the reductions in nps pollution loads are calculated by adding the reductions in tn and tp loads this is because the tn and tp load reductions bear the same importance and were given equal weights the detailed objective function is organized as follows 13a max f

agricultural nutrients and conservation tillage are set to 0 the minimum placement levels of bmps that will be effective for many years such as the filter strips and wetlands are set to the current placement levels the maximum placement levels are determined by the types of bmps and the local situation the maximum placement level of the wetland can be determined by the potential wetland sites in each sub basin which are identified by cti the placement levels of bmps used in farmland should not exceed the farmland area 4 nitrogen reduction constraints the reduction in the nitrogen load should

river basin in chengde city is located in the northeastern part of hebei province china with east longitude between 115 54 119 20 and north latitude between 40 12 and 42 40 fig 3 it covers an area of 26 500 km2 with a riverbank length of 374 km it includes the main stream of the luan river and six main tributaries the luan river basin has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual temperature of 5 12 an annual evaporation of 950 1150 mm and an annual rainfall of 563 7 mm the overall trend of rainfall increases from north to south and is mainly concentrated in july to august cheng et al 2018 the terrain in the study area varies greatly the general terrain slopes from northwest to southeast basically in line with the flow direction of the river the luan river has played an important role in water use for agriculture life industry and ecology in the basin in addition as an important water source for beijing and tianjin luan river is of great importance to environmental protection and climate regulation in these areas the water pollution in the luan river basin of chengde city is mainly caused by urban sewage industrial wastewater and nps pollution in the past few decades many measures have been implemented in the luan river basin to reduce point source pollution including building sewage treatment plants and establishing a pollution discharge permit system these measures have improved the water quality of the watershed at some monitoring sites the concentration of cod and nh4 n has been decreasing in recent years however with the continuous reduction in point source pollution nps pollution caused by excessive application of fertilizers soil erosion and random discharge of rural sewage has become the main pollution source of the water environment chengde city has suffered serious soil erosion problems due to the steep terrain slopes and low soil quality a lot of pollutants enter the water body with soil erosion deteriorating the water environment on some sections of the river the concentration of tp and tn has shown an upward trend or even exceed the water quality standard set by the government in the 14th five year plan of environmental protection of chengde city it is required to reduce the amount of discharged pollution load and make the water quality of each monitoring point meet the standards set by the government meanwhile the local government actively promotes the implementation of bmps to improve the water environment such as the reduction of fertilizer use centralized treatment of pollution load from the breeding industry ecological restoration of rivers and transformation of cultivated land with steep slopes 4 2 data collection and processing the basic data used in this study mainly included the land use map and dem precipitation data at observation sites bmp costs nutrients reduction efficiency of bmps maximum allowable bmp placement levels the current bmp placement levels export coefficients of tn and tp allowable amount of discharged nutrients in each sub basin and the amount of population and livestock all input parameters of the optimization model were interval numbers except the allowable discharge amount of nutrients and the maximum placement level of the rural sewage treatment station the dem land use map tn and tp loads discharged from point sources and the current bmps placement levels were obtained through actual investigation in chengde ecology and environmental bureau the amount of population and livestock were obtained from the chengde statistical yearbook chengde 2019 the rainfall data were obtained from the website of the national meteorological administration in this study six bmps that are promoted in the luan river basin were considered including agriculture nutrient management 20 30 reduction in fertilizer use conservation tillage management terraces rural sewage treatment stations vegetative filter strips 10 m 30 m and wetlands the placement levels of these bmps in each sub basin should not exceed the maximum placement levels the annual allowable discharge amount of tn and tp in each sub basin were fuzzy sets which were determined according to the current discharge amount of tn and tp from nps pollution and suggested reduction targets the costs and pollution reduction efficiency of bmps were obtained from field investigation and literature review dai et al 2016 cai et al 2018 which are presented in table 1 the export coefficients of tn and tp from different sources were obtained from the literature review huang et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 which are shown in table 2 4 3 results and discussions 4 3 1 simulation of nonpoint source pollution load the tn and tp loads discharged from npss in 2019 were estimated using the ecm the impacts of precipitation and terrain heterogeneity on the nps pollution discharges were reflected by the introduction of precipitation and terrain factors based on the dem the luan river basin in chengde city was divided into 23 sub basins the spatial distributions of the precipitation and terrain factors are shown in fig 4 the precipitation factor of tn changed from 0 61 to 0 87 and that of tp changed from 0 57 to 0 81 the precipitation factors for both tn and tp in the study area increased from north to south this is mainly because the precipitation in the basin gradually increased from north to south the terrain factor ranged from 0 to 2 4 with no obvious change in spatial trend owing to the smaller gradient the slope factor upstream of sub basin 1 was lower than that in the other districts fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of tn and tp loads and the contributions to tn and tp loads from three categories of pollution sources including rural living livestock breeding and land use in each sub basin the contributions of land use to tn load were the largest and the contributions to tn from rural living were the least rural living contributed the most tp load in each sub basin whereas the least contributions to tp load came from either livestock or land use the export intensity of tp and tn would show the same trend in space that is the export intensity downstream of the study area would be higher than that upstream on the one hand this is because there is a higher density of people and livestock downstream than upstream on the other hand the downstream districts have more precipitation and a greater gradient than those upstream resulting in higher precipitation and terrain factors 4 3 2 bmp optimization results under different credibility levels with the goal of maximizing the ratio of nps pollution reduction to cost the placement levels of various bmps in each sub basin were obtained under different credibility levels the credibility level in this study was used to quantify the violation risk of the allowable amount of discharged nutrients a higher credibility level is associated with a less allowable amount of discharged nutrients and lower violation risk a fuzzy semantic scale was developed by jimenez et al 2007 to distinguish credibility levels from λ 0 to λ 1 based on the semantic scale the allowable amounts of nutrients discharged under three credibility levels λ 0 6 0 75 and 0 9 were considered fig 6 presents the upper and lower bounds of the bmp placement levels under different credibility levels when the credibility level rises the placement levels of rural sewage treatment stations vegetative filter strips and wetlands would increase to mitigate the pollution nevertheless the placement levels of the other bmps i e agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces would remain unchanged when the credibility level increased from 0 6 to 0 9 this is because these three bmps can only be utilized to reduce the nps pollution discharged from farmland the reductions in pollution loads from farmland reached their maximum value when the credibility level was low λ 0 6 moreover conservation tillage management and terraces would approach the maximum placement levels at a low credibility level this means that these two bmps would be prioritized for pollution mitigation when compared with the other bmps these preferred bmps may also be more cost effective as the model aims to maximize the ratio between pollution reduction and cost the number of rural sewage treatment stations would be equal to the maximum placement level at a high credibility level λ 0 9 except for sub basins 4 21 and 23 however the size of wetlands and vegetative filter strips can still be expanded in most sub basins this could be attributed to the fact that the rural sewage treatment station was more cost effective than wetlands and vegetative filter strips in mitigating nps pollution from rural living and livestock areas with a cti index greater than 10 were considered suitable for wetland construction in total 556 potential sites in the watershed were identified for wetland construction fig 7 the exact locations of wetlands should be further determined according to their potential locations and the surrounding environment fig 8 presents the upper and lower bounds of bmp costs under different credibility levels under a certain credibility level the costs of wetlands and rural sewage treatment stations would be higher than that of other bmps whereas the agricultural nutrient and conservative tillage management would be lower than those of other bmps for instance when the credibility level is 0 6 the costs of wetlands and rural sewage treatment stations would be 13 3 21 9 108 yuan and 14 0 28 8 108 yuan respectively the costs of agricultural nutrient management and conservative tillage management would be 0 35 0 90 108 yuan and 0 43 0 50 108 yuan respectively this indicated that compared with other bmps more money should be invested in the construction of wetlands and rural sewage treatment stations as the credibility level increases the total bmp costs would increase from 31 0 67 9 108 yuan to 65 0 118 2 108 yuan this means that as the credibility level increases there would be a greater cost to alleviate the risk of the pollution loads exceeding the discharge permits among all the bmps the costs of agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces would remain unchanged as the credibility level increases whereas that of the other three bmps would keep increasing this illustrates that priority should be given to the implementation of bmps such as agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces when these bmps reach their maximum placement levels the placement of filter strips and wetlands would increase to prevent the pollution loads from exceeding the allowable discharge amount fig 9 shows the reductions in tn and tp loads from npss hereinafter referred to as nps pollution load as well as the nps pollution reduction per unit cost under different credibility levels similar to bmp costs the reductions in nps pollution load would increase as the credibility level increases on the contrary when the credibility level rises the reduction in nps pollution per unit cost would keep decreasing from 0 88 1 66 kg 103 yuan to 0 70 1 15 kg 103 yuan this is primarily because as the credibility level increases the placement levels of less cost effective bmps such as wetlands and vegetative filter strips would also increase to mitigate against the pollution loads leading to lower system efficiency nps pollution reduction per unit cost these results also revealed the changing tradeoff between the expected system efficiency and the violation risk of fuzzy credibility constraints fig 10 presents the system efficiency in each sub basin under different credibility levels among all the sub basins the system efficiency of sub basin 10 was the highest followed by those of sub basins 3 and 22 this indicated that in the case of limited funds bmps should be implemented in sub basins 10 3 and 22 as a priority the system efficiency of sub basins 13 and 14 would be lower than that of other sub basins under a fixed credibility level this means that more investment would be required to reduce the same amount of nps pollution in these areas than in the other sub basins 4 3 3 comparisons to alternative models to further illustrate the effects and advantages of the sicmfp in bmp placement a simulation based credibility constrained mixed integer sicmp was established where cost minimization was the only objective the solutions obtained from sicmfp and sicmp were both interval numbers which enabled decision makers to select bmp placement plans within the solution ranges when the bmp placement levels varied within the ranges of interval solutions the bmp costs nps pollution reductions and nps pollution reduction per unit cost also fluctuated correspondingly within the ranges of their solutions consequently various decision alternatives could be generated by changing different solution combinations in this study four types of typical alternatives combining the upper and lower values of bmp placement levels were selected for comparison table 3 the alternatives with the highest system efficiency a1 lowest system efficiency a2 largest nps pollution reduction a3 and lowest cost a4 the typical alternatives obtained from sicmfp and sicmp are both labeled a1 a4 according to the corresponding solution combinations fig 11 presents the nps pollution reductions bmp costs and nps pollution reduction per unit cost of these typical alternatives obtained from the sicmfp and sicmp under a certain credibility level and the same type of alternative although the costs obtained from sicmp would be slightly less than those of sicmfp the pollution reductions and pollution reduction per unit cost generated by sicmfp would be higher in particular at a credibility level of 0 75 the pairs with the same setting such as a1 in sicmfp and a1 in sicmp could be regarded as examples for comparison the costs pollution reductions and pollution reduction per unit cost in the sicmfp were 46 7 51 3 108 yuan 5 61 6 33 106 kg and 1 09 1 36 kg 103 yuan respectively while those in the sicmp were 46 2 50 8 108 yuan 5 31 5 99 106 kg and 1 05 1 30 kg 103 yuan respectively these comparison results indicate that although the alternatives obtained in sicmfp would require more costs than those in sicmp they would lead to more environmental benefits and notably improve the system efficiency moreover comparing two magnitudes representing conflicting goals can better reflect real world problems with multiple objectives and stakeholders than simply considering each using quotient measures the ranking results of the decision alternatives would be clearer and more significant than mop methods therefore compared with the sicmp the sicmfp could better address the issues associated with practical bmp placement by optimizing the ratio between the criteria of two magnitudes 4 3 4 implementation and policy implication the sicmfp can improve and guide bmp placement in terms of bmp costs nps pollution reductions and system efficiency it can provide multiple alternatives for decision makers according to their expectations of pollution reduction and investment cost risk tolerance and local realistic conditions in detail decision makers with different preferences could further choose bmp placement plans within the solution ranges obtained from the sicmfp four types of typical alternatives within the solution ranges were analyzed in this study fig 11 alternative a1 is suitable for decision makers who expect a high nps pollution reduction per unit cost when this alternative is adopted the agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces should take the upper bound values whereas the rural sewage treatment stations wetlands and vegetative filter strips should take the lower bound values alternative a3 is a desirable choice for decision makers who pursue maximum nps pollution reductions regardless of cost where all bmp activities would get their upper bound values alternative a2 was not recommended because it was inferior to a3 in terms of costs pollution reductions and system efficiency alternative a4 may interest decision makers with a low budget where all bmp activities are recommended to take their lower bound values under the same type of alternative a higher credibility level indicated a lower violation risk of the pollution loads exceeding the discharge permits resulting in higher costs nps pollution reductions and lower system efficiency when decision makers are risk averse higher bmp placement levels would be adopted leading to higher costs and lower system efficiency in comparison when the decision makers are risk neutral or aggressive alternatives associated with lower costs and higher system efficiency would be obtained but the risk of exceeding pollution discharge permits would increase simultaneously in this study the discharge permits for tn and tp discharged from npss were specific to each sub basin sub basin scenario in some districts a global pollution discharge permit was used throughout the watershed entire watershed scenario table 4 presents the differences in nps pollution reductions bmp costs and system efficiencies of these two discharge permit scenarios the upper and lower bounds of nps pollution reductions and system efficiency in the entire watershed scenario would be higher than those in the sub basin scenario and bmp costs would be lower this is mainly because in the entire watershed scenario discharge permits could be shifted across the sub basins and more bmps would be adopted in the sub basins with higher cost efficiency in general the entire watershed scenario can save costs and improve the system efficiency nevertheless it should be noted that the risk of the pollution discharge amount exceeding the environmental capacity may increase under the entire watershed scenario in sub basins with lower nps pollution reduction per unit cost this affects the fairness of resource allocation and further hinders the coordinated development of the economy and society in sub basins this study is a novel attempt at identifying the optimal placement of bmps under uncertainty from the perspective of ratio optimization this could be improved in future attempts from two aspects first the simulated accuracy of ecm was lower than that of the distributed model such as the soil and water model the icmfp model can be coupled with more accurate pollutant simulation models to determine the optimal location of the bmps second bmp marginal costs in this study were assumed to be fixed in the real world the marginal cost will change with the bmp placement levels thus nonlinear cost functions could be utilized in the optimization framework in a future study 5 conclusions it is of great significance to develop an advanced model to support best management practice bmp placement from the perspective of optimizing the ratio between reducing pollutants and saving costs to address the ratio optimization problem involving mixed integer variables under uncertainty an inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming icmfp method was first developed by coupling inexact programming mixed integer programming and fractional programming thereafter a simulation based inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming sicmfp model was developed for bmp placement by integrating the export coefficient model ecm compound topographic index cti and icmfp in the integrated method the ecm was utilized to estimate nitrogen and phosphorous loads from nonpoint sources npss and the cti was used to identify potential sites for wetland construction the sicmfp model improved over previous bmp placement models by optimizing the ratio between pollution reduction and cost it could also address the mixed integer optimization problems and uncertainties involved in bmp placement in addition sicmfp could provide detailed tradeoffs between expected system efficiency represented as the ratio objective and the risks of constraint violation this approach was used in bmp placement in the luan river basin to demonstrate its applicability the results of the nps pollution load estimation indicated that rural living would contribute the most tp load in each sub basin and land use would be the largest contributor to tn loads the export intensities of tp and tn downstream of the study area were higher than those upstream the optimization results show that sicmfp can provide bmp placement plans with the highest system efficiency between pollution reduction and cost under different credibility levels these plans were obtained by handling the tradeoffs between cost and pollution reduction and balancing the expected system efficiency and the risks of constraint violation compared with other bmps conservation tillage management and terraces are more cost effective for mitigating nps pollution the rural sewage treatment station was more cost effective than wetlands and vegetative filter strips in mitigating nps pollution from rural living and livestock breeding when the credibility increased from 0 6 to 0 9 the pollution reduction per unit cost would decrease from 0 88 1 66 kg 103 yuan to 0 70 1 15 kg 103 yuan whereas the costs and pollution reductions continued to increase in the case of limited funds as a priority bmps should be implemented in sub basins 10 3 and 22 to mitigate nps pollution to further illustrate the effects and advantages of sicmfp in bmp placement a simulation based interval credibility constrained mixed integer sicmp model was established which is a single objective model with the goal of minimizing costs compared with the sicmp model although the costs obtained from sicmfp would be slightly higher it could lead to more pollution reductions and notably improve the system efficiency compared with setting a specific discharge permit in each sub basin in this study setting a discharge permit throughout the entire watershed could save costs and improve system efficiency nevertheless it would affect the fairness of resource allocation and the coordinated development of the regional economy and society although this study is a novel attempt at identifying optimal bmp placement from the perspective of ratio optimization it could still be improved by using more accurate pollutant simulation models and variable marginal costs of bmps the developed icmfp method is also suitable to address the ratio optimization problems under uncertainty in other fields such as resource management financial planning and agriculture production the sicmfp approach is applicable to the planning of other measures for nps pollution control credit authorship contribution statement shuping

2312,the implementation of best management practices bmps is crucial for protecting and restoring watersheds from nonpoint source nps pollution bmp placement plans with a high pollution reduction to cost ratio are highly desired by decision makers nevertheless few studies tackled such a ratio optimization problem in their efforts to identify bmp placement plans bmp planning also faces challenges in handling inherent uncertainties and estimating nps pollution loads to address these gaps a simulation based inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming sicmfp model was proposed for supporting the placement of bmps this model was developed by integrating the export coefficient model ecm compound topographic index cti inexact programming and mixed integer programming within a fractional programming framework sicmfp extends the capability of previous bmp placement models by optimizing the ratio of conflicting objectives and handling uncertain parameters based on interval theory and credibility measure it can also conveniently simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution loads through the ecm and efficiently identify potential wetland sites using cti sicmfp was applied to plan bmp placement in the luan river basin located in northern china the results showed that sicmfp could provide bmp placement plans with the optimal system efficiency between pollution reductions and cost savings under different credibility levels these plans could help decision makers gain in depth insights into the tradeoffs between expected system efficiency and the risk of constraint violation as the credibility level rises from 0 6 to 0 9 the optimal ratio between pollution reduction and cost declined from 0 88 1 66 kg 103 yuan to 0 70 1 15 kg 103yuan whereas the costs and pollution reductions increased compared with the least cost single objective model sicmfp could lead to more pollution reductions and higher system efficiency the developed sicmfp

economic development in watersheds qiu et al 2019 lintern et al 2020 xue et al 2022 nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus originate from either point or nonpoint sources because point source pollution is well controlled in many countries nonpoint source nps pollution has become a key cause of the deterioration of water environments cai et al 2018 li et al 2022 best management practices bmps such as parallel terraces and constructed wetlands are effective approaches for preventing nps pollution from entering water bodies lee et al 2002 qi altinakar 2011 liu et al 2018 rallapalli et al 2022 nevertheless the identification of the optimal bmp placement schemes faces many challenges one challenge is to analyze the tradeoff between pollution reductions and cost savings in bmp planning another challenge is to deal with uncertainties which can be derived from the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of pollutants the subjectivity of decision makers and deviations in data measurement and collection wang huang 2015 tan et al 2016 therefore it is desirable to develop an efficient systematic approach that can balance conflicting goals and handle uncertainties in the planning of bmp placement many researchers have made efforts to provide bmp placement plans by optimal methods zhang chui 2018 lintern et al 2020 liu et al 2020 for example dai et al 2016 proposed an inexact programming model for bmp optimization to control the nutrient inputs in lake dianchi in southwest china at the lowest cost cai et al 2018 developed a multi objective programming model based on the export coefficient to obtain the optimal bmp placement plan and land use pattern most of the previous studies have reflected both economic and environmental concerns in bmp placement some of these studies considered economic costs as an objective function and simply transformed environmental goals into constraints dai et al 2016 others relied on multi objective programming mop approaches to balance multiple targets such as cost saving and pollution reduction maringanti et al 2009 cai et al 2018 geng et al 2019 the mop models were usually solved by turning multiple objectives into a single measure or by generating a pareto front with various solutions turning multiple objectives into a single measure often encountered difficulties in weighting multiple objectives meanwhile generating a pareto front with various solutions was computationally expensive and created additional difficulties for decision makers in selecting an implementation plan from solutions more importantly previous bmp placement studies primarily focused on cost inputs and or environmental benefit outputs these studies lose their advantages when the objective is to maximize system efficiency which is represented as the ratio of environmental benefit outputs to cost inputs fractional programming fp is an effective method for tackling ratio optimization problems where the objective is the quotient of two functions such as cost time cost volume or output input stancu minasian 1999 zhu et al 2014 salary pour sharif abad et al 2020 it can provide an unprejudiced measure of system efficiency represented as output input ratios and effectively optimize marginal system benefits in recent years fp has been successfully applied in many fields e g resource management financial planning and production planning because of its advantage of balancing conflicting objectives zhou et al 2018 ren et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2018 balanced economic growth against climate change mitigation by an inexact fractional programming model meanwhile tan and zhang 2018 optimized agricultural water use efficiency using a robust fractional programming method these studies proved that fp was effective in measuring system efficiency and could be a promising tool for optimizing the system efficiency of bmp placement nevertheless to ensure that the discharged pollution load does not exceed the allowable amount simulation models are also needed in bmp planning to estimate the pollution load among simulation models the export coefficient model is popular and has the potential to be incorporated into the fp framework due to its low data requirements and high computational efficiency ding et al 2010 rong et al 2017 moreover there are many uncertain parameters in bmp placement such as nutrient discharge permits bmp costs and nutrient reduction efficiency recently researchers have proposed many inexact optimization methods to support environmental management under uncertainty tan et al 2010 wang huang 2013 dong et al 2015 li et al 2019 among them interval linear programming ilp is a useful approach for dealing with uncertainties as it does not require distributional information for input parameters huang et al 1995 fan 2012 tan et al 2017 additionally fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp can handle epistemic uncertainties represented as fuzzy membership functions which effectively reveals the satisfaction degrees of fuzzy constraints zhang huang 2011 dai et al 2016 the ilp and fccp methods have been successfully applied to water resource and environmental management including bmp placement rong et al 2017 ma et al 2020 in addition to the uncertain parameters some decision variables in bmp placement models such as the number of rural sewage treatment stations and biogas digesters may only be represented as integers it is necessary to address both uncertainties and mixed integer optimization problems in bmp placement however few studies have identified the optimal placement of bmps from the perspective of system efficiency optimization while handling the inherent uncertainty in practice bmp placement plans with high system efficiency between pollution reduction and cost are of great interest to decision makers this is because these plans tend to have higher marginal environmental benefits and are more cost effective moreover complex issues involving uncertainties ratio objectives and mixed integer variables are prevalent in bmp placement and other real world cases there was a lack of methods that could simultaneously tackle ratio optimization problems with mixed integer variables and handle uncertainties represented as fuzzy sets and interval numbers in addition determining the spatiotemporal distribution of nps pollution loads and allowable bmp placement levels is an essential step in bmp placement optimization few methods could effectively incorporate the nps pollution simulation model and the identification methods of bmp i e wetlands into the optimization framework to remedy the above mentioned deficiencies an inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming icmfp method was first proposed by coupling ilp mixed integer programming fccp and fp it can balance the dual objectives of two aspects reflecting the system optimal ratio while handling uncertainties and mixed integer optimization problems subsequently a simulation based inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming sicmfp model for bmp placement was developed by integrating the export coefficient model ecm and compound topographic index cti into the icmfp framework sicmfp improved over previous bmp placement models by optimizing system efficiency represented as the ratio objective and handling uncertain parameters in both simulation and optimization sicmfp could also effectively simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution loads using ecm and identify potential wetland sites by cti to demonstrate its effectiveness the developed method was applied to bmp placement in the luan river basin with the aim of mitigating nps pollution and saving costs the solutions generated can help decision makers to identify the bmp placement plan with the highest system efficiency between pollution reductions and cost savings it can also provide a detailed analysis of the tradeoff between system efficiency and the risks of constraint violation 2 complexities of non point source pollution management as an important source of nutrients nps pollution has a profoundly negative impact on the health and economic productivity of aquatic ecosystems the management of nps pollution is complicated because it is associated with multiple systems e g agriculture hydrology economy and requires reasonable placement of various pollution control measures conflicting goals among various stakeholders and inherent uncertainties further complicate the management of nps pollution to handle these complexities the following problems must be addressed what measures can effectively mitigate nps pollution how to balance the conflicting goals of multiple stakeholders how can one deal with the inherent uncertainties in natural and economic systems bmps are effective tools in mitigating nps pollution and can be divided into the categories of structural and nonstructural measures fig 1 shows the sources of nps pollution and the implementation of bmps in watersheds nps pollution primarily originates from rural living livestock breeding and the use of land e g farmland forest and grassland nonstructural bmps such as fertilizer management and tillage management are used to reduce nps pollution loads at the source structural bmps such as vegetative filter strips and wetlands are used to control the migration of pollutants after they leave the source areas the implementation of bmps has been challenged by conflicting economic social and environmental implications on the one hand the implementation of bmps can improve the water quality in watersheds and maintain ecological balance in water bodies on the other hand their implementation imposes additional costs on the watershed managers and or agricultural producers there are also significant differences in the costs and environmental benefits of different bmps and their combinations these differences further increase the complexity of bmp placement if these complexities are not considered uneconomical bmp placement plans may be developed making it difficult to achieve the given water quality targets with limited budgets moreover there is inherent uncertainty in bmp placement these uncertainties are caused by complex hydro meteorological and biochemical processes as well as by spatial variability in pollutant transport and transformation uncertainties in bmp placement are primarily reflected in the objective function and constraint coefficients which are closely associated with realistic economic and environmental issues for instance the effects of bmps on pollution reduction and the export coefficients of nps pollution vary with topographic and hydrological conditions bmp costs fluctuate with the implementation location and market prices the allowable discharge permit also varies with the environmental capacity and the preferences of the decision makers meanwhile in bmp placement planning some decision variables such as the number of rural sewage treatment stations and septic tanks may be integers uncertainties and mixed integer variables increase the challenges of bmp placement and the risk of failure in decision making given the complexities and challenges involved in bmp planning the key issue in this study is how to determine the optimal placement plan of bmps under uncertainty to achieve maximum system efficiency between pollution reduction and cost to address this issue a systematic approach is highly desired to balance these conflicting goals and identify cost effective bmp placement plans under uncertainty 3 methodology an icmfp method is first developed by integrating the ilp mixed integer programming and fccp into the fp framework icmfp can address ratio optimization problems with mixed integer variables it can also tackle multiple uncertainties in the form of fuzzy sets and intervals thereafter a sicmfp model for bmp placement is proposed by coupling the icmfp model ecm and cti the ecm is used to simulate nps pollution loads and the cti is adopted to obtain the allowable placement level of wetlands the results of ecm and cti are incorporated into the icmfp model as constraint coefficients after determining the coefficients using ecm and cti the icmfp model is adopted to generate cost effective bmp placement plans under uncertainty the framework of this methodology is presented in fig 2 3 1 inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming previously the interval fractional programming ifp method integrated fp with ilp was proposed by zhu et al 2014 to tackle ratio optimizations under uncertainty where the parameter distribution information is unknown and could merely exist as interval values nevertheless in real world problems some of the decision variables are integers which could not be handled by ifp moreover some parameters such as available water and allowable pollution discharge amount are related to environmental loading capacities which may subject to human judgments they are more suitable for the expression of fuzzy membership functions rather than interval numbers xu qin 2010 to address these issues an icmfp method is developed to optimize the system efficiency represented as output input ratios tackle mixed integer optimization problems and handle fuzzy and interval uncertainties the icmfp model can be written as 1a max f j 1 t p j x j j t 1 k p j y j α j 1 t c j x j j t 1 k c j y j β subject to 1b c r j 1 t a ij x ij j t 1 k a ij y ij b

a significant credibility level should be larger than 0 5 thus the credibility constraints can be calculated as 3 2 b i b i r i 2 b i b i λ i which can be transformed into an equivalent equation as

from the upper bound sub model by giving different credibility levels the final solutions of icmfp can be generated as x jopt x jopt and f opt f opt the steps for developing and solving the icmfp

icmfp model under a certain credibility level λ i using the branch and bound algorithm step 5 repeat step 2 4 under different credibility levels and generate the final solutions 3 2 sicmfp for bmp placement a sicmfp model for bmp placement is developed to mitigate nps pollution this model includes ecm for simulating pollution loads cti for identifying potential wetland locations and an icmfp method for optimizing ratio objectives the sicmfp model aims to obtain a bmp implementation plan with an optimal pollution reduction to cost ratio under interval and fuzzy uncertainties 3 2 1 improved export coefficient model the ecm is based on the idea that the pollution loads exported from a watershed equal to the sum of the losses from individual sources it can be used for simulating the annual nitrogen and phosphorus loads from nps pollution johnes 1996 the improved ecm proposed by ding et al 2010 can reflect the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of pollutant load per unit area exported from the same sources according to the improved ecm the tn and tp loads from nps pollution can be calculated as 7 f n k j α β e n j k a j k 8 f p k j α β e p j k a j k where j is the index for npss f n k and f p k respectively denote the annual tn load and tp load discharged from npss in sub basin k kg e n j k and e p j k are respectively the nitrogen export coefficient and phosphorus export coefficient of

head bird or person α is the precipitation factor β is the terrain factor α and β are associated with the spatial grid which is set to be 28 m 28 m according to the digital elevation map dem the precipitation factor is equal to the spatial impact factor α s times the temporal impact factor α t and the nitrogen and phosphorus loads exported to rivers are positively correlated with precipitation therefore the α is calculated as follows 9 α α s α t r a r l l r a r f r a f r m where l is the pollutant discharge for a given year kg l is the multi year average pollutant discharge of the watershed kg r denotes the annual average precipitation of the watershed in a certain year mm r a denotes the precipitation in the spatial grid a in a certain year mm r m is the multi year average precipitation of the whole watershed mm f r is a function representing the correlation between precipitation and pollutant discharge which is obtained from the precipitation and water quality data the terrain factor β can be defined as 10 β m θ a m θ 11 m θ a m θ e θ a f e θ f θ a f θ f where θ a is the slope of the grid a θ is the average slope of the whole watershed m θ a represents the relationship between pollution load and slope e and f are regression parameters which are respectively estimated as 0 1881 and 0 6104 ding et al 2010 3 2 2 identification of potential wetland locations agricultural and unused lands that can collect runoff have been identified as suitable sites for wetland construction babbar sebens et al 2013 the cti identifies areas prone to water accumulation based on topographic features gessler et al 2000 the cti is a steady state wetness index that is a function of the slope and specific upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction it is defined as 12 cti i n a s tan θ where θ is the slope and a s is the special basin area sites with high cti values are considered potential locations for wetlands because they contribute to water accumulation there are several steps to identifying potential wetland locations for each sub basin i extract the river network and divide the sub basins based on dem ii calculate the cti values based on gis technology iii create a new layer with cti pixels located only on agricultural and unused land iv convert the new raster layer into polygons and remove the polygons whose size is below the minimum area and v obtain potential locations and allowable placement levels of wetlands in each sub basin which will be input into the optimization model 3 2 3 optimal model formulation based on the simulation results of nps pollution loads and the allowable placement levels of wetlands an optimization model for bmp placement is developed the decision variables are the placement levels of different bmps the objective function is to maximize the ratio of nps pollution reduction to cost the reductions in nps pollution loads are calculated by adding the reductions in tn and tp loads this is because the tn and tp load reductions bear the same importance and were given equal weights the detailed objective function is organized as follows 13a max f

agricultural nutrients and conservation tillage are set to 0 the minimum placement levels of bmps that will be effective for many years such as the filter strips and wetlands are set to the current placement levels the maximum placement levels are determined by the types of bmps and the local situation the maximum placement level of the wetland can be determined by the potential wetland sites in each sub basin which are identified by cti the placement levels of bmps used in farmland should not exceed the farmland area 4 nitrogen reduction constraints the reduction in the nitrogen load should

river basin in chengde city is located in the northeastern part of hebei province china with east longitude between 115 54 119 20 and north latitude between 40 12 and 42 40 fig 3 it covers an area of 26 500 km2 with a riverbank length of 374 km it includes the main stream of the luan river and six main tributaries the luan river basin has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual temperature of 5 12 an annual evaporation of 950 1150 mm and an annual rainfall of 563 7 mm the overall trend of rainfall increases from north to south and is mainly concentrated in july to august cheng et al 2018 the terrain in the study area varies greatly the general terrain slopes from northwest to southeast basically in line with the flow direction of the river the luan river has played an important role in water use for agriculture life industry and ecology in the basin in addition as an important water source for beijing and tianjin luan river is of great importance to environmental protection and climate regulation in these areas the water pollution in the luan river basin of chengde city is mainly caused by urban sewage industrial wastewater and nps pollution in the past few decades many measures have been implemented in the luan river basin to reduce point source pollution including building sewage treatment plants and establishing a pollution discharge permit system these measures have improved the water quality of the watershed at some monitoring sites the concentration of cod and nh4 n has been decreasing in recent years however with the continuous reduction in point source pollution nps pollution caused by excessive application of fertilizers soil erosion and random discharge of rural sewage has become the main pollution source of the water environment chengde city has suffered serious soil erosion problems due to the steep terrain slopes and low soil quality a lot of pollutants enter the water body with soil erosion deteriorating the water environment on some sections of the river the concentration of tp and tn has shown an upward trend or even exceed the water quality standard set by the government in the 14th five year plan of environmental protection of chengde city it is required to reduce the amount of discharged pollution load and make the water quality of each monitoring point meet the standards set by the government meanwhile the local government actively promotes the implementation of bmps to improve the water environment such as the reduction of fertilizer use centralized treatment of pollution load from the breeding industry ecological restoration of rivers and transformation of cultivated land with steep slopes 4 2 data collection and processing the basic data used in this study mainly included the land use map and dem precipitation data at observation sites bmp costs nutrients reduction efficiency of bmps maximum allowable bmp placement levels the current bmp placement levels export coefficients of tn and tp allowable amount of discharged nutrients in each sub basin and the amount of population and livestock all input parameters of the optimization model were interval numbers except the allowable discharge amount of nutrients and the maximum placement level of the rural sewage treatment station the dem land use map tn and tp loads discharged from point sources and the current bmps placement levels were obtained through actual investigation in chengde ecology and environmental bureau the amount of population and livestock were obtained from the chengde statistical yearbook chengde 2019 the rainfall data were obtained from the website of the national meteorological administration in this study six bmps that are promoted in the luan river basin were considered including agriculture nutrient management 20 30 reduction in fertilizer use conservation tillage management terraces rural sewage treatment stations vegetative filter strips 10 m 30 m and wetlands the placement levels of these bmps in each sub basin should not exceed the maximum placement levels the annual allowable discharge amount of tn and tp in each sub basin were fuzzy sets which were determined according to the current discharge amount of tn and tp from nps pollution and suggested reduction targets the costs and pollution reduction efficiency of bmps were obtained from field investigation and literature review dai et al 2016 cai et al 2018 which are presented in table 1 the export coefficients of tn and tp from different sources were obtained from the literature review huang et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 which are shown in table 2 4 3 results and discussions 4 3 1 simulation of nonpoint source pollution load the tn and tp loads discharged from npss in 2019 were estimated using the ecm the impacts of precipitation and terrain heterogeneity on the nps pollution discharges were reflected by the introduction of precipitation and terrain factors based on the dem the luan river basin in chengde city was divided into 23 sub basins the spatial distributions of the precipitation and terrain factors are shown in fig 4 the precipitation factor of tn changed from 0 61 to 0 87 and that of tp changed from 0 57 to 0 81 the precipitation factors for both tn and tp in the study area increased from north to south this is mainly because the precipitation in the basin gradually increased from north to south the terrain factor ranged from 0 to 2 4 with no obvious change in spatial trend owing to the smaller gradient the slope factor upstream of sub basin 1 was lower than that in the other districts fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of tn and tp loads and the contributions to tn and tp loads from three categories of pollution sources including rural living livestock breeding and land use in each sub basin the contributions of land use to tn load were the largest and the contributions to tn from rural living were the least rural living contributed the most tp load in each sub basin whereas the least contributions to tp load came from either livestock or land use the export intensity of tp and tn would show the same trend in space that is the export intensity downstream of the study area would be higher than that upstream on the one hand this is because there is a higher density of people and livestock downstream than upstream on the other hand the downstream districts have more precipitation and a greater gradient than those upstream resulting in higher precipitation and terrain factors 4 3 2 bmp optimization results under different credibility levels with the goal of maximizing the ratio of nps pollution reduction to cost the placement levels of various bmps in each sub basin were obtained under different credibility levels the credibility level in this study was used to quantify the violation risk of the allowable amount of discharged nutrients a higher credibility level is associated with a less allowable amount of discharged nutrients and lower violation risk a fuzzy semantic scale was developed by jimenez et al 2007 to distinguish credibility levels from λ 0 to λ 1 based on the semantic scale the allowable amounts of nutrients discharged under three credibility levels λ 0 6 0 75 and 0 9 were considered fig 6 presents the upper and lower bounds of the bmp placement levels under different credibility levels when the credibility level rises the placement levels of rural sewage treatment stations vegetative filter strips and wetlands would increase to mitigate the pollution nevertheless the placement levels of the other bmps i e agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces would remain unchanged when the credibility level increased from 0 6 to 0 9 this is because these three bmps can only be utilized to reduce the nps pollution discharged from farmland the reductions in pollution loads from farmland reached their maximum value when the credibility level was low λ 0 6 moreover conservation tillage management and terraces would approach the maximum placement levels at a low credibility level this means that these two bmps would be prioritized for pollution mitigation when compared with the other bmps these preferred bmps may also be more cost effective as the model aims to maximize the ratio between pollution reduction and cost the number of rural sewage treatment stations would be equal to the maximum placement level at a high credibility level λ 0 9 except for sub basins 4 21 and 23 however the size of wetlands and vegetative filter strips can still be expanded in most sub basins this could be attributed to the fact that the rural sewage treatment station was more cost effective than wetlands and vegetative filter strips in mitigating nps pollution from rural living and livestock areas with a cti index greater than 10 were considered suitable for wetland construction in total 556 potential sites in the watershed were identified for wetland construction fig 7 the exact locations of wetlands should be further determined according to their potential locations and the surrounding environment fig 8 presents the upper and lower bounds of bmp costs under different credibility levels under a certain credibility level the costs of wetlands and rural sewage treatment stations would be higher than that of other bmps whereas the agricultural nutrient and conservative tillage management would be lower than those of other bmps for instance when the credibility level is 0 6 the costs of wetlands and rural sewage treatment stations would be 13 3 21 9 108 yuan and 14 0 28 8 108 yuan respectively the costs of agricultural nutrient management and conservative tillage management would be 0 35 0 90 108 yuan and 0 43 0 50 108 yuan respectively this indicated that compared with other bmps more money should be invested in the construction of wetlands and rural sewage treatment stations as the credibility level increases the total bmp costs would increase from 31 0 67 9 108 yuan to 65 0 118 2 108 yuan this means that as the credibility level increases there would be a greater cost to alleviate the risk of the pollution loads exceeding the discharge permits among all the bmps the costs of agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces would remain unchanged as the credibility level increases whereas that of the other three bmps would keep increasing this illustrates that priority should be given to the implementation of bmps such as agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces when these bmps reach their maximum placement levels the placement of filter strips and wetlands would increase to prevent the pollution loads from exceeding the allowable discharge amount fig 9 shows the reductions in tn and tp loads from npss hereinafter referred to as nps pollution load as well as the nps pollution reduction per unit cost under different credibility levels similar to bmp costs the reductions in nps pollution load would increase as the credibility level increases on the contrary when the credibility level rises the reduction in nps pollution per unit cost would keep decreasing from 0 88 1 66 kg 103 yuan to 0 70 1 15 kg 103 yuan this is primarily because as the credibility level increases the placement levels of less cost effective bmps such as wetlands and vegetative filter strips would also increase to mitigate against the pollution loads leading to lower system efficiency nps pollution reduction per unit cost these results also revealed the changing tradeoff between the expected system efficiency and the violation risk of fuzzy credibility constraints fig 10 presents the system efficiency in each sub basin under different credibility levels among all the sub basins the system efficiency of sub basin 10 was the highest followed by those of sub basins 3 and 22 this indicated that in the case of limited funds bmps should be implemented in sub basins 10 3 and 22 as a priority the system efficiency of sub basins 13 and 14 would be lower than that of other sub basins under a fixed credibility level this means that more investment would be required to reduce the same amount of nps pollution in these areas than in the other sub basins 4 3 3 comparisons to alternative models to further illustrate the effects and advantages of the sicmfp in bmp placement a simulation based credibility constrained mixed integer sicmp was established where cost minimization was the only objective the solutions obtained from sicmfp and sicmp were both interval numbers which enabled decision makers to select bmp placement plans within the solution ranges when the bmp placement levels varied within the ranges of interval solutions the bmp costs nps pollution reductions and nps pollution reduction per unit cost also fluctuated correspondingly within the ranges of their solutions consequently various decision alternatives could be generated by changing different solution combinations in this study four types of typical alternatives combining the upper and lower values of bmp placement levels were selected for comparison table 3 the alternatives with the highest system efficiency a1 lowest system efficiency a2 largest nps pollution reduction a3 and lowest cost a4 the typical alternatives obtained from sicmfp and sicmp are both labeled a1 a4 according to the corresponding solution combinations fig 11 presents the nps pollution reductions bmp costs and nps pollution reduction per unit cost of these typical alternatives obtained from the sicmfp and sicmp under a certain credibility level and the same type of alternative although the costs obtained from sicmp would be slightly less than those of sicmfp the pollution reductions and pollution reduction per unit cost generated by sicmfp would be higher in particular at a credibility level of 0 75 the pairs with the same setting such as a1 in sicmfp and a1 in sicmp could be regarded as examples for comparison the costs pollution reductions and pollution reduction per unit cost in the sicmfp were 46 7 51 3 108 yuan 5 61 6 33 106 kg and 1 09 1 36 kg 103 yuan respectively while those in the sicmp were 46 2 50 8 108 yuan 5 31 5 99 106 kg and 1 05 1 30 kg 103 yuan respectively these comparison results indicate that although the alternatives obtained in sicmfp would require more costs than those in sicmp they would lead to more environmental benefits and notably improve the system efficiency moreover comparing two magnitudes representing conflicting goals can better reflect real world problems with multiple objectives and stakeholders than simply considering each using quotient measures the ranking results of the decision alternatives would be clearer and more significant than mop methods therefore compared with the sicmp the sicmfp could better address the issues associated with practical bmp placement by optimizing the ratio between the criteria of two magnitudes 4 3 4 implementation and policy implication the sicmfp can improve and guide bmp placement in terms of bmp costs nps pollution reductions and system efficiency it can provide multiple alternatives for decision makers according to their expectations of pollution reduction and investment cost risk tolerance and local realistic conditions in detail decision makers with different preferences could further choose bmp placement plans within the solution ranges obtained from the sicmfp four types of typical alternatives within the solution ranges were analyzed in this study fig 11 alternative a1 is suitable for decision makers who expect a high nps pollution reduction per unit cost when this alternative is adopted the agricultural nutrient management conservation tillage management and terraces should take the upper bound values whereas the rural sewage treatment stations wetlands and vegetative filter strips should take the lower bound values alternative a3 is a desirable choice for decision makers who pursue maximum nps pollution reductions regardless of cost where all bmp activities would get their upper bound values alternative a2 was not recommended because it was inferior to a3 in terms of costs pollution reductions and system efficiency alternative a4 may interest decision makers with a low budget where all bmp activities are recommended to take their lower bound values under the same type of alternative a higher credibility level indicated a lower violation risk of the pollution loads exceeding the discharge permits resulting in higher costs nps pollution reductions and lower system efficiency when decision makers are risk averse higher bmp placement levels would be adopted leading to higher costs and lower system efficiency in comparison when the decision makers are risk neutral or aggressive alternatives associated with lower costs and higher system efficiency would be obtained but the risk of exceeding pollution discharge permits would increase simultaneously in this study the discharge permits for tn and tp discharged from npss were specific to each sub basin sub basin scenario in some districts a global pollution discharge permit was used throughout the watershed entire watershed scenario table 4 presents the differences in nps pollution reductions bmp costs and system efficiencies of these two discharge permit scenarios the upper and lower bounds of nps pollution reductions and system efficiency in the entire watershed scenario would be higher than those in the sub basin scenario and bmp costs would be lower this is mainly because in the entire watershed scenario discharge permits could be shifted across the sub basins and more bmps would be adopted in the sub basins with higher cost efficiency in general the entire watershed scenario can save costs and improve the system efficiency nevertheless it should be noted that the risk of the pollution discharge amount exceeding the environmental capacity may increase under the entire watershed scenario in sub basins with lower nps pollution reduction per unit cost this affects the fairness of resource allocation and further hinders the coordinated development of the economy and society in sub basins this study is a novel attempt at identifying the optimal placement of bmps under uncertainty from the perspective of ratio optimization this could be improved in future attempts from two aspects first the simulated accuracy of ecm was lower than that of the distributed model such as the soil and water model the icmfp model can be coupled with more accurate pollutant simulation models to determine the optimal location of the bmps second bmp marginal costs in this study were assumed to be fixed in the real world the marginal cost will change with the bmp placement levels thus nonlinear cost functions could be utilized in the optimization framework in a future study 5 conclusions it is of great significance to develop an advanced model to support best management practice bmp placement from the perspective of optimizing the ratio between reducing pollutants and saving costs to address the ratio optimization problem involving mixed integer variables under uncertainty an inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming icmfp method was first developed by coupling inexact programming mixed integer programming and fractional programming thereafter a simulation based inexact credibility constrained mixed integer fractional programming sicmfp model was developed for bmp placement by integrating the export coefficient model ecm compound topographic index cti and icmfp in the integrated method the ecm was utilized to estimate nitrogen and phosphorous loads from nonpoint sources npss and the cti was used to identify potential sites for wetland construction the sicmfp model improved over previous bmp placement models by optimizing the ratio between pollution reduction and cost it could also address the mixed integer optimization problems and uncertainties involved in bmp placement in addition sicmfp could provide detailed tradeoffs between expected system efficiency represented as the ratio objective and the risks of constraint violation this approach was used in bmp placement in the luan river basin to demonstrate its applicability the results of the nps pollution load estimation indicated that rural living would contribute the most tp load in each sub basin and land use would be the largest contributor to tn loads the export intensities of tp and tn downstream of the study area were higher than those upstream the optimization results show that sicmfp can provide bmp placement plans with the highest system efficiency between pollution reduction and cost under different credibility levels these plans were obtained by handling the tradeoffs between cost and pollution reduction and balancing the expected system efficiency and the risks of constraint violation compared with other bmps conservation tillage management and terraces are more cost effective for mitigating nps pollution the rural sewage treatment station was more cost effective than wetlands and vegetative filter strips in mitigating nps pollution from rural living and livestock breeding when the credibility increased from 0 6 to 0 9 the pollution reduction per unit cost would decrease from 0 88 1 66 kg 103 yuan to 0 70 1 15 kg 103 yuan whereas the costs and pollution reductions continued to increase in the case of limited funds as a priority bmps should be implemented in sub basins 10 3 and 22 to mitigate nps pollution to further illustrate the effects and advantages of sicmfp in bmp placement a simulation based interval credibility constrained mixed integer sicmp model was established which is a single objective model with the goal of minimizing costs compared with the sicmp model although the costs obtained from sicmfp would be slightly higher it could lead to more pollution reductions and notably improve the system efficiency compared with setting a specific discharge permit in each sub basin in this study setting a discharge permit throughout the entire watershed could save costs and improve system efficiency nevertheless it would affect the fairness of resource allocation and the coordinated development of the regional economy and society although this study is a novel attempt at identifying optimal bmp placement from the perspective of ratio optimization it could still be improved by using more accurate pollutant simulation models and variable marginal costs of bmps the developed icmfp method is also suitable to address the ratio optimization problems under uncertainty in other fields such as resource management financial planning and agriculture production the sicmfp approach is applicable to the planning of other measures for nps pollution control credit authorship contribution statement shuping

2313,global navigation satellite system gnss is an effective means to monitor surface deformations associated with changes in terrestrial water storage tws in this study we introduced a priori constraint matrix and estimated the regularization parameter through an iterative least squares method to infer the tws changes using gnss vertical displacements from december 2010 to february 2021 in the yunnan province ynp china the gnss inferred tws changes were validated through the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on gfo estimates the global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model and the meteorological data i e precipitation and drought severity index dsi the results demonstrate that the spatial resolution of tws changes derived from 45 gnss stations can reach 2 2 in the ynp and the a priori constraint is better than the traditional laplacian matrix constraint for solving the discrete ill conditioned problem of gnss inversion the gnss inferred tws changes are consistent with the tws changes derived from grace gfo and gldas estimates in the spatio temporal domains over the ynp but the gnss inversion results show stronger amplitudes furthermore the ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to the tws changes and the correlation between precipitation and gnss inferred tws changes is improved by about 11 and 5 compared to grace gfo and gldas estimates in the ynp respectively the gnss inferred dsi can well reveal the two severe drought events in the ynp during the study period which is consistent with the dsi derived from grace gfo and gldas estimates as well as the published self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the gnss observations can compensate the limitations of grace gfo observations e g bridging the data gap between grace and gfo missions and help to better investigate the tws changes in the ynp which has significant potentials for regional water resource management and extreme climate changes monitoring keywords terrestrial water storage gnss vertical displacements yunnan province a priori constraint drought events data availability the data can be accessed through the website provided in the text 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws refers to the water stored both on the surface and underground which includes surface water groundwater glaciers snow and soil water etc the tws forms an important part of the global water cycle the accurate measurement of the migration and redistribution of tws changes has an important impact on evaluating the natural environment changes and water resource management plans rodell and famiglietti 1999 cazenave and chen 2010 rodell et al 2018 currently the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on gfo satellite observations have been widely used to quantify the large and medium scales tws changes tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2006 chen 2019 tapley et al 2019 nevertheless the application of grace gfo observations to investigate the continuous and refined regional tws changes is challenging due to the north south striping errors caused by the geometry of the polar type grace gfo mission swenson and wahr 2006 chen et al 2015 coarse spatial resolution of 300 500 km swenson and wahr 2006 wouters and schrama 2007 low temporal resolution i e monthly intervals and large data gap nearly one year data gap between grace and gfo missions of grace gfo observations to this end we need to explore other geodetic technologies to compensate the limitations of grace gfo observations according to green s function theory farrell 1972 the migration and redistribution of surface mass changes e g tws changes and the non tidal atmospheric and oceanic loading effects can deform the crust beneath the mass loading as well as in the vicinity of the loading as a function of the reciprocal distance conversely we can infer and monitor surface mass changes by observing the high precision surface deformation fields the global navigation satellite system gnss provides a powerful tool to continuously monitor the surface deformation fields in near real time at millimeter level accuracy this makes it possible to estimate the surface mass changes using the gnss surface displacement data especially the vertical displacements since blewitt et al 2001 first proposed the inversion method for quantifying surface mass changes using gnss surface displacements gnss inferred surface mass changes have been considered as a useful supplement of the grace gfo estimates for regions with proper gnss coverage moreover ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to the regional surface mass changes than grace gfo estimates which provides a reliable tool to study the refined regional tws changes argus et al 2014 first used the global positioning system gps observations to infer the regional tws changes the results showed that the spatial resolution of gps inferred tws changes can reach 50 km in california with densely distributed gps stations and the tws changes derived from gps grace and hydrological models were in good agreement with each other since then the gnss observations have been widely used to study the regional tws changes in different regions and continents including the united states argus et al 2014 2017 borsa et al 2014 fu et al 2015 jin and zhang 2016 enzminger et al 2018 china zhang et al 2016 zhong et al 2020a hsu et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 li et al 2022 and south america ferreira et al 2019 for instance jin and zhang 2016 used gps observations to investigate the severe drought in southwestern us during 2012 ferreira et al 2019 conducted a resolution analysis of the tws changes derived from daily gps observations over the south america zhong et al 2020a investigated the influence of station distribution on the gps inversion results and demonstrated the possibility of gps inferred surface mass changes to bridge the data gap between grace and gfo observations in southwest china jiang et al 2021 employed the daily gnss vertical displacements to track the tws changes induced by the extreme weather events in yunnan province because the correlation of the observations from adjacent gnss stations can introduce a large condition number into the normal matrix inversion of regional tws changes using gnss vertical displacements is a well known ill conditioned problem the common approach is to use the tikhonov regularization method tikhonov and arseninn 1977 tikhonov et al 1995 to stabilize the ill conditioned problem in which the second order laplacian matrix is used as the regularization constraint matrix and the l curve or generalized cross validation gcv method are used to determine the optimal regularization parameter argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 zhong et al 2020a however the laplacian matrix is a sparse matrix based on the perspective of geometry and does not have clear physical meaning moreover it is sometimes difficult to accurately estimate the optimal regularization parameter using the l curve or gcv method currently the inversion method for quantifying the tws changes using gnss observations is still a challenging task modified solving strategies should be introduced to improve the reliability of gnss inversion results including the construction of regularization constraint matrix and the optimal estimation of the regularization parameter in this study based on the tikhonov regularization method we presented the a priori covariance matrix calculated from the geophysical model i e hydrological model as the regularization constraint matrix additionally to obtain more stable and reliable inversion results the optimal regularization parameter was adaptively determined through data itself by using an iterative least squares estimation method compared with the laplacian matrix the a priori covariance matrix has clear physical meaning and the introduced a priori geophysical information can improve the reliability of gnss inversion results in addition we determined the optimal regularization parameter using the data driven method which can well utilize the observation data through iterative least squares estimation the objective of this study is to infer the tws changes based on the a priori constraint using the gnss vertical displacements in the yunnan province ynp of china for the period december 2010 to february 2021 first we compared the gnss inversion results based on the a priori covariance matrix and the traditional laplacian matrix constraint though a closed loop simulation second we used the measured gnss vertical displacement time series to infer the tws changes in the ynp and compared the results with grace gfo solutions and global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model in the spatio temporal domains finally we investigated the linkages between gnss inferred tws changes and precipitation data moreover the drought severity index dsi derived from gnss inferred tws changes was used to study the drought events in the ynp during the study period and the dsi inferred by grace gfo and gldas estimates as well as the published self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei were also used for comparison the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the detailed information of the study area datasets and the post processing of the geodetic observation data section 3 introduces the fundamental theory and provides a new inversion model to estimate the tws changes from gnss vertical displacements section 4 presents a research framework of

summary 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the ynp 97 31 106 11 e and 21 80 29 15 n fig 1 a is located on the eastern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau in the eastern part of the collision zone between the indian plate and the eurasian plate and the tectonic movement over this region is very intense the terrain of ynp is high in the northwest and low in the southeast fig 1 a and gradually decreases from north to south active faults and strong earthquakes are frequently developed in this region and their geological tectonic activities are closely related to the strong collision of the india eurasia plate since 45 ma england and molnar 1997 there are two major active fault zones i e the honghe fault zone and the xiaojiang fault zone fig 1 a in the ynp these faults divide the ynp into secondary blocks such as the sichuan yunnan diamond block the yunnan burma block and the south china block which control the obvious division of the regional stress field wang et al 1998 the gnss stations distributed in the ynp are affected by the seismic activities and tectonic effects induced by these fault zones these potential impacts should be minimized during the gnss data post processing the ynp has a subtropical plateau monsoon climate with remarkable three dimensional climate characteristics because of the unique geographical location ynp is intensively affected by the indian monsoon east asian monsoon and air masses from the qinghai tibet plateau zhang 1988 the vertical changes in temperature with terrain are unusually obvious in the ynp moreover the spatio temporal distributions of precipitation in this region are extremely uneven whereby the wet season is from may to october and this period concentrates 85 of the total rainfall on the other hand the dry season is from november to april of the following year and the rainfall during this period accounts for only 15 of the entire year the mean annual total precipitation in most areas exceeds 1000 mm fig 1 b from 2011 to 2020 these unique geomorphic features and climate diversities create unique biodiversity and form a huge wildlife germplasm resource bank in the ynp nevertheless global warming and frequent extreme climate events impose challenges to protect the ecological diversity of ynp being influenced by strong monsoon and topography this region is extremely sensitive to climate changes therefore study on the tws changes has great significances for water resource management and ecological environment protection in the ynp more importantly the ynp has relatively densely distributed gnss stations compared with other regions of the mainland china which provides the opportunity to infer the tws changes using gnss observations 2 2 materials 2 2 1 gnss data in this paper the vertical displacement time series at 45 gnss stations from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc over the period from december 2010 to february 2021 were used to infer tws changes in the ynp all gnss time series were downloaded from the national earthquake data center https www eqdsc com and were processed at the first monitoring and application center china earthquake administration the gnss vertical displacement time series released by the national earthquake data center were processed by using the gamit globk software version 10 4 herring et al 2018 and the quasi observation combination analysis qoca software based on the double differenced model before the gnss data processing the 230 gnss stations of the cmonoc were divided into six sub networks according to their geographic locations first the gamit software was used to solve the daily solutions of each sub network second the evenly distributed international terrestrial reference frame itrf 2008 core stations with good quality were selected as the fixed reference stations then the globk and qoca were used to perform the overall adjustment finally the qoca software was used for joint adjustment to obtain the final gnss displacement time series relative to the itrf 2008 the gnss surface displacement time series published by the national earthquake data center have been deducted the influence of solid earth tides ocean tides and polar tides therefore the gnss observations mainly represent the vertical displacements induced by tws changes non tidal atmospheric and oceanic loading effects in this study the post processing of gnss vertical displacement time series includes the following three steps first we removed the gross errors of gnss vertical displacement time series using the gross detection method presented in nikolaidis 2002 second we fitted each gnss vertical displacement time series with a position a linear trend annual signal and the heaviside function schumacher et al 2018 then we corrected the jumps and the long term trend changes mainly induced by the glacial isostatic adjustment gia or tectonic effects of gnss vertical displacement time series using the least squares linear fitting method third we interpolated the data gaps of gnss vertical displacement time series using the kriged kalman filter method proposed by liu et al 2017 in general these 45 gnss stations used in this study have good data availability during the study period and each station contains 95 of the observation data on average see fig s1 fig 2 shows the original light blue curves and post processing red curves gnss vertical displacement time series of two selected gnss stations i e ynsm and ynyl as shown in fig 2 the high frequency errors and data gaps of the original gnss vertical displacement time series can be well suppressed and interpolated through the post processing moreover we used the geophysical fluid loading products published by the earth system modeling group at deutsches geoforschungszentrum https esmdata gfz potsdam de 8080 repository dill and dobslaw 2013 to deduct the contributions of non tidal atmospheric and oceanic loading effects for gnss vertical displacements time series so as to infer the final tws changes in general the post processing of gnss vertical displacement time series is an essential step to improve the reliability of gnss inferred tws changes 2 2 2 grace gfo data to evaluate the reliability of gnss inversion results the monthly grace gfo release 06 rl06 mascon solutions save et al 2016 save 2020 published by the center for space research csr at the university of texas at austin were used to infer tws changes in the ynp the csr mascon solutions were downloaded from https www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html the released csr mascon solutions are generated on 0 25 0 25 grids however they are estimated on an equal area geodesic grid comprised of hexagonal tiles of approximately 120 km wide 1 1 at the equator the terms c20 and c30 gfo solutions only for the mascon solutions are replaced by the slr estimates loomis et al 2020 and the geo center and gia effects are corrected using the degree 1 coefficient from landerer 2019 and the ice 6g d model peltier et al 2018 respectively compared with the grace gfo spherical harmonic solutions the mascon solutions suppress the longitudinal stripes owing to the application of various constraints and do not require additional filtering and scaling factors corrections leading to higher precision and spatial resolution 2 2 3 gldas data the global land data assimilation systems gldas data are derived from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national centers of environmental prediction necp the gldas models use advanced data assimilation technology and land surface modeling technology to extract satellite and ground observations data for generating the best land surface state and flux field which mainly include noah vic clm and mosaic rodell et al 2004 in this study we used the gldas version 2 noah products downloaded from https hydro1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov opendap gldas gldas noah025 m 2 1 with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 grids and monthly intervals to estimate the tws changes i e the sum of canopy water soil moisture 0 2 m and snow water data layers the gldas derived tws changes over the period of december 2010 to february 2021 were used for comparison and as a priori model with the gnss inferred tws changes in the ynp 2 2 4 precipitation data the ground based precipitation observation data are published by the china meteorological data network https data cma cn and managed by the national meteorological information center nmic the published data are provided in 0 5 0 5 rectangle grids using records from 2472 weather stations in china in this study we used the precipitation data from december 2010 to december 2020 to infer the precipitation changes in the ynp 2 2 5 drought index data in order to assess the ability of gnss inferred tws changes for evaluating the drought events in the study area we used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei https spei csic es database html and the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi https www cru uea ac uk for comparison the spei was derived from the monthly precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration data from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia uea here we used the spei with four time scales i e spei 3 spei 6 spei 9 and spei 12 from december 2010 to december 2017 in the ynp and the scpdsi were presented for the time period from december 2010 to december 2019 3 methods 3 1 load green s function since the variations in surface mass load can deform the crust the surface deformation can be approximately expressed as elastic deformation based on the mass load green s function theory farrell 1972 the vertical displacements induced by unit mass load can be expressed using load green s function argus et al 2014 jin and zhang 2016 as follows 1 g φ r m e n 0 h n p n c o s φ where g φ is the green s function and φ is the angular distance between the gnss station and the mass load r and m e are the radius 6378 137 m and mass 5 965 1024 kg of the earth respectively h n are the load love numbers values are considered from wang et al 2012 p n are the legendre polynomials of order n for a specific study area the vertical displacements induced by l mass load grid cells can be expressed as follows 2 δ r i 1 l δ m i g φ in which δ r is the vertical displacement δ m i s i δ h i ρ w where δ m i s i and δ h i denote the mass area and height of the i th grid cell respectively ρ w 1000 k g m 3 is the density of the fresh water the eq 2 can be used to simulate the gnss vertical displacements according to the checkerboard signals and gldas hydrological model in the section 5 1 subsequently to facilitate the expression of the relationship between the tws changes and gnss observations the linear system of observation eq 2 can be expressed as follows 3 y a x e e 0 σ y 2 i where y y 1 y 2 y n obs t is the observation vector of gnss vertical displacements n obs is the number of gnss observations x x 1 x 2 x m t is the tws change parameter vector to be estimated which is expressed as the equivalent water height ewh m is the number of the grid cells and the division form of the grid cells is shown in fig 4 e e 1 e e n obs t is the residual vector of gnss observations with zero expectation and error variance σ y 2 and i is the identity matrix additionally the design matrix a corresponding to the green s function g φ is expressed as 4 a g φ 11 g φ 12 g φ 2 m g φ 21 g φ 22 g φ 2 m g φ n obs 1 g φ n obs 2 g φ 2 m g φ n obs m owing to the correlation of the gnss observations among the adjacent stations inferring regional tws changes by gnss vertical displacements can be categorized as a discrete ill conditioned problem to solve the ill conditioned problem and improve the reliability of gnss inverted tws changes the common approach is to use the tikhonov regularization method to stabilize the inversion results in which the laplacian matrix is used as the regularization constraint matrix the inversion model based on the tikhonov regularization method using the laplacian matrix constraint is as follows argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 5 x a t a λ 2 l t l 1 a t y x is the unknow tws change parameter vector to be estimated λ 2 is the regularization parameter the optimal estimate of λ 2 is commonly determined by the l curve fu et al 2015 or gcv method ferreira et al 2019 zhong et al 2020a l is the laplacian matrix which consists of the kernels 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 jiang et al 2021 or 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 li et al 2022 additionally the laplacian matrix is a sparse matrix which does not have clear physical meaning and only constrain the gnss inverted tws changes base on the perspective of geometry in addition to investigate the performance of the 45 gnss stations for recovering tws changes in the ynp a checkerboard test is performed in the section 5 1 1 3 2 inversion model for tws using a priori constraint to overcome the shortcomings of laplacian matrix constraint and obtain more stable and reliable inversion results we introduced a stochastic model for the unknown tws change parameter vector to stabilize the regularization solutions based on the a priori constraint e g hydrological model assuming the unknown tws change parameter vector x with priori expectation vector x 0 and covariance matrix c x the linear system of the a priori constraint equation of the new gnss inversion model can be written as follows zhong et al 2020b tangdamrongsub et al 2021 6 x 0 i x x e 0 e 0 0 c x where e 0 is the residual vector with zero expectation and covariance matrix c x and i x is the identity matrix in order to reduce the edge effects and obtain more reliable inversion results we extended the calculated region to 97 107 e and 20 30 n the calculated region was divided into 0 25 0 25 geographical grids and there are 1600 unknow tws change parameters to be estimated combing the eq 3 and eq 6 the least squares solutions of the unknow tws change parameter vector x can be estimated by using eq 7a and eq 7b as follows zhong et al 2020b 7a x a t a λ 2 σ y 2 c x 1 1 a t y λ 2 σ y 2 c x 1 x 0 7b λ 2 σ y 2 y t y x t 2 a t y x t 2 a t a x n obs x 0 x t c x 1 x 0 x because both the regularization parameter λ 2 and the error variance σ y 2 are unknow in eq 7a we simultaneously estimated the λ 2 σ y 2 using eq 7b starting with an initial value λ 2 σ y 2 to obtain the reliable solutions of the unknown tws change parameter vector we need to solve x and λ 2 σ y 2 iteratively based on eq 7a and eq 7b using the iterative least squares estimation method here assuming a stationary stochastic process for unknown tws change parameter vector x the covariance matrix c x can be obtained from the empirical covariance function as follows tangdamrongsub et al 2012 8 c x d ij σ x 2 exp d ij d where σ x 2 and d are the variance and correlation distance of the empirical covariance function and d ij is the distance between the i th and j th grid cells the eq 8 was used to fit the empirical covariance function and the empirical values of the covariance function were calculated from the grid values of gldas noah in the study area as follows tangdamrongsub et al 2012 tangdamrongsub et al 2021 9 c x d ij 1 n i j n f i f j d δ d 2 d ij d δ d 2 where f i and f j are the two tws change values on two grid cells separated by distance d ij n is the number of such distance pairs and δ d is the grid interval of the study area subsequently we can use the least squares method to estimate σ x 2 and d in the eq 8 after linearization it should be noted that the laplacian matrix is a sparse matrix based on geometric perspective and the function of the laplacian matrix is to suppress high frequency signals by smoothing the tws elements between adjacent grid cells while the a priori covariance matrix is derived from the real geophysical model e g gldas noah which introduces the a priori information to improve the stability and reliability of gnss inversion results 3 3 cross wavelet transformation the cross wavelet transformation cwt can simultaneously reveal the correlation between two time series in the frequency and time domains hudgins and huang 1996 it is widely used to analyze the correlation of hydrological and meteorological time series huang et al 2017 in this study we used the cwt to evaluate the consistency between the gnss inferred tws changes and grace gfo and gldas estimates the continuous wavelets transform of a time series u can be expressed as w u grinsted et al 2004 then the cwt of two hydrological and meteorological time series e g u n and v n can be defined as 10 w uv w u w v in which represents their complex conjugation their cross wavelet power is defined as w uv the complex argument arg w uv can be regarded as the local relative phase between u n and v n in both time and frequency domains if the u n and v n with the fourier spectra p k u and p k v the cross wavelet distribution can be expressed as follows torrence and compo 1998 11 w n u s w n v s σ u σ v z v p v p k u p k v where σ u and σ v are the respective standard deviations z v p is the confidence level corresponding to the probability p for a probability distribution

e t s p 95 4 research framework the aforementioned sections have introduced the research background datasets and methods used in the study to better present the overview of proposed method and results a flowchart of the assessments and applications of the proposed inversion method is presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the study content of the closed loop simulation with light green background reveals the optimal spatial resolution of tws changes derived from 45 gnss stations in the ynp and the superiority of the a priori covariance matrix over the traditional laplacian matrix the content of the comparison and analysis with light blue background presents the spatio temporal analysis of tws changes i e spatial patterns and seasonal changes of tws derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas in the ynp additionally the content of the validation and application with apricot colour background further reveals the performance and application of gnss inverted tws changes in regional meteorological and hydrological drought study 5 results 5 1 closed loop simulation 5 1 1 checkerboard test when the observation accuracy of gnss data remains unchanged the reliability of gnss inferred tws changes depends on the density and distribution of gnss stations to investigate the performance of the available 45 gnss stations for recovering tws signals in the ynp we conducted a checkerboard test we divided the study area into 0 25 0 25 grids and designed the checkerboard signals at 2 2 grids then we calculated the vertical displacements at gnss stations based on the checkerboard signals and inferred the tws changes using the simulated gnss observations fig 4 a shows the input checkerboard signals grids with 0 mm white grids and 300 mm brown grids ewh and the corresponding inversion results are presented in fig 4 b we can see that the inversion results can well recover the input checkerboard signals in the northeastern and southern parts of ynp due to the relatively densely distributed gnss stations but the checkerboard signals in the northwestern part of ynp are recovered relatively poorly where sparser gnss stations are distributed in general the average station distance of the available 45 gnss stations in the ynp is about 165 km and the vertical displacements of these gnss stations can be used to recover the tws changes very well with 2 2 spatial resolution which is better than the 300 500 km spatial resolution of grace gfo solutions however more gnss stations should be installed in the eastern and northwestern parts of ynp to improve the application potentials of gnss network 5 1 2 comparison of gnss inversion results using a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint using the laplacian matrix as a regularization constraint matrix and determining the optimal regularization parameter by l curve or gcv method is widely used to solve the discrete ill conditioned problem of inverting gnss observations for tws changes argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 zhong et al 2020a in this study we introduced the covariance matrix of a priori geophysical information i e gldas hydrological model as a regularization constraint matrix and employed the iterative least squares method to estimate the optimal regularization parameter for solving the ill conditioned problem of gnss inversion to assess the superiority of the a priori constraint matrix over the traditional laplacian matrix we conducted a closed loop simulation and the flowchart of the closed loop simulation can be found in fig s2 we used the original input signals gldas derived tws changes during january to december 2006 to simulate the vertical displacements at 45 gnss stations by eq 2 to be consistent with real gnss observations the gaussian white noises with a standard deviation of 1 mm were added to the simulated gnss vertical displacements before inversion of tws changes here we used the gldas derived tws changes after 300 km gauss filtering as the priori constraint information then the tws changes were inferred by the inversion model of eq 7a and the optimal regularization parameter was determined by eq 7b through the iterative least squares method in addition the gnss inversion results regularized by the traditional laplacian matrix with the optimal regularization parameter estimated by the gcv function zhong et al 2020a were presented for comparison fig 5 reveals the empirical covariance matrix c x and the fitted empirical covariance function and the iterative convergence curve from gldas derived tws changes in january 2006 in the ynp as shown in fig 5 a b the main diagonal elements of the empirical covariance matrix calculated from a priori information are evidently dominant and the corresponding fitted parameters σ x 2 2 87 10 3 mm2 and d 2 25 respectively as shown in fig 5 c the iterative convergence curve driven by the simulated gnss observations gradually converges after approximately three to four iterations in january 2006 furthermore we also investigated the sensitivity of gnss inferred tws changes to different priori information the results demonstrate that different priori information has little influence on gnss inverted tws changes and the overall characteristics of gnss inversion results remain unchanged additionally we also used incorrect a prior information that is completely out of phase with the original input signal to calculate the covariance matrix but the corresponding inversion results are generally consistent with the original input signal more detailed comparisons are presented in text s1 and fig s3 moreover the laplacian matrix fig s4 a b exhibits the similar distribution patterns as the covariance matrix c x and the gcv function curve gives a global optimal regularization parameter based on the perspective of statistics fig s4 c to assess the performance of different constraint matrices we calculated the differences between the original input signals and inversion results based on the a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint fig 6 reveals the comparison of the tws change time series derived from gldas i e original input signals and the inversion results derived from the simulated gnss observations based on the a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint during january to december 2006 in the ynp moreover the standard deviation std of the differences between original input signals and gnss inversion results based on different constraint matrices were also presented as shown in fig 6 a both the inversion results derived from simulated gnss observations based on the a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint can well recover the original input signal but the results corresponding to the a priori constraint are slightly closer to the original input signals compared with those of the laplacian matrix constraint as shown in fig 6 b the std corresponding to the a priori constraint is smaller than those of laplacian matrix constraint it demonstrates that the gnss inversion results based on the a priori constraint are generally more reliable than those of laplacian matrix constraint through the closed loop simulation from january to december 2006 in the ynp 5 2 spatial patterns of measured gnss inferred tws in the ynp to examine the performance of inverting gnss observations for tws changes using a priori constraint we used the measured vertical displacements at 45 gnss stations to infer the tws changes in the ynp and the grace gfo and gldas derived tws changes were presented for comparison fig 7 shows the spatial patterns of tws changes derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas in may and september 2011 and may and september 2019 as shown in fig 7 in may 2011 the tws changes derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas demonstrate similar spatial distribution characteristic with negative anomalies in the ynp but the grace derived results indicate stronger signals in the southwestern part of ynp in september 2011 the tws changes from these three data mainly present positive anomalies in the ynp while the gnss results show the strongest amplitude followed by the grace and the gldas is the smallest in addition the grace and gldas show negative anomalies in the northeastern part of ynp but the gnss does not reveal such signals in may 2019 the spatial patterns of tws changes are similar to those in may 2011 but the signal amplitudes are stronger in the southwestern part of ynp in september 2019 the spatial patterns of gnss and gfo derived tws changes are similar to those in september 2011 but the gldas results show different spatial characteristic in general gnss inferred tws changes show good consistency with grace gfo and gldas estimates for most months but the amplitudes are stronger except for may 2011 fig 8 presents the spatial patterns of annual amplitude and phases for tws changes derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas from december 2010 to february 2021 in the ynp in particular the annual amplitudes of grace gfo were simultaneously fitted using grace and gfo solutions as shown in fig 8 a c the annual amplitudes of tws change from these three data show similar spatial patterns and decrease from southwest to northeast among them gnss inferred tws changes demonstrate the strongest annual amplitudes which is because the ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to the regional tws changes than the satellite based geodetic techniques e g grace gfo and a single gnss station can be affected by the mass load changes within 100 200 km bevis et al 2005 followed by the grace gfo derived annual amplitudes although the grace gfo observes all water components including surface water groundwater soil moisture and snow the coarse spatial resolution i e 300 500 km of grace gfo solutions restricts their accurate estimate of tws changes at small scale area such as ynp and the gldas shows the weakest amplitudes because gldas derived tws changes only include the sum of canopy water soil moisture 0 2 m and snow water data layers but the deep groundwater and other surface water components e g rivers and lakes are not included in addition as we can see from the fig 1 b the spatial patterns of mean annual total precipitation show similar variation characteristic like the annual amplitudes of tws changes as in fig 8 a c this is because ynp belongs to the typical monsoon climate region the monsoon brings abundant precipitation to ynp every year jiang et al 2017 comparing figs 1 b and 8 a c we can see that precipitation dominates the tws changes in the ynp for the annual phases in fig 8 d f there is no significant regional difference in the annual phase of tws changes derived from these three products over the entire ynp it should be noted that the annual phases of tws changes derived from gnss and grace gfo are closer and lag behind the gldas estimates 5 3 temporal changes of measured gnss inferred tws in the ynp investigating the temporal changes of tws allows us for better understanding of water cycle processes fig 9 shows the time series of raw tws change seasonal and linear trend derived from gnss from december 2010 to february 2021 in the ynp and the gldas and grace gfo estimates were presented for comparison in particular the annual curve of grace gfo was simultaneously fitted using the grace and gfo solutions as shown in fig 9 a the tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace gfo show similar seasonal characteristics and present good consistent with each other in the ynp the correlation coefficient cc and std of the tws change time series between gnss and grace gfo are cc 0 84 std 56 19 mm and between gnss and gldas are cc 0 92 std 49 05 mm respectively furthermore the gnss inferred tws change time series provides an effective tool to bridge the nearly one year data gap between grace and gfo estimates in the ynp especially for the seasonal change characteristics as shown in fig 9 b the annual amplitude of gnss inferred tws time series is the largest followed by the grace gfo estimates and the gldas is the smallest the specific reasons are the same as presented in section 5 2 in addition the tws change time series display an increasing trend from december 2010 to june 2017 and a decreasing trend from july 2017 june 2018 of gfo to february 2021 more detailed comparisons are presented in table 1 to better investigate the consistency of tws changes from gnss with grace gfo and gldas estimates we used the cwt to further evaluate the correlation between tws changes from gnss gldas and grace fig 10 illustrates the cwt between the gnss inferred tws changes and gldas and grace estimates the gfo estimates are not considered for the data gap of grace gfo respectively we can see that the tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace observations present high energy spectrum region during 9 15 months i e annual variations throughout the entire study period and the arrows in this region point to the right it shows that there is an obvious one year resonance period in the time series of tws change derived from gnss gldas and grace in addition there is a secondary high energy spectrum region between gnss and gldas for 5 7 months i e semi annual variations during 2012 2016 and 2017 2021 fig 10 a and the corresponding secondary high energy spectrum region between the gnss and grace also occurs during 2012 2013 and 2014 2016 fig 10 b it shows that the gnss inferred tws changes are also in good agreement with gldas and grace estimates on the semi annual time scale in general gnss inferred tws changes show good consistency with grace and gldas estimates in both time and frequency domains and further indicates the reliability of gnss inversion results table 1 lists the detailed comparison of the annual amplitudes phases and linear trends of tws change time series derived from gnss gldas and grace gfo solutions in three different time periods i e december 2010 to february 2021 december 2010 to june 2017 and july 2017 june 2018 for gfo to february 2021 respectively as shown in table 1 since the ground based gnss is more sensitive to the regional short wavelength signals compared with grace gfo and the gldas does not include the tws components of deep groundwater rivers and lakes the amplitude of gnss inferred tws changes is obviously greater than those of grace gfo and gldas estimates especially for the operation phase of gfo mission the annual phases of gnss and gldas are more consistent than those of grace gfo during these three different time periods and the grace gfo observations lag behind the gnss estimates for about ten days this is because gnss and grace gfo present different sensitivities to tws changes the gnss is more sensitive to the short wavelength signals in the regional scale while grace gfo is more sensitive to long wavelength signals at global scale hsu et al 2020 as for the linear trend changes the rates of increasing trend from december 2010 to june 2017 of tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace are generally consistent while the rates of decreasing trend from july 2017 june 2018 for gfo to february 2021 of tws changes derived from gnss and gfo are more consistent and significantly faster than that of gldas derived tws changes the exact reason is unclear but the loss of groundwater may be one of the reasons because the deep groundwater is not included in gldas moreover during the entire study period gnss shows a slightly decreasing trend 0 80 2 56 mm yr while gldas 2 82 1 76 mm yr and grace gfo 3 93 2 80 mm yr show an increasing trend which may be related to the deduction of long term trend changes for gnss vertical displacements in the post processing see section 2 2 1 in general gnss inferred tws changes are independent and reliable which not only provides a special insight for studying tws changes but also complements to the limitations of grace and gfo observations in the ynp 6 discussion 6 1 correlation analysis between gnss inferred tws and precipitation data as mentioned above precipitation driven by the monsoon is the main source of the tws changes in the ynp to better investigate the linkages between gnss inferred tws changes and precipitation data we performed an in depth comparison between tws and precipitation change time series fig 11 displays the time series of tws change inferred by gnss gldas and grace gfo during december 2010 to february 2021 and precipitation time series during december 2010 to december 2020 in the ynp as shown in fig 11 precipitation shows a good consistency with gnss gldas and grace gfo derived tws changes in months with abundant or low precipitation the tws changes have peak or valley values with a time lag table 2 lists the correlation coefficients between precipitation with different time lags and the tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace gfo in the ynp we can see that the correlation between precipitation and tws changes are the best when precipitation with two months lag is considered this is because precipitation needs to take some time to undergo complex hydrodynamic processes including evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration etc before transforming into tws in addition the correlation between precipitation with two months lag and gnss inferred tws changes cc 0 88 is better than those of gldas cc 0 83 and grace gfo cc 0 77 it is indicated that the ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to precipitation changes and are more suitable for monitoring basin scale tws changes e g the ynp than those of grace gfo and gldas estimates 6 2 investigating drought events using gnss inferred tws in the ynp previous sections indicate that gnss inferred tws changes show good consistency with the grace gfo and gldas estimates and precipitation data in the spatio temporal domain further the reliability of gnss observations can be demonstrated by evaluating the ability of gnss inferred tws changes to monitor the drought events here we employed the gnss inferred tws changes to study the hydrological drought evolution process during the study period in the ynp according to the algorithm of calculating drought severity index dsi based on grace derived tws changes presented by zhao et al 2017 we calculated the dsi based on gnss inferred tws changes hereinafter called gnss dsi fig 12 presents the gnss dsi time series from december 2010 to february 2021 in the ynp and the dsi time series derived from tws changes of gldas and grace gfo and the published scpdsi were presented for comparison as shown in fig 12 a gnss dsi shows an increasing trend during 2011 to 2017 and a decreasing trend during 2017 to 2021 which are generally consistent with the trend of tws changes shown in fig 9 a it is indicated that the process of drought events can be quantified through the tws changes the tws derived dsi defines a severe drought as dsi 1 3 zhao et al 2017 and table s1 the two shaded grey areas in the fig 12 indicate two well documented severe droughts one is from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 wang et al 2014 2015 the other is from the summer of 2019 to the summer of 2020 wang et al 2021 it shows that gnss dsi can well capture the two severe drought events although it slightly underestimates the degree of the first drought event moreover both the dsi time series derived from tws changes of gldas and grace gfo estimates fig 12 b c also well capture the changing trend of drought process and these two severe drought events and the dsi time series derived from these three data i e gnss gldas and grace gfo show good agreement with each other table s2 fig 12 d presents the scpdsi time series from december 2010 to december 2019 in the ynp the scpdsi indicates a severe drought episode as pdsi 3 nathan et al 2004 as shown in fig 12 d the scpdsi time series shows an increasing trend from december 2010 to the middle of 2016 and a decreasing trend from the middle of 2016 to december 2019 which are generally consistent with the tws changes derived dsi fig 12 b and c the scpdsi time series also well reveals the severe drought event from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 and slightly underestimates the severe drought event in the 2019 in addition the spei time series with scales of 3 6 9 and 12 months from december 2010 to december 2017 were also presented for comparison fig s5 the spei time series indicates a severe drought episode as spei 1 5 vicente serrano et al 2010 and shows an increasing trend from december 2010 to july 2015 and a decreasing trend from august 2015 to december 2017 which are generally consistent with the tws derived dsi and scpdsi fig 12 the comprehensive comparisons of dsi time series demonstrate that gnss can be used as an effective tool to monitor hydrological drought events which further reveals the reliability of gnss inversion results and its application potential in regional tws changes research 7 conclusions in this study we presented a regularization constraint matrix i e a priori covariance matrix and an optimal regularization parameter estimation strategy i e adaptively determined through the iterative least squares estimation method to invert the gnss observations for tws changes the vertical displacement time series at 45 gnss stations from cmonoc were used to estimate the tws changes of the ynp from december 2010 to february 2021 the advantage of our inversion strategies is that the a priori constraint can introduce the priori information of geophysical models e g gldas hydrological model to improve the reliability of gnss inversion results and the optimal regularization parameter can be adaptively determined through the iterative least squares estimation method the gnss inferred tws changes were validated by the gldas and grace gfo estimated results as well as by the correlation analysis with meteorological data i e precipitation and dsi in the ynp the results demonstrate that the spatial resolution of tws changes derived from the 45 gnss stations can reach 2 2 in the ynp and the gnss inferred tws changes regularized by the a priori constraint matrix is more reliable than those of the traditional laplacian constraint matrix the spatial patterns and seasonal characteristics of tws change time series derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas were found to be highly consistent with each other however the gnss inferred tws changes present stronger amplitudes than those of gldas and grace gfo estimates because gnss observations are more sensitive to the changes of regional water mass load precipitation driven by the monsoon is the main source of the tws changes in the ynp and the spatio temporal distributions of tws changes and precipitation are in good agreement additionally the gnss inferred tws changes present better correlation with precipitation data compared with gldas and grace gfo estimates furthermore the gnss dsi can well reveal the hydrological drought process and the two severe drought events one from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 and the other from the summer of 2019 to the summer of 2020 during the study period of ynp which is consistent with the dsi derived from the gldas and grace gfo estimated tws changes and the published scpdsi and spei data with the continuous accumulation of data and the improvement of data processing strategies gnss observations have great potentials to study tws changes and extreme climate events e g hydrological drought especially for the regions with densely distributed gnss stations inferring tws changes using gnss vertical displacements is still a challenging work it is necessary to introduce more optimized and stable inversion algorithms to

2313,global navigation satellite system gnss is an effective means to monitor surface deformations associated with changes in terrestrial water storage tws in this study we introduced a priori constraint matrix and estimated the regularization parameter through an iterative least squares method to infer the tws changes using gnss vertical displacements from december 2010 to february 2021 in the yunnan province ynp china the gnss inferred tws changes were validated through the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on gfo estimates the global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model and the meteorological data i e precipitation and drought severity index dsi the results demonstrate that the spatial resolution of tws changes derived from 45 gnss stations can reach 2 2 in the ynp and the a priori constraint is better than the traditional laplacian matrix constraint for solving the discrete ill conditioned problem of gnss inversion the gnss inferred tws changes are consistent with the tws changes derived from grace gfo and gldas estimates in the spatio temporal domains over the ynp but the gnss inversion results show stronger amplitudes furthermore the ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to the tws changes and the correlation between precipitation and gnss inferred tws changes is improved by about 11 and 5 compared to grace gfo and gldas estimates in the ynp respectively the gnss inferred dsi can well reveal the two severe drought events in the ynp during the study period which is consistent with the dsi derived from grace gfo and gldas estimates as well as the published self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the gnss observations can compensate the limitations of grace gfo observations e g bridging the data gap between grace and gfo missions and help to better investigate the tws changes in the ynp which has significant potentials for regional water resource management and extreme climate changes monitoring keywords terrestrial water storage gnss vertical displacements yunnan province a priori constraint drought events data availability the data can be accessed through the website provided in the text 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws refers to the water stored both on the surface and underground which includes surface water groundwater glaciers snow and soil water etc the tws forms an important part of the global water cycle the accurate measurement of the migration and redistribution of tws changes has an important impact on evaluating the natural environment changes and water resource management plans rodell and famiglietti 1999 cazenave and chen 2010 rodell et al 2018 currently the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on gfo satellite observations have been widely used to quantify the large and medium scales tws changes tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2006 chen 2019 tapley et al 2019 nevertheless the application of grace gfo observations to investigate the continuous and refined regional tws changes is challenging due to the north south striping errors caused by the geometry of the polar type grace gfo mission swenson and wahr 2006 chen et al 2015 coarse spatial resolution of 300 500 km swenson and wahr 2006 wouters and schrama 2007 low temporal resolution i e monthly intervals and large data gap nearly one year data gap between grace and gfo missions of grace gfo observations to this end we need to explore other geodetic technologies to compensate the limitations of grace gfo observations according to green s function theory farrell 1972 the migration and redistribution of surface mass changes e g tws changes and the non tidal atmospheric and oceanic loading effects can deform the crust beneath the mass loading as well as in the vicinity of the loading as a function of the reciprocal distance conversely we can infer and monitor surface mass changes by observing the high precision surface deformation fields the global navigation satellite system gnss provides a powerful tool to continuously monitor the surface deformation fields in near real time at millimeter level accuracy this makes it possible to estimate the surface mass changes using the gnss surface displacement data especially the vertical displacements since blewitt et al 2001 first proposed the inversion method for quantifying surface mass changes using gnss surface displacements gnss inferred surface mass changes have been considered as a useful supplement of the grace gfo estimates for regions with proper gnss coverage moreover ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to the regional surface mass changes than grace gfo estimates which provides a reliable tool to study the refined regional tws changes argus et al 2014 first used the global positioning system gps observations to infer the regional tws changes the results showed that the spatial resolution of gps inferred tws changes can reach 50 km in california with densely distributed gps stations and the tws changes derived from gps grace and hydrological models were in good agreement with each other since then the gnss observations have been widely used to study the regional tws changes in different regions and continents including the united states argus et al 2014 2017 borsa et al 2014 fu et al 2015 jin and zhang 2016 enzminger et al 2018 china zhang et al 2016 zhong et al 2020a hsu et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 li et al 2022 and south america ferreira et al 2019 for instance jin and zhang 2016 used gps observations to investigate the severe drought in southwestern us during 2012 ferreira et al 2019 conducted a resolution analysis of the tws changes derived from daily gps observations over the south america zhong et al 2020a investigated the influence of station distribution on the gps inversion results and demonstrated the possibility of gps inferred surface mass changes to bridge the data gap between grace and gfo observations in southwest china jiang et al 2021 employed the daily gnss vertical displacements to track the tws changes induced by the extreme weather events in yunnan province because the correlation of the observations from adjacent gnss stations can introduce a large condition number into the normal matrix inversion of regional tws changes using gnss vertical displacements is a well known ill conditioned problem the common approach is to use the tikhonov regularization method tikhonov and arseninn 1977 tikhonov et al 1995 to stabilize the ill conditioned problem in which the second order laplacian matrix is used as the regularization constraint matrix and the l curve or generalized cross validation gcv method are used to determine the optimal regularization parameter argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 zhong et al 2020a however the laplacian matrix is a sparse matrix based on the perspective of geometry and does not have clear physical meaning moreover it is sometimes difficult to accurately estimate the optimal regularization parameter using the l curve or gcv method currently the inversion method for quantifying the tws changes using gnss observations is still a challenging task modified solving strategies should be introduced to improve the reliability of gnss inversion results including the construction of regularization constraint matrix and the optimal estimation of the regularization parameter in this study based on the tikhonov regularization method we presented the a priori covariance matrix calculated from the geophysical model i e hydrological model as the regularization constraint matrix additionally to obtain more stable and reliable inversion results the optimal regularization parameter was adaptively determined through data itself by using an iterative least squares estimation method compared with the laplacian matrix the a priori covariance matrix has clear physical meaning and the introduced a priori geophysical information can improve the reliability of gnss inversion results in addition we determined the optimal regularization parameter using the data driven method which can well utilize the observation data through iterative least squares estimation the objective of this study is to infer the tws changes based on the a priori constraint using the gnss vertical displacements in the yunnan province ynp of china for the period december 2010 to february 2021 first we compared the gnss inversion results based on the a priori covariance matrix and the traditional laplacian matrix constraint though a closed loop simulation second we used the measured gnss vertical displacement time series to infer the tws changes in the ynp and compared the results with grace gfo solutions and global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model in the spatio temporal domains finally we investigated the linkages between gnss inferred tws changes and precipitation data moreover the drought severity index dsi derived from gnss inferred tws changes was used to study the drought events in the ynp during the study period and the dsi inferred by grace gfo and gldas estimates as well as the published self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei were also used for comparison the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the detailed information of the study area datasets and the post processing of the geodetic

summary 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the ynp 97 31 106 11 e and 21 80 29 15 n fig 1 a is located on the eastern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau in the eastern part of the collision zone between the indian plate and the eurasian plate and the tectonic movement over this region is very intense the terrain of ynp is high in the northwest and low in the southeast fig 1 a and gradually decreases from north to south active faults and strong earthquakes are frequently developed in this region and their geological tectonic activities are closely related to the strong collision of the india eurasia plate since 45 ma england and molnar 1997 there are two major active fault zones i e the honghe fault zone and the xiaojiang fault zone fig 1 a in the ynp these faults divide the ynp into secondary blocks such as the sichuan yunnan diamond block the yunnan burma block and the south china block which control the obvious division of the regional stress field wang et al 1998 the gnss stations distributed in the ynp are affected by the seismic activities and tectonic effects induced by these fault zones these potential impacts should be minimized during the gnss data post processing the ynp has a subtropical plateau monsoon climate with remarkable three dimensional climate characteristics because of the unique geographical location ynp is intensively affected by the indian monsoon east asian monsoon and air masses from the qinghai tibet plateau zhang 1988 the vertical changes in temperature with terrain are unusually obvious in the ynp moreover the spatio temporal distributions of precipitation in this region are extremely uneven whereby the wet season is from may to october and this period concentrates 85 of the total rainfall on the other hand the dry season is from november to april of the following year and the rainfall during this period accounts for only 15 of the entire year the mean annual total precipitation in most areas exceeds 1000 mm fig 1 b from 2011 to 2020 these unique geomorphic features and climate diversities create unique biodiversity and form a huge wildlife germplasm resource bank in the ynp nevertheless global warming and frequent extreme climate events impose challenges to protect the ecological diversity of ynp being influenced by strong monsoon and topography this region is extremely sensitive to climate changes therefore study on the tws changes has great significances for water resource management and ecological environment protection in the ynp more importantly the ynp has relatively densely distributed gnss stations compared with other regions of the mainland china which provides the opportunity to infer the tws changes using gnss observations 2 2 materials 2 2 1 gnss data in this paper the vertical displacement time series at 45 gnss stations from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc over the period from december 2010 to february 2021 were used to infer tws changes in the ynp all gnss time series were downloaded from the national earthquake data center https www eqdsc com and were processed at the first monitoring and application center china earthquake administration the gnss vertical displacement time series released by the national earthquake data center were processed by using the gamit globk software version 10 4 herring et al 2018 and the quasi observation combination analysis qoca software based on the double differenced model before the gnss data processing the 230 gnss stations of the cmonoc were divided into six sub networks according to their geographic locations first the gamit software was used to solve the daily solutions of each sub network second the evenly distributed international terrestrial reference frame itrf 2008 core stations with good quality were selected as the fixed reference stations then the globk and qoca were used to perform the overall adjustment finally the qoca software was used for joint adjustment to obtain the final gnss displacement time series relative to the itrf 2008 the gnss surface displacement time series published by the national earthquake data center have been deducted the influence of solid earth tides ocean tides and polar tides therefore the gnss observations mainly represent the vertical displacements induced by tws changes non tidal atmospheric and oceanic loading effects in this study the post processing of gnss vertical displacement time series includes the following three steps first we removed the gross errors of gnss vertical displacement time series using the gross detection method presented in nikolaidis 2002 second we fitted each gnss vertical displacement time series with a position a linear trend annual signal and the heaviside function schumacher et al 2018 then we corrected the jumps and the long term trend changes mainly induced by the glacial isostatic adjustment gia or tectonic effects of gnss vertical displacement time series using the least squares linear fitting method third we interpolated the data gaps of gnss vertical displacement time series using the kriged kalman filter method proposed by liu et al 2017 in general these 45 gnss stations used in this study have good data availability during the study period and each station contains 95 of the observation data on average see fig s1 fig 2 shows the original light blue curves and post processing red curves gnss vertical displacement time series of two selected gnss stations i e ynsm and ynyl as shown in fig 2 the high frequency errors and data gaps of the original gnss vertical displacement time series can be well suppressed and interpolated through the post processing moreover we used the geophysical fluid loading products published by the earth system modeling group at deutsches geoforschungszentrum https esmdata gfz potsdam de 8080 repository dill and dobslaw 2013 to deduct the contributions of non tidal atmospheric and oceanic loading effects for gnss vertical displacements time series so as to infer the final tws changes in general the post processing of gnss vertical displacement time series is an essential step to improve the reliability of gnss inferred tws changes 2 2 2 grace gfo data to evaluate the reliability of gnss inversion results the monthly grace gfo release 06 rl06 mascon solutions save et al 2016 save 2020 published by the center for space research csr at the university of texas at austin were used to infer tws changes in the ynp the csr mascon solutions were downloaded from https www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html the released csr mascon solutions are generated on 0 25 0 25 grids however they are estimated on an equal area geodesic grid comprised of hexagonal tiles of approximately 120 km wide 1 1 at the equator the terms c20 and c30 gfo solutions only for the mascon solutions are replaced by the slr estimates loomis et al 2020 and the geo center and gia effects are corrected using the degree 1 coefficient from landerer 2019 and the ice 6g d model peltier et al 2018 respectively compared with the grace gfo spherical harmonic solutions the mascon solutions suppress the longitudinal stripes owing to the application of various constraints and do not require additional filtering and scaling factors corrections leading to higher precision and spatial resolution 2 2 3 gldas data the global land data assimilation systems gldas data are derived from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national centers of environmental prediction necp the gldas models use advanced data assimilation technology and land surface modeling technology to extract satellite and ground observations data for generating the best land surface state and flux field which mainly include noah vic clm and mosaic rodell et al 2004 in this study we used the gldas version 2 noah products downloaded from https hydro1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov opendap gldas gldas noah025 m 2 1 with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 grids and monthly intervals to estimate the tws changes i e the sum of canopy water soil moisture 0 2 m and snow water data layers the gldas derived tws changes over the period of december 2010 to february 2021 were used for comparison and as a priori model with the gnss inferred tws changes in the ynp 2 2 4 precipitation data the ground based precipitation observation data are published by the china meteorological data network https data cma cn and managed by the national meteorological information center nmic the published data are provided in 0 5 0 5 rectangle grids using records from 2472 weather stations in china in this study we used the precipitation data from december 2010 to december 2020 to infer the precipitation changes in the ynp 2 2 5 drought index data in order to assess the ability of gnss inferred tws changes for evaluating the drought events in the study area we used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei https spei csic es database html and the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi https www cru uea ac uk for comparison the spei was derived from the monthly precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration data from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia uea here we used the spei with four time scales i e spei 3 spei 6 spei 9 and spei 12 from december 2010 to december 2017 in the ynp and the scpdsi were presented for the time period from december 2010 to december 2019 3 methods 3 1 load green s function since the variations in surface mass load can deform the crust the surface deformation can be approximately expressed as elastic deformation based on the mass load green s function theory farrell 1972 the vertical displacements induced by unit mass load can be expressed using load green s function argus et al 2014 jin and zhang 2016 as follows 1 g φ r m e n 0 h n p n c o s φ where g φ is the green s function and φ is the angular distance between the gnss station and the mass load r and m e are the radius 6378 137 m and mass 5 965 1024 kg of the earth respectively h n are the load love numbers values are considered from wang et al 2012 p n are the legendre polynomials of order n for a specific study area the vertical displacements induced by l mass load grid cells can be expressed as follows 2 δ r i 1 l δ m i g φ in which δ r is the vertical displacement δ m i s i δ h i ρ w where δ m i s i and δ h i denote the mass area and height of the i th grid cell respectively ρ w 1000 k g m 3 is the density of the fresh water the eq 2 can be used to simulate the gnss vertical displacements according to the checkerboard signals and gldas hydrological model in the section 5 1 subsequently to facilitate the expression of the relationship between the tws changes and gnss observations the linear system of observation eq 2 can be expressed as follows 3 y a x e e 0 σ y 2 i where y y 1 y 2 y n obs t is the observation vector of gnss vertical displacements n obs is the number of gnss observations x x 1 x 2 x m t is the tws change parameter vector to be estimated which is expressed as the equivalent water height ewh m is the number of the grid cells and the division form of the grid cells is shown in fig 4 e e 1 e e n obs t is the residual vector of gnss observations with zero expectation and error variance σ y 2 and i is the identity matrix additionally the design matrix a corresponding to the green s function g φ is expressed as 4 a g φ 11 g φ 12 g φ 2 m g φ 21 g φ 22 g φ 2 m g φ n obs 1 g φ n obs 2 g φ 2 m g φ n obs m owing to the correlation of the gnss observations among the adjacent stations inferring regional tws changes by gnss vertical displacements can be categorized as a discrete ill conditioned problem to solve the ill conditioned problem and improve the reliability of gnss inverted tws changes the common approach is to use the tikhonov regularization method to stabilize the inversion results in which the laplacian matrix is used as the regularization constraint matrix the inversion model based on the tikhonov regularization method using the laplacian matrix constraint is as follows argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 5 x a t a λ 2 l t l 1 a t y x is the unknow tws change parameter vector to be estimated λ 2 is the regularization parameter the optimal estimate of λ 2 is commonly determined by the l curve fu et al 2015 or gcv method ferreira et al 2019 zhong et al 2020a l is the laplacian matrix which consists of the kernels 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 jiang et al 2021 or 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 li et al 2022 additionally the laplacian matrix is a sparse matrix which does not have clear physical meaning and only constrain the gnss inverted tws changes base on the perspective of geometry in addition to investigate the performance of the 45 gnss stations for recovering tws changes in the ynp a checkerboard test is performed in the section 5 1 1 3 2 inversion model for tws using a priori constraint to overcome the shortcomings of laplacian matrix constraint and obtain more stable and reliable inversion results we introduced a stochastic model for the unknown tws change parameter vector to stabilize the regularization solutions based on the a priori constraint e g hydrological model assuming the unknown tws change parameter vector x with priori expectation vector x 0 and covariance matrix c x the linear system of the a priori constraint equation of the new gnss inversion model can be written as follows zhong et al 2020b tangdamrongsub et al 2021 6 x 0 i x x e 0 e 0 0 c x where e 0 is the residual vector with zero expectation and covariance matrix c x and i x is the identity matrix in order to reduce the edge effects and obtain more reliable inversion results we extended the calculated region to 97 107 e and 20 30 n the calculated region was divided into 0 25 0 25 geographical grids and there are 1600 unknow tws change parameters to be estimated combing the eq 3 and eq 6 the least squares solutions of the unknow tws change parameter vector x can be estimated by using eq 7a and eq 7b as follows zhong et al 2020b 7a x a t a λ 2 σ y 2 c x 1 1 a t y λ 2 σ y 2 c x 1 x 0 7b λ 2 σ y 2 y t y x t 2 a t y x t 2 a t a x n obs x 0 x t c x 1 x 0 x because both the regularization parameter λ 2 and the error variance σ y 2 are unknow in eq 7a we simultaneously estimated the λ 2 σ y 2 using eq 7b starting with an initial value λ 2 σ y 2 to obtain the reliable solutions of the unknown tws change parameter vector we need to solve x and λ 2 σ y 2 iteratively based on eq 7a and eq 7b using the iterative least squares estimation method here assuming a stationary stochastic process for unknown tws change parameter vector x the covariance matrix c x can be obtained from the empirical covariance function as follows tangdamrongsub et al 2012 8 c x d ij σ x 2 exp d ij d where σ x 2 and d are the variance and correlation distance of the empirical covariance function and d ij is the distance between the i th and j th grid cells the eq 8 was used to fit the empirical covariance function and the empirical values of the covariance function were calculated from the grid values of gldas noah in the study area as follows tangdamrongsub et al 2012 tangdamrongsub et al 2021 9 c x d ij 1 n i j n f i f j d δ d 2 d ij d δ d 2 where f i and f j are the two tws change values on two grid cells separated by distance d ij n is the number of such distance pairs and δ d is the grid interval of the study area subsequently we can use the least squares method to estimate σ x 2 and d in the eq 8 after linearization it should be noted that the laplacian matrix is a sparse matrix based on geometric perspective and the function of the laplacian matrix is to suppress high frequency signals by smoothing the tws elements between adjacent grid cells while the a priori covariance matrix is derived from the real geophysical model e g gldas noah which introduces the a priori information to improve the stability and reliability of gnss inversion results 3 3 cross wavelet transformation the cross wavelet transformation cwt can simultaneously reveal the correlation between two time series in the frequency and time domains hudgins and huang 1996 it is widely used to analyze the correlation of hydrological and meteorological time series huang et al 2017 in this study we used the cwt to evaluate the consistency between the gnss inferred tws changes and grace gfo and gldas estimates the continuous wavelets transform of a time series u can be expressed as w u grinsted et al 2004 then the cwt of two hydrological and meteorological time series e g u n and v n can be defined as 10 w uv w u w v in which represents their complex conjugation their cross wavelet power is defined as w uv the complex argument arg w uv can be regarded as the local relative phase between u n and v n in both time and frequency domains if the u n and v n with the fourier spectra p k u and p k v the cross wavelet distribution can be expressed as follows torrence and compo 1998 11 w n u s w n v s σ u σ v z v p v p k u p k v where σ u and σ v are the respective standard deviations z v p is the confidence level corresponding to the probability p for a probability distribution function defined by the square root of the two χ 2 distributions which can be expressed as grinsted et al 2004 12 z v p 2 182 i f v 1 r e a l w a v e l e t s p 95 3 999 i f v 2 c o m p l e x w a v e l e t s p 95 4 research framework the aforementioned sections have introduced the research background datasets and methods used in the study to better present the overview of proposed method and results a flowchart of the assessments and applications of the proposed inversion method is presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the study content of the closed loop simulation with light green background reveals the optimal spatial resolution of tws changes derived from 45 gnss stations in the ynp and the superiority of the a priori covariance matrix over the traditional laplacian matrix the content of the comparison and analysis with light blue background presents the spatio temporal analysis of tws changes i e spatial patterns and seasonal changes of tws derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas in the ynp additionally the content of the validation and application with apricot colour background further reveals the performance and application of gnss inverted tws changes in regional meteorological and hydrological drought study 5 results 5 1 closed loop simulation 5 1 1 checkerboard test when the observation accuracy of gnss data remains unchanged the reliability of gnss inferred tws changes depends on the density and distribution of gnss stations to investigate the performance of the available 45 gnss stations for recovering tws signals in the ynp we conducted a checkerboard test we divided the study area into 0 25 0 25 grids and designed the checkerboard signals at 2 2 grids then we calculated the vertical displacements at gnss stations based on the checkerboard signals and inferred the tws changes using the simulated gnss observations fig 4 a shows the input checkerboard signals grids with 0 mm white grids and 300 mm brown grids ewh and the corresponding inversion results are presented in fig 4 b we can see that the inversion results can well recover the input checkerboard signals in the northeastern and southern parts of ynp due to the relatively densely distributed gnss stations but the checkerboard signals in the northwestern part of ynp are recovered relatively poorly where sparser gnss stations are distributed in general the average station distance of the available 45 gnss stations in the ynp is about 165 km and the vertical displacements of these gnss stations can be used to recover the tws changes very well with 2 2 spatial resolution which is better than the 300 500 km spatial resolution of grace gfo solutions however more gnss stations should be installed in the eastern and northwestern parts of ynp to improve the application potentials of gnss network 5 1 2 comparison of gnss inversion results using a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint using the laplacian matrix as a regularization constraint matrix and determining the optimal regularization parameter by l curve or gcv method is widely used to solve the discrete ill conditioned problem of inverting gnss observations for tws changes argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 zhong et al 2020a in this study we introduced the covariance matrix of a priori geophysical information i e gldas hydrological model as a regularization constraint matrix and employed the iterative least squares method to estimate the optimal regularization parameter for solving the ill conditioned problem of gnss inversion to assess the superiority of the a priori constraint matrix over the traditional laplacian matrix we conducted a closed loop simulation and the flowchart of the closed loop simulation can be found in fig s2 we used the original input signals gldas derived tws changes during january to december 2006 to simulate the vertical displacements at 45 gnss stations by eq 2 to be consistent with real gnss observations the gaussian white noises with a standard deviation of 1 mm were added to the simulated gnss vertical displacements before inversion of tws changes here we used the gldas derived tws changes after 300 km gauss filtering as the priori constraint information then the tws changes were inferred by the inversion model of eq 7a and the optimal regularization parameter was determined by eq 7b through the iterative least squares method in addition the gnss inversion results regularized by the traditional laplacian matrix with the optimal regularization parameter estimated by the gcv function zhong et al 2020a were presented for comparison fig 5 reveals the empirical covariance matrix c x and the fitted empirical covariance function and the iterative convergence curve from gldas derived tws changes in january 2006 in the ynp as shown in fig 5 a b the main diagonal elements of the empirical covariance matrix calculated from a priori information are evidently dominant and the corresponding fitted parameters σ x 2 2 87 10 3 mm2 and d 2 25 respectively as shown in fig 5 c the iterative convergence curve driven by the simulated gnss observations gradually converges after approximately three to four iterations in january 2006 furthermore we also investigated the sensitivity of gnss inferred tws changes to different priori information the results demonstrate that different priori information has little influence on gnss inverted tws changes and the overall characteristics of gnss inversion results remain unchanged additionally we also used incorrect a prior information that is completely out of phase with the original input signal to calculate the covariance matrix but the corresponding inversion results are generally consistent with the original input signal more detailed comparisons are presented in text s1 and fig s3 moreover the laplacian matrix fig s4 a b exhibits the similar distribution patterns as the covariance matrix c x and the gcv function curve gives a global optimal regularization parameter based on the perspective of statistics fig s4 c to assess the performance of different constraint matrices we calculated the differences between the original input signals and inversion results based on the a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint fig 6 reveals the comparison of the tws change time series derived from gldas i e original input signals and the inversion results derived from the simulated gnss observations based on the a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint during january to december 2006 in the ynp moreover the standard deviation std of the differences between original input signals and gnss inversion results based on different constraint matrices were also presented as shown in fig 6 a both the inversion results derived from simulated gnss observations based on the a priori constraint and laplacian matrix constraint can well recover the original input signal but the results corresponding to the a priori constraint are slightly closer to the original input signals compared with those of the laplacian matrix constraint as shown in fig 6 b the std corresponding to the a priori constraint is smaller than those of laplacian matrix constraint it demonstrates that the gnss inversion results based on the a priori constraint are generally more reliable than those of laplacian matrix constraint through the closed loop simulation from january to december 2006 in the ynp 5 2 spatial patterns of measured gnss inferred tws in the ynp to examine the performance of inverting gnss observations for tws changes using a priori constraint we used the measured vertical displacements at 45 gnss stations to infer the tws changes in the ynp and the grace gfo and gldas derived tws changes were presented for comparison fig 7 shows the spatial patterns of tws changes derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas in may and september 2011 and may and september 2019 as shown in fig 7 in may 2011 the tws changes derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas demonstrate similar spatial distribution characteristic with negative anomalies in the ynp but the grace derived results indicate stronger signals in the southwestern part of ynp in september 2011 the tws changes from these three data mainly present positive anomalies in the ynp while the gnss results show the strongest amplitude followed by the grace and the gldas is the smallest in addition the grace and gldas show negative anomalies in the northeastern part of ynp but the gnss does not reveal such signals in may 2019 the spatial patterns of tws changes are similar to those in may 2011 but the signal amplitudes are stronger in the southwestern part of ynp in september 2019 the spatial patterns of gnss and gfo derived tws changes are similar to those in september 2011 but the gldas results show different spatial characteristic in general gnss inferred tws changes show good consistency with grace gfo and gldas estimates for most months but the amplitudes are stronger except for may 2011 fig 8 presents the spatial patterns of annual amplitude and phases for tws changes derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas from december 2010 to february 2021 in the ynp in particular the annual amplitudes of grace gfo were simultaneously fitted using grace and gfo solutions as shown in fig 8 a c the annual amplitudes of tws change from these three data show similar spatial patterns and decrease from southwest to northeast among them gnss inferred tws changes demonstrate the strongest annual amplitudes which is because the ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to the regional tws changes than the satellite based geodetic techniques e g grace gfo and a single gnss station can be affected by the mass load changes within 100 200 km bevis et al 2005 followed by the grace gfo derived annual amplitudes although the grace gfo observes all water components including surface water groundwater soil moisture and snow the coarse spatial resolution i e 300 500 km of grace gfo solutions restricts their accurate estimate of tws changes at small scale area such as ynp and the gldas shows the weakest amplitudes because gldas derived tws changes only include the sum of canopy water soil moisture 0 2 m and snow water data layers but the deep groundwater and other surface water components e g rivers and lakes are not included in addition as we can see from the fig 1 b the spatial patterns of mean annual total precipitation show similar variation characteristic like the annual amplitudes of tws changes as in fig 8 a c this is because ynp belongs to the typical monsoon climate region the monsoon brings abundant precipitation to ynp every year jiang et al 2017 comparing figs 1 b and 8 a c we can see that precipitation dominates the tws changes in the ynp for the annual phases in fig 8 d f there is no significant regional difference in the annual phase of tws changes derived from these three products over the entire ynp it should be noted that the annual phases of tws changes derived from gnss and grace gfo are closer and lag behind the gldas estimates 5 3 temporal changes of measured gnss inferred tws in the ynp investigating the temporal changes of tws allows us for better understanding of water cycle processes fig 9 shows the time series of raw tws change seasonal and linear trend derived from gnss from december 2010 to february 2021 in the ynp and the gldas and grace gfo estimates were presented for comparison in particular the annual curve of grace gfo was simultaneously fitted using the grace and gfo solutions as shown in fig 9 a the tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace gfo show similar seasonal characteristics and present good consistent with each other in the ynp the correlation coefficient cc and std of the tws change time series between gnss and grace gfo are cc 0 84 std 56 19 mm and between gnss and gldas are cc 0 92 std 49 05 mm respectively furthermore the gnss inferred tws change time series provides an effective tool to bridge the nearly one year data gap between grace and gfo estimates in the ynp especially for the seasonal change characteristics as shown in fig 9 b the annual amplitude of gnss inferred tws time series is the largest followed by the grace gfo estimates and the gldas is the smallest the specific reasons are the same as presented in section 5 2 in addition the tws change time series display an increasing trend from december 2010 to june 2017 and a decreasing trend from july 2017 june 2018 of gfo to february 2021 more detailed comparisons are presented in table 1 to better investigate the consistency of tws changes from gnss with grace gfo and gldas estimates we used the cwt to further evaluate the correlation between tws changes from gnss gldas and grace fig 10 illustrates the cwt between the gnss inferred tws changes and gldas and grace estimates the gfo estimates are not considered for the data gap of grace gfo respectively we can see that the tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace observations present high energy spectrum region during 9 15 months i e annual variations throughout the entire study period and the arrows in this region point to the right it shows that there is an obvious one year resonance period in the time series of tws change derived from gnss gldas and grace in addition there is a secondary high energy spectrum region between gnss and gldas for 5 7 months i e semi annual variations during 2012 2016 and 2017 2021 fig 10 a and the corresponding secondary high energy spectrum region between the gnss and grace also occurs during 2012 2013 and 2014 2016 fig 10 b it shows that the gnss inferred tws changes are also in good agreement with gldas and grace estimates on the semi annual time scale in general gnss inferred tws changes show good consistency with grace and gldas estimates in both time and frequency domains and further indicates the reliability of gnss inversion results table 1 lists the detailed comparison of the annual amplitudes phases and linear trends of tws change time series derived from gnss gldas and grace gfo solutions in three different time periods i e december 2010 to february 2021 december 2010 to june 2017 and july 2017 june 2018 for gfo to february 2021 respectively as shown in table 1 since the ground based gnss is more sensitive to the regional short wavelength signals compared with grace gfo and the gldas does not include the tws components of deep groundwater rivers and lakes the amplitude of gnss inferred tws changes is obviously greater than those of grace gfo and gldas estimates especially for the operation phase of gfo mission the annual phases of gnss and gldas are more consistent than those of grace gfo during these three different time periods and the grace gfo observations lag behind the gnss estimates for about ten days this is because gnss and grace gfo present different sensitivities to tws changes the gnss is more sensitive to the short wavelength signals in the regional scale while grace gfo is more sensitive to long wavelength signals at global scale hsu et al 2020 as for the linear trend changes the rates of increasing trend from december 2010 to june 2017 of tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace are generally consistent while the rates of decreasing trend from july 2017 june 2018 for gfo to february 2021 of tws changes derived from gnss and gfo are more consistent and significantly faster than that of gldas derived tws changes the exact reason is unclear but the loss of groundwater may be one of the reasons because the deep groundwater is not included in gldas moreover during the entire study period gnss shows a slightly decreasing trend 0 80 2 56 mm yr while gldas 2 82 1 76 mm yr and grace gfo 3 93 2 80 mm yr show an increasing trend which may be related to the deduction of long term trend changes for gnss vertical displacements in the post processing see section 2 2 1 in general gnss inferred tws changes are independent and reliable which not only provides a special insight for studying tws changes but also complements to the limitations of grace and gfo observations in the ynp 6 discussion 6 1 correlation analysis between gnss inferred tws and precipitation data as mentioned above precipitation driven by the monsoon is the main source of the tws changes in the ynp to better investigate the linkages between gnss inferred tws changes and precipitation data we performed an in depth comparison between tws and precipitation change time series fig 11 displays the time series of tws change inferred by gnss gldas and grace gfo during december 2010 to february 2021 and precipitation time series during december 2010 to december 2020 in the ynp as shown in fig 11 precipitation shows a good consistency with gnss gldas and grace gfo derived tws changes in months with abundant or low precipitation the tws changes have peak or valley values with a time lag table 2 lists the correlation coefficients between precipitation with different time lags and the tws changes derived from gnss gldas and grace gfo in the ynp we can see that the correlation between precipitation and tws changes are the best when precipitation with two months lag is considered this is because precipitation needs to take some time to undergo complex hydrodynamic processes including evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration etc before transforming into tws in addition the correlation between precipitation with two months lag and gnss inferred tws changes cc 0 88 is better than those of gldas cc 0 83 and grace gfo cc 0 77 it is indicated that the ground based gnss observations are more sensitive to precipitation changes and are more suitable for monitoring basin scale tws changes e g the ynp than those of grace gfo and gldas estimates 6 2 investigating drought events using gnss inferred tws in the ynp previous sections indicate that gnss inferred tws changes show good consistency with the grace gfo and gldas estimates and precipitation data in the spatio temporal domain further the reliability of gnss observations can be demonstrated by evaluating the ability of gnss inferred tws changes to monitor the drought events here we employed the gnss inferred tws changes to study the hydrological drought evolution process during the study period in the ynp according to the algorithm of calculating drought severity index dsi based on grace derived tws changes presented by zhao et al 2017 we calculated the dsi based on gnss inferred tws changes hereinafter called gnss dsi fig 12 presents the gnss dsi time series from december 2010 to february 2021 in the ynp and the dsi time series derived from tws changes of gldas and grace gfo and the published scpdsi were presented for comparison as shown in fig 12 a gnss dsi shows an increasing trend during 2011 to 2017 and a decreasing trend during 2017 to 2021 which are generally consistent with the trend of tws changes shown in fig 9 a it is indicated that the process of drought events can be quantified through the tws changes the tws derived dsi defines a severe drought as dsi 1 3 zhao et al 2017 and table s1 the two shaded grey areas in the fig 12 indicate two well documented severe droughts one is from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 wang et al 2014 2015 the other is from the summer of 2019 to the summer of 2020 wang et al 2021 it shows that gnss dsi can well capture the two severe drought events although it slightly underestimates the degree of the first drought event moreover both the dsi time series derived from tws changes of gldas and grace gfo estimates fig 12 b c also well capture the changing trend of drought process and these two severe drought events and the dsi time series derived from these three data i e gnss gldas and grace gfo show good agreement with each other table s2 fig 12 d presents the scpdsi time series from december 2010 to december 2019 in the ynp the scpdsi indicates a severe drought episode as pdsi 3 nathan et al 2004 as shown in fig 12 d the scpdsi time series shows an increasing trend from december 2010 to the middle of 2016 and a decreasing trend from the middle of 2016 to december 2019 which are generally consistent with the tws changes derived dsi fig 12 b and c the scpdsi time series also well reveals the severe drought event from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 and slightly underestimates the severe drought event in the 2019 in addition the spei time series with scales of 3 6 9 and 12 months from december 2010 to december 2017 were also presented for comparison fig s5 the spei time series indicates a severe drought episode as spei 1 5 vicente serrano et al 2010 and shows an increasing trend from december 2010 to july 2015 and a decreasing trend from august 2015 to december 2017 which are generally consistent with the tws derived dsi and scpdsi fig 12 the comprehensive comparisons of dsi time series demonstrate that gnss can be used as an effective tool to monitor hydrological drought events which further reveals the reliability of gnss inversion results and its application potential in regional tws changes research 7 conclusions in this study we presented a regularization constraint matrix i e a priori covariance matrix and an optimal regularization parameter estimation strategy i e adaptively determined through the iterative least squares estimation method to invert the gnss observations for tws changes the vertical displacement time series at 45 gnss stations from cmonoc were used to estimate the tws changes of the ynp from december 2010 to february 2021 the advantage of our inversion strategies is that the a priori constraint can introduce the priori information of geophysical models e g gldas hydrological model to improve the reliability of gnss inversion results and the optimal regularization parameter can be adaptively determined through the iterative least squares estimation method the gnss inferred tws changes were validated by the gldas and grace gfo estimated results as well as by the correlation analysis with meteorological data i e precipitation and dsi in the ynp the results demonstrate that the spatial resolution of tws changes derived from the 45 gnss stations can reach 2 2 in the ynp and the gnss inferred tws changes regularized by the a priori constraint matrix is more reliable than those of the traditional laplacian constraint matrix the spatial patterns and seasonal characteristics of tws change time series derived from gnss grace gfo and gldas were found to be highly consistent with each other however the gnss inferred tws changes present stronger amplitudes than those of gldas and grace gfo estimates because gnss observations are more sensitive to the changes of regional water mass load precipitation driven by the monsoon is the main source of the tws changes in the ynp and the spatio temporal distributions of tws changes and precipitation are in good agreement additionally the gnss inferred tws changes present better correlation with precipitation data compared with gldas and grace gfo estimates furthermore the gnss dsi can well reveal the hydrological drought process and the two severe drought events one from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 and the other from the summer of 2019 to the summer of 2020 during the study period of ynp which is consistent with the dsi derived from the gldas and grace gfo estimated tws changes and the published scpdsi and spei data with the continuous accumulation of data and the improvement of data processing strategies gnss observations have great potentials to study tws changes and extreme climate events e g hydrological drought especially for the regions with densely distributed gnss stations inferring tws changes using gnss vertical displacements is still a challenging work it is necessary to introduce more optimized and stable inversion algorithms to improve the accuracy and reliability of gnss inversion results credit authorship contribution statement xianpao li methodology data curation software validation writing original draft bo zhong

2314,tree transpiration and associated evaporative cooling play a critical role in water cycles and combating urban heat islands effects however species differences in transpiration magnitude seasonality and biophysical regulation in dryland urban regions are not well understood we measured the sap flow of three widely planted coniferous species pinus tabulaeformis pinus sylvestris and picea meyeri for urban greening and concurrent soil moisture and meteorological variables in three pure urban forest plantations during three successive growing seasons may to september during 2017 2019 under a semiarid urban environment in northern china stand level transpiration e c differed significantly among the three species p 0 001 where the mean daily e c of p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri plantations were 0 78 0 02 mm d 1 0 68 0 01 mm d 1 and 0 20 0 01 mm d 1 respectively additionally distinct differences in the seasonality of e c were observed among tree species except for 2017 the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris maintained at low levels in may and june and increased significantly with precipitation in july and august p 0 05 when soil volumetric water content vwc increased but the e c of p meyeri remained relatively stable throughout the growing season responses of e c in p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations to meteorological factors can be changed by soil water availability under relatively higher water availability the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were primarily controlled by vapor pressure deficit vpd and solar radiation r s under soil water stress the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were more affected by vwc than p meyeri biologically p tabulaeformis had a higher stomatal sensitivity to vpd than p sylvestris and p meyeri at the beginning of growing seasons the high water use in p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations could lead to soil water depletion therefore the species specific biophysical regulations of tree water use should be carefully considered for urban forest management to achieve ecosystem services by balancing the tradeoff between water consumption and its cooling effects through evapotranspiration in semiarid cities keywords stand transpiration soil water availability meteorological factors urban environments canopy conductance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban trees and forests provide green spaces for recreation and aesthetic pleasure wang et al 2012 and effectively alleviate urban heat island through latent heat flux winbourne et al 2020 since impervious surfaces dominate the land cover in the urban area tree transpiration may be the main source of latent heat flux in the area konarska et al 2016 wang et al 2019a furthermore owing to the increase of atmospheric evaporative demand and temperature in urban environments moriwaki and kanda 2004 li et al 2013 the transpiration of urban trees may be greater than that of trees grown in natural areas particularly in cities of dryland areas trees are vulnerable to water scarcity due to limited water resources and unfavorable conditions such as pollution insect and disease attacks livesley et al 2016 urban trees may require irrigation to maintain water use and healthy growth mccarthy and pataki 2010 leading to the increased maintenance cost of urban trees and forests in dryland areas therefore tree species selection based on transpiration characteristics is critical for urban forestry managers to balance water consumption and ecological services numerous studies suggested that meteorological factors play a decisive role in tree transpiration under wet conditions mcjannet et al 2007 horna et al 2011 tie et al 2017 and the effects of meteorological factors can be more pronounced in urban environments when soil water availability is high mccarthy and pataki 2010 winbourne et al 2020 however in arid or semiarid areas tree transpiration is strongly affected by soil water availability llorens et al 2010 brito et al 2014 compared with trees in non urban environments soil moisture shortage can lead to greater decrease in tree transpiration and tree transpiration is more sensitive to vpd in urban environments riikonen et al 2016 these differences are not only associated with the difference in external environmental conditions but also with tree biological characteristics pataki et al 2011 litvak et al 2012 when drought occurs some tree species can prevent excessive water loss and maintain a stable leaf water potential by significantly reducing transpiration tuzet et al 2003 fisher et al 2006 under high vapor pressure deficit vpd conditions trees can exhibit a decrease in water consumption cunningham 2004 whitley et al 2013 conversely there are tree species that maintain high transpiration even under high vpd and solar radiation conditions zhu et al 2015 song et al 2020 in addition urban environments may alter the physiological ecological response processes of trees compared to natural environments thomsen et al 2020 leading to great uncertainty and complexity in water use by urban trees in arid or semiarid areas in semiarid urban areas trees may suffer from more soil water limitation and higher evapotranspiration demand than their counterparts in natural environments asawa et al 2017 chen et al 2022a kendal et al 2018 suggested that changes in the structural composition of urban tree populations driven by environmental changes will exceed those predicted for trees in natural environments in addition in forest ecosystems evaporative responses to climate change are partly related to tree species composition peters et al 2010 in recent years compound extreme events such as drought and high temperature have been increasing globally masson delmotte et al 2021 the frequency of extreme heat events is also increasing in urban environments livesley et al 2016 these extreme heat events directly and severely affect tree health allen et al 2010 anderegg et al 2013 under the context of climate change the effectiveness of the water use strategy becomes important for tree survival mcdowell et al 2008 especially in the dryland area it is necessary and needed to understand how the transpiration of different types of urban tree species responds to environmental changes tree transpiration and its adaptation to water availability are also closely related to species specific physiological processes trees can respond to environmental conditions by regulating their hydraulic systems and leaf stomata ayutthaya et al 2011 pangle et al 2015 matheny et al 2017 previous studies have found that urban tree transpiration is strongly controlled by leaf stomatal regulation chen et al 2011 chen et al 2022b and the strong stomatal regulation and its positive response to hydraulic conductance can improve the adaptability of trees to droughts sperry 2000 2016 however some tree species still maintain stomatal opening under soil water stress zhu et al 2015 konings and gentine 2017 but this stomatal behavior increases the risk of hydraulic cavitation novick et al 2019 moreover the effects of leaf stomata on plant transpiration may change under different water conditions gu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 hence in order to better formulate scientific water management policies under the background of climate change it is urgent to clarify the possible species specific biological regulations of water use for urban trees as native and widely used coniferous species for afforestation in semiarid areas of north china zhang et al 2012 bao 2015 sun and liu 2015 pinus tabulaeformis pinus sylvestris and picea meyeri with the cold and drought resistant nature are also widely used in cities of dryland regions for urban parks roadside greening and residential area greening wen et al 2011 chen et al 2015 chen et al 2022a most studies on the water use relationships of these plantations are conducted in non urban environments while the differences in transpiration variations and their biophysical regulations in semiarid urban environments are not fully understood therefore we set the objective to compare and determine the water use relationships of tree species in water controlled dryland cities e g annual precipitation below 400 mm per year the objectives of this study are to 1 identify the differences in stand transpiration among tree species in a semiarid urban environment 2 elucidate species specific biophysical regulation of stand transpiration and 3 quantify and understand the proportion of stand transpiration in precipitation for different plantations during growing seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 site and stand description the study site is

chen et al 2022b the arboretum is located in the built up area of hohhot city in a semiarid region chen et al 2022a fig 1 which has documented urban heat islands zhou et al 2014 and water limitations of plant growth li et al 2017 three pure coniferous plantation forests including p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri were selected to conduct the study during the growing season from may to september for three consecutive years from 2017 to 2019 fig 1 stands and sampled trees survey were implemented at the beginning of each growing season table 1 the canopy height was measured by an optical height meter cgq 1 harbin optical instrument factory co ltd china 2 2 monitoring of environmental factors meteorological variables were measured by a dynamet automatic weather station dynamax

campbell scientific inc logan ut usa vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from t a and relative humidity campbell and norman 1998 soil volumetric water content of each plantation vwc m3 m 3 was measured at 0 1 m 0 3 m and 0 5 m soil depths by 5te soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa the sensors were scanned every 30 s and recorded at a 30 min interval using an em50 data logger decagon devices inc pullman usa the relative extractable water rew was calculated as follows granier 1987 1 rew vwc vwc w vwc c vwc w where vwc c is the soil moisture at soil field capacity determined in the laboratory by taking soil samples and vwc w is the soil moisture at a wilting point estimated by the soil moisture when soil water potential is approximately 1500 kpa thomsen et al 2020 soil water stress can be identified based on the relationship between the ratio of actual stand transpiration to reference evapotranspiration and rew chen et al 2014 in previous studies stand transpiration was more impacted by soil moisture when rew 0 4 granier 1987 chen et al 2022a thus soil water availability can be classified into two categories with no soil water stress when rew 0 4 and water stress when rew 0 4 the reference evapotranspiration et 0 mm was estimated by the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ

determined by calculating the area turning red after treating the increment cores with a safranin o solution spicer and gartner 2001 the relationship between a s and diameter at breast height dbh was

previous similar studies ghimire et al 2014 di et al 2019 chen et al 2020 6 8 sample trees representing the dbh classes distribution of each stand were selected to measure the sap flow the thermal

north of each tree to minimize measurement errors granier 1987 komatsu et al 2016 after being sealed with silicone gel the sensor units were covered with reflective insulation to reduce the possible effects of solar radiation precipitation and natural thermal gradients ghimire et al 2014 data monitoring frequency was set to 10 s and the mean value was recorded by cr1000 dataloggers campbell scientific inc logan ut usa at a 30 min interval the sap flux density in the outermost 20 mm of sapwood depth j o g cm 2 s 1 was calculated using the empirical equation granier 1987 3 j o 0 0119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where δt c is the temperature difference between the two probes and δt m is the value of δt when there is no sap flux the sap flux density may not reach zero every night and the daily maximum values of δt are not appropriate to represent δt m chen et al 2020 therefore δt m was estimated by using baseliner software version 3 0 ram oren duke university durham nc usa oishi et al 2008 2016 considering the depth of sapwood is 20 mm the radial variation of sap flux density should be taken into account the sap flux density was calculated by the generalized gaussian function in

0 001 under different soil moisture conditions fig 7 a c the sensitivity of g c to vpd increased with rew for p tabulaeformis when rew 0 6 and dg c dlnvpd reached the maximum when 0 4 rew 0 6 fig 7a the sensitivity of g c to vpd for p sylvestris increased with rew and dg c dlnvpd reached the maximum when rew 0 6 fig 7b however the sensitivity of g c to vpd for p meyeri did not change significantly under different rew conditions fig 7c the relationships of dg c dlnvpd to g cref did not vary between the three tree species under different soil moisture conditions with a slope of 0 54 for p tabulaeformis 0 50 for p sylvestris and 0 49 for p meyeri fig 7d the slope of p tabulaeformis was similar to 0 6 whereas the slopes of p sylvestris and p meyeri were significantly lower p 0 01 than 0 6 3 5 the ratios of e c to p and et 0 throughout the growing season of 2017 2019 the e c p for p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri was 0 41 0 39 and 0 15 respectively and the e c et 0 for p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri was 0 48 0 41 and 0 17 respectively table 2 on the monthly scale the e c p of three plantations was maintained at relatively high levels in may and june in particular the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris exceeded the p in may with the e c p of 1 25 for p tabulaeformis and 1 28 for p sylvestris fig 8 a however the e c et 0 of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were relatively low in may and june and they reached the maximum value of 0 80 and 0 63 in august fig 8b in contrast the e c et 0 of p meyeri remained at a relatively stable level and reached the maximum value of 0 19 in september fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 seasonality of e c in different plantations the e c of three urban plantations varied greatly in magnitude and seasonality during three consecutive growing seasons fig 3p r because of less precipitation and relatively constant vwc fig 3m the variation range of e c in p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations was relatively small throughout the growing season of 2017 fig 3p however due to the low precipitation and vwc in may and june in 2018 and 2019 fig 3n and o the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris was lower than in other months fig 3q and r this was attributed to the fact that trees prevent excessive water loss by reducing transpiration during droughts jiao et al 2016 dang et al 2021 but soil and atmospheric droughts will also increase the degree of xylem embolism and reduce the gas exchange rate savi et al 2015 compared with our study during the growing season p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were found to maintain more stable water use in non urban areas wu et al 2018 song et al 2022 this may be related to impervious surfaces and a high degree of soil compaction in urban environments song et al 2015 suggested the transpiration rate water use efficiency and co2 use efficiency of trees with totally and partly impervious surface were 20 40 less than those on the grass land thus urban trees may be more susceptible to soil water limitations than trees in non urban areas from june to august the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased gradually with increasing precipitation and soil moisture fig 3p r and this water supplement also can reduce xylem cavitation and promote tree growth nitschke et al 2017 however low soil moisture did not lead to a decrease in e c of p meyeri and the e c in may and june were higher than in other months fig 3p r this difference may be attributed to the less water use of p meyeri compared with p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris although p meyeri belongs to the shallow rooted tree species the water absorbed by root systems may satisfy its transpiration in relatively dry periods matheny et al 2017 consequently relatively low vwc did not inhibit p meyeri transpiration in may and june on the contrary the higher vpd r s and et 0 in may can promote tree transpiration without water limitation schmidt walter et al 2014 causing the e c of p meyeri in may to be significantly higher than in other months fig 3 in july and august although the precipitation and vwc increased the e c of p meyeri did not increase due to the significant decrease in vpd r s and et 0 in september although soil moisture was higher than in may and june the decreases of vpd r s and et 0 weakened the e c of three plantations 4 2 differences in environmental controls on e c between species the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris decreased significantly when soil water availability was reduced whereas p meyeri with the low e c was weakly affected by soil moisture fig 4 the difference in transpiration of tree species was related to species specific water use and its sensitivity to soil drought bovard et al 2005 wang et al 2019b in addition to the relatively high evaporation demand in urban environments ballinas and barradas 2016 broad impervious surfaces may intensify the limitation of water deficit on transpiration song et al 2015 p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations may be more susceptible to soil water deficit and tree xylem cavitation in urban environments savi et al 2015 despite p tabulaeformis having strong drought adaptations and deep roots liang et al 2003 this was demonstrated in a previous study where moser reischl et al 2018 found that trees less affected by abiotic and biotic stresses in rural environments grew better than trees situated in the city center under drought conditions the decline in water use of urban trees also can be beneficial for tree survival espadafor et al 2017 additionally soil moisture and meteorological conditions had interactive effects on forest transpiration fig 5 under relatively sufficient soil moisture conditions vpd was the main driver of e c in three plantations the result was similar to the study in humid boreal regions vpd and r s were the major drivers of tree transpiration under high soil moisture conditions oogathoo et al 2020 t a also could significantly impact the e c of p sylvestris fig 5b the higher vpd and t a in urban environments zhou et al 2014 can promote tree water use when soil water was not limited mccarthy and pataki 2010 as soil water stress progressed the effects of r s and vwc on the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased due to soil water stress fig 5a and b however p meyeri water use was not impacted by vwc and it was positively correlated with vpd throughout the study period fig 5c thus p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris water use were more restricted by water limitation than p meyeri moreover the e c of p tabulaeformis was significantly inhibited by vpd fig 5a which was related to the stomatal closure in response to increasing evaporative demand brito et al 2014 the reason is that soil moisture has more impacts on e c for plantations in urban conditions for example song et al 2022 found the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were still mainly controlled by r s and vpd under stressed conditions in non urban environments by comparison of the differences between species the leaf stomata of p tabulaeformis was more sensitive to environments than p sylvestris and p meyeri fig 7 in addition given the significant effect of vwc on the e c of p sylvestris throughout the study period p sylvestris may be more vulnerable to water shortage than p tabulaeformis and p meyeri the drought vulnerability of p sylvestris was also found in non urban environments and p sylvestris may suffer obvious dieback when extreme drought occurred song et al 2022 due to the limited forest stand comparison the results may subject to uncertainties in environmental conditions stand heterogeneity sample tree selection and sapwood area estimation ewers et al 2000 hentschel et al 2013 also data bias can lead to uncertainty in model calculations and statistical analyses therefore future studies need to further expand stand and tree samples to reduce errors in the observed data 4 3 species differences in g c and biological controls previous studies have suggested stomatal regulations varied among tree species owing to the differences in environmental conditions and tree species characteristics litvak et al 2012 grossiord et al 2020 in contrast the hydraulic architectures composed of tracheids in conifer species are more resistant to cavitation than angiosperms and their hydraulic conductivity is lower choat et al 2012 similarly we found that the g c and e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were vulnerable to soil drought figs 3 and 6 during soil droughts i e may and june the tight stomatal regulation on transpiration can help conifer trees to maintain a constant water potential gradient and hydraulic safety mcdowell et al 2008 chen et al 2022b as precipitation and soil moisture increased from july to september fig 3m o the g c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased significantly leading to more water use figs 3 and 6 p meyeri stands had lower water consumption and stomatal sensitivity than p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris fig 7 thus could maintain relatively stable g c over time considerable evidence indicates that plant stomatal activities are mainly impacted by vpd tang et al 2006 brito et al 2015 grossiord et al 2020 although soil moisture can alter g c responses to vpd bovard et al 2005 the effect of vpd on g c has been found to be greater than soil moisture globally flo et al 2022 sopharat et al 2015 also found that the impact of atmospheric drought on tree transpiration appeared to be more important than soil drought under soil water stressed conditions the stomatal openness of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris was more inhibited by vpd and g c and its sensitivity to vpd declined significantly with increasing vpd due to stomatal closure thus reducing tree water loss conversely the sensitivity of g c to vpd for p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased obviously with increasing soil water availability fig 7a and b this was because the trees enhanced their stomatal regulation of transpiration in response to increasing evaporative demand franks et al 2007 schmidt walter et al 2014 in contrast the g c of p meyeri was not sensitive to vpd fig 7c the same phenomenon was also found at half hour timescales as vpd increased the g c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris reached the maximum earlier than p meyeri fig 6d moreover the higher stomatal sensitivity of p tabulaeformis was confirmed in this study fig 7d and the stomatal closure caused by high vpd led to the negative relationship between e c and vpd for p tabulaeformis when soil water stress occurred fig 5a in summary p tabulaeformis can avoid excessive water loss through stronger stomatal regulation in comparison to p sylvestris and p meyeri during soil and atmosphere droughts strong stomatal regulations can help trees control water use to avoid xylem embolism caused by excessive dehydration hartmann 2011 martin stpaul et al 2017 however p sylvestris water use was more impacted by soil moisture than p tabulaeformis and p meyeri and it may easily suffer from tree dieback song et al 2022 due to low water consumption and stable g c p meyeri can maintain a stable water status and be at a lower risk of xylem hydraulic failure 4 4 implications and limitations urban trees consume a large amount of groundwater or soil water stored in a clay layer to sustain transpiration marchionni et al 2019 similarly p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations need soil water stored from the previous year to meet transpiration demand table 2 particularly in relatively dry may the higher atmospheric evaporation demand promoted tree water loss than in other months fig 8 from june to september as soil moisture increased the e c and its ratio to et 0 of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased dramatically fig 8b based on this p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations could provide a better cooling effect by high transpiration than p meyeri in urban environments however climate change has led to varying degrees of variability in regional temperature and precipitation grossiord et al 2016 choat et al 2018 in semiarid areas frequent drought and high temperature events may have a great impact on the water use of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations although p tabulaeformis can reduce transpiration by strong stomatal control the short term droughts in the early stage of the growing season can aggravate water competition between individual trees hinder tree growth and even profoundly influence forest ecosystems mackay et al 2012 jiao et al 2016 especially in may and june due to relatively low precipitation and dry soil conditions irrigation may be necessary for the fast growing p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris tree planting and maintenance have been increasingly used as one of the most effective nature based solutions nbs to mitigate the urban heat island and manage the urban stormwater under the global warming hobbie et al 2020 cortinovis et al 2022 thom et al 2022 therefore it is of critical importance to understand the water use and its biophysical governing mechanism of different tree species in cities across different geographical zones for managing the tradeoffs of multiple ecosystem services provided by urban trees and forests rana et al 2020 rötzer et al 2021 chen et al 2022a however our study focused on the water relation of only three widely planted coniferous species in a semiarid city in northern china and could not provide a whole picture of tree transpiration for the whole city and the cities across different climate zones transpiration studies of more tree species in more cities located in the different climate zone should be conducted in the future for comprehensively understanding the regulatory mechanisms of tree transpiration and for guiding tree species selection toward sustainable urban management objectives under the global climate change 5 conclusions this study revealed the seasonal variations and biophysical controls of stand transpiration in three widely used coniferous afforestation species in semiarid areas of northern china p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri due to little precipitation and low soil moisture in may and june p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris maintained low stand transpiration as soil moisture increased the stand transpiration of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased significantly in contrast the stand transpiration of p meyeri was relatively stable and even maintained at a higher level in may than in other months when soil water was sufficient vpd and solar radiation were major influencing factors of stand transpiration for p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris additionally air temperature and soil moisture can promote p sylvestris transpiration p meyeri transpiration was positively correlated to vpd and soil moisture under soil water stressed conditions the stand transpiration of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were significantly reduced and the effects of soil moisture were increased in contrast p tabulaeformis showed stronger stomatal regulation than p sylvestris and p meyeri and high vpd inhibited stomatal openness to reduce water loss during droughts whereas p sylvestris water use was more vulnerable to soil water shortage consequently during droughts with high atmospheric evaporation demand and low soil moisture e g may and june p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris consumed more soil water than p meyeri to reduce the drought stress on the forest ecosystem and provide better cooling effects in urban environments through transpiration p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris may need irrigation at the beginning of the growing season however a complete water balance study that accounts for all the water flux canopy interception and soil evaporation is needed to fully evaluate the water demands of these three key species in the study region

2314,tree transpiration and associated evaporative cooling play a critical role in water cycles and combating urban heat islands effects however species differences in transpiration magnitude seasonality and biophysical regulation in dryland urban regions are not well understood we measured the sap flow of three widely planted coniferous species pinus tabulaeformis pinus sylvestris and picea meyeri for urban greening and concurrent soil moisture and meteorological variables in three pure urban forest plantations during three successive growing seasons may to september during 2017 2019 under a semiarid urban environment in northern china stand level transpiration e c differed significantly among the three species p 0 001 where the mean daily e c of p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri plantations were 0 78 0 02 mm d 1 0 68 0 01 mm d 1 and 0 20 0 01 mm d 1 respectively additionally distinct differences in the seasonality of e c were observed among tree species except for 2017 the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris maintained at low levels in may and june and increased significantly with precipitation in july and august p 0 05 when soil volumetric water content vwc increased but the e c of p meyeri remained relatively stable throughout the growing season responses of e c in p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations to meteorological factors can be changed by soil water availability under relatively higher water availability the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were primarily controlled by vapor pressure deficit vpd and solar radiation r s under soil water stress the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were more affected by vwc than p meyeri biologically p tabulaeformis had a higher stomatal sensitivity to vpd than p sylvestris and p meyeri at the beginning of growing seasons the high water use in p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations could lead to soil water depletion therefore the species specific biophysical regulations of tree water use should be carefully considered for urban forest management to achieve ecosystem services by balancing the tradeoff between water consumption and its cooling effects through evapotranspiration in semiarid cities keywords stand transpiration soil water availability meteorological factors urban environments canopy conductance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban trees and forests provide green spaces for recreation and aesthetic pleasure wang et al 2012 and effectively alleviate urban heat island through latent heat flux winbourne et al 2020 since impervious surfaces dominate the land cover in the urban area tree transpiration may be the main source of latent heat flux in the area konarska et al 2016 wang et al 2019a furthermore owing to the increase of atmospheric evaporative demand and temperature in urban environments moriwaki and kanda 2004 li et al 2013 the transpiration of urban trees may be greater than that of trees grown in natural areas particularly in cities of dryland areas trees are vulnerable to water scarcity due to limited water resources and unfavorable conditions such as pollution insect and disease attacks livesley et al 2016 urban trees may require irrigation to maintain water use and healthy growth mccarthy and pataki 2010 leading to the increased maintenance cost of urban trees and forests in dryland areas therefore tree species selection based on transpiration characteristics is critical for urban forestry managers to balance water consumption and ecological services numerous studies suggested that meteorological factors play a decisive role in tree transpiration under wet conditions mcjannet et al 2007 horna et al 2011 tie et al 2017 and the effects of meteorological factors can be more pronounced in urban environments when soil water availability is high mccarthy and pataki 2010 winbourne et al 2020 however in arid or semiarid areas tree transpiration is strongly affected by soil water availability llorens et al 2010 brito et al 2014 compared with trees in non urban environments soil moisture shortage can lead to greater decrease in tree transpiration and tree transpiration is more sensitive to vpd in urban environments riikonen et al 2016 these differences are not only associated with the difference in external environmental conditions but also with tree biological characteristics pataki et al 2011 litvak et al 2012 when drought occurs some tree species can prevent excessive water loss and maintain a stable leaf water potential by significantly reducing transpiration tuzet et al 2003 fisher et al 2006 under high vapor pressure deficit vpd conditions trees can exhibit a decrease in water consumption cunningham 2004 whitley et al 2013 conversely there are tree species that maintain high transpiration even under high vpd and solar radiation conditions zhu et al 2015 song et al 2020 in addition urban environments may alter the physiological ecological response processes of trees compared to natural environments thomsen et al 2020 leading to great uncertainty and complexity in water use by urban trees in arid or semiarid areas in semiarid urban areas trees may suffer from more soil water limitation and higher evapotranspiration demand than their counterparts in natural environments asawa et al 2017 chen et al 2022a kendal et al 2018 suggested that changes in the structural composition of urban tree populations driven by environmental changes will exceed those predicted for trees in natural environments in addition in forest ecosystems evaporative responses to climate change are partly related to tree species composition peters et al 2010 in recent years compound extreme events such as drought and high temperature have been increasing globally masson delmotte et al 2021 the frequency of extreme heat events is also increasing in urban environments livesley et al 2016 these extreme heat events directly and severely affect tree health allen et al 2010 anderegg et al 2013 under the context of climate change the effectiveness of the water use strategy becomes important for tree survival mcdowell et al 2008 especially in the dryland area it is necessary and needed to understand how the transpiration of different types of urban tree species responds to environmental changes tree transpiration and its adaptation to water availability are also closely related to species specific physiological processes trees can respond to environmental conditions by regulating their hydraulic systems and leaf stomata ayutthaya et al 2011 pangle et al 2015 matheny et al 2017 previous studies have found that urban tree transpiration is strongly controlled by leaf stomatal regulation chen et al 2011 chen et al 2022b and the strong stomatal regulation and its positive response to hydraulic conductance can improve the adaptability of trees to droughts sperry 2000 2016 however some tree species still maintain stomatal opening under soil water stress zhu et al 2015 konings and gentine 2017 but this stomatal behavior increases the risk of hydraulic cavitation novick et al 2019 moreover the effects of leaf stomata on plant transpiration may change under different water conditions gu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 hence in order to better formulate scientific water management policies under the background of climate change it is urgent to clarify the possible species specific biological regulations of water use for urban trees as native and widely used coniferous species for afforestation in semiarid areas of north china zhang et al 2012 bao 2015 sun and liu 2015 pinus tabulaeformis pinus sylvestris and picea meyeri with the cold and drought resistant nature are also widely used in cities of dryland regions for urban parks roadside greening and residential area greening wen et al 2011 chen et al 2015 chen et al 2022a most studies on the water use relationships of these plantations are conducted in non urban environments while the differences in transpiration variations and their biophysical regulations in semiarid urban environments are not fully understood therefore we set the objective to compare and determine the water use relationships of tree species in water controlled dryland cities e g annual precipitation below 400 mm per year the objectives of this study are to 1 identify the differences in stand transpiration among tree species in a semiarid urban environment 2 elucidate species specific biophysical regulation of stand transpiration and 3 quantify and understand the proportion of stand transpiration in precipitation for different plantations during growing seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 site and stand description the study site is

of plant growth li et al 2017 three pure coniferous plantation forests including p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri were selected to conduct the study during the growing season from may to

capacity determined in the laboratory by taking soil samples and vwc w is the soil moisture at a wilting point estimated by the soil moisture when soil water potential is approximately 1500 kpa thomsen et al 2020 soil water stress can be identified based on the relationship between the ratio of actual stand transpiration to reference evapotranspiration and rew chen et al 2014 in previous studies stand transpiration was more impacted by soil moisture when rew 0 4 granier 1987 chen et al 2022a thus soil water availability can be classified into two categories with no soil water stress

differences in environmental variables during the growing season repeated measures anova was performed to examine the differences in stand transpiration and canopy conductance under different soil

similar to e c the g c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris was relatively stable throughout the growing season of 2017 fig 6 a in 2018 and 2019 the g c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris in may and june was lower than in july august and september and increased gradually from june to august but the g c of p meyeri remained relatively stable over time fig 6 vpd showed a large variation at the diurnal timescale and the g c of p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri peaked at 10 00 11 00 and 12 30 respectively fig 6d the g c of three plantations was negatively correlated to vpd r 2 0 93 p

for p tabulaeformis 0 50 for p sylvestris and 0 49 for p meyeri fig 7d the slope of p tabulaeformis was similar to 0 6 whereas the slopes of p sylvestris and p meyeri were significantly lower p 0 01 than 0 6 3 5 the ratios of e c to p and et 0 throughout the growing season of 2017 2019 the e c p for p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri was 0 41 0 39 and 0 15 respectively and the e c et 0 for p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri was 0 48 0 41 and 0 17 respectively table 2 on the monthly scale the e c p of three plantations was maintained at relatively high levels in may and june in particular the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris exceeded the p in may with the e c p of 1 25 for p tabulaeformis and 1 28 for p sylvestris fig 8 a however the e c et 0 of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were relatively low in may and june and they reached the maximum value of 0 80 and 0 63 in august fig 8b in contrast the e c et 0 of p meyeri remained at a relatively stable level and reached the maximum value of 0 19 in september fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 seasonality of e c in different plantations the e c of three urban plantations varied greatly in magnitude and seasonality during three consecutive growing seasons fig 3p r because of less precipitation and relatively constant vwc fig 3m the variation range of e c in p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations was relatively small throughout the growing season of 2017 fig 3p however due to the low precipitation and vwc in may and june in 2018 and 2019 fig 3n and o the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris was lower than in other months fig 3q and r this was attributed to the fact that trees prevent excessive water loss by reducing transpiration during droughts jiao et al 2016 dang et al 2021 but soil and atmospheric droughts will also increase the degree of xylem embolism and reduce the gas exchange rate savi et al 2015 compared with our study during the growing season p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were found to maintain more stable water use in non urban areas wu et al 2018 song et al 2022 this may be related to impervious surfaces and a high degree of soil compaction in urban environments song et al 2015 suggested the transpiration rate water use efficiency and co2 use efficiency of trees with totally and partly impervious surface were 20 40 less than those on the grass land thus urban trees may be more susceptible to soil water limitations than trees in non urban areas from june to august the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased gradually with increasing precipitation and soil moisture fig 3p r and this water supplement also can reduce xylem cavitation and promote tree growth nitschke et al 2017 however low soil moisture did not lead to a decrease in e c of p meyeri and the e c in may and june were higher than in other months fig 3p r this difference may be attributed to the less water use of p meyeri compared with p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris although p meyeri belongs to the shallow rooted tree species the water absorbed by root systems may satisfy its transpiration in relatively dry periods matheny et al 2017 consequently relatively low vwc did not inhibit p meyeri transpiration in may and june on the contrary the higher vpd r s and et 0 in may can promote tree transpiration without water limitation schmidt walter et al 2014 causing the e c of p meyeri in may to be significantly higher than in other months fig 3 in july and august although the precipitation and vwc increased the e c of p meyeri did not increase due to the significant decrease in vpd r s and et 0 in september although soil moisture was higher than in may and june the decreases of vpd r s and et 0 weakened the e c of three plantations 4 2 differences in environmental controls on e c between species the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris decreased significantly when soil water availability was reduced whereas p meyeri with the low e c was weakly affected by soil moisture fig 4 the difference in transpiration of tree species was related to species specific water use and its sensitivity to soil drought bovard et al 2005 wang et al 2019b in addition to the relatively high evaporation demand in urban environments ballinas and barradas 2016 broad impervious surfaces may intensify the limitation of water deficit on transpiration song et al 2015 p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations may be more susceptible to soil water deficit and tree xylem cavitation in urban environments savi et al 2015 despite p tabulaeformis having strong drought adaptations and deep roots liang et al 2003 this was demonstrated in a previous study where moser reischl et al 2018 found that trees less affected by abiotic and biotic stresses in rural environments grew better than trees situated in the city center under drought conditions the decline in water use of urban trees also can be beneficial for tree survival espadafor et al 2017 additionally soil moisture and meteorological conditions had interactive effects on forest transpiration fig 5 under relatively sufficient soil moisture conditions vpd was the main driver of e c in three plantations the result was similar to the study in humid boreal regions vpd and r s were the major drivers of tree transpiration under high soil moisture conditions oogathoo et al 2020 t a also could significantly impact the e c of p sylvestris fig 5b the higher vpd and t a in urban environments zhou et al 2014 can promote tree water use when soil water was not limited mccarthy and pataki 2010 as soil water stress progressed the effects of r s and vwc on the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased due to soil water stress fig 5a and b however p meyeri water use was not impacted by vwc and it was positively correlated with vpd throughout the study period fig 5c thus p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris water use were more restricted by water limitation than p meyeri moreover the e c of p tabulaeformis was significantly inhibited by vpd fig 5a which was related to the stomatal closure in response to increasing evaporative demand brito et al 2014 the reason is that soil moisture has more impacts on e c for plantations in urban conditions for example song et al 2022 found the e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were still mainly controlled by r s and vpd under stressed conditions in non urban environments by comparison of the differences between species the leaf stomata of p tabulaeformis was more sensitive to environments than p sylvestris and p meyeri fig 7 in addition given the significant effect of vwc on the e c of p sylvestris throughout the study period p sylvestris may be more vulnerable to water shortage than p tabulaeformis and p meyeri the drought vulnerability of p sylvestris was also found in non urban environments and p sylvestris may suffer obvious dieback when extreme drought occurred song et al 2022 due to the limited forest stand comparison the results may subject to uncertainties in environmental conditions stand heterogeneity sample tree selection and sapwood area estimation ewers et al 2000 hentschel et al 2013 also data bias can lead to uncertainty in model calculations and statistical analyses therefore future studies need to further expand stand and tree samples to reduce errors in the observed data 4 3 species differences in g c and biological controls previous studies have suggested stomatal regulations varied among tree species owing to the differences in environmental conditions and tree species characteristics litvak et al 2012 grossiord et al 2020 in contrast the hydraulic architectures composed of tracheids in conifer species are more resistant to cavitation than angiosperms and their hydraulic conductivity is lower choat et al 2012 similarly we found that the g c and e c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were vulnerable to soil drought figs 3 and 6 during soil droughts i e may and june the tight stomatal regulation on transpiration can help conifer trees to maintain a constant water potential gradient and hydraulic safety mcdowell et al 2008 chen et al 2022b as precipitation and soil moisture increased from july to september fig 3m o the g c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased significantly leading to more water use figs 3 and 6 p meyeri stands had lower water consumption and stomatal sensitivity than p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris fig 7 thus could maintain relatively stable g c over time considerable evidence indicates that plant stomatal activities are mainly impacted by vpd tang et al 2006 brito et al 2015 grossiord et al 2020 although soil moisture can alter g c responses to vpd bovard et al 2005 the effect of vpd on g c has been found to be greater than soil moisture globally flo et al 2022 sopharat et al 2015 also found that the impact of atmospheric drought on tree transpiration appeared to be more important than soil drought under soil water stressed conditions the stomatal openness of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris was more inhibited by vpd and g c and its sensitivity to vpd declined significantly with increasing vpd due to stomatal closure thus reducing tree water loss conversely the sensitivity of g c to vpd for p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased obviously with increasing soil water availability fig 7a and b this was because the trees enhanced their stomatal regulation of transpiration in response to increasing evaporative demand franks et al 2007 schmidt walter et al 2014 in contrast the g c of p meyeri was not sensitive to vpd fig 7c the same phenomenon was also found at half hour timescales as vpd increased the g c of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris reached the maximum earlier than p meyeri fig 6d moreover the higher stomatal sensitivity of p tabulaeformis was confirmed in this study fig 7d and the stomatal closure caused by high vpd led to the negative relationship between e c and vpd for p tabulaeformis when soil water stress occurred fig 5a in summary p tabulaeformis can avoid excessive water loss through stronger stomatal regulation in comparison to p sylvestris and p meyeri during soil and atmosphere droughts strong stomatal regulations can help trees control water use to avoid xylem embolism caused by excessive dehydration hartmann 2011 martin stpaul et al 2017 however p sylvestris water use was more impacted by soil moisture than p tabulaeformis and p meyeri and it may easily suffer from tree dieback song et al 2022 due to low water consumption and stable g c p meyeri can maintain a stable water status and be at a lower risk of xylem hydraulic failure 4 4 implications and limitations urban trees consume a large amount of groundwater or soil water stored in a clay layer to sustain transpiration marchionni et al 2019 similarly p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations need soil water stored from the previous year to meet transpiration demand table 2 particularly in relatively dry may the higher atmospheric evaporation demand promoted tree water loss than in other months fig 8 from june to september as soil moisture increased the e c and its ratio to et 0 of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased dramatically fig 8b based on this p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations could provide a better cooling effect by high transpiration than p meyeri in urban environments however climate change has led to varying degrees of variability in regional temperature and precipitation grossiord et al 2016 choat et al 2018 in semiarid areas frequent drought and high temperature events may have a great impact on the water use of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris plantations although p tabulaeformis can reduce transpiration by strong stomatal control the short term droughts in the early stage of the growing season can aggravate water competition between individual trees hinder tree growth and even profoundly influence forest ecosystems mackay et al 2012 jiao et al 2016 especially in may and june due to relatively low precipitation and dry soil conditions irrigation may be necessary for the fast growing p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris tree planting and maintenance have been increasingly used as one of the most effective nature based solutions nbs to mitigate the urban heat island and manage the urban stormwater under the global warming hobbie et al 2020 cortinovis et al 2022 thom et al 2022 therefore it is of critical importance to understand the water use and its biophysical governing mechanism of different tree species in cities across different geographical zones for managing the tradeoffs of multiple ecosystem services provided by urban trees and forests rana et al 2020 rötzer et al 2021 chen et al 2022a however our study focused on the water relation of only three widely planted coniferous species in a semiarid city in northern china and could not provide a whole picture of tree transpiration for the whole city and the cities across different climate zones transpiration studies of more tree species in more cities located in the different climate zone should be conducted in the future for comprehensively understanding the regulatory mechanisms of tree transpiration and for guiding tree species selection toward sustainable urban management objectives under the global climate change 5 conclusions this study revealed the seasonal variations and biophysical controls of stand transpiration in three widely used coniferous afforestation species in semiarid areas of northern china p tabulaeformis p sylvestris and p meyeri due to little precipitation and low soil moisture in may and june p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris maintained low stand transpiration as soil moisture increased the stand transpiration of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris increased significantly in contrast the stand transpiration of p meyeri was relatively stable and even maintained at a higher level in may than in other months when soil water was sufficient vpd and solar radiation were major influencing factors of stand transpiration for p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris additionally air temperature and soil moisture can promote p sylvestris transpiration p meyeri transpiration was positively correlated to vpd and soil moisture under soil water stressed conditions the stand transpiration of p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris were significantly reduced and the effects of soil moisture were increased in contrast p tabulaeformis showed stronger stomatal regulation than p sylvestris and p meyeri and high vpd inhibited stomatal openness to reduce water loss during droughts whereas p sylvestris water use was more vulnerable to soil water shortage consequently during droughts with high atmospheric evaporation demand and low soil moisture e g may and june p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris consumed more soil water than p meyeri to reduce the drought stress on the forest ecosystem and provide better cooling effects in urban environments through transpiration p tabulaeformis and p sylvestris may need irrigation at the beginning of the growing season however a complete water balance study that accounts for all the water flux canopy interception and soil evaporation is needed to fully evaluate the water demands of these three key species in the study region
