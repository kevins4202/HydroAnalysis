15850,chlorine dioxide clo2 applications to drinking water are limited by the formation of chlorite clo2 which is regulated in many countries however when clo2 is used as a pre oxidant clo2 can be oxidized by chlorine during subsequent disinfection in this study a kinetic model for the reaction of chlorine with clo2 was developed to predict the fate of clo2 during chlorine disinfection the reaction of clo2 with chlorine was found to be highly ph dependent with formation of clo3 and clo2 in ultrapure water in presence of dissolved organic matter dom 60 70 of the clo2 was transformed to clo3 during chlorination while the in situ regenerated clo2 was quickly consumed by reaction with dom the remaining 30 40 of the clo2 first reacted to clo2 which then formed chlorine from the dom clo2 reaction since only part of the clo2 was transformed to clo3 the sum of the molar concentrations of oxychlorine species clo2 clo3 decreased during chlorination by kinetic modelling the clo2 concentration after 24 h of chlorination was accurately predicted in synthetic waters but was largely overestimated in natural waters possibly due to a clo2 decay enhanced by high concentrations of chloride and in situ formed bromine from bromide understanding the chlorine clo2 reaction mechanism and the corresponding kinetics allows to potentially apply higher clo2 doses during the pre oxidation step thus improving disinfection byproduct mitigation while keeping clo2 and if required clo3 below the regulatory limits in addition clo2 was demonstrated to efficiently degrade haloacetonitrile precursors either when used as pre oxidant or when regenerated in situ during chlorination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine dioxide chlorite chlorate disinfection byproducts kinetic modelling 1 introduction disinfection byproducts dbps are formed from the reactions of dissolved organic matter dom with chemical oxidants such as free available chlorine fac during disinfection processes dbps such as trihalomethanes thms or haloacetic acids have raised public health concerns due to their potential health effects leading to drinking water regulations richardson et al 2007 sedlak and von gunten 2011 in the 1980s clo2 was widely used as an alternative disinfectant to fac since it produces low concentrations of regulated organic halogenated dbps aieta and berg 1986 rougé et al 2018 however chlorite clo2 formed as a byproduct was found to induce oxidative stress ali and mahmood 2017 bercz et al 1982 resulting in a world health organization who guideline value of 0 7 mg l 1 which drastically reduced the options for the application of clo2 awwa 2021 who 2017 this guideline value is currently applied by the european union eu 2020 while the us enforces a higher drinking water standard of 1 mg l 1 usepa 2006 with clo2 yields typically around 70 korn et al 2002 rougé et al 2018 the maximum clo2 dose that can be applied during disinfection is 1 0 1 4 mg l 1 which might not be sufficient for efficient pathogen inactivation in waters containing reactive dom leading to a rapid consumption of clo2 black and veatch 2010 nevertheless clo2 can be used as a pre oxidant or primary disinfectant and efficiently inhibit the formation of highly toxic dbps such as halonitromethanes or haloacetonitriles hans by selectively oxidizing some reactive dom moieties prior to disinfection with fac holden 2017 rougé et al 2020b yang et al 2013 to cope with the drinking water standards an additional treatment step with ferrous iron or activated carbon can be added between the clo2 pre oxidation and the chlorination to remove clo2 holden 2017 sorlini and collivignarelli 2005a 2005b otherwise clo2 will be oxidized by fac forming mostly chlorate clo3 singer and o neil 1987 in contrast to clo2 clo3 is inducing little oxidative stress ali et al 2017 bercz et al 1982 but has shown evidences of carcinogenicity although experimental evidences are scarce and controversial richardson et al 2007 clo3 is currently regulated at 0 7 mg l 1 in the eu european union 2020 in agreement with the who guidelines 2017 but not in us usepa 2006 in this context it is important to better understand treatment processes involving clo2 and fac and the corresponding formation of oxychlorine compounds clo2 and clo3 the kinetics and mechanism of the reaction between clo2 and fac have been studied and were found to be complex the products of this reaction are clo2 clo3 and chloride cl but the stoichiometry kinetics and yields vary widely with ph buffering conditions and initial reactant concentrations gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 jia et al 2000 peintler et al 1990 tang and gordon 1984 peintler and nagipál 1990 proposed a model labelled as model 1 in table 1 which involves the formation of an intermediate compound cl2o2 eqs 1 and 2 table 1 leading to the formation of either clo2 or clo3 eqs 4 and 5 table 1 an additional reaction is leading directly to the formation of clo3 to account for the mixed order reaction in hocl obtained with excess hocl and or at higher ph eq 3 table 1 jia et al 2000 model 2 table 1 revisited the hocl clo2 reaction and investigated the impact of phosphate and acetate on the initial reaction step eq 6b table 1 acetate is not shown and on the base assisted cl2o2 hydrolysis eq 8b table 1 acetate is not shown furthermore jia et al 2000 considered that the hocl reaction order was 1 while peintler and nagipál 1990 previously proposed eq 3 to explain the variations in hocl reaction order and clo2 yields this difference is likely due to the large clo2 excesses clo2 hocl 10 used by jia et al 2000 while eq 3 proposed by peintler and nagipál 1990 is mostly relevant when hocl is in excess gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 focused solely on the formation of clo3 and proposed a simplified model eq 9 table 1 the rate constant shown in table 1 was calculated based on clo3 formation kinetic data at ph 8 8 and provided a satisfactory fit to clo3 formation in the ph range 6 4 10 all the studies reported above used high concentrations of reactants at mm levels or higher and high ionic strength 0 5 1 m which are not relevant for drinking water treatment the depletion of clo2 during fac disinfection was previously studied under more realistic water treatment conditions 1 1 5 0 mg l 1 oxidant demand free solution ph 7 and was shown to produce limited clo2 and equimolar concentrations of clo3 101 19 singer and o neil 1987 however to the best of our knowledge apart from the aforementioned study no data is available on the kinetics and the product yields of the fac clo2 reaction under realistic conditions understanding the fac clo2 reaction during water treatment is important to efficiently control the formation and abatement of the oxychlorine species clo2 clo3 and assess the impact of clo2 potentially formed in situ ultimately clo2 pre oxidation can be optimized allowing additional abatement of reactive dom moieties and a lower formation of regulated dbps while keeping clo2 and clo3 if regulated below the regulatory limits the aim of this study was to model the fac clo2 reaction under controlled conditions relevant to drinking water treatment the kinetic of the fac clo2 reaction was investigated in a time frame of 24 h in the ph range 6 6 8 1 and tested with models from the literature gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 jia et al 2000 peintler et al 1990 furthermore an improved kinetic model was developed based on experimental data and applied to predict clo2 abatement clo2 and clo3 formation in presence or absence of dom finally a simple treatment scenario clo2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination was tested in real waters and the evolution of oxychlorine species was compared to the predictions using the adjusted model relevant dbps were monitored adsordable organic halogens hans and thms and the trade off between abatement of organic dbps and formation of oxychlorine species was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents sodium chlorite 80 and sodium hypochlorite 10 15 solution were purchased from sigma aldrich

were based on preliminary experiments to ensure a residual concentration 0 5 mgcl2 l 1 after 24 h in all the experiments experiments were conducted at room temperature 23 1 c and the ionic strength ranged from 16 to 29 mm due to the fixed phosphate concentration 10 mm and varying phs 2 4 dbp formation in real and synthetic waters three groundwaters labelled a b and c were sampled in western australia and filtered through 0 45 µm polyethersulfone merck millipore their water quality parameters measured after filtration are provided in table 2 clo2 was spiked into 200 ml of each groundwater at doses in the range of 1 2 mg l 1 the samples were kept without headspace in the dark until complete depletion of clo2 after 3 h an aliquot 0 2 ml was withdrawn for clo2 and clo3 analysis and the rest was chlorinated for 24 h samples without clo2 pre oxidation were also chlorinated and the doses of fac 3 7 8 8 mgcl2 l 1 were set to target a residual concentration of 0 5 1 0 mgcl2 l 1 after 24

experiments ph 6 6 was chosen to enhance the fac clo2 reaction and clo2 formation 2 5 analytical methods fac and clo2 were measured by abts based methods pinkernell et al 2000 clo2 and clo3 by ion chromatography usepa 2002 thms and hans by headspace gc ms allard et al 2012 kristiana et al 2012 and aox by adsorption followed by combustion and ion chromatography langsa et al 2017 details of the analytical methods are provided in text s1 supporting information si 2 6 modelling simulations and rate constant fittings were performed with the program kintecus ianni 2018 details are provided in text s2 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 the fac clo2 reaction in ultrapure water the three existing models described above for the fac clo2 system labelled as model 1 peintler et al 1990 model 2 jia et al 2000 and model 3 gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 see table 1 were tested against experimental data 3 1 1 comparison between experimental data and predictions with the existing models the fac clo2 reaction was monitored during 24 h in buffered ultrapure water at different ph values ranging from 6 6 to 8 1 and with concentrations relevant to a disinfection step in drinking water treatment i e 65 µm of fac 4 6 mgcl2 l 1 and 24 µm of clo2 1 6 mg l 1 circles fig 1 the concentration of clo2 was selected to be above the guideline provided by who 0 7 mg l 1 and corresponds to a clo2 dosage of about 2 mg l 1 29 7 µm cl was also present in solution originating from the sodium hypochlorite stock solution cl 1 9 x fac as shown in fig 1 the experimental clo2 abatement decreased significantly with increasing ph clo2 was abated by 54 32 and 10 after 24 h at ph 6 6 7 1 and 7 7 respectively the clo2 abatement was negligible at ph 7 7 the slower reaction with increasing ph is well established and is notably attributed to the decreasing fraction of hocl gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 jia et al 2000 peintler et al 1990 the experimental clo2 data were compared to the three models by kinetic simulations eqs 1 9 in table 1 lines in fig 1 the clo2 decrease was overestimated by models 1 and 3 and underestimated by model 2 fig 1 as previously mentioned all models were determined using mm levels or higher of fac and or chlorite and at high ionic strength 0 5 1 m which may explain the discrepancy with our experimental data in addition experimental variations between the studies may be the cause of the variations between the models for example model 2 was determined using only large excess of clo2 which may have introduced a bias compared to model 1 which was determined using fac or clo2 excess another notable difference was the buffering conditions the rate constants of models 1 and 3 were determined in acetate 0 5 m and phosphate buffer 0 1 m respectively gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 peintler et al 1990 while the experiments in this study were performed in 10 mm phosphate model 2 jia et al 2000 suggested that the acid assisted hocl clo2 reaction is catalyzed by acetic acid or h2po4 which may explain the faster clo2 decrease predicted by models 1 and 3 to test this hypothesis and since phosphate was used in the experiments of this study the relevance of the phosphate assisted clo2 oxidation in model 2 was evaluated eqs 6b and 8b table 1 model 2 predicted a 24 h clo2 abatement 2 5 times higher when increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 20 mm which was not observed experimentally fig s4 si these results do not exclude a possible impact of phosphate when using higher concentrations up to 0 2 m for model 2 and 0 1 m for model 3 however it is not significant under the experimental conditions used in this study 3 1 2 development of a kinetic model in a first step rate constants related to the reaction of fac with clo2 were fitted to the clo2 experimental data at ph 6 6 using kintecus the following rate constants were adjusted k 1 for model 1 k 6a or k 6b for model 2 and k 9 for model 3 see table 1 in model 1 k 2 and k 3 did not have a significant impact on the model output and therefore were not modified see fig s2 si the fitted rate constants were then applied to simulate clo2 decrease at ph 7 1 7 7 and 8 1 the modified rate constants and the resulting comparison with experimental data are presented in table s2 and fig s3 si a good fit was obtained for models 1 and 2 fig s3a c si while model 3 overestimated the impact of increasing the ph fig s3d si therefore model 3 was not further considered in this study in addition as phosphate impact on clo2 decay was found to be negligible under the conditions in this study fig s4 si model 2 was not further considered and model 1 eqs 1 5 in table 1 was selected for the remainder of this study to further improve the kinetic model k 3 and k 5 were fitted using both clo2 decrease and clo3 formation similar to the first step k 1 was fitted to the experimental data for clo2 at ph 6 6 using kintecus while k 3 and k 5 were initially fixed at values ranging from 0 to 2 5 103 m 2 s 1 and from 0 to 2 0 105 s 1 respectively residual sum of squares between experimental and modelled data at all phs were then calculated and applied to determine the optimal rate constants k 3 1 3 103 m 2 s 1 k 5 1 0 105 s 1 and k 1 2 9 105 m 2 s 1 see details in text s3 table s3 and fig s5 si the optimized rate constants are shown in table 1 eqs 1 5 and the simulated clo2 fac clo3 and clo2 are compared to the experimental data in fig 2 a d a good fit to the experimental data was obtained at all ph except 6 6 at which a significantly lower concentration of clo2 was measured compared to the model prediction the molar concentration balance of oxychlorine species was not complete at this ph about 10 of the clo2 was not recovered as clo3 or clo2 at ph 6 6 this deviation can be explained by the high reactivity of clo2 with potential impurities which led to significant variations between experimental replicates large error bars for clo2 in fig 2d the reduction of clo2 by impurities should not affect the rest of the model clo3 is unlikely to be a significant product of clo2 reduction and the formation of clo2 or fac from clo2 degradation would be negligible compared to their higher concentrations gan et al 2019 the impact of eq 2 which involves cl2 was negligible under our experimental conditions fig s2 si cl2 is relevant only at low ph and when significant concentrations of cl are present see eqs s8 and s9 in table s1 si in pure and synthetic waters the cl concentration was about 0 13 mm which led to a negligible impact of k 2 on the existing model at ph 6 6 fig s2 si however as real waters may contain higher cl concentrations eq 2 was kept in the model 3 2 dom fac clo2 reaction in synthetic water 3 2 1 dom fac reaction under realistic conditions it is expected that the presence of dom significantly impacts the fac clo2 reaction by consuming part of the fac to test this hypothesis the fac decrease was investigated in presence of 3 mgc l 1 umrnom in absence of clo2 fig 2f purple squares and modeled using fast domfast and slow domslow reacting fractions of dom similarly to previous studies eqs 10 and 11 table 1 qualls and johnson 1983 zhai et al 2014 the aromatic content of fulvic acids has been shown to be correlated to the chlorine consumption reckhow et al 1990 with a stoichiometry between fac consumption and aromatic carbon concentration caromatic of 1 1 1 4 fac per caromatic after 72 h this stoichiometry is close to the 1 1 stoichiometry used in eqs 10 and 11 table 1 the molar sum of the fast and slow reacting fractions was therefore based on the caromatic of umrnom calculated from its 13c nmr carbon distribution 15 8 µm mgc 1 of aromatic carbon ihss thus 3 mgc l 1 of umrnom corresponds to 47 µm of aromatic carbons the rate law for fac consumption was expressed by 12b d fac dt k domfast fac do m fast k domslow fac do m slow the fitting process of domfast and domslow fractions and rate constants eqs 10 and 11 is illustrated in fig s6 si and was performed as follows domfast was initially defined as the fac fraction reacting within the first 2 h about 21 µm 44 of the aromatic carbon for umrnom the rate constant for the fac domfast reaction k domfast was fitted with kintecus to the decay of fac between 0 and 2 h 17 m 1 s 1 fig s6a si considering that the k domslow fac domslow term was negligible the remaining aromatic carbon accounted for domslow about 26 µm 56 of the aromatic carbon for umrdom and the rate constant for the fac domslow reaction k domslow 0 42 m 1 s 1 fig s6b si was adjusted to fit the fac decrease between 2 and 24 h in this phase the fraction of domfast was already depleted fig s6a si and the k domfast fac domfast term was therefore 0 the fitted k domslow was then used to calculate how much fac was consumed by domslow within the first 2 h 4 µm and the percentage of domslow and domfast fractions was re adjusted accordingly fig s6c si adjusted fractions of domfast and domslow determined by this procedure were 36 17 µm and 64 30 µm respectively and the fit to the experimental data is shown by the purple line in fig 2f since the fac umrnom reaction was observed to be independent of ph 6 6 8 1 fig s7 si eqs 10 and 11 were formulated independently to the hocl ocl speciation an insignificant ph effect has already been observed on the fac dom reaction and may be due to a balance between hocl ocl speciation and dom moieties speciation e g phenolic phenolate moieties speciation westerhoff et al 2004 the reaction of fac with nlfa was simulated using the same fractions and rate constants for domfast and domslow and a caromatic of 25 8 µm mgc 1 estimated from the 13c nmr carbon distribution ihss the model was in agreement with the experimental fac consumption by 3 mgc l 1 of nlfa after 24 h at ph 6 6 and 7 1 fig s7 si 3 2 2 impact of dom on kinetics of the fac clo2 reaction the fac clo2 reaction was investigated with and without 3 mgc l 1 of umrnom at ph 6 6 brown diamonds and orange circles respectively in fig 2e h in presence of dom clo2 decreased from 23 7 µm to 17 5 µm after 24 h brown diamonds fig 2e while it decreased to 11 0 µm in absence of dom orange circles fig 2e this was due to the fast consumption of fac by dom purple squares fig 2f reducing the fac exposure thus inhibiting clo2 oxidation consequently clo3 formation was mitigated from 7 9 µm absence of dom orange circles to 4 0 µm presence of dom brown diamonds after 24 h fig 2g in presence of dom clo2 was not detected as a result of its fast reaction with activated aromatic compounds such as phenols which are major constituents of dom fig 2h hoigné and bader 1994 houska et al 2021 rougé et al 2020a the reaction between dom and clo2 was previously shown to produce clo2 and hocl the latter representing a maximum of 50 of the consumed clo2 based on its reaction mechanism with phenol rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 furthermore the reaction of dom with clo2 is much faster than with hocl which means that during chlorination sufficient clo2 reactive sites are still present in dom see below two equations were tested for the consumption of clo2 one leading solely to clo2 eq 13a and the second one leading to 50 hocl and 50 clo2 eq 13b since clo2 is gradually produced over the 24 h of our experiments without dom fig 2h the domslow fraction defined for the dom fac reaction was used in eqs 13a and 13b both equations assumed a first order reaction in clo2 and domslow and their rate constants were set at 103 m 1 s 1 which is sufficiently high to prevent clo2 accumulation the fitting is shown in fig s8 si 13a cl o 2 do m slow cl o 2 do m ox 13b cl o 2 do m slow 0 5 cl o 2 0 5 hocl do m ox the modelling of fac clo2 and clo3 was tested using either eqs 13a or 13b and the results are shown in fig 2e h red line for eq 13a and brown line for eq 13b using eq 13a or 13b gave negligible differences for fac and clo3 simulations fig 2f and 2g however eq 13b provided a better fit for clo2 brown line in fig 2e and was therefore selected for the model table 1 activated aromatic moieties such as phenols react with higher second order rate constants with clo2 compared to fac for the reaction with phenol the ratio of the second order rate constants k clo2 kfac 102 at ph 6 6 8 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 hoigné and bader 1994 it is therefore plausible that such moieties remain intact during chlorination and quickly react with the in situ formed clo2 releasing an equimolar amount of hocl and clo2 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 3 2 3 influence of ph dom type and concentration and fac dose on the fac clo2 reaction to validate the model the 24 h consumption of clo2 and fac as well as the formation of clo3 were measured under different experimental conditions different concentrations of umrnom 1 3 and 5 mgc l 1 and nlfa 3 mgc l 1 at ph 6 6 or 7 1 and fac doses of 40 or 65 µm the concentrations of clo2 fac and clo3 after 24 h were in good agreement with the predicted values fig 3 for clo2 and fig s9 si for fac and clo3 the predicted clo2 and clo3 concentrations were within 10 of the measured values except for low clo3 concentrations 2 µm which were close to the loq 1 3 µm in practice contact times are likely to be shorter than the 24 h applied in this study however as the model yielded a reasonable fit to the evolution of the concentrations over 24 h fig 2e h good agreement between predicted and experimental values are also expected for contact times 24 h it was observed that 59 62 of the clo2 was oxidized to clo3 for both the measured and modelled data fig s10 si these yields are consistent with the oxidation of clo2 to clo2 which is the competing reaction eq 4 and with a partial reaction of clo2 with dom that leads to hocl formation eq 13b rougé et al 2018 if all clo2 was reduced to clo2 eq 13a the clo3 yield from clo2 would be 100 which was not the case fig s10 si the model predicted that a higher ph and higher matrix reactivity higher domfast and domslow fractions inhibited clo2 abatement and clo3 formation model 4 in table 1 figs 3 and s9 3 3 treatment of real waters by clo2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination 3 3 1 clo2 formation and abatement clo2 doses 1 mg l 1 were applied to 3 groundwaters labelled water a b and c for characteristics see table 2 followed by 24 h chlorination clo2 pre oxidation led to 60 65 of clo2 and negligible concentrations of clo3 about 6 data not shown in waters a and b fig 4 a b in agreement to typical clo2 yields in natural waters korn et al 2002 in water c only 14 38 of the clo2 was transformed to clo2 fig 4c lower yields may be due to the reactions of clo2 with inorganic compounds such as fe ii and mn ii aieta and berg 1986 moore et al 2004 which were higher in water c than in waters a and b table 2 after clo2 pre oxidation the clo2 levels were above the who guideline 0 7 mg l 1 i e 0 76 0 95 mg l 1 for clo2 doses of 1 25 mg l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 in waters a and b fig 4a b black circles in water c the clo2 was above the guideline only for the highest clo2 dose of 2 mg l 1 0 75 mg l 1 clo2 black circles in fig 4c after chlorination clo2 levels decreased below the guideline value of 0 7 mg l 1 in all samples white circles fig 4a c concomitantly to the clo2 decrease clo3 was formed in all samples white stars fig 4 and accounted for about 70 of the oxidized clo2 fig s11 si consistent with the experiments in synthetic waters section 3 2 3 and fig s10 si clo3 is currently regulated in the eu at the same level than clo2 0 7 mg l 1 but not in the us the clo3 concentrations after chlorination were below the eu guideline in all samples except for the highest clo2 dose in water c fig 4c 3 3 2 modelling of clo2 abatement during chlorination 24 h clo2 residual concentrations were predicted using the adjusted model from this study table 1 model 4 as the aromatic carbon concentration was not available for real waters it was estimated using a published relationship between aromaticity and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm see text s4 and fig s12 si weishaar et al 2003 a reasonable agreement between simulated and experimental fac residual concentrations was obtained within 15 for water a and c and within 25 for water b text s4 si in comparison to the measured data the final clo2 concentrations were largely overestimated by the model white and orange circles respectively in fig 4a c suggesting that the fac clo2 reaction was significantly faster in all real waters compared to synthetic waters for a clo2 dose of 1 5 mg l 1 the model predicted a final clo2 concentration above the guideline value in waters a and b 0 74 0 80 mg l 1 orange circles in fig 4a b however the measured clo2 levels were significantly below the who guideline i e 0 37 0 38 mg l 1 white circles in fig 4a b consequently the clo3 concentrations were higher than predicted by the model white and orange stars in fig 4a c but were still below the who guideline 0 7 mg l 1 except for the highest clo2 dose in water c 0 80 mg l 1 fig 4c the levels of cl present in real waters were between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conditions used for the model development table 2 with such cl levels eq 2 becomes relevant and an underestimation of k2 could be partly responsible of the overestimated modelled clo2 residuals shown in fig 4 further investigation is needed to evaluate the accuracy of k 2 under the applied experimental conditions but practical limitations prevented such experiments in particular impurities present in cl notably bromide and metals may introduce a bias especially when adding high concentrations of cl bromide was also present in all the tested natural waters at relatively high concentrations 190 260 µg l 1 table 2 bromide exhibits a low reactivity toward clo2 10 2 m 1 s 1 and is not expected to affect clo2 pre oxidation hoigné and bader 1994 however bromide can rapidly be oxidized to free available bromine fab during chlorination kumar and margerum 1987 which can then react with both dom and clo2 criquet et al 2015 furman and margerum 1998 langsa et al 2017b the second order rate constants for reaction of clo2 with fab have been reported to be significantly higher than for fac k fab k fac 101 103 jia et al 2000 which was confirmed for the experimental conditions in this study see details in text s5 and fig s13 si however due to the large fraction of bromide incorporated in dom between 80 and 97 of the initial bromide was recovered as aobr after 24 h chlorination fig 5 a it is difficult to accurately model the contribution of bromide to the enhanced clo2 abatement in presence of dom text s5 si and further investigations were beyond the scope of this paper finally the involvement of carbonate commonly found in natural waters was excluded since no significant effect was found for carbonate concentrations up to 1 5 mm 18 mgc l 1 fig s14 si 3 3 3 impact of increasing clo2 pre oxidation dose on dbp mitigation a better kinetic and mechanistic understanding of the fac clo2 reaction enables the prediction of clo2 and clo3 concentrations and potentially the use of higher clo2 doses during pre oxidation treatment to mitigate organic dbp formation while ensuring that inorganic dbp regulations are met to investigate if optimizing clo2 pre oxidation is beneficial to the mitigation of other dbps such as aox thms and hans they were monitored in the three groundwaters after 24 h chlorination with and without clo2 pre oxidation fig 5 as expected the formation of all dbps increased with increasing doc concentration i e water a 3 mgc l 1 water b 4 2 mgc l 1 water c 6 8 mgc l 1 fig 5 a pre oxidation treatment with 1 mg l 1 of clo2 which ensures clo2 levels below who guideline decreased the aox by about 30 20 and 10 in waters a b and c respectively fig 5a the same clo2 dose of 1 mg l 1 decreased thm formation by about 10 in water a but not in waters b and c 2 fig 5b the han formation was reduced by about 70 70 and 50 in waters a b and c respectively fig 5c clo2 pre oxidation with 1 mg l 1 also increased the fac residual after 24 h by about 50 110 and 215 in waters a b and c respectively triangles in fig 5b which indicates that in practice the fac dose could be reduced potentially leading to lower dbp formation since clo2 is abated during chlorination clo2 doses beyond 1 mg l 1 could be used while maintaining clo2 residuals well below the who guidelines increasing the clo2 dose in waters a and b to 1 5 mg l 1 increased both clo2 and clo3 concentrations by 0 15 0 18 mg l 1 after chlorination fig 4 concomitantly the highest clo2 dose 1 5 mg l 1 allowed a significant additional thm abatement between 21 and 29 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5b and han abatement between 15 and 27 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5c in both waters a and b as well as some minor improvements for aox abatement in water a ca 10 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5a in comparison increasing clo2 dose from 1 to 2 mg l 1 in water c did not significantly impact thms or aox 5 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5a b but was highly beneficial for han abatement ca 60 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5c in water c although clo2 residuals remained low 0 1 mg l 1 clo3 increased from 0 2 to 0 8 mg l 1 which is above the who guideline when increasing the clo2 dose from 1 to 2 mg l 1 fig 4c 3 3 4 practical implications abating clo2 during post chlorination allows to significantly increase the clo2 pre oxidation dose and further mitigate organic dbp formation while keeping clo2 below regulatory limits it has to be noted that the oxidation of clo2 by fac leads to the formation of clo3 which is also regulated in eu european union 2020 and needs to be taken into account fig 6 shows a comparative radar chart for inorganic dbp formation clo2 clo3 and organic dbp abatement aox thms hans in water a analogous charts for waters b and c are shown in fig s15 si increasing the clo2 pre oxidation dose gradually leads to a shift from organic to inorganic dbps fig 6 however the water matrix effects dom composition bromide ph etc largely impact the shift in dbp speciation for example aox formation was not affected by an increase in clo2 dose 1 mg l 1 in water b and thm formation was not affected by clo2 in water c fig s15 si conversely thm and han formations were particularly affected by increasing clo2 doses in water b only for the highest clo2 dose and c respectively fig s15 si raising the clo2 dose increased clo2 and clo3 formation in water b but only clo3 formation in water c up to levels 0 80 mg l 1 that can be problematic in countries where clo3 is regulated e g 0 7 mg l 1 in eu 2020 nevertheless in countries where clo3 is not regulated such as the us clo2 doses could in theory be further increased since 0 4 mg l 1 of clo2 was formed in all scenarios considering 24 h chlorination which is well below the us drinking water standard 1 mg l 1 usepa 2006 therefore the trade off between the formation of organic and inorganic dbps needs to be thoroughly assessed to comply with the different regulatory limits in different countries and the associated toxicity of the water current regulations for organic dbps are generally limited to thms and haas european union 2020 usepa 2006 which are not good surrogates for the overall dbp formation toxicity weighted concentrations of unregulated dbps such as haloacetaldehydes or hans largely outweigh thms and haas and the formation mitigation of regulated and unregulated dbps is not necessarily correlated chuang et al 2019 furst et al 2021 lau et al 2020 in absence of regulatory values the efficiency of a given treatment to control dbp formation is often evaluated as cumulated weighted toxicity using toxicity endpoints such as cytotoxicity or oxidative stress that can be quantitatively compared lau et al 2020 stalter et al 2020 however the contribution of clo2 and clo3 to these toxicity endpoints is currently unknown due to a lack of literature therefore there is a strong need for quantitative determination of clo2 and clo3 toxicities using bioassays comparable to those used for organic dbps to better evaluate the trade off between an increase in clo2 clo3 and a mitigation of organic dbps 3 3 5 role of in situ clo2 regeneration in dbps mitigation as discussed in section 3 2 2 the reaction between clo2 and fac produces clo2 in situ which further reacts with dom to evaluate if the in situ formed clo2 enhances the degradation of dbp precursors the formation of thms only trichloromethane tcm was formed in absence of bromide and hans only dichloroacetonitrile dcan was formed in absence of bromide was measured after 24 h chlorination of 3 mgc l 1 umrnom with and without 1 6 mg l 1 of clo2 and at ph 6 6 fig 7 tcm and dcan were chosen as they are known to be relatively unaffected and efficiently mitigated respectively by low clo2 doses rougé et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2013 the presence of clo2 had a negligible impact on fac exposure 43 versus 44 mm min with or without clo2 and on tcm formation 0 64 0 03 µm and 0 62 0 02 µm with and without clo2 respectively however dcan formation was strongly mitigated 33 0 2 nm and 61 1 nm with and without clo2 respectively fig 7 these results further support the regeneration of clo2 during the fac clo2 reaction and its role in the mitigation of dbp formation 4 conclusions in this study a kinetic model was developed to simulate the reaction between fac and clo2 and the ensuing formation of inorganic byproducts for varying fac doses contact times and water characteristics doc suva254 and ph the main outcomes based on experimental data and simulations were the model accurately predicted clo2 clo3 and fac concentrations in synthetic waters but largely underestimated clo2 oxidation in real waters chloride and bromide which were present at significant concentrations in the real water samples play a catalytic role in clo2 oxidation through the formation of cl2 and fab respectively their impact needs further investigation to improve clo2 and clo3 concentration predictions in real waters the byproducts clo3 and clo2 were formed at molar yields of 60 70 and 30 40 respectively clo2 was rapidly consumed by dom releasing fac the developed model provides a good foundation for more comprehensive models including the impact of bromide and other water constituent allowing to accurately predict the fate of clo2 and clo3 during chlorination of real waters predicting fac clo2 reaction will help to optimize clo2 pre oxidation this allows to apply higher doses to mitigate the formation of halo organic dbps such as hans and in some cases thms and aox while keeping the concentration of clo2 and clo3 below the current or future regulatory guidelines higher clo2 doses also significantly decrease the chlorine demand which will lead to a decrease in halogenated organic dbp formation there is a need for toxicological evaluation of clo2 clo3 using bioassays comparable to those used for other dbps to assess the trade off between oxychlorine compounds and organic dbps

15850,chlorine dioxide clo2 applications to drinking water are limited by the formation of chlorite clo2 which is regulated in many countries however when clo2 is used as a pre oxidant clo2 can be oxidized by chlorine during subsequent disinfection in this study a kinetic model for the reaction of chlorine with clo2 was developed to predict the fate of clo2 during chlorine disinfection the reaction of clo2 with chlorine was found to be highly ph dependent with formation of clo3 and clo2 in ultrapure water in presence of dissolved organic matter dom 60 70 of the clo2 was transformed to clo3 during chlorination while the in situ regenerated clo2 was quickly consumed by reaction with dom the remaining 30 40 of the clo2 first reacted to clo2 which then formed chlorine from the dom clo2 reaction since only part of the clo2 was transformed to clo3 the sum of the molar concentrations of oxychlorine species clo2 clo3 decreased during chlorination by kinetic modelling the clo2 concentration after 24 h of chlorination was accurately predicted in synthetic waters but was largely overestimated in natural waters possibly due to a clo2 decay enhanced by high concentrations of chloride and in situ formed bromine from bromide understanding the chlorine clo2 reaction mechanism and the corresponding kinetics allows to potentially apply higher clo2 doses during the pre oxidation step thus improving disinfection byproduct mitigation while keeping clo2 and if required clo3 below the regulatory limits in addition clo2 was demonstrated to efficiently degrade haloacetonitrile precursors either when used as pre oxidant or when regenerated in situ during chlorination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine dioxide chlorite chlorate disinfection byproducts kinetic modelling 1 introduction disinfection byproducts dbps are formed from the reactions of dissolved organic matter dom with chemical oxidants such as free available chlorine fac during disinfection processes dbps such as trihalomethanes thms or haloacetic acids have raised public health concerns due to their potential health effects leading to drinking water regulations richardson et al 2007 sedlak and von gunten 2011 in the 1980s clo2 was widely used as an alternative disinfectant to fac since it produces low concentrations of regulated organic halogenated dbps aieta and berg 1986 rougé et al 2018 however chlorite clo2 formed as a byproduct was found to induce oxidative stress ali and mahmood 2017 bercz et al 1982 resulting in a world health organization who guideline value of 0 7 mg l 1 which drastically reduced the options for the application of clo2 awwa 2021 who 2017 this guideline value is currently applied by the european union eu 2020 while the us enforces a higher drinking water standard of 1 mg l 1 usepa 2006 with clo2 yields typically around 70 korn et al 2002 rougé et al 2018 the maximum clo2 dose that can be applied during disinfection is 1 0 1 4 mg l 1 which might not be sufficient for efficient pathogen inactivation in waters containing reactive dom leading to a rapid consumption of clo2 black and veatch 2010 nevertheless clo2 can be used as a pre oxidant or primary disinfectant and efficiently inhibit the formation of highly toxic dbps such as halonitromethanes or haloacetonitriles hans by selectively oxidizing some reactive dom moieties prior to disinfection with fac holden 2017 rougé et al 2020b yang et al 2013 to cope with the drinking water standards an additional treatment step with ferrous iron or activated carbon can be added between the clo2 pre oxidation and the chlorination to remove clo2 holden 2017 sorlini and collivignarelli 2005a 2005b otherwise clo2 will be oxidized by fac forming mostly chlorate clo3 singer and o neil 1987 in contrast to clo2 clo3 is inducing little oxidative stress ali et al 2017 bercz et al 1982 but has shown evidences of carcinogenicity although experimental evidences are scarce and controversial richardson et al 2007 clo3 is currently regulated at 0 7 mg l 1 in the eu european union 2020 in agreement with the who guidelines 2017 but not in us usepa 2006 in this context it is important to better understand treatment processes involving clo2 and fac and the corresponding formation of oxychlorine compounds clo2 and clo3 the kinetics and mechanism of the reaction between clo2 and fac have been studied and were found to be complex the products of this reaction are clo2 clo3 and chloride cl but the stoichiometry kinetics and yields vary widely with ph buffering conditions and initial reactant concentrations gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 jia et al 2000 peintler et al 1990 tang and gordon 1984 peintler and nagipál 1990 proposed a model labelled as model 1 in table 1 which involves the formation of an intermediate compound cl2o2 eqs 1 and 2 table 1 leading to the formation of either clo2 or clo3 eqs 4 and 5 table 1 an additional reaction is leading directly to the formation of clo3 to account for the mixed order reaction in hocl obtained with excess hocl and or at higher ph eq 3 table 1 jia et al 2000 model 2 table 1 revisited the hocl clo2 reaction and investigated the impact of phosphate and acetate on the initial reaction step eq 6b table 1 acetate is not shown and on the base assisted cl2o2 hydrolysis eq 8b table 1 acetate is not shown furthermore jia et al 2000 considered that the hocl reaction order was 1 while peintler and nagipál 1990 previously proposed eq 3 to explain the variations in hocl reaction order and clo2 yields this difference is likely due to the large clo2 excesses clo2 hocl 10 used by jia et al 2000 while eq 3 proposed by peintler and nagipál 1990 is mostly relevant when hocl is in excess gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 focused solely on the formation of clo3 and proposed a simplified model eq 9 table 1 the rate constant shown in table 1 was calculated based on clo3 formation kinetic data at ph 8 8 and provided a satisfactory fit to clo3 formation in the ph range 6 4 10 all the studies reported above used high concentrations of reactants at mm levels or higher and high ionic strength 0 5 1 m which are not relevant for drinking water treatment the depletion of clo2 during fac disinfection was previously studied under more realistic water treatment conditions 1 1 5 0 mg l 1 oxidant demand free solution ph 7 and was shown to produce limited clo2 and equimolar concentrations of clo3 101 19 singer and o neil 1987 however to the best of our knowledge apart from the aforementioned study no data is available on the kinetics and the product yields of the fac clo2 reaction under realistic conditions understanding the fac clo2 reaction during water treatment is important to efficiently control the formation and abatement of the oxychlorine species clo2 clo3 and assess the impact of clo2 potentially formed in situ ultimately clo2 pre oxidation can be optimized allowing additional abatement of reactive dom moieties and a lower formation of regulated dbps while keeping clo2 and clo3 if regulated below the regulatory limits the aim of this study was to model the fac clo2 reaction under controlled conditions relevant to drinking water treatment the kinetic of the fac clo2 reaction was investigated in a time frame of 24 h in the ph range 6 6 8 1 and tested with models from the literature gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 jia et al 2000 peintler et al 1990 furthermore an improved kinetic model was developed based on experimental data and applied to predict clo2 abatement clo2 and clo3 formation in presence or absence of dom finally a simple treatment scenario clo2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination was tested in real waters and the evolution of oxychlorine species was compared to the predictions using the adjusted model relevant dbps were monitored adsordable organic halogens hans and thms and the trade off between abatement of organic dbps and formation of oxychlorine species was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents sodium chlorite 80 and sodium hypochlorite 10 15 solution were purchased from sigma aldrich

text s2 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 the fac clo2 reaction in ultrapure water the three existing models described above for the fac clo2 system labelled as model 1 peintler et al 1990 model 2 jia et al 2000 and model 3 gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 see table 1 were tested against experimental data 3 1 1 comparison between experimental data and predictions with the existing models the fac clo2 reaction was monitored during 24 h in buffered ultrapure water at different ph values ranging from 6 6 to 8 1 and with concentrations relevant to a disinfection step in drinking water treatment i e 65 µm of fac 4 6 mgcl2 l 1 and 24 µm of clo2 1 6 mg l 1 circles fig 1 the concentration of clo2 was selected to be above the guideline provided by who 0 7 mg l 1 and corresponds to a clo2 dosage of about 2 mg l 1 29 7 µm cl was also present in solution originating from the sodium hypochlorite stock solution cl 1 9 x fac as shown in fig 1 the experimental clo2 abatement decreased significantly with increasing ph clo2 was abated by 54 32 and 10 after 24 h at ph 6 6 7 1 and 7 7 respectively the clo2 abatement was negligible at ph 7 7 the slower reaction with increasing ph is well established and is notably attributed to the decreasing fraction of hocl gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 jia et al 2000 peintler et al 1990 the experimental clo2 data were compared to the three models by kinetic simulations eqs 1 9 in table 1 lines in fig 1 the clo2 decrease was overestimated by models 1 and 3 and underestimated by model 2 fig 1 as previously mentioned all models were determined using mm levels or higher of fac and or chlorite and at high ionic strength 0 5 1 m which may explain the discrepancy with our experimental data in addition experimental variations between the studies may be the cause of the variations between the models for example model 2 was determined using only large excess of clo2 which may have introduced a bias compared to model 1 which was determined using fac or clo2 excess another notable difference was the buffering conditions the rate constants of models 1 and 3 were determined in acetate 0 5 m and phosphate buffer 0 1 m respectively gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 peintler et al 1990 while the experiments in this study were performed in 10 mm phosphate model 2 jia et al 2000 suggested that the acid assisted hocl clo2 reaction is catalyzed by acetic acid or h2po4 which may explain the faster clo2 decrease predicted by models 1 and 3 to test this hypothesis and since phosphate was used in the experiments of this study the relevance of the phosphate assisted clo2 oxidation in model 2 was evaluated eqs 6b and 8b table 1 model 2 predicted a 24 h clo2 abatement 2 5 times higher when increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 20 mm which was not observed experimentally fig s4 si these results do not exclude a possible impact of phosphate when using higher concentrations up to 0 2 m for model 2 and 0 1 m for model 3 however it is not significant under the experimental conditions used in this study 3 1 2 development of a kinetic model in a first step rate constants related to the reaction of fac with clo2 were fitted to the clo2 experimental data at ph 6 6 using kintecus the following rate constants were adjusted k 1 for model 1 k 6a or k 6b for model 2 and k 9 for model 3 see table 1 in model 1 k 2 and k 3 did not have a significant impact on the model output and therefore were not modified see fig s2 si the fitted rate constants were then applied to simulate clo2 decrease at ph 7 1 7 7 and 8 1 the modified rate constants and the resulting comparison with experimental data are presented in table s2 and fig s3 si a good fit was obtained for models 1 and 2 fig s3a c si while model 3 overestimated the impact of increasing the ph fig s3d si therefore model 3 was not further considered in this study in addition as phosphate impact on clo2 decay was found to be negligible under the conditions in this study fig s4 si model 2 was not further considered and model 1 eqs 1 5 in table 1 was selected for the remainder of this study to further improve the kinetic model k 3 and k 5 were fitted using both clo2 decrease and clo3 formation similar to the first step k 1 was fitted to the experimental data for clo2 at ph 6 6 using kintecus while k 3 and k 5 were initially fixed at values ranging from 0 to 2 5 103 m 2 s 1 and from 0 to 2 0 105 s 1 respectively residual sum of squares between experimental and modelled data at all phs were then calculated and applied to determine the optimal rate constants k 3 1 3 103 m 2 s 1 k 5 1 0 105 s 1 and k 1 2 9 105 m 2 s 1 see details in text s3 table s3 and fig s5 si the optimized rate constants are shown in table 1 eqs 1 5 and the simulated clo2 fac clo3 and clo2 are compared to the experimental data in fig 2 a d a good fit to the experimental data was obtained at all ph except 6 6 at which a significantly lower concentration of clo2 was measured compared to the model prediction the molar concentration balance of oxychlorine species was not complete at this ph about 10 of the clo2 was not recovered as clo3 or clo2 at ph 6 6 this deviation can be explained by the high reactivity of clo2 with potential impurities which led to significant variations between experimental replicates large error bars for clo2 in fig 2d the reduction of clo2 by impurities should not affect the rest of the model clo3 is unlikely to be a significant product of clo2 reduction and the formation of clo2 or fac from clo2 degradation would be negligible compared to their higher concentrations gan et al 2019 the impact of eq 2 which involves cl2 was negligible under our experimental conditions fig s2 si cl2 is relevant only at low ph and when significant concentrations of cl are present see eqs s8 and s9 in table s1 si in pure and synthetic waters the cl concentration was about 0 13 mm which led to a negligible impact of k 2 on the existing model at ph 6 6 fig s2 si however as real waters may contain higher cl concentrations eq 2 was kept in the model 3 2 dom fac clo2 reaction in synthetic water 3 2 1 dom fac reaction under realistic conditions it is expected that the presence of dom significantly impacts the fac clo2 reaction by consuming part of the fac to test this hypothesis the fac decrease was investigated in presence of 3 mgc l 1 umrnom in absence of clo2 fig 2f purple squares and modeled using fast domfast and slow domslow reacting fractions of dom similarly to previous studies eqs 10 and 11 table 1 qualls and johnson 1983 zhai et al 2014 the aromatic content of fulvic acids has been shown to be correlated to the chlorine consumption reckhow et al 1990 with a stoichiometry between fac consumption and aromatic carbon concentration caromatic of 1 1 1 4 fac per caromatic after 72 h this stoichiometry is close to the 1 1 stoichiometry used in eqs 10 and 11 table 1 the molar sum of the fast and slow reacting fractions was therefore based on the caromatic of umrnom calculated from its 13c nmr carbon distribution 15 8 µm mgc 1 of aromatic carbon ihss thus 3 mgc l 1 of umrnom corresponds to 47 µm of aromatic carbons the rate law for fac consumption was expressed by 12b d fac dt k domfast fac do m fast k domslow fac do m slow the fitting process of domfast and domslow fractions and rate constants eqs 10 and 11 is illustrated in fig s6 si and was performed as follows domfast was initially defined as the fac fraction reacting within the first 2 h about 21 µm 44 of the aromatic carbon for umrnom the rate constant for the fac domfast reaction k domfast was fitted with kintecus to the decay of fac between 0 and 2 h 17 m 1 s 1 fig s6a si considering that the k domslow fac domslow term was negligible the remaining aromatic carbon accounted for domslow about 26 µm 56 of the aromatic carbon for umrdom and the rate constant for the fac domslow reaction k domslow 0 42 m 1 s 1 fig s6b si was adjusted to fit the fac decrease between 2 and 24 h in this phase the fraction of domfast was already depleted fig s6a si and the k domfast fac domfast term was therefore 0 the fitted k domslow was then used to calculate how much fac was consumed by domslow within the first 2 h 4 µm and the percentage of domslow and domfast fractions was re adjusted accordingly fig s6c si adjusted fractions of domfast and domslow determined by this procedure were 36 17 µm and 64 30 µm respectively and the fit to the experimental data is shown by the purple line in fig 2f since the fac umrnom reaction was observed to be independent of ph 6 6 8 1 fig s7 si eqs 10 and 11 were formulated independently to the hocl ocl speciation an insignificant ph effect has already been observed on the fac dom reaction and may be due to a balance between hocl ocl speciation and dom moieties speciation e g phenolic phenolate moieties speciation westerhoff et al 2004 the reaction of fac with nlfa was simulated using the same fractions and rate constants for domfast and domslow and a caromatic of 25 8 µm mgc 1 estimated from the 13c nmr carbon distribution ihss the model was in agreement with the experimental fac consumption by 3 mgc l 1 of nlfa after 24 h at ph 6 6 and 7 1 fig s7 si 3 2 2 impact of dom on kinetics of the fac clo2 reaction the fac clo2 reaction was investigated with and without 3 mgc l 1 of umrnom at ph 6 6 brown diamonds and orange circles respectively in fig 2e h in presence of dom clo2 decreased from 23 7 µm to 17 5 µm after 24 h brown diamonds fig 2e while it decreased to 11 0 µm in absence of dom orange circles fig 2e this was due to the fast consumption of fac by dom purple squares fig 2f reducing the fac exposure thus inhibiting clo2 oxidation consequently clo3 formation was mitigated from 7 9 µm absence of dom orange circles to 4 0 µm presence of dom brown diamonds after 24 h fig 2g in presence of dom clo2 was not detected as a result of its fast reaction with activated aromatic compounds such as phenols which are major constituents of dom fig 2h hoigné and bader 1994 houska et al 2021 rougé et al 2020a the reaction between dom and clo2 was previously shown to produce clo2 and hocl the latter representing a maximum of 50 of the consumed clo2 based on its reaction mechanism with phenol rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 furthermore the reaction of dom with clo2 is much faster than with hocl which means that during chlorination sufficient clo2 reactive sites are still present in dom see below two equations were tested for the consumption of clo2 one leading solely to clo2 eq 13a and the second one leading to 50 hocl and 50 clo2 eq 13b since clo2 is gradually produced over the 24 h of our experiments without dom fig 2h the domslow fraction defined for the dom fac reaction was used in eqs 13a and 13b both equations assumed a first order reaction in clo2 and domslow and their rate constants were set at 103 m 1 s 1 which is sufficiently high to prevent clo2 accumulation the fitting is shown in fig s8 si 13a cl o 2 do m slow cl o 2 do m ox 13b cl o 2 do m slow 0 5 cl o 2 0 5 hocl do m ox the modelling of fac clo2 and clo3 was tested using either eqs 13a or 13b and the results are shown in fig 2e h red line for eq 13a and brown line for eq 13b using eq 13a or 13b gave negligible differences for fac and clo3 simulations fig 2f and 2g however eq 13b provided a better fit for clo2 brown line in fig 2e and was therefore selected for the model table 1 activated aromatic moieties such as phenols react with higher second order rate constants with clo2 compared to fac for the reaction with phenol the ratio of the second order rate constants k clo2 kfac 102 at ph 6 6 8 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 hoigné and bader 1994 it is therefore plausible that such moieties remain intact during chlorination and quickly react with the in situ formed clo2 releasing an equimolar amount of hocl and clo2 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 3 2 3 influence of ph dom type and concentration and fac dose on the fac clo2 reaction to validate the model the 24 h consumption of clo2 and fac as well as the formation of clo3 were measured under different experimental conditions different concentrations of umrnom 1 3 and 5 mgc l 1 and nlfa 3 mgc l 1 at ph 6 6 or 7 1 and fac doses of 40 or 65 µm the concentrations of clo2 fac and clo3 after 24 h were in good agreement with the predicted values fig 3 for clo2 and fig s9 si for fac and clo3 the predicted clo2 and clo3 concentrations were within 10 of the measured values except for low clo3 concentrations 2 µm which were close to the loq 1 3 µm in practice contact times are likely to be shorter than the 24 h applied in this study however as the model yielded a reasonable fit to the evolution of the concentrations over 24 h fig 2e h good agreement between predicted and experimental values are also expected for contact times 24 h it was observed that 59 62 of the clo2 was oxidized to clo3 for both the measured and modelled data fig s10 si these yields are consistent with the oxidation of clo2 to clo2 which is the competing reaction eq 4 and with a partial reaction of clo2 with dom that leads to hocl formation eq 13b rougé et al 2018 if all clo2 was reduced to clo2 eq 13a the clo3 yield from clo2 would be 100 which was not the case fig s10 si the model predicted that a higher ph and higher matrix reactivity higher domfast and domslow fractions inhibited clo2 abatement and clo3 formation model 4 in table 1 figs 3 and s9 3 3 treatment of real waters by clo2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination 3 3 1 clo2 formation and abatement clo2 doses 1 mg l 1 were applied to 3 groundwaters labelled water a b and c for characteristics see table 2 followed by 24 h chlorination clo2 pre oxidation led to 60 65 of clo2 and negligible concentrations of clo3 about 6 data not shown in waters a and b fig 4 a b in agreement to typical clo2 yields in natural waters korn et al 2002 in water c only 14 38 of the clo2 was transformed to clo2 fig 4c lower yields may be due to the reactions of clo2 with inorganic compounds such as fe ii and mn ii aieta and berg 1986 moore et al 2004 which were higher in water c than in waters a and b table 2 after clo2 pre oxidation the clo2 levels were above the who guideline 0 7 mg l 1 i e 0 76 0 95 mg l 1 for clo2 doses of 1 25 mg l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 in waters a and b fig 4a b black circles in water c the clo2 was above the guideline only for the highest clo2 dose of 2 mg l 1 0 75 mg l 1 clo2 black circles in fig 4c after chlorination clo2 levels decreased below the guideline value of 0 7 mg l 1 in all samples white circles fig 4a c concomitantly to the clo2 decrease clo3 was formed in all samples white stars fig 4 and accounted for about 70 of the oxidized clo2 fig s11 si consistent with the experiments in synthetic waters section 3 2 3 and fig s10 si clo3 is currently regulated in the eu at the same level than clo2 0 7 mg l 1 but not in the us the clo3 concentrations after chlorination were below the eu guideline in all samples except for the highest clo2 dose in water c fig 4c 3 3 2 modelling of clo2 abatement during chlorination 24 h clo2 residual concentrations were predicted using the adjusted model from this study table 1 model 4 as the aromatic carbon concentration was not available for real waters it was estimated using a published relationship between aromaticity and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm see text s4 and fig s12 si weishaar et al 2003 a reasonable agreement between simulated and experimental fac residual concentrations was obtained within 15 for water a and c and within 25 for water b text s4 si in comparison to the measured data the final clo2 concentrations were largely overestimated by the model white and orange circles respectively in fig 4a c suggesting that the fac clo2 reaction was significantly faster in all real waters compared to synthetic waters for a clo2 dose of 1 5 mg l 1 the model predicted a final clo2 concentration above the guideline value in waters a and b 0 74 0 80 mg l 1 orange circles in fig 4a b however the measured clo2 levels were significantly below the who guideline i e 0 37 0 38 mg l 1 white circles in fig 4a b consequently the clo3 concentrations were higher than predicted by the model white and orange stars in fig 4a c but were still below the who guideline 0 7 mg l 1 except for the highest clo2 dose in water c 0 80 mg l 1 fig 4c the levels of cl present in real waters were between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conditions used for the model development table 2 with such cl levels eq 2 becomes relevant and an underestimation of k2 could be partly responsible of the overestimated modelled clo2 residuals shown in fig 4 further investigation is needed to evaluate the accuracy of k 2 under the applied experimental conditions but practical limitations prevented such experiments in particular impurities present in cl notably bromide and metals may introduce a bias especially when adding high concentrations of cl bromide was also present in all the tested natural waters at relatively high concentrations 190 260 µg l 1 table 2 bromide exhibits a low reactivity toward clo2 10 2 m 1 s 1 and is not expected to affect clo2 pre oxidation hoigné and bader 1994 however bromide can rapidly be oxidized to free available bromine fab during chlorination kumar and margerum 1987 which can then react with both dom and clo2 criquet et al 2015 furman and margerum 1998 langsa et al 2017b the second order rate constants for reaction of clo2 with fab have been reported to be significantly higher than for fac k fab k fac 101 103 jia et al 2000 which was confirmed for the experimental conditions in this study see details in text s5 and fig s13 si however due to the large fraction of bromide incorporated in dom between 80 and 97 of the initial bromide was recovered as aobr after 24 h chlorination fig 5 a it is difficult to accurately model the contribution of bromide to the enhanced clo2 abatement in presence of dom text s5 si and further investigations were beyond the scope of this paper finally the involvement of carbonate commonly found in natural waters was excluded since no significant effect was found for carbonate concentrations up to 1 5 mm 18 mgc l 1 fig s14 si 3 3 3 impact of increasing clo2 pre oxidation dose on dbp mitigation a better kinetic and mechanistic understanding of the fac clo2 reaction enables the prediction of clo2 and clo3 concentrations and potentially the use of higher clo2 doses during pre oxidation treatment to mitigate organic dbp formation while ensuring that inorganic dbp regulations are met to investigate if optimizing clo2 pre oxidation is beneficial to the mitigation of other dbps such as aox thms and hans they were monitored in the three groundwaters after 24 h chlorination with and without clo2 pre oxidation fig 5 as expected the formation of all dbps increased with increasing doc concentration i e water a 3 mgc l 1 water b 4 2 mgc l 1 water c 6 8 mgc l 1 fig 5 a pre oxidation treatment with 1 mg l 1 of clo2 which ensures clo2 levels below who guideline decreased the aox by about 30 20 and 10 in waters a b and c respectively fig 5a the same clo2 dose of 1 mg l 1 decreased thm formation by about 10 in water a but not in waters b and c 2 fig 5b the han formation was reduced by about 70 70 and 50 in waters a b and c respectively fig 5c clo2 pre oxidation with 1 mg l 1 also increased the fac residual after 24 h by about 50 110 and 215 in waters a b and c respectively triangles in fig 5b which indicates that in practice the fac dose could be reduced potentially leading to lower dbp formation since clo2 is abated during chlorination clo2 doses beyond 1 mg l 1 could be used while maintaining clo2 residuals well below the who guidelines increasing the clo2 dose in waters a and b to 1 5 mg l 1 increased both clo2 and clo3 concentrations by 0 15 0 18 mg l 1 after chlorination fig 4 concomitantly the highest clo2 dose 1 5 mg l 1 allowed a significant additional thm abatement between 21 and 29 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5b and han abatement between 15 and 27 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5c in both waters a and b as well as some minor improvements for aox abatement in water a ca 10 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5a in comparison increasing clo2 dose from 1 to 2 mg l 1 in water c did not significantly impact thms or aox 5 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5a b but was highly beneficial for han abatement ca 60 compared to 1 mg l 1 clo2 fig 5c in water c although clo2 residuals remained low 0 1 mg l 1 clo3 increased from 0 2 to 0 8 mg l 1 which is above the who guideline when increasing the clo2 dose from 1 to 2 mg l 1 fig 4c 3 3 4 practical implications abating clo2 during post chlorination allows to significantly increase the clo2 pre oxidation dose and further mitigate organic dbp formation while keeping clo2 below regulatory limits it has to be noted that the oxidation of clo2 by fac leads to the formation of clo3 which is also regulated in eu european union 2020 and needs to be taken into account fig 6 shows a comparative radar chart for inorganic dbp formation clo2 clo3 and organic dbp abatement aox thms hans in water a analogous charts for waters b and c are shown in fig s15 si increasing the clo2 pre oxidation dose gradually leads to a shift from organic to inorganic dbps fig 6 however the water matrix effects dom composition bromide ph etc largely impact the shift in dbp speciation for example aox formation was not affected by an increase in clo2 dose 1 mg l 1 in water b and thm formation was not affected by clo2 in water c fig s15 si conversely thm and han formations were particularly affected by increasing clo2 doses in water b only for the highest clo2 dose and c respectively fig s15 si raising the clo2 dose increased clo2 and clo3 formation in water b but only clo3 formation in water c up to levels 0 80 mg l 1 that can be problematic in countries where clo3 is regulated e g 0 7 mg l 1 in eu 2020 nevertheless in countries where clo3 is not regulated such as the us clo2 doses could in theory be further increased since 0 4 mg l 1 of clo2 was formed in all scenarios considering 24 h chlorination which is well below the us drinking water standard 1 mg l 1 usepa 2006 therefore the trade off between the formation of organic and inorganic dbps needs to be thoroughly assessed to comply with the different regulatory limits in different countries and the associated toxicity of the water current regulations for organic dbps are generally limited to thms and haas european union 2020 usepa 2006 which are not good surrogates for the overall dbp formation toxicity weighted concentrations of unregulated dbps such as haloacetaldehydes or hans largely outweigh thms and haas and the formation mitigation of regulated and unregulated dbps is not necessarily correlated chuang et al 2019 furst et al 2021 lau et al 2020 in absence of regulatory values the efficiency of a given treatment to control dbp formation is often evaluated as cumulated weighted toxicity using toxicity endpoints such as cytotoxicity or oxidative stress that can be quantitatively compared lau et al 2020 stalter et al 2020 however the contribution of clo2 and clo3 to these toxicity endpoints is currently unknown due to a lack of literature therefore there is a strong need for quantitative determination of clo2 and clo3 toxicities using bioassays comparable to those used for organic dbps to better evaluate the trade off between an increase in clo2 clo3 and a mitigation of organic dbps 3 3 5 role of in situ clo2 regeneration in dbps mitigation as discussed in section 3 2 2 the reaction between clo2 and fac produces clo2 in situ which further reacts with dom to evaluate if the in situ formed clo2 enhances the degradation of dbp precursors the formation of thms only trichloromethane tcm was formed in absence of bromide and hans only dichloroacetonitrile dcan was formed in absence of bromide was measured after 24 h chlorination of 3 mgc l 1 umrnom with and without 1 6 mg l 1 of clo2 and at ph 6 6 fig 7 tcm and dcan were chosen as they are known to be relatively unaffected and efficiently mitigated respectively by low clo2 doses rougé et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2013 the presence of clo2 had a negligible impact on fac exposure 43 versus 44 mm min with or without clo2 and on tcm formation 0 64 0 03 µm and 0 62 0 02 µm with and without clo2 respectively however dcan formation was strongly mitigated 33 0 2 nm and 61 1 nm with and without clo2 respectively fig 7 these results further support the regeneration of clo2 during the fac clo2 reaction and its role in the mitigation of dbp formation 4 conclusions in this study a kinetic model was developed to simulate the reaction between fac and clo2 and the ensuing formation of inorganic byproducts for varying fac doses contact times and water characteristics doc suva254 and ph the main outcomes based on experimental data and simulations were the model accurately predicted clo2 clo3 and fac concentrations in synthetic waters but largely underestimated clo2 oxidation in real waters chloride and bromide which were present at significant concentrations in the real water samples play a catalytic role in clo2 oxidation through the formation of cl2 and fab respectively their impact needs further investigation to improve clo2 and clo3 concentration predictions in real waters the byproducts clo3 and clo2 were formed at molar yields of 60 70 and 30 40 respectively clo2 was rapidly consumed by dom releasing fac the developed model provides a good foundation for more comprehensive models including the impact of bromide and other water constituent allowing to accurately predict the fate of clo2 and clo3 during chlorination of real waters predicting fac clo2 reaction will help to optimize clo2 pre oxidation this allows to apply higher doses to mitigate the formation of halo organic dbps such as hans and in some cases thms and aox while keeping the concentration of clo2 and clo3 below the current or future regulatory guidelines higher clo2 doses also significantly decrease the chlorine demand which will lead to a decrease in halogenated organic dbp formation there is a need for toxicological evaluation of clo2 clo3 using bioassays comparable to those used for other dbps to assess the trade off between oxychlorine compounds and organic dbps

et al 2021 a nested monitoring strategy that samples wastewater at different spatial scales within a city e g from municipal zones down to individual neighborhoods and even buildings has the potential to provide greater granularity in understanding disease transmission and its associated impact this study sought to understand how sars cov 2 wastewater measurements collected at a range of scales extending from neighborhoods through to an entire city across an urban metropolis with high levels of public health data integration correlated with clinically diagnosed cases among canada s cities calgary is the fourth largest and third most ethnically diverse calgary 2020 calgary is an ideal place to perform wbe modeling of covid 19 for a number of reasons i unique relative to other cities calgary has separate stormwater and wastewater collection systems preventing epidemiological signals in wastewater from being diluted by stormwater ii a single municipal utility provider is responsible for waterworks enabling consistency and greater ease of sampling iii all healthcare and covid 19 diagnostic testing are performed and data captured by a single publicly funded health service provider alberta health services and iv longstanding relationships between the university of calgary and the city of calgary through the urban alliance university of calgary 2021 enabled the rapid development and deployment of wbe these advantages have enabled this transdisciplinary nested approach to longitudinal monitoring for sars cov 2 in wastewater from june 2020 to may 2021 that assessed sars cov 2 rna signal accuracy at the level of individual neighborhoods each of calgary s three wwtps and a flow adjusted aggregate signal representing the entire city of calgary 2 methods

transparent tool that complements government reported clinical testing to understand the covid 19 pandemic and can inform public health decision making kondilis et al 2021 ronquillo et al 2020 the lancet digital 2020 other groups worldwide have reported on their own local experience using this emerging technology at the level of wwtp d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wannigama et al 2021 wurtzer et al 2020 these studies universally report strong correlations between wastewater sars cov 2 rna and clinical variables including diagnosed cases hospitalizations and covid 19 associated deaths the potential for wbe data to identify changes in community disease dynamics prior to clinical diagnoses is consistently reported with the lead time varying from study to study wbe directed from wwtps has intrinsic advantages including ease of access existing technical expertise and infrastructure however as wwtp include large and diverse geographic catchments they do not provide information or insight on the complex geospatial distribution of covid 19 in a community since the start of the pandemic neighborhoods with racialized communities and of lower socioeconomic status have consistently been disproportionally impacted patel et al 2020 accordingly many have advocated for the early adoption of nodal sewershed sampling to provide more granular and potentially actionable data for public health and education interventions resource distribution and vaccine targeting barrios et al 2021 mcclary gutierrez et al 2021 from a technical perspective however the resources required for neighborhood nodal monitoring are considerable including the need for accurate maps of the sewer network computer modeling of sewershed drainage areas sufficiently granular flow measurements and detailed census and public health data for the corresponding resident population neighborhood level wbe programs must also accommodate the complex and dynamic realities related to the feasibility and safety of accessing the desired field sampling points municipal sewershed networks are not designed for this kind of sampling and in some instances the best situated sample access points from an epidemiological perspective may be in locations e g busy roads that are relative inaccessible for high frequency sampling events with our nodal based monitoring of calgary we observed the nucleocapsid n1 region to be more sensitive than n 2 at the level of the wwtp individual neighborhoods and the composite city wide metric other groups have reported similar trends in that the n1 target is the most sensitive marker in wwtp studies acosta et al 2021 hong et al 2021 huang et al 2021 medema et al 2020 although this has not been universal ai et al 2021 relative to wwtp sampling sub catchment scale wbe i e neighborhoods is in its infancy this study uniquely correlates zonal sars cov 2 rna data with the collective demographics of residents in corresponding neighborhoods as determined through detailed census data neighborhoods with the highest sars cov 2 signals in wastewater were areas where the greatest number of covid 19 diagnosed were reported clinically our study took place at a time in which vaccine availability was extremely limited in calgary s general population fully vaccinated march 31st 2 5 april 30th 7 and may 31st 9 5 alberta government 2021 indeed neighborhood level wbe was an important factor that influenced the creation and resourcing of vaccination clinics in communities disproportionally burdened with sars cov 2 ultimately leading to a 99 vaccination first dose uptake in the associated population herring 2021 as individuals with a learned immune response either through vaccination or natural infection are more likely to have mild symptoms that are less likely to prompt clinical testing harder et al 2021 tang et al 2021 in the future monitoring for breakthrough covid 19 infections through nodal wbe could prove more important as the pandemic wanes to identify persistent pockets of ongoing unidentified transmission 4 2 relation between abundance of sars cov 2 in wastewater and ses uniquely we were able to correlate cases with ses and ethnodemographic indicators using comprehensive 2016 census data from statistics canada statistics canada 2016 detailed to the postal code level fig 6 for example neighborhoods with the highest sars cov 2 in wastewater were associated with lower household income fig 6b and higher numbers of residents per household fig 6c real time monitoring with transparent reporting of neighborhood wastewater sars cov 2 will provide an additional tool to help engage marginalized communities and ensure that the threat of covid 19 is related to the unique circumstances of each community ahmed et al 2021 quinn and andrasik 2021 salma and giri 2021 it is not surprising that we observed mechanical complications that prevented neighborhood sample collection to occur at a slightly higher frequency than at wwtps although samples were still successfully collected 86 of the time the dynamic nature of remote fieldwork including the requirement of raising and lowering autosamplers into the sewershed through manholes creates the opportunities for increased wear and resultant equipment failure relative to the more controlled environment and infrastructure of a static wwtp monitoring program we did not find that samples collected at the neighborhood level where dispersion and dilution are less likely than wwtp were disproportionally affected by matrix problems or inhibition with the 1 of samples excluded from analysis being independent of sampling location others too have begun exploring sub catchment monitoring targeted surveillance from five manholes through lincoln nebraska usa was used to infer zip code level regional variation in sars cov 2 activity barrios et al 2021 rubio acero et al longitudinally monitored six areas in munich germany capturing 32 of the total city s population demonstrating congruence between wastewater sars cov 2 levels and regionally identified cases and regional distribution of specific variants of concern voc rubio acero et al 2021 similarly a study from nice france assessed wastewater between october and march 2021 and used qpcr quantification and targeted pcr tiling with artic network primers and oxford nanopore sequencing devices to understand regional dynamics in covid 19 rios et al 2021 the authors observed that in areas purported to have residents of lower ses wastewater sars cov 2 rna values were frequently higher than those of higher ses and specific voc were concentrated in distinct geographic areas rios et al 2021 mota et al monitored fifteen sewershed sub catchments in addition to two central wwtp to perform nodal sampling in belo horizonte brazil to comprehensively capture portions of the community in an area where clinical testing was limited in order to track the effectiveness of public health measures mota et al 2021 this revealed that the highest levels of sars cov 2 were present in areas with the most vulnerable populations i e favelas or shanty towns yaniv et al 2021 used neighborhood level sampling to monitor the city of ashkelon israel at the end of their first wave during a period of low viral transmission to document viral shedding even in the absence of clinically diagnosed cases they reported stronger signals at the level of sub catchments relative to wwtp that they attributed to potential dilution effects which occurred downstream at the wwtp relative to individual neighborhoods in contrast we report the opposite wwtp level data correlated with case data limited to three digit postal codes to a greater degree than neighborhood level data in calgary possibly owing to the wastewater sewershed s separation from the stormwater system within the confines of 3 digit postal code case correlations our data demonstrates the strongest correlations between cases and sars cov 2 signal considered across the entire city wwtp individual neighborhoods significant correlations at the neighborhood scale were observed in ne1 ne2 and ne3 that were monitored for the longest time and where clinical cases were higher than in the other three neighborhoods there are limitations to assigning clinical case residence based on three digit postal codes as these boundaries do not necessarily align precisely with sewershed drainage networks sampling at larger wwtp and city wide scales result in these potential overlap artifacts fading away resulting in stronger correlations for these larger catchments and populations this limitation can in principle be accounted for in future efforts where granular wbe data is sought novel strategies that maintain individuals anonymity while facilitating precise attribution of diagnosed cases to addresses can be developed with the guidance of local ethics boards hrudey et al 2021 other factors may also contribute to improved correlation of sars cov 2 wastewater signals with clinically identified cases at larger geographies in areas of lower ses and higher occupancy per residence i e crowding secondary infection rates within a household are higher potentially concentrating the wastewater signal koureas et al 2021 madewell et al 2021 this is consistent with evidence that the adherence to physical and social distancing recommendations are correlated with ses indicators jay et al 2020 4 3 human behaviors toileting patterns and their influence on wbe a major limitation of wastewater surveillance is that the signal recorded is only contributed to by individuals who defecate in a particular sewershed catchment indeed most studies either show no or extremely low levels of sars cov 2 excreted in urine with 106 more rna shed g in stool relative to urine jones et al 2020 toileting pattens are therefore a critical determinant when ascribing wastewater data to populations while academic studies on toileting are scarce heaton et al 1992 a multitude of non academic surveys exist which highlight a potential limitation in trying to understand patterns at increasingly granular scales most individuals report once daily defecation patterns with the majority occurring in the morning at home although considerable variation exists this is the rationale by which wastewater data is ascribed to a diagnosed individual s residence for covid 19 wbe obviously individuals still defecate outside the home most commonly at their place of employment but almost half of employees report a level of discomfort defecating at work wong et al 2019 further the usage of public restroom facilities for defecation is more likely if respondents could be assured of a single occupancy restroom the healthline editorial team 2017 additionally implementation of measurements such as quarantine facilities i e hotels could also contribute to the discrepancies between sewershed catchment area and where a positive case is ascribed during the time of the study the province of alberta offered isolation in a specific hotel free of charge to homeless individuals to mitigate the spread of sars cov 2 in the community alberta government 2021 further refinements to covid 19 wbe studies may need to link clinical cases not only with sewersheds of primary residences but also with primary sites of employment to capture toileting variables more comprehensively understanding the natural history of sars cov 2 rna excreted into wastewater is also necessary when correlating measured signals with clinical cases confounding the already complicated wastewater matrix is the fact that there is likely large differences in amount duration and time course of fecal sars cov 2 rna shedding potentially influenced by age immune status and further affected by viral factors including voc fitness frampton et al 2021 medema et al 2020 mousazadeh et al 2021 despite the prolonged fecal shedding reported by human studies mean 21 days wastewater studies generally most strongly correlate with new daily cases with a 4 to 7 day lead time nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 monitoring the wastewater of three tertiary care hospitals in calgary using the same methods as described here it was observed that large increases in sars cov 2 rna were attributable to even single or small clusters of hospital acquired transmission despite the presence of dozens of hospitalized patients on site further suggesting that shedding is greatest at symptom onset acosta et al 2021 there are several other limitations of this work that warrant discussion most notably we were limited in the frequency and number of samples that were analyzed per week per location primarily related to the cost associated with collection from neighborhoods more frequent sample collection would be useful for early detection of outbreaks or rapid changes in the trajectory of the sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater for more granular wbe to be successful new strategies independent of the dangerous and confined spaces hazards of municipally installed autosamplers in local sewersheds need to be realized our study focuses primarily on detection and trend determination for sars cov 2 rna copies in wastewater samples obtained at different catchment scales future research should examine aspects such as sensitivity and lead time estimation 5 conclusions wastewater based monitoring of sars cov 2 rna across a range of geospatial scales correlated well with clinically diagnosed covid 19 cases in calgary composite flow adjusted signals from three individual wwtps enabled a single city wide metric that correlated strongly with clinically diagnosed cases geographically constrained to the three digit postal code level the more granular neighborhood level sub catchment data showed a significant correlation but the limitations of three digit postal code case attribution reduced sensitivity we believe that the actionability of wbe ultimately will be greatest when performed at granular levels however at present nodal wbe requires a more refined understanding modeling of the system dynamics because the system is noisier more

et al 2021 a nested monitoring strategy that samples wastewater at different spatial scales within a city e g from municipal zones down to individual neighborhoods and even buildings has the potential to provide greater granularity in understanding disease transmission and its associated impact this study sought to understand how sars cov 2 wastewater measurements collected at a range of scales extending from neighborhoods through to an entire city across an urban metropolis with high levels of public health data integration correlated with clinically diagnosed cases among canada s cities calgary is the fourth largest and third most ethnically diverse calgary 2020 calgary is an ideal place to perform wbe modeling of covid 19 for a number of reasons i unique relative to other cities calgary has separate stormwater and wastewater collection systems preventing epidemiological signals in wastewater from being diluted by stormwater ii a single municipal utility provider is responsible for waterworks enabling consistency and greater ease of sampling iii all healthcare and covid 19 diagnostic testing are performed and data captured by a single publicly funded health service provider alberta health services and iv longstanding relationships between the university of calgary and the city of calgary through the urban alliance university of calgary 2021 enabled the rapid development and deployment of wbe these advantages have enabled this transdisciplinary nested approach to longitudinal monitoring for sars cov 2 in wastewater from june 2020 to may 2021 that assessed sars cov 2 rna signal accuracy at the level of individual neighborhoods each of calgary s three wwtps and a flow adjusted aggregate signal representing the entire city of calgary 2 methods

alberta government 2020 composite raw wastewater from each of the three wwtps table 1 was collected up to three times per week from june 29 2020 to may 31 2021 six neighborhood specific sampling sites table 1 fig 1 were sequentially added to a bi weekly sample collection schedule to enable more granular geographic assessment of the spatial and temporal variation in sars cov 2 rna levels throughout the city neighborhoods were chosen based on ease of access size of population and to represent a diverse cross section of calgary wwtp and neighborhood wastewater samples were collected by city of calgary water utility services staff and or the university research team using a consistent standard protocol isco 5800 or isco 6712 portable autosamplers were programmed to collect and store 24 hour composite samples sample collection from wwtp 2 wwtp 3 and neighborhood locations were time weighted whereas samples collected from the larger wwtp 1 were flow weighted detailed description of sample

wastewater pearson correlations were performed using the 5 day average of new cases linked to the three digit postal codes for the sewershed catchments served by each wwtp we observed a strong correlation between wastewater n1 signals and new daily cases for all wwtps when analyzed individually table 2 n2 signals also strongly correlated with the number of incident cases in each area supplemental material table 4s acf and pacf plots were generated to analyze the autocorrelation of the sars cov 2 rna concentration measured either by the n1 or n2 and or new cases on the time series

for more granular sars cov 2 surveillance upstream of the wwtps we collected samples from different locations within calgary composite 24 h wastewater samples from six separate neighborhoods fig 1 were brought online sequentially over 25 weeks resulting in a total of 191 samples being collected between december 1 2020 and may 31 2021 table 1 fig 4 cumulatively these six sampling locations represented ww from 183 109 residents 14 2 of calgary s population with the six populations ranging in size from 12 000 to 72 000 residents table 1 sites were chosen to represent the geographic diversity of calgary and are notable for significant heterogeneity with respect to statistics canada s indicators of ethno demographics and socioeconomic status fig 5 three samples 1 6 were excluded

shown in general among all neighborhoods the ne1 location had the highest incidence of covid 19 cases as was reflected by the greatest abundance of sars cov 2 signal detected in wastewater fig 4a a positive correlation between the n1 signal and new cases was identified for each of the ne neighborhoods and se2 when analyzed individually table 2 but not for se1 and sw1 where fewer datapoints were collected although the same trends evident when sars cov 2 was measured with the n2 assay the sars cov 2 signal only correlated with the number of new cases at the ne3 site supplemental material table

the strongest correlations between the number of clinically identified cases defined to the three digit postal code level and ww measurements at the level of the city and wwtp relative to neighborhoods to better understand the impact of nested sampling for wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 pearson correlation analysis were conducted with all data points for all wwtp and

223 fisher s exact test p 0 339 4 discussion 4 1 importance of wbe in a nodal sewershed sampling wbe surveillance combined with real time data sharing is an inclusive independent unbiased and transparent tool that complements government reported clinical testing to understand the covid 19 pandemic and can inform public health decision making kondilis et al 2021 ronquillo et al 2020 the lancet digital 2020 other groups worldwide have reported on their own local experience using this emerging technology at the level of wwtp d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wannigama et al 2021 wurtzer et al 2020 these studies universally report strong correlations between wastewater sars cov 2 rna and clinical variables including diagnosed cases hospitalizations and covid 19 associated deaths the potential for wbe data to identify changes in community disease dynamics prior to clinical diagnoses is consistently reported with the lead time varying from study to study wbe directed from wwtps has intrinsic advantages including ease of access existing technical expertise and infrastructure however as wwtp include large and diverse geographic catchments they do not provide information or insight on the complex geospatial distribution of covid 19 in a community since the start of the pandemic neighborhoods with racialized communities and of lower socioeconomic status have consistently been disproportionally impacted patel et al 2020 accordingly many have advocated for the early adoption of nodal sewershed sampling to provide more granular and potentially actionable data for public health and education interventions resource distribution and vaccine targeting barrios et al 2021 mcclary gutierrez et al 2021 from a technical perspective however the resources required for neighborhood nodal monitoring are considerable including the need for accurate maps of the sewer network computer modeling of sewershed drainage areas sufficiently granular flow measurements and detailed census and public health data for the corresponding resident population neighborhood level wbe programs must also accommodate the complex and dynamic realities related to the feasibility and safety of accessing the desired field sampling points municipal sewershed networks are not designed for this kind of sampling and in some instances the best situated sample access points from an epidemiological perspective may be in locations e g busy roads that are relative inaccessible for high frequency sampling events with our nodal based monitoring of calgary we observed the nucleocapsid n1 region to be more sensitive than n 2 at the level of the wwtp individual neighborhoods and the composite city wide metric other groups have reported similar trends in that the n1 target is the most sensitive marker in wwtp studies acosta et al 2021 hong et al 2021 huang et al 2021 medema et al 2020 although this has not been universal ai et al 2021 relative to wwtp sampling sub catchment scale wbe i e neighborhoods is in its infancy this study uniquely correlates zonal sars cov 2 rna data with the collective demographics of residents in corresponding neighborhoods as determined through detailed census data neighborhoods with the highest sars cov 2 signals in wastewater were areas where the greatest number of covid 19 diagnosed were reported clinically our study took place at a time in which vaccine availability was extremely limited in calgary s general population fully vaccinated march 31st 2 5 april 30th 7 and may 31st 9 5 alberta government 2021 indeed neighborhood level wbe was an important factor that influenced the creation and resourcing of vaccination clinics in communities disproportionally burdened with sars cov 2 ultimately leading to a 99 vaccination first dose uptake in the associated population herring 2021 as individuals with a learned immune response either through vaccination or natural infection are more likely to have mild symptoms that are less likely to prompt clinical testing harder et al 2021 tang et al 2021 in the future monitoring for breakthrough covid 19 infections through nodal wbe could prove more important as the pandemic wanes to identify persistent pockets of ongoing unidentified transmission 4 2 relation between abundance of sars cov 2 in wastewater and ses uniquely we were able to correlate cases with ses and ethnodemographic indicators using comprehensive 2016 census data from statistics canada statistics canada 2016 detailed to the postal code level fig 6 for example neighborhoods with the highest sars cov 2 in wastewater were associated with lower household income fig 6b and higher numbers of residents per household fig 6c real time monitoring with transparent reporting of neighborhood wastewater sars cov 2 will provide an additional tool to help engage marginalized communities and ensure that the threat of covid 19 is related to the unique circumstances of each community ahmed et al 2021 quinn and andrasik 2021 salma and giri 2021 it is not surprising that we observed mechanical complications that prevented neighborhood sample collection to occur at a slightly higher frequency than at wwtps although samples were still successfully collected 86 of the time the dynamic nature of remote fieldwork including the requirement of raising and lowering autosamplers into the sewershed through manholes creates the opportunities for increased wear and resultant equipment failure relative to the more controlled environment and infrastructure of a static wwtp monitoring program we did not find that samples collected at the neighborhood level where dispersion and dilution are less likely than wwtp were disproportionally affected by matrix problems or inhibition with the 1 of samples excluded from analysis being independent of sampling location others too have begun exploring sub catchment monitoring targeted surveillance from five manholes through lincoln nebraska usa was used to infer zip code level regional variation in sars cov 2 activity barrios et al 2021 rubio acero et al longitudinally monitored six areas in munich germany capturing 32 of the total city s population demonstrating congruence between wastewater sars cov 2 levels and regionally identified cases and regional distribution of specific variants of concern voc rubio acero et al 2021 similarly a study from nice france assessed wastewater between october and march 2021 and used qpcr quantification and targeted pcr tiling with artic network primers and oxford nanopore sequencing devices to understand regional dynamics in covid 19 rios et al 2021 the authors observed that in areas purported to have residents of lower ses wastewater sars cov 2 rna values were frequently higher than those of higher ses and specific voc were concentrated in distinct geographic areas rios et al 2021 mota et al monitored fifteen sewershed sub catchments in addition to two central wwtp to perform nodal sampling in belo horizonte brazil to comprehensively capture portions of the community in an area where clinical testing was limited in order to track the effectiveness of public health measures mota et al 2021 this revealed that the highest levels of sars cov 2 were present in areas with the most vulnerable populations i e favelas or shanty towns yaniv et al 2021 used neighborhood level sampling to monitor the city of ashkelon israel at the end of their first wave during a period of low viral transmission to document viral shedding even in the absence of clinically diagnosed cases they reported stronger signals at the level of sub catchments relative to wwtp that they attributed to potential dilution effects which occurred downstream at the wwtp relative to individual neighborhoods in contrast we report the opposite wwtp level data correlated with case data limited to three digit postal codes to a greater degree than neighborhood level data in calgary possibly owing to the wastewater sewershed s separation from the stormwater system within the confines of 3 digit postal code case correlations our data demonstrates the strongest correlations between cases and sars cov 2 signal considered across the entire city wwtp individual neighborhoods significant correlations at the neighborhood scale were observed in ne1 ne2 and ne3 that were monitored for the longest time and where clinical cases were higher than in the other three neighborhoods there are limitations to assigning clinical case residence based on three digit postal codes as these boundaries do not necessarily align precisely with sewershed drainage networks sampling at larger wwtp and city wide scales result in these potential overlap artifacts fading away resulting in stronger correlations for these larger catchments and populations this limitation can in principle be accounted for in future efforts where granular wbe data is sought novel strategies that maintain individuals anonymity while facilitating precise attribution of diagnosed cases to addresses can be developed with the guidance of local ethics boards hrudey et al 2021 other factors may also contribute to improved correlation of sars cov 2 wastewater signals with clinically identified cases at larger geographies in areas of lower ses and higher occupancy per residence i e crowding secondary infection rates within a household are higher potentially concentrating the wastewater signal koureas et al 2021 madewell et al 2021 this is consistent with evidence that the adherence to physical and social distancing recommendations are correlated with ses indicators jay et al 2020 4 3 human behaviors toileting patterns and their influence on wbe a major limitation of wastewater surveillance is that the signal recorded is only contributed to by individuals who defecate in a particular sewershed catchment indeed most studies either show no or extremely low levels of sars cov 2 excreted in urine with 106 more rna shed g in stool relative to urine jones et al 2020 toileting pattens are therefore a critical determinant when ascribing wastewater data to populations while academic studies on toileting are scarce heaton et al 1992 a multitude of non academic surveys exist which highlight a potential limitation in trying to understand patterns at increasingly granular scales most individuals report once daily defecation patterns with the majority occurring in the morning at home although considerable variation exists this is the rationale by which wastewater data is ascribed to a diagnosed individual s residence for covid 19 wbe obviously individuals still defecate outside the home most commonly at their place of employment but almost half of employees report a level of discomfort defecating at work wong et al 2019 further the usage of public restroom facilities for defecation is more likely if respondents could be assured of a single occupancy restroom the healthline editorial team 2017 additionally implementation of measurements such as quarantine facilities i e hotels could also contribute to the discrepancies between sewershed catchment area and where a positive case is ascribed during the time of the study the province of alberta offered isolation in a specific hotel free of charge to homeless individuals to mitigate the spread of sars cov 2 in the community alberta government 2021 further refinements to covid 19 wbe studies may need to link clinical cases not only with sewersheds of primary residences but also with primary sites of employment to capture toileting variables more comprehensively understanding the natural history of sars cov 2 rna excreted into wastewater is also necessary when correlating measured signals with clinical cases confounding the already complicated wastewater matrix is the fact that there is likely large differences in amount duration and time course of fecal sars cov 2 rna shedding potentially influenced by age immune status and further affected by viral factors including voc fitness frampton et al 2021 medema et al 2020 mousazadeh et al 2021 despite the prolonged fecal shedding reported by human studies mean 21 days wastewater studies generally most strongly correlate with new daily cases with a 4 to 7 day lead time nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 monitoring the wastewater of three tertiary care hospitals in calgary using the same methods as described here it was observed that large increases in sars cov 2 rna were attributable to even single or small clusters of hospital acquired transmission despite the presence of dozens of hospitalized patients on site further suggesting that shedding is greatest at symptom onset acosta et al 2021 there are several other limitations of this work that warrant discussion most notably we were limited in the frequency and number of samples that were analyzed per week per location primarily related to the cost associated with collection from neighborhoods more frequent sample collection would be useful for early detection of outbreaks or rapid changes in the trajectory of the sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater for more granular wbe to be successful new strategies independent of the dangerous and confined spaces hazards of municipally installed autosamplers in local sewersheds need to be realized our study focuses primarily on detection and trend determination for sars cov 2 rna copies in wastewater samples obtained at different catchment scales future research should examine aspects such as sensitivity and lead time estimation 5 conclusions wastewater based monitoring of sars cov 2 rna across a range of geospatial scales correlated well with clinically diagnosed covid 19 cases in calgary composite flow adjusted signals from three individual wwtps enabled a single city wide metric that correlated strongly with clinically diagnosed cases geographically constrained to the three digit postal code level the more granular neighborhood level sub catchment data showed a significant correlation but the limitations of three digit postal code case attribution reduced sensitivity we believe that the actionability of wbe ultimately will be greatest when performed at granular levels however at present nodal wbe requires a more refined understanding modeling of the system dynamics because the system is noisier more

15852,ocean deoxygenation could potentially trigger substantial changes in the composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter dom pool which plays an important role in the global carbon cycle to evaluate links between dom dynamics and oxygen availability we investigated the dom composition under varying levels of oxygen in a seasonally hypoxic fjord through a monthly time series over two years we used ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to characterize dom on a molecular level we find a clear trend both in diversity and molecular composition of the dom along the oxygen gradient as oxygen decreased the chemodiversity was significantly increased along with accumulation of relatively high molecular weight reduced and unsaturated compounds enriched with carboxyl group structures which were also thermodynamically less favorable to biodegradation our results suggested that oxygen depletion selectively protected otherwise bioavailable compounds from decomposition and may promote the accumulation of a larger recalcitrant dom pool in the global ocean which could provide negative feedback to the ocean carbon sequestration

preservation of organic carbon furthermore loginova et al 2016 investigated the distribution of optically active fraction of dom in the oxygen minimum zone omz off peru and showed that humic like substances enriched in the anoxic compared with the oxic layers suggesting a quality shift of dom from labile to recalcitrant with oxygen decreasing in the same site maßmig and engel 2021 studied the effects of oxygen on degradation of two important dom components dissolved sugars and amino acids and observed a preferential degradation of more labile dissolved amino acids under suboxic conditions compared to dissolved sugars suggesting the selective protection of less labile organic compounds in oxygen depleted waters however dom is a highly heterogeneous mixture of presumably millions of different compounds dittmar 2015 changes of which at molecular level can bring about differences in reactivity and persistence of dom in the ocean that are not detectable on the bulk concentration or

2019 he et al 2019 kellerman et al 2014 lehmann et al 2020 letourneau et al 2021 osterholz et al 2021 to move further forward we need to better understand the impact of deoxygenation on the molecular properties of dom especially in the chemical composition and structure here we present dom molecular composition from a monthly sampled time series spanning two years in the bedford basin a seasonally hypoxic embayment on the eastern shore of nova scotia canada fig s1 haas et al 2021 li 2014 the aim was to examine how dom composition and reactivity changes with varying oxygen availability and the potential consequences for long term carbon storage we hypothesize that dom in oxygen depleted conditions would be more diverse and less bioavailable because anaerobic degradation of organic matter is less efficient than aerobic one and produce more metabolic intermediates contributing to the chemical diversity of dom 2 material and methods 2 1 study site sampling and data sets the bedford basin is a coastal embayment area 17 km2 that forms the inner portion of halifax harbor nova scotia canada li and dickie 2001 basin has a maximum depth of 71 m and is connected to the adjacent scotian shelf through a narrow and shallow sill the basin is characterized by restricted water exchange with the open ocean as well as annual cycles of stratification and winter mixing and thus represents an ideal natural laboratory for investigating the complex interconnections between deoxygenation dom cycling and ultimate organic carbon storage stratification is established in spring approximately april followed by benthic hypoxia and persists into winter november through february until broken down due to intense cooling haas et al 2021 li 2014 sampling was carried out from february 2018 to november

protocol can be found in li and dickie 2001 briefly at each sampling point a profiling conductivity temperature depth ctd system seabird sbe 25 equipped with a sbe 43 o2 sensor was used to measure pressure conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen water samples were retrieved from 60 m depth using 12 l niskin bottles attached to the ctd probe monthly samples for dom analysis were collected

elut ppl 500 mg after extraction the cartridges were eluted with 6 ml of methanol hplc grade sigma aldric after desalting with acidified ultrapure water and drying with ultrapure n2 the eluates were stored at 20 c until analysis on the ft icr ms the molecular dom composition was analyzed using a 9 4 t apex ultra ft icr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source bruker apollo ii at the state key laboratory of heavy oil processing beijing china instrument settings were as specified in he et al 2020 briefly dom methanol extracts were diluted with methanol to a doc concentration of 50 mg c l 1 and then introduced into the esi source in negative mode by infusion with a flow rate of 250 µl h 1 for each mass spectrum 128 broadband scans with 4 m word size were accumulated in the scanning range of 200 800 da the instrument was initially calibrated using sodium formate and then recalibrated with a list of known mass series containing a relatively high abundance of cho molecular formulae to achieve a mass error of 0 2 ppm data generated by ft icr ms analyses were processed with an in house software he et al 2020 for molecular formula assignment we included the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 30 14n0 3 32s0 1 and searched for matches in a tolerance range of 1 0 ppm with a signal to noise s n ratio of 4 and higher the signal intensity of each identified molecular formula was normalized to the sum of all peak intensities in each sample before applying a dataset detection limit where peaks present in fewer than four samples were not considered the double bond equivalents dbe refer to the total number of double bonds and aliphatic rings in a molecule including the double bonds of carboxyl groups dbe c 0 7 indicates the presence of aromatic or condensed aromatic structures whereas dbe o is inversely related to the possible number of c o bonds koch and dittmar 2016 dbe o is used to describe c c unsaturation without consideration of the possible c o bonds that are abundant in rcooh functionalities d andrilli et al 2010 the modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated to determine the degree of aromaticity which provides an unequivocal minimum criterion for the existence of either aromatic aimod 0 5 or condensed aromatic structures aimod 0 67 in dom koch and dittmar 2016 the aromatic compounds have been suggested to be resistant to biodegradation and susceptible to photodegradation rossel et al 2013 stubbins et al 2010 we also calculated the nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc as nosc 4 4c h 3n 2o 2s c where c h o n and s denotes the number of atoms of each element in each formula nosc is a simple proxy to assess the thermodynamic limitation for organic matter as the energetic rewards from oxidation of organic carbon to co2 can be estimated through an inverse linear relationship between the gibbs free energy of oxidation and nosc larowe and cappellen 2011 the degradation index ideg was calculated for each sample as described by flerus et al 2012 to assess the relative degradation state of spe dom and a higher ideg points to a more degraded and aged dom flerus et al 2012 the degree of hydrogen saturation and oxygenation are indicated by h c and o c ratios respectively the intensity weighted averages of molecular weight elemental ratios h c o c dbe aimod and nosc were calculated for each sample in addition the basic structural features about the compounds were inferred from the molecular formula six compound classes were assigned using aimod and elemental ratios as follows condensed aromatic aimod 0 67 polyphenolic 0 67 aimod 0 5 highly unsaturated and phenolic hup aimod 0 5 h c 1 5 aliphatic h c 1 5 o c 0 9 n 0 peptide like h c 1 5 o c 0 9 n 0 and sugar like h c 1 5 o c 0 9 kellerman et al 2021 due to numerous possible structural isomers behind each molecular formula hawkes et al 2018 hertkorn et al 2007 we emphasize that this molecular structure assignment is not unambiguous but it provides a useful overview on likely structures behind a molecular formula the contribution of each compound class was calculated by summing the relative abundances of all molecules in each compound group and expressed as percentages ra a similar calculation was used to determine the relative abundances of compounds containing different heteroatoms e g cho chon chos chons and the island of stability ios formulae which represents a potentially recalcitrant fraction of dom in the ocean lechtenfeld et al 2014 2 3 diversity measures two types of diversity indices calculated for this study first we calculated the chemical diversity of individual dom compounds i e chemodiversity using the gini simpson gs diversity which considers both the richness the number of molecular formulas and the intensity distribution evenness of individual molecular formula in each sample gotelli and chao 2013 the gs diversity increases with richness and evenness and is more influenced by evenness than richness especially when the richness exceeds 10 s we calculated four measures of functional diversity fd using rao s quadratic entropy based on the chemical structural properties of dom molecules 1 fd mass the number of c atoms indicates the molecular mass of dom molecules 2 fd bioavailability the bioavailability is indicated by h c ratio where compounds with high h c ratios are considered more biodegradable sun et al 1997 3 fd energy rewards energy rewards for oxidation of organic compounds can be estimated through an inverse linear relationship between the gibbs free energy of oxidation δ g cox 0 and nosc which can be directly calculated from the elemental stoichiometry of the molecular formula and does not require the structural information larowe and cappellen 2011 this indicator provides information on the biogeochemical reactivity of an organic compound microbial degradation of an organic substrate becomes thermodynamically more favorable as nosc increases larowe and cappellen 2011 4 fd aromaticity compounds with high aimod values are often less reactive koch and dittmar 2016 rao s quadratic entropy has been widely used to demonstrate the temporal and spatial patterns of dom molecular diversity mentges et al 2017 allowing direct comparison with other studies 2 4 statistical analyses non metric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarities bray and curtis 1957 was conducted using the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 to identify patterns in the molecular spe dom composition environmental and ft icr ms derived variables were fit to the ordination to assess the relationships between dom molecules and environment the significance was assessed through a monte carlo test 999 permutations to test whether dom molecular composition systematically changed with oxygen availability the dom intensity weighted average molecular metrics mass aromaticity nosc chemodiversity degradation index as well as relative abundances of compound class and ios were regressed against the oxygen concentrations using linear or polynomial degree 2 models the coefficients of which were estimated by least squares method a mantel test 999 permutations mantel 1967 was also conducted to confirm the regression results by examining the pearson s correlation between the oxygen distance euclidean distance and molecular composition distance bray curtis distance at significance level of 0 05 p value was corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method benjamini and hochberg 1995 we further assessed the patterns of molecular associations with oxygen availability using pearson s product moment correlation coefficient pearson correlation the pearson correlation was calculated between dissolved oxygen concentrations and the sum normalized intensity of ft icr ms peaks with unambiguous formulae assignment using corr test function in psych package revelle 2020 the dataset included 20 samples and the correlations were tested only for the formulas that present in at least 90 of the samples n 2155 a false discovery rate p value correction was applied to control the type i errors and adjusted p value 0 05 was considered significant benjamini and hochberg 1995 significant pearson correlations were then visualized in van krevelen diagram kim et al 2003 all the analyses were performed using r version 4 1 0 rcoreteam 2021 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical properties fig 1 shows the temporal variations of dissolved oxygen and dom chemodiversity in the near bottom water 60 m between january 2018 and december 2019 the time series began in february 2018 coinciding with the end of winter mixing and onset of stratification of the year and ended just before the beginning of winter mixing at the end of 2019 over this period the water column exhibited the typical annual cycles of summer fall thermal stratification and winter spring vertical mixing during stratified periods dissolved oxygen generally showed a steady decline to suboxic levels 1 20 µmol o2 l 1 wright et al 2012 occasionally the stratification was interrupted by lateral inflow events intrusions with bottom water replaced by warmer saltier and more oxygenated water from offshore this occurred between 17 and 24 october 2018 during our study as indicated by abrupt increases of temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen in the bottom water oxygen showed significant temporal variability over the time series with values ranging from 5 2 to 314 1 µmol o2 l 1 3 2 molecular composition from ft icr ms using ft icr ms of solid phase extractable dom we detected a total of 7244 distinct molecular formulas mfs in the mass range between m z 200 and 800 from 20 spe dom samples over the time series with an average of 3676 formulae present in each sample table 1 the average mass dbe and ideg showed all a negative and linear change with oxygen table s1 the average aimod changed nonlinearly with oxygen which was best fitted by a quadratic polynomial model with a decrease of the aimod values until the oxygen reached 130 µmol l 1 and a progressive increase afterwards fig 2 b the average h c o c and nosc did not change appreciably with oxygen table s1 for diversity measures the number of molecular formulae did not vary significantly with oxygen table s1 whereas chemodiversity that accounts for the evenness of individual formula in each sample was negatively correlated to oxygen fig 2a indicating the molecular composition became more uniform as oxygen decreased the functional diversity in bioavailability and energy rewards were positively correlated with oxygen table s1 r 2 0 32 p 0 01 and r 2 0 44 p 0 01 respectively whereas the molecular mass became more diverse with decreasing oxygen table s1 r 2 0 29 p 0 013 similar to aimod the aromaticity diversity exhibited a quadratic polynomial correlation with oxygen table s1 r 2 0 57 p 0 001 with an initial decrease to a minimum at oxygen concentrations of 100 150 µmol l 1 followed by an increase with further decreases of o 2 along the oxygen gradient for compound classes the relative abundance of condensed aromatics 0 4 0 2 ra and polyphenolics 3 1 0 8 ra displayed an analogous trend to that for aimod along the oxygen gradient fig 2c d aliphatic compound relative abundance 8 6 2 5 ra was decreased with decreasing oxygen fig 2f in contrast the fraction of highly unsaturated and phenolic hup 87 1 3 1 ra and ios compounds 38 8 1 6 ra increased with decreasing oxygen fig 2e and table s1 respectively both of which are indicative of reworked and refractory dom seidel et al 2015 the sugar 0 04 0 03 ra and peptide like 0 75 0 24 ra compounds did not change appreciably with oxygen and neither did the fraction of total relative abundance from cho 73 7 2 1 chon 18 1 1 6 chos 7 8 2 1 and chons 0 4 0 2 classes table s1 the mantel test of the pearson s correlation also revealed a significant association of dom molecular composition with oxygen r 0 24 p 0 012 indicating the overall effect of oxygen availability on the composition of dom pool a similar pattern can be observed when assessing the relationships between oxygen and the relative abundance of individual molecular formula using pearson s product moment correlation ft icr ms detected 2155 formulae present in at least 90 of samples 643 29 8 of which had relative intensities that were significantly correlated with oxygen average absolute value pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 63 p 0 05 formulae with similar r values and signs were found to be grouped into two distinct assemblages in van krevelen space fig 3 a molecular formulae with relative intensities that were negatively correlated with oxygen n 409 r 0 generally had high h c and low o c ratios along with high molecular mass low aromaticity and nosc whereas positively correlated formulae n 234 r 0 displayed the opposite trend the mann whitney u test revealed that the medians for all the molecular parameters within groups were significantly different p 0 0001 fig 3b and table s2 3 3 multivariate relationships the nmds using bray curtis dissimilarity revealed a clear separation of the samples by the intrusion event which occurred between october and november 2018 k 3 stress 0 04 fig 4 and coincided with the dramatic temperature salinity and redox change fig 1 this suggests a dominant control and legacy effect of water mixing on dom molecular composition with the intrusion reflecting the replacement of aged bottom water in bedford basin with near surface water derived from the scotian shelf offshore these intrusion events are associated with introduction of low nutrient water with very different microbial characteristics in accordance with the lateral inflow event more degraded and unsaturated dom with higher diversity and molecular size pre intrusion was clearly separated from less reworked dom dominated by saturated aliphatic compounds post intrusion on the first dimension nmds1 these results suggested that mixing between water masses primarily drives the dom molecular composition in this case the sudden shift of chemodiversity appears to relate to the introduction of near surface high oxygen waters from offshore along the second dimension nmds2 the decrease in nosc aimod condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds coincided with an increase in the relative abundance of peptide like highly unsaturated and phenolic as well as ios compounds and a decrease of oxygen indicating the gradient in molecular composition along oxygen availability 4 discussion 4 1 oxygen deficiency promotes the chemical diversification of dom we found that oxygen deficiency promoted the dom diversification likely in part by enhancing denitrifiers and or nitrifiers activities chemodiversity was highest in oxygen depleted conditions during the study suggesting anaerobically derived dom species may contribute to the diversity due to the thermodynamic inhibition on the one hand anaerobic carbon decomposition pathways tend to involve sequential partial oxidations by multiple interdependent populations which necessarily produce diverse by products contributing the chemical diversity of dom großkopf and soyer 2016 on the other hand as oxygen is absent anaerobic microbes may diversify the range of compounds they produce to overcome the limitation of metabolic intermediates accumulation which in turn favors a higher diversity in both the niche and the resulting dom chemical composition großkopf and soyer 2016 despite lack of direct observations of water column denitrification we inferred the presence of this process from indirect evidence that nitrogen deficiency indicative of low n was higher with lower oxygen fig s3 the quasi conservative tracer n defined as linear combination of nitrate and phosphate n no3 16 po4 3 0 29 0 87 was proposed to investigate the distribution of nitrogen fixation and denitrification in the world oceans gruber and sarmiento 1997 low n concentrations indicated a sink of n due to potentially prevailing denitrification moreover we noted that chemodiversity was also positively correlated with the nitrate concentration during the stagnant periods r 2 0 58 p 0 01 fig s2b the accumulation of which had been recently proposed to be closely associated with the activities of aerobic nitrifiers especially after the onset of stratification haas et al 2021 this was confirmed by our observations that rapid nitrate increase was coupled with rapid decrease of ammonium or nitrite fig s2a nitrifying microorganisms are chemoautotrophs they oxidize nh4 or no2 using o2 as the terminal electron acceptor to yield energy which is used to fix co2 and produce biomass the organic compounds released by these nitrifiers may enhance the diversity of dom but poorly examined suominen et al 2021 from this point of view nitrification may contribute to both the oxygen deficiency beman et al 2021 and speciation of dom high chemodiversity in the low oxygen conditions contributes to the background of highly diluted individual molecules which are inaccessible to microbial uptake due to their extremely low concentration and thus can persist for a long time in the ocean arrieta et al 2015 dittmar et al 2021 jiao et al 2014 mentges et al 2019 4 2 oxygen availability dependent dom reactivity our results suggest that labile dom degradation was not affected by oxygen availability while non labile fraction decomposition was inhibited and appeared to accumulate below a threshold of oxygen concentration the aliphatic sugar and peptide like compounds have been associated with microbial and algal sources of dom and high bioavailability d andrilli et al 2015 their dynamics showed no clear trends or only weak correlations with oxygen in our study suggesting such bio labile molecules can be rapidly cycled hours to days regardless of the oxygen regime and even dropped to too low concentrations to be captured by our monthly interval investigation kaiser and benner 2012 our results were substantiated by earlier findings that anaerobic respiration e g nitrate sulfate reduction is as efficient as aerobic respiration in degrading labile organic matter in the eastern tropical pacific oxygen minimum zones maßmig et al 2019 maßmig and engel 2021 mooy et al 2002 pantoja et al 2009 the anoxic cariaco basin taylor et al 2009 thunell et al 2000 and black sea schmidt et al 2011 although relevant reports in the bedford basin are scarce the condensed aromatics and polyphenolics have been suggested to be resistant to biodegradation rossel et al 2013 however which appeared to be more resistant to anaerobic degradation revealed by our results these highly aromatic compounds showed a rapid decrease and then began to accumulate when oxygen dropped below 130 µmol o2 l 1 fig 2c d which is much higher than the classic definitions of hypoxia 62 5 µmol o2 l 1 diaz and rosenberg 1995 and consistent with a previous report for significant changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a dissolved oxygen concentration between 161 9 and 222 5 µmol o2 l 1 spietz et al 2015 suggesting biodegradation of non labile dom was more sensitive to oxygen availability than previously thought in other words anaerobic degradation of non labile organic matter is less efficient than aerobic respiration which supported previous incubation studies that found a reduced degradation potential under oxygen depleted conditions bastviken et al 2004 tusseau vuillemin et al 2003 also this threshold value of dissolved oxygen was coincided with the oxygen minima for n2o production from nitrification starting to occur 150 µmol o2 l 1 detected in the same site punshon and moore 2004 suggesting nitrification may contribute to the aromaticity of dom compounds in addition the highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were also accumulated in low oxygen conditions fig 2e one explanation for the accumulation of these aromatic compounds is that the phenol oxidase degradation of organic matter was inhibited by low oxygen availability freeman et al 2001 this has profound implications in the context of ocean deoxygenation as negative feedback to the process of intensified carbon loss the accumulation of the condensed aromatics and polyphenolics in oxygen deficient condition could also be attributed to the dehydration transformation which is one of the dominant reactions under oxygen depleted conditions schmidt et al 2011 this reaction can lead to ring formation and aromatization which is expected in the diagenetic processes kelemen et al 2007 this process can also transform aliphatic molecules into to the carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram a major refractory component of marine dom hertkorn et al 2006 taken together the effect of oxygen availability on degradation of organic matter is dependent on the nature i e the lability of the organic matter and key redox sensitive enzymes activities molecular associations analysis revealed that molecules with significant correlations with oxygen were grouped into two distinct assemblages with similar r but opposite sign along a trend line representing methylation demethylation reaction pathways in the van krevelen space fig 3a kim et al 2003 molecules negatively related to oxygen were on average larger less oxygenated and more unsaturated fig 3b which appears to resemble the compounds found in sediment pore water from the black sea schmidt et al 2011 we noted that methylation of hydroxyl groups which is one of the dominant reactions under oxygen depleted condition schmidt et al 2011 can reduce o c whereas it can increase h c and molecular mass this process may contribute to the accumulated molecules in the low oxygen conditions observed in our study molecules negatively related to oxygen showed thermodynamically less favorable to biodegradation suggesting that some constituents of dom were selectively protected from a thermodynamic perspective these molecules were also enriched the carboxyl group functionalities rcooh commonly identified in the cram molecules hertkorn et al 2006 indicating the refractory nature of these accumulated compounds under oxygen deficient conditions one hypothesis for this accumulation of molecules with lower biodegradability might be attributed to the reduced metabolic potential of aerobic microbes facing hypoxic conditions and a reduced bioavailability of substrates overall our results implied that the sequestration of refractory dom may potentially be enhanced in the oxygen deficient water 4 3 implications for marine carbon sequestration and climate change oxygen deficiency may provide negative feedback to the carbon sequestration and climate change the biodegradability of dom is not only concentration constrained but also environmental context dependent jiao et al 2014 specifically oxygen depleted waters may represent a refuge from degradation for dom one the one hand as dom diversifies with greater oxygen deficiency assuming a constant bulk dom concentration some constituents will escape biodegradation due to their concentrations below the microbial uptake thresholds and thus contribute to carbon sequestration arrieta et al 2015 on the other hand some molecules would be inaccessible to anaerobic microbes due to the thermodynamic limitation further anaerobically derived intermediates or by products of varying bioavailability may be added to the dom pool ogawa et al 2001 some of which may be recalcitrant dom and accumulate in the waters jiao et al 2010 we therefore speculate that the intensified ocean deoxygenation may potentially increase the ocean carbon storage capacity and thus alleviate climate change 5 conclusions our study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the detailed molecular composition of dom and its relationship to oxygen availability by a two year time series in a seasonally hypoxic fjord despite the primary control of water mixing from the surface oxygen availability is still an important driver of molecular dom composition oxygen regimes and the associated biogeochemical processes influence fractions of dom released and consumed in the water column which could ultimately shape the molecular composition and reactivity spectrum of the dom pool in the ocean oxygen depletion shifts the fundamental types of thermodynamically favored reactions resulting in a greater chemical diversity and selectively protects otherwise bioavailable reduced organic compounds from decomposition although the molecular level patterns are clear along the oxygen gradient the underlying microbially mediated processes and mechanisms are still unknown given the global importance of carbon sequestration in oceanic systems whether deoxygenation favors microbial activities that funnel more organic matter into the recalcitrant dom pool via the microbial carbon pump mcp is a problem worthy of further attention understanding the underlying biogeochemical mechanisms warrants further research both on field investigations integrating microbial identity and function chemodiversity and metabolic rate measurements and on manipulation experiments on

15852,ocean deoxygenation could potentially trigger substantial changes in the composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter dom pool which plays an important role in the global carbon cycle to evaluate links between dom dynamics and oxygen availability we investigated the dom composition under varying levels of oxygen in a seasonally hypoxic fjord through a monthly time series over two years we used ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to characterize dom on a molecular level we find a clear trend both in diversity and molecular composition of the dom along the oxygen gradient as oxygen decreased the chemodiversity was significantly increased along with accumulation of relatively high molecular weight reduced and unsaturated compounds enriched with carboxyl group structures which were also thermodynamically less favorable to biodegradation our results suggested that oxygen depletion selectively protected otherwise bioavailable compounds from decomposition and may promote the accumulation of a larger recalcitrant dom pool in the global ocean which could provide negative feedback to the ocean carbon sequestration

consequences for carbon persistence marine dom is the largest reservoir of reduced carbon in the ocean with an inventory of 662 pg c comparable in size to the stock of carbon resident in atmospheric co2 hansell et al 2009 hedges 2002 and possibly a barometer of global change church et al 2002 due to the great size even minor shifts in pool size or reactivity could potentially cause major perturbations of the global ocean s long term carbon storage and thus the earth s climate sexton et al 2011 the composition of dom in marine environments are commonly associated with oxygen

dom pool oxygen availability may also play a central role in shaping dom quality e g composition reactivity analysis of the energetic potential from degrading different organic matter fractions illustrates that a range of molecular structures such as membrane type compounds that are degraded by bacteria in a well oxygenated ocean may be rendered effectively refractory under oxygen depleted conditions larowe and cappellen 2011 this was confirmed by recent field investigations boye et al 2017 and incubation experiments valle et al 2018 which all pointed to a thermodynamically controlled preservation of organic carbon furthermore loginova et al 2016 investigated the distribution of optically active fraction of dom in the oxygen minimum zone omz off peru and showed that humic like substances enriched in the anoxic compared with the oxic layers suggesting a quality shift of dom from labile to recalcitrant with oxygen decreasing in the same site maßmig and engel 2021 studied the effects of oxygen on degradation of two important dom components dissolved sugars and amino acids and observed a preferential degradation of more labile dissolved amino acids under suboxic conditions compared to dissolved sugars suggesting the selective protection of less labile organic compounds in oxygen depleted waters however dom is a highly heterogeneous mixture of presumably millions of different compounds dittmar 2015 changes of which at molecular level can bring about differences in reactivity and persistence of dom in the ocean that are not detectable on the bulk concentration or

followed by benthic hypoxia and persists into winter november through february until broken down due to intense cooling haas et al 2021 li 2014 sampling was carried out from february 2018 to november

protocol can be found in li and dickie 2001 briefly at each sampling point a profiling conductivity temperature depth ctd system seabird sbe 25 equipped with a sbe 43 o2 sensor was used to measure pressure conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen water samples were retrieved from 60 m depth using 12 l niskin bottles attached to the ctd probe monthly samples for dom analysis were collected

elut ppl 500 mg after extraction the cartridges were eluted with 6 ml of methanol hplc grade sigma aldric after desalting with acidified ultrapure water and drying with ultrapure n2 the eluates were stored at 20 c until analysis on the ft icr ms the molecular dom composition was analyzed using a 9 4 t apex ultra ft icr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source bruker apollo ii at the state key laboratory of heavy oil processing beijing china instrument settings were as specified in he et al 2020 briefly dom methanol extracts were diluted with methanol to a doc concentration of 50 mg c l 1 and then introduced into the esi source in negative mode by infusion with a flow rate of 250 µl h 1 for each mass spectrum 128 broadband scans with 4 m word size were accumulated in the scanning range of 200 800 da the instrument was initially calibrated using sodium formate and then recalibrated with a list of known mass series containing a relatively high abundance of cho molecular formulae to achieve a mass error of 0 2 ppm data generated by ft icr ms analyses were processed with an in house software he et al 2020 for molecular formula assignment we included the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 30 14n0 3 32s0 1 and searched for matches in a tolerance range of 1 0 ppm with a signal to noise s n ratio of 4 and higher the signal intensity of each identified molecular formula was normalized to the sum of all peak intensities in each sample before applying a dataset detection limit where peaks present in fewer than four samples were not considered the double bond equivalents dbe refer to the total number of double bonds and aliphatic rings in a molecule including the double bonds of carboxyl groups dbe c 0 7 indicates the presence of aromatic or condensed aromatic structures whereas dbe o is inversely related to the possible number of c o bonds koch and dittmar 2016 dbe o is used to describe c c unsaturation without consideration of the possible c o bonds that are abundant in rcooh functionalities d andrilli et al 2010 the modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated to determine the degree of aromaticity which provides an unequivocal minimum criterion for the existence of either aromatic aimod 0 5 or condensed aromatic structures aimod 0 67 in dom koch and dittmar 2016 the aromatic compounds have been suggested to be resistant to biodegradation and susceptible to photodegradation rossel et al 2013 stubbins et al 2010 we also calculated the nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc as nosc 4 4c h 3n 2o 2s c where c h o n and s denotes the number of atoms of each element in each formula nosc is a simple proxy to assess the thermodynamic limitation for organic matter as the energetic rewards from oxidation of organic carbon to co2 can be estimated through an inverse linear relationship between the gibbs free energy of oxidation and nosc larowe and cappellen 2011 the degradation index ideg was calculated for each sample as described by flerus et al 2012 to assess the relative degradation state of spe dom and a higher ideg points to a more degraded and aged dom flerus et al 2012 the degree of hydrogen saturation and oxygenation are indicated by h c and o c ratios respectively the intensity weighted averages of molecular weight elemental ratios h c o c dbe aimod and nosc were calculated for each sample in addition the basic structural features about the compounds were inferred from the molecular formula six compound classes were assigned using aimod and elemental ratios as follows condensed aromatic aimod 0 67 polyphenolic 0 67 aimod 0 5 highly unsaturated and phenolic hup aimod 0 5 h c 1 5 aliphatic h c 1 5 o c 0 9 n 0 peptide like h c 1 5 o c 0 9 n 0 and sugar like h c 1 5 o c 0 9 kellerman et al 2021 due to numerous possible structural isomers behind each molecular formula hawkes et al 2018 hertkorn et al 2007 we emphasize that this molecular structure assignment is not unambiguous but it provides a useful overview on likely structures behind a molecular formula the contribution of each compound class was calculated by summing the relative abundances of all molecules in each compound group and expressed as percentages ra a similar calculation was used to determine the relative abundances of compounds containing different heteroatoms e g cho chon chos chons and the island of stability ios formulae which represents a potentially recalcitrant fraction of dom in the ocean lechtenfeld et al 2014 2 3 diversity measures two types of diversity indices calculated for this study first we calculated the chemical diversity of individual dom compounds i e chemodiversity using the gini simpson gs diversity which considers both the richness the number of molecular formulas and the intensity distribution evenness of individual molecular formula in each sample gotelli and chao 2013 the gs diversity increases with richness and evenness and is more influenced by evenness than richness especially when the richness exceeds 10 s we calculated four measures of functional diversity fd using rao s quadratic entropy based on the chemical structural properties of dom molecules 1 fd mass the number of c atoms indicates the molecular mass of dom molecules 2 fd bioavailability the bioavailability is indicated by h c ratio where compounds with high h c ratios are considered more biodegradable sun et al 1997 3 fd energy rewards energy rewards for oxidation of organic compounds can be estimated through an inverse linear relationship between the gibbs free energy of oxidation δ g cox 0 and nosc which can be directly calculated from the elemental stoichiometry of the molecular formula and does not require the structural information larowe and cappellen 2011 this indicator provides information on the biogeochemical reactivity of an organic compound microbial degradation of an organic substrate becomes thermodynamically more favorable as nosc increases larowe and cappellen 2011 4 fd aromaticity compounds with high aimod values are often less reactive koch and dittmar 2016 rao s quadratic entropy has been widely used to demonstrate the temporal and spatial patterns of dom molecular diversity mentges et al 2017 allowing direct comparison with other studies 2 4 statistical analyses non metric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarities bray and curtis 1957 was conducted using the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 to identify patterns in the molecular spe dom composition environmental and ft icr ms derived variables were fit to the ordination to assess the relationships between dom molecules and environment the significance was assessed through a monte carlo test 999 permutations to test whether dom molecular composition systematically changed with oxygen availability the dom intensity weighted average molecular metrics mass aromaticity nosc chemodiversity degradation index as well as relative abundances of compound class and ios were regressed against the oxygen concentrations using linear or polynomial degree 2 models the coefficients of which were estimated by least squares method a mantel test 999 permutations mantel 1967 was also conducted to confirm the regression results by examining the pearson s correlation between the oxygen distance euclidean distance and molecular composition distance bray curtis distance at significance level of 0 05 p value was corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method benjamini and hochberg 1995 we further assessed the patterns of molecular associations with oxygen availability using pearson s product moment correlation coefficient pearson correlation the pearson correlation was calculated between dissolved oxygen concentrations and the sum normalized intensity of ft icr ms peaks with unambiguous formulae assignment using corr test function in psych package revelle 2020 the dataset included 20 samples and the correlations were tested only for the formulas that present in at least 90 of the samples n 2155 a false discovery rate p value correction was applied to control the type i errors and adjusted p value 0 05 was considered significant benjamini and hochberg 1995 significant pearson correlations were then visualized in van krevelen diagram kim et al 2003 all the analyses were performed using r version 4 1 0 rcoreteam 2021 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical properties fig 1 shows the temporal variations of dissolved oxygen and dom chemodiversity in the near bottom water 60 m between january 2018 and december 2019 the time series began in february 2018 coinciding with the end of winter mixing and onset of stratification of the year and ended just before the beginning of winter mixing at the end of 2019 over this period the water column exhibited the typical annual cycles of summer fall thermal stratification and winter spring vertical mixing during stratified periods dissolved oxygen generally showed a steady decline to suboxic levels 1 20 µmol o2 l 1 wright et al 2012 occasionally the stratification was interrupted by lateral inflow events intrusions with bottom water replaced by warmer saltier and more oxygenated water from offshore this occurred between 17 and 24 october 2018 during our study as indicated by abrupt increases of temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen in the bottom water oxygen showed significant temporal variability over the time series with values ranging from 5 2 to 314 1 µmol o2 l 1 3 2 molecular composition from ft icr ms using ft icr ms of solid phase extractable dom we detected a total of 7244 distinct molecular formulas mfs in the mass range between m z 200 and 800 from 20 spe dom samples over the time series with an average of 3676 formulae present in each sample table 1 the average mass dbe and ideg showed all a negative and linear change with oxygen table s1 the average aimod changed nonlinearly with oxygen which was best fitted by a quadratic polynomial model with a decrease of the aimod values until the oxygen reached 130 µmol l 1 and a progressive increase afterwards fig 2 b the average h c o c and nosc did not change appreciably with oxygen table s1 for diversity measures the number of molecular formulae did not vary significantly with oxygen table s1 whereas chemodiversity that accounts for the evenness of individual formula in each sample was negatively correlated to oxygen fig 2a indicating the molecular composition became more uniform as oxygen decreased the functional diversity in bioavailability and energy rewards were positively correlated with oxygen table s1 r 2 0 32 p 0 01 and r 2 0 44 p 0 01 respectively whereas the molecular mass became more diverse with decreasing oxygen table s1 r 2 0 29 p 0 013 similar to aimod the aromaticity diversity exhibited a quadratic polynomial correlation with oxygen table s1 r 2 0 57 p 0 001 with an initial decrease to a minimum at oxygen concentrations of 100 150 µmol l 1 followed by an increase with further decreases of o 2 along the oxygen gradient for compound classes the relative abundance of condensed aromatics 0 4 0 2 ra and polyphenolics 3 1 0 8 ra displayed an analogous trend to that for aimod along the oxygen gradient fig 2c d aliphatic compound relative abundance 8 6 2 5 ra was decreased with decreasing oxygen fig 2f in contrast the fraction of highly unsaturated and phenolic hup 87 1 3 1 ra and ios compounds 38 8 1 6 ra increased with decreasing oxygen fig 2e and table s1 respectively both of which are indicative of reworked and refractory dom seidel et al 2015 the sugar 0 04 0 03 ra and peptide like 0 75 0 24 ra compounds did not change appreciably with oxygen and neither did the fraction of total relative abundance from cho 73 7 2 1 chon 18 1 1 6 chos 7 8 2 1 and chons 0 4 0 2 classes table s1 the mantel test of the pearson s correlation also revealed a significant association of dom molecular composition with oxygen r 0 24 p 0 012 indicating the overall effect of oxygen availability on the composition of dom pool a similar pattern can be observed when assessing the relationships between oxygen and the relative abundance of individual molecular formula using pearson s product moment correlation ft icr ms detected 2155 formulae present in at least 90 of samples 643 29 8 of which had relative intensities that were significantly correlated with oxygen average absolute value pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 63 p 0 05 formulae with similar r values and signs were found to be grouped into two distinct assemblages in van krevelen space fig 3 a molecular formulae with relative intensities that were negatively correlated with oxygen n 409 r 0 generally had high h c and low o c ratios along with high molecular mass low aromaticity and nosc whereas positively correlated formulae n 234 r 0 displayed the opposite trend the mann whitney u test revealed that the medians for all the molecular parameters within groups were significantly different p 0 0001 fig 3b and table s2 3 3 multivariate relationships the nmds using bray curtis dissimilarity revealed a clear separation of the samples by the intrusion event which occurred between october and november 2018 k 3 stress 0 04 fig 4 and coincided with the dramatic temperature salinity and redox change fig 1 this suggests a dominant control and legacy effect of water mixing on dom molecular composition with the intrusion reflecting the replacement of aged bottom water in bedford basin with near surface water derived from the scotian shelf offshore these intrusion events are associated with introduction of low nutrient water with very different microbial characteristics in accordance with the lateral inflow event more degraded and unsaturated dom with higher diversity and molecular size pre intrusion was clearly separated from less reworked dom dominated by saturated aliphatic compounds post intrusion on the first dimension nmds1 these results suggested that mixing between water masses primarily drives the dom molecular composition in this case the sudden shift of chemodiversity appears to relate to the introduction of near surface high oxygen waters from offshore along the second dimension nmds2 the decrease in nosc aimod condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds coincided with an increase in the relative abundance of peptide like highly unsaturated and phenolic as well as ios compounds and a decrease of oxygen indicating the gradient in molecular composition along oxygen availability 4 discussion 4 1 oxygen deficiency promotes the chemical diversification of dom we found that oxygen deficiency promoted the dom diversification likely in part by enhancing denitrifiers and or nitrifiers activities chemodiversity was highest in oxygen depleted conditions during the study suggesting anaerobically derived dom species may contribute to the diversity due to the thermodynamic inhibition on the one hand anaerobic carbon decomposition pathways tend to involve sequential partial oxidations by multiple interdependent populations which necessarily produce diverse by products contributing the chemical diversity of dom großkopf and soyer 2016 on the other hand as oxygen is absent anaerobic microbes may diversify the range of compounds they produce to overcome the limitation of metabolic intermediates accumulation which in turn favors a higher diversity in both the niche and the resulting dom chemical composition großkopf and soyer 2016 despite lack of direct observations of water column denitrification we inferred the presence of this process from indirect evidence that nitrogen deficiency indicative of low n was higher with lower oxygen fig s3 the quasi conservative tracer n defined as linear combination of nitrate and phosphate n no3 16 po4 3 0 29 0 87 was proposed to investigate the distribution of nitrogen fixation and denitrification in the world oceans gruber and sarmiento 1997 low n concentrations indicated a sink of n due to potentially prevailing denitrification moreover we noted that chemodiversity was also positively correlated with the nitrate concentration during the stagnant periods r 2 0 58 p 0 01 fig s2b the accumulation of which had been recently proposed to be closely associated with the activities of aerobic nitrifiers especially after the onset of stratification haas et al 2021 this was confirmed by our observations that rapid nitrate increase was coupled with rapid decrease of ammonium or nitrite fig s2a nitrifying microorganisms are chemoautotrophs they oxidize nh4 or no2 using o2 as the terminal electron acceptor to yield energy which is used to fix co2 and produce biomass the organic compounds released by these nitrifiers may enhance the diversity of dom but poorly examined suominen et al 2021 from this point of view nitrification may contribute to both the oxygen deficiency beman et al 2021 and speciation of dom high chemodiversity in the low oxygen conditions contributes to the background of highly diluted individual molecules which are inaccessible to microbial uptake due to their extremely low concentration and thus can persist for a long time in the ocean arrieta et al 2015 dittmar et al 2021 jiao et al 2014 mentges et al 2019 4 2 oxygen availability dependent dom reactivity our results suggest that labile dom degradation was not affected by oxygen availability while non labile fraction decomposition was inhibited and appeared to accumulate below a threshold of oxygen concentration the aliphatic sugar and peptide like compounds have been associated with microbial and algal sources of dom and high bioavailability d andrilli et al 2015 their dynamics showed no clear trends or only weak correlations with oxygen in our study suggesting such bio labile molecules can be rapidly cycled hours to days regardless of the oxygen regime and even dropped to too low concentrations to be captured by our monthly interval investigation kaiser and benner 2012 our results were substantiated by earlier findings that anaerobic respiration e g nitrate sulfate reduction is as efficient as aerobic respiration in degrading labile organic matter in the eastern tropical pacific oxygen minimum zones maßmig et al 2019 maßmig and engel 2021 mooy et al 2002 pantoja et al 2009 the anoxic cariaco basin taylor et al 2009 thunell et al 2000 and black sea schmidt et al 2011 although relevant reports in the bedford basin are scarce the condensed aromatics and polyphenolics have been suggested to be resistant to biodegradation rossel et al 2013 however which appeared to be more resistant to anaerobic degradation revealed by our results these highly aromatic compounds showed a rapid decrease and then began to accumulate when oxygen dropped below 130 µmol o2 l 1 fig 2c d which is much higher than the classic definitions of hypoxia 62 5 µmol o2 l 1 diaz and rosenberg 1995 and consistent with a previous report for significant changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a dissolved oxygen concentration between 161 9 and 222 5 µmol o2 l 1 spietz et al 2015 suggesting biodegradation of non labile dom was more sensitive to oxygen availability than previously thought in other words anaerobic degradation of non labile organic matter is less efficient than aerobic respiration which supported previous incubation studies that found a reduced degradation potential under oxygen depleted conditions bastviken et al 2004 tusseau vuillemin et al 2003 also this threshold value of dissolved oxygen was coincided with the oxygen minima for n2o production from nitrification starting to occur 150 µmol o2 l 1 detected in the same site punshon and moore 2004 suggesting nitrification may contribute to the aromaticity of dom compounds in addition the highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were also accumulated in low oxygen conditions fig 2e one explanation for the accumulation of these aromatic compounds is that the phenol oxidase degradation of organic matter was inhibited by low oxygen availability freeman et al 2001 this has profound implications in the context of ocean deoxygenation as negative feedback to the process of intensified carbon loss the accumulation of the condensed aromatics and polyphenolics in oxygen deficient condition could also be attributed to the dehydration transformation which is one of the dominant reactions under oxygen depleted conditions schmidt et al 2011 this reaction can lead to ring formation and aromatization which is expected in the diagenetic processes kelemen et al 2007 this process can also transform aliphatic molecules into to the carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram a major refractory component of marine dom hertkorn et al 2006 taken together the effect of oxygen availability on degradation of organic matter is dependent on the nature i e the lability of the organic matter and key redox sensitive enzymes activities molecular associations analysis revealed that molecules with significant correlations with oxygen were grouped into two distinct assemblages with similar r but opposite sign along a trend line representing methylation demethylation reaction pathways in the van krevelen space fig 3a kim et al 2003 molecules negatively related to oxygen were on average larger less oxygenated and more unsaturated fig 3b which appears to resemble the compounds found in sediment pore water from the black sea schmidt et al 2011 we noted that methylation of hydroxyl groups which is one of the dominant reactions under oxygen depleted condition schmidt et al 2011 can reduce o c whereas it can increase h c and molecular mass this process may contribute to the accumulated molecules in the low oxygen conditions observed in our study molecules negatively related to oxygen showed thermodynamically less favorable to biodegradation suggesting that some constituents of dom were selectively protected from a thermodynamic perspective these molecules were also enriched the carboxyl group functionalities rcooh commonly identified in the cram molecules hertkorn et al 2006 indicating the refractory nature of these accumulated compounds under oxygen deficient conditions one hypothesis for this accumulation of molecules with lower biodegradability might be attributed to the reduced metabolic potential of aerobic microbes facing hypoxic conditions and a reduced bioavailability of substrates overall our results implied that the sequestration of refractory dom may potentially be enhanced in the oxygen deficient water 4 3 implications for marine carbon sequestration and climate change oxygen deficiency may provide negative feedback to the carbon sequestration and climate change the biodegradability of dom is not only concentration constrained but also environmental context dependent jiao et al 2014 specifically oxygen depleted waters may represent a refuge from degradation for dom one the one hand as dom diversifies with greater oxygen deficiency assuming a constant bulk dom concentration some constituents will escape biodegradation due to their concentrations below the microbial uptake thresholds and thus contribute to carbon sequestration arrieta et al 2015 on the other hand some molecules would be inaccessible to anaerobic microbes due to the thermodynamic limitation further anaerobically derived intermediates or by products of varying bioavailability may be added to the dom pool ogawa et al 2001 some of which may be recalcitrant dom and accumulate in the waters jiao et al 2010 we therefore speculate that the intensified ocean deoxygenation may potentially increase the ocean carbon storage capacity and thus alleviate climate change 5 conclusions our study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the detailed molecular composition of dom and its relationship to oxygen availability by a two year time series in a seasonally hypoxic fjord despite the primary control of water mixing from the surface oxygen availability is still an important driver of molecular dom composition oxygen regimes and the associated biogeochemical processes influence fractions of dom released and consumed in the water column which could ultimately shape the molecular composition and reactivity spectrum of the dom pool in the ocean oxygen depletion shifts the fundamental types of thermodynamically favored reactions resulting in a greater chemical diversity and selectively protects otherwise bioavailable reduced organic compounds from decomposition although the molecular level patterns are clear along the oxygen gradient the underlying microbially mediated processes and mechanisms are still unknown given the global importance of carbon sequestration in oceanic systems whether deoxygenation favors microbial activities that funnel more organic matter into the recalcitrant dom pool via the microbial carbon pump mcp is a problem worthy of further attention understanding the underlying biogeochemical mechanisms warrants further research both on field investigations integrating microbial identity and function chemodiversity and metabolic rate measurements and on manipulation experiments on

15853,pre ozonation coupled with ceramic membrane filtration has been widely used to alleviate membrane fouling however information on the efficiency and underlying mechanism of pre ozonation in the evolution of ceramic membrane biofouling is limited herein filtration experiments with a synthesis wastewater containing activated sludge were conducted in a cross flow system to evaluate the effects of pre ozonation on ceramic membrane biofouling results of flux tests show that pre ozonation aggravated biofouling at the early stage but alleviated the biofouling at the late stage in situ ftir spectra show that the aggravated biofouling with pre ozonation was mainly caused by the enhanced complexation between phosphate group from dna and al2o3 surface and the increased rigid of proteins structure at the early stage more severe pore blockage further substantiated the higher permeate resistance by contrast more dead cells were observed on membrane surface at the late stage indicating the prevention of biofouling development after long term pre ozonation additionally the structures and compositions of cake layers at the early and late stages exhibited considerable differences accompanied by the variation in microbial community with the evolution of biofouling therefore this work demonstrates the effectiveness of pre ozonation in biofouling in long term operation and provides mechanistic insights into the evolution of biofouling on ceramic membrane graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane biofouling pre ozonation in situ spectroscopy mechanism 1 introduction ceramic membrane filtration is widely applied in water and wastewater treatment due to its thermal stability and long term resistance to chemicals in the last decade li et al 2020 merlet et al 2020 however like polymeric membranes ceramic membranes are also vulnerable to fouling in filtration applications which imposes harmful effects on its performance membrane fouling organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling leads to critical decline of permeate flux that compromises the efficiency of ceramic membrane filtration in practice blanpain avet et al 2011 yue et al 2015 particularly biofouling especially the complex and poorly understood is the most detrimental problem for ceramic membranes due to the built up of biofouling layer on membrane surface and the pore blockage blanpain avet et al 2011 liu et al 2018 the biofouling formation comprises deposition adhesion metabolism growth and proliferation of microbial cells or flocs on the membranes aslam et al 2018 meng et al 2009 at the initial stage of filtration biofouling is mainly governed by the initial adhesion of microorganisms on the membrane surface the initial adhesion is closely associated with the physicochemical properties of microbial cells and membranes wang et al 2005 including covalent and non covalent interactions the non covalent interactions between ceramic membrane and microorganisms include van der waals force lewis acid base force and electrostatic force traditionally described by dlvo or xdlvo theory combined with contact angle and zeta potential ying et al 2010 the covalent interactions are often ignored in polymeric membrane microorganism interactions but for the ceramic membrane composed of metal oxide they should not be overlooked for example it was reported that pyoverdine a siderophore produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa can simultaneously bind covalently to iron iii oxides and to tio2 mcwhirter et al 2003 phosphate groups and carboxyl groups were also found to play a main role in the covalent interaction between microorganisms and metal oxide elzinga et al 2012 hong et al 2018 overall the covalent interactions between ceramic membrane and microbial cells in biofouling should be intensively investigated to elucidate the underlying mechanism the composition and structure of cake layer also play an important role in membrane permeation flux especially with the accumulation of microbial cells on the surface of ceramic membrane microbial cells release extracellular polymeric substances whose main components are proteins polysaccharides and humic substances adsorbing onto the membrane surface and thus aggravating membrane fouling for example polysaccharides are reported to form a gel layer on membrane surface which is hard to clean especially after the complexation with inorganic ions present in feed solution such as calcium ions chen et al 2016 li et al 2021 protein based fouling occurs by the interactions like electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding with membrane surface at the early stage of membrane fouling followed by protein protein and protein membrane interactions huisman et al 2000 song et al 2018 in addition due to the porosity of membrane the impact of pore blockage caused by small compounds on membrane filtration performance should not be overlooked lin et al 2009 pre ozonation is an efficient means to alleviate membrane fouling song et al 2017 except for alleviating membrane fouling pre ozonation can also improve the biodegradability of wastewater and reduce disinfection by products qi et al 2018 compared to polymeric membrane ceramic membrane can withstand the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals produced by ozone karnik et al 2005 therefore combination of pre ozonation and ceramic membrane separation has provided a promising avenue for mitigating organic fouling like proteins and polysaccharides fouling of ceramic membrane song et al 2018 2017 yin et al 2020 however studies of whether pre ozonation could mitigate biofouling of ceramic membrane are insufficient yet some studies have shown that ozone might aggravate biofouling of ceramic membrane by releasing intracellular organics and generating small organic compounds after oxidation liu et al 2018 meanwhile some studies have also shown that pre ozonation could mitigate the biofouling of ceramic membrane through changing the characteristics of foulants yu et al 2020 thus whether pre ozonation could alleviate the ceramic membrane biofouling and the underlying mechanism needs further systematical exploration in this work a comparative investigation into the effects of pre ozonation on early stage and late stage biofouling of ceramic membrane was performed dynamic biofouling experiments using a synthetic wastewater containing activated sludge were conducted in a cross flow system to evaluate the fouling performance of ceramic membrane with or without pre ozonation early stage biofouling behavior was extensively explored by in situ attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy late stage biofouling layer was related to the estimated ratio of live dead cells to elucidate the development of biofouling with or without pre ozonation additionally the evolution of biofouling on ceramic membrane surface over time with or without pre ozonation was thoroughly compared using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm image analysis and surface enhanced raman scattering sers coupled with principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis our findings reveal the negative effect of pre ozonation on early stage biofouling while positive effect on long term biofouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals circular disk shaped

and thickness 2 0 mm was inserted into the membrane system which consists of a 14 ml feed chamber and a 14 ml permeate chamber with an effective membrane area of 10 75 cm2 then di water was pumped into the feed chamber at a flow velocity of 6 52 0 13 l h and temperature of 25 1 c the initial pure water flux was obtained under the transmembrane pressure of 30 kpa which was supplied by compressed nitrogen and controlled by a pressure controller only the membranes with less than 5 pure water flux variation were selected for the subsequent biofouling experiments finally di water was replaced with the prepared feed solution followed by pumped into the feed chamber to initiate biofouling water and wastewater fluxes in the experiments were recorded every 2 min using an electronic balance which was connected to a computer via a hyperterminal software then the fouled membranes were immediately backwashed by di water at a flow velocity of 6 52 0 13 l h for 1 5 h under the transmembrane pressure of 30 kpa after the backwashing the pure water flux was re evaluated under the transmembrane pressure of 30 kpa to obtain the recovery rate in addition to evaluate the fouling propensity the unified membrane fouling index umfi was calculated as reported previously huang et al 2008 details about the calculation are given in supplementary materials after the filtration runs subsequent experiments were conducted to examine the influence of pre ozonation on ceramic membrane biofouling fig 1 2 3 in situ atr ftir observation on the interactions between e coli and ceramic membrane the interaction between ceramic membrane and a model microorganism e coli jm109 was measured using in situ fourier transform infrared spectrometer vetex 70 bruker co germany equipped with an external nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride mct detector and a znse crystal sample cell 50 10 3 mm 45 incident angle fig s2 the spectra were collected in the range of 800 2000 cm 1 with 32 scans averaged for each spectrum at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the ceramic membrane was ground into fine powder the powder was dispersed in di water to obtain a 0 1 wt suspension and then drop coated onto the znse crystal sample cell followed by oven drying at 40 c for 12 h later 1 ml of 0 9 nacl was added into the sample cell the spectra were recorded until they remained almost unchanged and the stable spectrum was used as the background spectrum afterwards the 0 9 nacl solution was replaced with 1 ml of e coli jm109 suspension 108 cfu ml 0 9 nacl and the spectra of the suspension were measured for 3 h for the e coli jm109 with pre ozonation o3 for 1 h the spectra were obtained in the same way as described above 2 4 analysis of dissolved organic matter of activated sludge activated sludge was first pre treated using 7 55 0 21 mg l o3 and then filtered using 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filters samples were taken for analysis of dissolved organic matter at pre ozonation time intervals of

means of spectra with standard deviation using in house procedures written in matlab r2021a the principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis pca lda was calculated by the irootlab toolbox http trevisanj github io irootlab run on matlab r2021a martin et al 2010 the elemental distribution of the cross section of the fouled membrane was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem with a high spatial resolution of x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds phenom prox phenom world bv netherlands before imaging the samples were initially fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer saline for 4 h followed by sequentially immersed in each water ethanol mixture 80 20 60 40 40 60 20 80 and 0 100 v v for 20 min after drying in air the samples were sputter coated with a thin

cake layers at the end of 3 and 10 h biofouling experiments with and without pre ozonation was performed by 16s rrna sequencing details about the 16s rrna sequencing are given in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiencies of pre ozonation in mitigating biofouling dynamic biofouling experiments were conducted using the feed solution as described above to directly evaluate the role of pre ozonation in biofouling of ceramic membrane identical hydrodynamic conditions of an initial water flux of 380 87 12 05 l m2 h and cross flow velocity at 6 52 0 13 l h were adapted in the 10 h biofouling experiments as shown in fig 2 a and s3 all ceramic membranes first exhibited a faster water flux decline and then a slower water flux decline in the biofouling tests however the control membrane exhibited a higher normalized flux in the initial 5 h compared to the 1 h and 2 h pre ozonation membranes suggesting that the membrane fouling was aggravated with pre ozonation in the initial 5 h besides the membranes with 1 h and 2 h pre ozonation displayed similar biofouling behaviors from 0 to 1 5 h implying that biofouling could not be alleviated in the initial 1 5 h even with a longer pre ozonation process nevertheless at the end of the filtration tests the normalized flux declined by 87 84 and 76 for the control 1 h pre ozonation and 2 h pre ozonation membranes respectively a higher extent of biofouling was found for the control membrane than that for the pre ozonation membranes to further quantify the biofouling potential of ceramic membrane with and without pre ozonation umfi values were calculated based on the filtration data in the current study the umfi values were determined from the plot of 1 js versus vs when the data exhibited linear regression fig 2b indicating the formation of cake layer whereas the nonlinear region corresponded to the pore blocking domination process huang et al 2008 typically a higher umfi value indicates a greater total membrane fouling during filtration the umfi value of control sample was 0 0131 obviously higher than the umfi values of 1 h pre ozonation 0 00426 and 2 h pre ozonation 0 00193 samples which indicates membrane filtration without pre ozonation experienced higher fouling extent in comparison with membrane filtration with pre ozonation in addition membrane with 2 h pre ozonation reduced the umfi value by 54 7 compared to that with 1 h pre ozonation suggesting an increase in pre ozonation time could further alleviate biofouling the cleaning efficiency of the membranes was tested to evaluate the effect of pre ozonation on the reversibility of biofouling at the end of 10 h biofouling runs backwashing with di water was immediately performed and water recovery rate was obtained as shown in fig s4 the flux recovery rate was higher for the membrane with pre ozonation 68 6 2 0 compared to that of membrane without pre ozonation 68 6 0 7 suggesting that the biofouling layer developed on the surface of ceramic membranes with pre ozonation was more easily disrupted by physical cleaning thus ceramic membrane with pre ozonation exhibited lower flux decline and greater cleaning efficiency than that without pre ozonation indicating that pre ozonation improve resistance to biofouling taken together in the long term operation pre ozonation was beneficial for mitigating ceramic membrane biofouling and an increase in pre ozonation time could further alleviate long term biofouling considering that biofouling processes mainly consist of three aspects namely initial attachment pore blocking and cake layer formation guo et al 2012 10 h was selected as the late stage to study the properties of cake layer based on the umfi analysis in addition 3 h was selected as the early stage based on the previous studies kastl et al 2020 yang et al 2020 where 2 4 h was chose to investigate the initial attachment of microorganism therefore 3 h and 10 h in the following sections refer to early stage and late stage respectively and vice versa 3 2 mechanisms of enhanced biofouling with pre ozonation at early stage biofouling at the early stage is substantially governed by the favorable interaction between membrane surface and foulants virtanen et al 2020 for example attachment of microbial cells onto the membrane surface is reported to be affected by the membrane surface charges functional groups and hydrophobicity etc kochkodan and hilal 2015 to investigate the initial attachment of foulants on ceramic membrane surface in situ atr ftir characterization was performed on a thin ceramic film using mct detector with e coli jm109 as the model microbial cells fig 3 a due to the complexity of wastewater and activated sludge especially the phosphate anion which could interfere the observation of dna e coli jm109 was adopted as the model microbial strain which was suspended in 0 9 nacl solution as depicted in fig 3a compared to the e coli attachment without pre ozonation the enhanced intensity of peaks at 1220 1230 cm 1 and 1080 1090 cm 1 could be attributed to po stretch in phosphates and phosphodiester elzinga et al 2012 parikh and chorover 2006 possibly due to the released dna and other phosphates group related species from e coli with pre ozonation treatment this result is consistent with the previous reports of the adsorption of phosphate on other al oxides such as α al2o3 del nero et al 2010 this result suggests that more released dna from cells attacked by ozone bound with al2o3 in addition the intensity of the peaks at 1125 cm 1 and 1060 cm 1 attributed to the vibrations of p o al coordination of inner sphere complexes also increased for the al2o3 surface attached with pre ozonated e coli relative to that without pre ozonated e coli calais et al 2015 hong et al 2018 suggesting the strong covalent interaction between the released dna and al2o3 surface therefore dna was likely to act as a priority adsorption specie to mediate the subsequent absorption of other substances higher amount of dna released from the cells after pre ozonation might aggravate the initial membrane fouling the peaks at 1650 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 were assigned to amide ⅰ mainly c o stretching of amides and amide ⅱ nh bending and cn stretching in amides respectively which are characteristic features for proteins mcclellan and franses 2005 the amide i band is associated with secondary structure of proteins while amide ⅱ band reflects the extent of proteins adsorption liu et al 2020 the amide i regions of e coli without pre ozonation and with 1 h pre ozonation on al2o3 surfaces after normalization by area are shown in fig 3b obviously the amide i band shifted to a higher wavenumber 1655 cm 1 for the e coli with pre ozonation in comparison to that of the e coli without pre ozonation this result indicates that pre ozonation could change the secondary structure of proteins thus the secondary structure of proteins was further quantitatively analyzed using second derivative analysis and peak fitting as presented in fig s5 and table 1 the proteins of e coli without pre ozonation on al2o3 surface comprised more abundant proteins with β sheet and random coil structures corresponding to a looser proteins structure in contrast a higher proportion of α helix structure of proteins was observed for the e coli with pre ozonation suggesting a more rigid and tight proteins structure maintained by hydrogen bonds hou et al 2015 liu et al 2020 this structure might be beneficial for forming a denser gel layer lei et al 2021 which resulted in a lower water permeability taken together these results demonstrate ozonation could alter the proteins secondary structure leading to more severe membrane fouling which is consistent with previous reports song et al 2018 3 3 cross section morphologies and elemental analysis at early stage of filtration the cross section morphological features of the fouled ceramic membranes after 3 h filtration with or without pre ozonation were imaged by sem as a control a clean ceramic membrane was also observed using sem fig s6 compared to the clean ceramic membrane fig s6a and the fouled ceramic membrane without pre ozonation fig s6b foulants were obviously adsorbed within the pores of the fouled ceramic membrane with pre ozonation red circle in fig s6c the relative elemental contents of the clean and fouled ceramic membranes were evaluated using edx mapping fig 4 a the carbon contents of the fouled ceramic membranes without pre ozonation and with pre ozonation were 11 09 1 19 and 18 17 2 86 respectively which were much higher than that of the clean ceramic membrane 7 85 1 19 correspondingly the aluminum contents of the ceramic membrane decreased from 24 88 0 23 to 20 76 1 15 after fouling as the cross section of ceramic membranes were covered by foulants the fouled ceramic membrane with pre ozonation exhibited the lowest aluminum content of 18 50 1 75 indicating the most severe biofouling among the three samples in addition the fouled ceramic membranes without pre ozonation and with pre ozonation displayed nitrogen contents of 5 46 0 46 and 5 79 0 63 respectively which were comparable to that of the clean ceramic membrane 4 46 0 26 these results indicate that after pre ozonation the carbon containing organic foulants were easily deposited on the cross section of ceramic membrane causing a more severe pore blockage in addition nitrogen containing organic foulants also slightly contributed to the pore blockage the increase in carbon and nitrogen containing organic foulants on the cross section of the membrane might come from the release of dissolved organic matter from bacteria in the feed solution after pre ozonation to judge this possibility the concentrations of polysaccharides proteins and dna critical substances responsible for the initial fouling in dissolved organic matter of activated sludge were measured as depicted in fig 3b the concentrations of all the three substances increased with the increasing ozonation time validating the release of intracellular substances of activated sludge after oxidation by ozone apart from the three substances humic acid as a main component of dissolved organic matter of activated sludge was also measured using eem spectra three main eem peaks are displayed in fig s7 the peaks with ex em of 265 450 nm and 340 445 nm were attributable to type a and type c of humic like substances respectively jacquin et al 2017 while the peak located at ex em of 276 363 nm corresponded to tryptophan like substances jacquin et al 2017 with the increase in ozonation time from 0 to 60 min the fluorescence intensity of these peaks increased suggesting that more humic acid and proteins were released from the activated sludge flocs to the supernatant after ozonation however after the ozonation time was prolonged from 60 min to 120 min the fluorescence intensity decreased this result might be ascribed to the decrease in the aromaticity of humic like structures zhang et al 2008 and the oxidation of the tryptophan group cataldo 2003 3 4 compositions of the cake layer at the late stage of filtration the compositions of the cake layer after 10 h filtration were stained and characterized using clsm more dead cells were observed in the cake layer of the ceramic membrane with pre ozonation compared to that without pre ozonation fig 5 a this result indicates that the microbial growth was inhibited and the residual ozone in the feed solution might sterilize the cells in the 10 h filtration in addition to cells proteins polysaccharides and dna of cake layers of the ceramic membranes with pre ozonation and without pre ozonation after 10 h filtration were also observed as shown in fig 5b and s8 polysaccharides and proteins were evenly distributed throughout the cake layers of both ceramic membranes while dna contents were higher at the bottom of cake layer than those on the surface of cake layer for the two membranes moreover the ceramic membrane with pre ozonation exhibited a relatively higher dna content these results further demonstrate that the dna could covalently bind onto the ceramic membrane surface and pre ozonation could enhance the covalent interaction which is in accordance with the observation using in situ ftir spectroscopy fig 3a 3 5 comparison of the structure of cake layers at early late stages to further investigate the effects of pre ozonation on the structure of cake layer in the 10 h filtration the variations in thickness and porosity of the cake layers with and without pre ozonation were compared at different filtration times the thickness of cake layer is directly proportional to permeate resistance as shown in fig 6 a the cake layer with pre ozonation at 3 h was thicker 46 36 3 52 μm compared to that without pre ozonation 39 06 3 97 μm however for the ceramic membrane without pre ozonation at 10 h the thickness of the cake layer was about 51 08 3 60 μm while it decreased to 40 27 2 45 μm after pre ozonation the contrast changes which were statistically significant based on a t test of thickness at the early and late stages were in accordance with the flux behaviors to say for the ceramic membrane with pre ozonation a lower normalized flux at the early stage while a higher normalized flux at the late stage was observed fig 2a it is worth noting that the cake layer with pre ozonation at 10 h was thinner than that at 3 h which was probably caused by the continuous compression under pressure polysaccharides as the main component of eps are widely believed to cause severe membrane fouling problem the α and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides have different biodegradability and play different roles in different biofouling process chen et al 2006 as shown in fig s9 β d glucopyranose polysaccharides corresponding closely to microbial cells particularly the dead cells had a much greater contribution to the cake resistance than the other three foulants yang et al 2012 while α d glucopyranose polysaccharides was weakly correlated to cells indicating a loose binding of free polysaccharides onto the cell membranes yang et al 2007 observations on the distribution of these polysaccharides imply that a higher distribution of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides was found with pre ozonation o3 3 h in comparison to that without pre ozonation control 3 h fig s9 this result further suggests a great role of the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in permeate resistance for the cake layers with or without pre ozonation the porosity of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides decreased at the late stage control 10 h and o3 10 h relative to the early stage control 3 h and o3 3 h leading to a higher permeate resistance this can be used to reasonably explain the lower normalized flux observed at the late stage fig 2a the decreased porosity at the late stage also implies a structure compression under pressure ng and ng 2010 furthermore the pre ozonation decreased the porosity of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides for the cake layer o3 3 h at the early stage stemming from the decomposition of cell membrane by ozone oxidation this result could be ascribed to the conversion of bound polysaccharides mainly β d glucopyranose polysaccharides into free polysaccharides chen et al 2006 leading to the decreased porosity of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and the further increased membrane fouling with pre ozonation at the early stage in contrast the total porosity fig 6b and distribution fig s9 of polysaccharides exhibited a negligible change at the late stage with or without pre ozonation suggesting the contribution of polysaccharides to the development of cake layer was limited this warrants further investigations the porosity of dna became declined for the cake layer with pre ozonation at the early stage leading to a denser dna layer formation supporting the more severe fouling observed at this stage the denser dna layer was associated with more released extracellular dna from microbial cells after ozone oxidation the extracellular dna was further compressed under the transmembrane pressure resulting in a lower porosity of the cake layer with pre ozonation at 10 h fig 6b the change of proteins also displayed the same trend as other substances specifically compared with the cake layer without pre ozonation control 3 h the porosity of proteins for the cake layer with pre ozonation decreased at the early stage o3 3 h suggesting a tighter structure of proteins formed after pre ozonation the structure of proteins changed from β sheet and random coil to rigid and tight α helix after pre ozonation table 1 with the further filtration the porosity of proteins decreased at the late stage from 72 35 for control 3 h to 61 65 for control 10 h suggesting a denser structure of proteins formed at the late stage biofouling started from the initial deposition of free polysaccharides extracellular dna and rigid proteins on the ceramic membrane surface forming a thicker cake layer such a deposition could be enhanced after ozone oxidation which could convert bond polysaccharides to free ones increase the content of extracellular dna from microbial cells and change the structure of proteins thereby a thicker cake layer and a correspondingly higher permeate resistance were formed with pre ozonation at the early stage the evolution of the accumulated cake layer was mainly governed by the chemical compositions of feed solution and pressure it was proposed that the residual ozone in the feed solution could continuously sterilize microbial cells and the dead cells were compressed onto membrane surface under pressure forming a thinner cake layer 3 6 comparison of chemical compositions of cake layers at early late stages to further investigate the chemical compositions of cake layer sers spectroscopic characterization was performed the characteristic raman bands of the three substances polysaccharides dna and proteins could be identified in the region of 400 1800 cm 1 fig 7 the narrow corona in fig 7a proves that the spectral variation was negligibly affected by the heterogeneity of both biofilm and sers enhancement using thick silver sol fig 7b maps the relevant band intensities using collected spectra from an area of 20 μm 20 μm with a 2 μm step size higher raman bands at 1325 730 and 654 cm 1 were observed at the late stage with or without pre ozonation fig 7a which could be ascribed to the adenosine and guanosine related molecules of dna cui et al 2015 ivleva et al 2010 this result is consistent with the previous study in which higher edna related peaks were observed in mature biofilm and biofouling layer chao and zhang 2012 cui et al 2015 the cake layer with pre ozonation at 3 h had lower dna related peaks compared to the cake layer without pre ozonation fig 7b indicating an inhibition of microbial growth by ozone when the sers detection was performed within 3 nm the raman bands at 430 and 555 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o c glycosidic ring deformation and skeletal modes cc ccc ring deformation in dextran fig 7a respectively cui et al 2015 ivleva et al 2010 in addition the band at 1383 cm 1 could be attributable to coo symmetric stretching in polysaccharides fig 7a ivleva et al 2008 2010 the intensities of the two polysaccharides related bands were lower at the late stage compared to that at the early stage with or without pre ozonation fig 7b further demonstrating that polysaccharides were involved in the formation of cake layer at the early stage chen et al 2016 lei et al 2021 li et al 2021 the raman bands at 1690 1615 and 1000 cm 1 were assigned to the amide i and ring breathe of phenylalanine cui et al 2015 ivleva et al 2010 respectively during the development of the cake layer these bands displayed different changes specifically the band at 1690 cm 1 increased while the bands at 1615 and 1000 cm 1 decreased over time for the cake layer without pre ozonation fig 7a due to the sensitivity of sers proteins can be distinguished by different bands such as amide i 1615 cm 1 and phenylalanine 1000 cm 1 cui et al 2015 2011 for the cake layer with pre ozonation the band of amide i decreased at the early stage compared to the cake layer without pre ozonation fig 7b while this band enhanced at the late stage for the cake layer with pre ozonation the change of phenylalanine displayed the same trend as amide i these results indicate that proteins varied a lot in types and contents with the development of cake layer to further evaluate the differences of chemical compositions of cake layer pca lda analysis was performed based on the sers spectra fig 7c the differences of chemical compositions between the different cake layers became relatively larger at the late stage in comparison to those at the early stage this result indicates the microbial community of the cake layer might have been changed at the late stage with pre ozonation which could be used to explain the diversity of proteins observed in the cake layers fig 7b the change of the microbial community at the late stage with pre ozonation was verified by 16s rrna analysis as shown in fig s10 after pre ozonation the differences of the microbial community of the cake layer became larger for the 10 h sample compared to the 3 h sample consistent with the results of the chemical composition in addition proteobacteria which has been reported to play a pioneering role in cake layer formation ishizaki et al 2016 was the most dominant phylum in the cake layer after pre ozonation the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria increased which might contribute to the severer membrane fouling after pre ozonation at early stage 4 conclusions the role of pre ozonation in ceramic membrane biofouling is explored in this work at the early stage pre ozonation aggravated biofouling through forming a thicker cake layer caused by the stronger covalent interaction between the phosphate group from dna and al2o3 of ceramic membrane surface the more rigid proteins structure and the more severe pore blockage on the contrary pre ozonation could alleviate biofouling at the late stage by inhibiting the microbial growth to form a relatively thinner cake layer with a higher quantity of dead cells on ceramic membrane surface which are easily disrupted by water backwashing this results in a higher water recovery rate this work provides a new insight into the development of biofouling on ceramic membrane with pre ozonation highlights the spatial and temporal differences of fouling layer thereby guiding the design of more effective methods to apply pre ozonation for alleviating ceramic membrane biofouling especially in ceramic membrane bioreactor mbr processes longer term experiments in ceramic mbr should be systematically conducted to evaluate the effect of pre

15853,pre ozonation coupled with ceramic membrane filtration has been widely used to alleviate membrane fouling however information on the efficiency and underlying mechanism of pre ozonation in the evolution of ceramic membrane biofouling is limited herein filtration experiments with a synthesis wastewater containing activated sludge were conducted in a cross flow system to evaluate the effects of pre ozonation on ceramic membrane biofouling results of flux tests show that pre ozonation aggravated biofouling at the early stage but alleviated the biofouling at the late stage in situ ftir spectra show that the aggravated biofouling with pre ozonation was mainly caused by the enhanced complexation between phosphate group from dna and al2o3 surface and the increased rigid of proteins structure at the early stage more severe pore blockage further substantiated the higher permeate resistance by contrast more dead cells were observed on membrane surface at the late stage indicating the prevention of biofouling development after long term pre ozonation additionally the structures and compositions of cake layers at the early and late stages exhibited considerable differences accompanied by the variation in microbial community with the evolution of biofouling therefore this work demonstrates the effectiveness of pre ozonation in biofouling in long term operation and provides mechanistic insights into the evolution of biofouling on ceramic membrane graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane biofouling pre ozonation in situ spectroscopy mechanism 1 introduction ceramic membrane filtration is widely applied in water and wastewater treatment due to its thermal stability and long term resistance to chemicals in the last decade li et al 2020 merlet et al 2020 however like polymeric membranes ceramic membranes are also vulnerable to fouling in filtration applications which imposes harmful effects on its performance membrane fouling organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling leads to critical decline of permeate flux that compromises the efficiency of ceramic membrane filtration in practice blanpain avet et al 2011 yue et al 2015 particularly biofouling especially the complex and poorly understood is the most detrimental problem for ceramic membranes due to the built up of biofouling layer on membrane surface and the pore blockage blanpain avet et al 2011 liu et al 2018 the biofouling formation comprises deposition adhesion metabolism growth and proliferation of microbial cells or flocs on the membranes aslam et al 2018 meng et al 2009 at the initial stage of filtration biofouling is mainly governed by the initial adhesion of microorganisms on the membrane surface the initial adhesion is closely associated with the physicochemical properties of microbial cells and membranes wang et al 2005 including covalent and non covalent interactions the non covalent interactions between ceramic membrane and microorganisms include van der waals force lewis acid base force and electrostatic force traditionally described by dlvo or xdlvo theory combined with contact angle and zeta potential ying et al 2010 the covalent interactions are often ignored in polymeric membrane microorganism interactions but for the ceramic membrane composed of metal oxide they should not be overlooked for example it was reported that pyoverdine a siderophore produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa can simultaneously bind covalently to iron iii oxides and to tio2 mcwhirter et al 2003 phosphate groups and carboxyl groups were also found to play a main role in the covalent interaction between microorganisms and metal oxide elzinga et al 2012 hong et al 2018 overall the covalent interactions between ceramic membrane and microbial cells in biofouling should be intensively investigated to elucidate the underlying mechanism the composition and structure of cake layer also play an important role in membrane permeation flux especially with the accumulation of microbial cells on the surface of ceramic membrane microbial cells release extracellular polymeric substances whose main components are proteins polysaccharides and humic substances adsorbing onto the membrane surface and thus aggravating membrane fouling for example polysaccharides are reported to form a gel layer on membrane surface which is hard to clean especially after the complexation with inorganic ions present in feed solution such as calcium ions chen et al 2016 li et al 2021 protein based fouling occurs by the interactions like electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding with membrane surface at the early stage of membrane fouling followed by protein protein and protein membrane interactions huisman et al 2000 song et al 2018 in addition due to the porosity of membrane the impact of pore blockage caused by small compounds on membrane filtration performance should not be overlooked lin et al 2009 pre ozonation is an efficient means to alleviate membrane fouling song et al 2017 except for alleviating membrane fouling pre ozonation can also improve the biodegradability of wastewater and reduce disinfection by products qi et al 2018 compared to polymeric membrane ceramic membrane can withstand the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals produced by ozone karnik et al 2005 therefore combination of pre ozonation and ceramic membrane separation has provided a promising avenue for mitigating organic fouling like proteins and polysaccharides fouling of ceramic membrane song et al 2018 2017 yin et al 2020 however studies of whether pre ozonation could mitigate biofouling of ceramic membrane are insufficient yet some studies have shown that ozone might aggravate biofouling of ceramic membrane by releasing intracellular organics and generating small organic compounds after oxidation liu et al 2018 meanwhile some studies have also shown that pre ozonation could mitigate the biofouling of ceramic membrane through changing the characteristics of foulants yu et al 2020 thus whether pre ozonation could alleviate the ceramic membrane biofouling and the underlying mechanism needs further systematical exploration in this work a comparative investigation into the effects of pre ozonation on early stage and late stage biofouling of ceramic membrane was performed dynamic biofouling experiments using a synthetic wastewater containing activated sludge were conducted in a cross flow system to evaluate the fouling performance of ceramic membrane with or without pre ozonation early stage biofouling behavior was extensively explored by in situ attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy late stage biofouling layer was related to the estimated ratio of live dead cells to elucidate the development of biofouling with or without pre ozonation additionally the evolution of biofouling on ceramic membrane surface over time with or without pre ozonation was thoroughly compared using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm image analysis and surface enhanced raman scattering sers coupled with principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis our findings reveal the negative effect of pre ozonation on early stage biofouling while positive effect on long term biofouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals circular disk shaped

and thickness 2 0 mm was inserted into the membrane system which consists of a 14 ml feed chamber and a 14 ml permeate chamber with an effective membrane area of 10 75 cm2 then di water was pumped into the feed chamber at a flow velocity of 6 52 0 13 l h and temperature of 25 1 c the initial pure water flux was obtained under the transmembrane pressure of 30 kpa which was supplied by compressed nitrogen and controlled by a pressure controller only the membranes with less than 5 pure water flux variation were selected for the subsequent biofouling experiments finally di water was replaced with the prepared feed solution followed by pumped into the feed chamber to initiate biofouling water and wastewater fluxes in the experiments were recorded every 2 min using an electronic balance which was connected to a computer via a hyperterminal software then the fouled membranes were immediately backwashed by di water at a flow velocity of 6 52 0 13 l h for 1 5 h under the transmembrane pressure of 30 kpa after the backwashing the pure water flux was re evaluated under the transmembrane pressure of 30 kpa to obtain the recovery rate in addition to evaluate the fouling propensity the unified membrane fouling index umfi was calculated as reported previously huang et al 2008 details about the calculation are given in supplementary materials after the filtration runs subsequent experiments were conducted to examine the influence of pre ozonation on ceramic membrane biofouling fig 1 2 3 in situ atr ftir observation on the interactions between e coli and ceramic membrane the interaction between ceramic membrane and a model microorganism e coli jm109 was measured using in situ fourier transform infrared spectrometer vetex 70 bruker co germany equipped with an external nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride mct detector and a znse crystal sample cell 50 10 3 mm 45 incident angle fig s2 the spectra were collected in the range of 800 2000 cm 1 with 32 scans averaged for each spectrum at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the ceramic membrane was ground into fine powder the powder was dispersed in di water to obtain a 0 1 wt suspension and then drop coated onto the znse crystal sample cell followed by oven drying at 40 c for 12 h later 1 ml of 0 9 nacl was added into the sample cell the spectra were recorded until they remained almost unchanged and the stable spectrum was used as the background spectrum afterwards the 0 9 nacl solution was replaced with 1 ml of e coli jm109 suspension 108 cfu ml 0 9 nacl and the spectra of the suspension were measured for 3 h for the e coli jm109 with pre ozonation o3 for 1 h the spectra were obtained in the same way as described above 2 4 analysis of dissolved organic matter of activated sludge activated sludge was

respectively details on the clsm analysis protocol are given in supplementary materials the chemical composition analysis of the cake layers at the end of 3 and 10 h biofouling experiments was acquired from sers spectra before collecting spectra 16 ml aggregated silver sol was filtered onto the fouled ceramic membrane under 0 1 mpa to enhance the raman scattering details about the aggregated silver sol synthesis are provided in supplementary materials then sers spectra were measured using a confocal micro raman spectrometer horiba co japan equipped with a he ne 632 8 nm

the sers spectra were baseline corrected and normalized by area via labspec 6 5 1 software horiba co japan followed by removing the background signal from the ceramic membrane and calculating the means of spectra with standard deviation using in house procedures written in matlab r2021a the principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis pca lda was calculated by the irootlab toolbox http trevisanj github io irootlab run on matlab r2021a martin et al 2010 the elemental distribution of the cross section of the fouled membrane was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem with a high spatial resolution of x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds phenom prox phenom world bv netherlands before imaging the samples were initially fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde in phosphate

cake layers at the end of 3 and 10 h biofouling experiments with and without pre ozonation was performed by 16s rrna sequencing details about the 16s rrna sequencing are given in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiencies of pre ozonation in mitigating biofouling dynamic biofouling experiments were conducted using the feed solution as described above to directly evaluate the role of pre ozonation in biofouling of ceramic membrane identical hydrodynamic conditions of an initial water flux of 380 87 12 05 l m2 h and cross flow velocity at 6 52 0 13 l h were adapted in the 10 h biofouling experiments as shown in fig 2 a and s3 all ceramic membranes first exhibited a faster water flux decline and then a slower water flux decline in the biofouling tests however the control membrane exhibited a higher normalized flux in the initial 5 h compared to the 1 h and 2 h pre ozonation membranes suggesting that the membrane fouling was aggravated with pre ozonation in the initial 5 h besides the membranes with 1 h and 2 h pre ozonation displayed similar biofouling behaviors from 0 to 1 5 h implying that biofouling could not be alleviated in the initial 1 5 h even with a longer pre ozonation process nevertheless at the end of the filtration tests the normalized flux declined by 87 84 and 76 for the control 1 h pre ozonation and 2 h pre ozonation membranes respectively a higher extent of biofouling was found for the control membrane than that for the pre ozonation membranes to further quantify the biofouling potential of ceramic membrane with and without pre ozonation umfi values were calculated based on the filtration data in the current study the umfi values were determined from the plot of 1 js versus vs when the data exhibited linear regression fig 2b indicating the formation of cake layer whereas the nonlinear region corresponded to the pore blocking domination process huang et al 2008 typically a higher umfi value indicates a greater total membrane fouling during filtration the umfi value of control sample was 0 0131 obviously higher than the umfi values of 1 h pre ozonation 0 00426 and 2 h pre ozonation 0 00193 samples which indicates membrane filtration without pre ozonation experienced higher fouling extent in comparison with membrane filtration with pre ozonation in addition membrane with 2 h pre ozonation reduced the umfi value by 54 7 compared to that with 1 h pre ozonation suggesting an increase in pre ozonation time could further alleviate biofouling the cleaning efficiency of the membranes was tested to evaluate the effect of pre ozonation on the reversibility of biofouling at the end of 10 h biofouling runs backwashing with di water was immediately performed and water recovery rate was obtained as shown in fig s4 the flux recovery rate was higher for the membrane with pre ozonation 68 6 2 0 compared to that of membrane without pre ozonation 68 6 0 7 suggesting that the biofouling layer developed on the surface of ceramic membranes with pre ozonation was more easily disrupted by physical cleaning thus ceramic membrane with pre ozonation exhibited lower flux decline and greater cleaning efficiency than that without pre ozonation indicating that pre ozonation improve resistance to biofouling taken together in the long term operation pre ozonation was beneficial for mitigating ceramic membrane biofouling and an increase in pre ozonation time could further alleviate long term biofouling considering that biofouling processes mainly consist of three aspects namely initial attachment pore blocking and cake layer formation guo et al 2012 10 h was selected as the late stage to study the properties of cake layer based on the umfi analysis in addition 3 h was selected as the early stage based on the previous studies kastl et al 2020 yang et al 2020 where 2 4 h was chose to investigate the initial attachment of microorganism therefore 3 h and 10 h in the following sections refer to early stage and late stage respectively and vice versa 3 2 mechanisms of enhanced biofouling with pre ozonation at early stage biofouling at the early stage is substantially governed by the favorable interaction between membrane surface and foulants virtanen et al 2020 for example attachment of microbial cells onto the membrane surface is reported to be affected by the membrane surface charges functional groups and hydrophobicity etc kochkodan and hilal 2015 to investigate the initial attachment of foulants on ceramic membrane surface in situ atr ftir characterization was performed on a thin ceramic film using mct detector with e coli jm109 as the model microbial cells fig 3 a due to the complexity of wastewater and activated sludge especially the phosphate anion which could interfere the observation of dna e coli jm109 was adopted as the model microbial strain which was suspended in 0 9 nacl solution as depicted in fig 3a compared to the e coli attachment without pre ozonation the enhanced intensity of peaks at 1220 1230 cm 1 and 1080 1090 cm 1 could be attributed to po stretch in phosphates and phosphodiester elzinga et al 2012 parikh and chorover 2006 possibly due to the released dna and other phosphates group related species from e coli with pre ozonation treatment this result is consistent with the previous reports of the adsorption of phosphate on other al oxides such as α al2o3 del nero et al 2010 this result suggests that more released dna from cells attacked by ozone bound with al2o3 in addition the intensity of the peaks at 1125 cm 1 and 1060 cm 1 attributed to the vibrations of p o al coordination of inner sphere complexes also increased for the al2o3 surface attached with pre ozonated e coli relative to that without pre ozonated e coli calais et al 2015 hong et al 2018 suggesting the strong covalent interaction between the released dna and al2o3 surface therefore dna was likely to act as a priority adsorption specie to mediate the subsequent absorption of other substances higher amount of dna released from the cells after pre ozonation might aggravate the initial membrane fouling the peaks at 1650 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 were assigned to amide ⅰ mainly c o stretching of amides and amide ⅱ nh bending and cn stretching in amides respectively which are characteristic features for proteins mcclellan and franses 2005 the amide i band is associated with secondary structure of proteins while amide ⅱ band reflects the extent of proteins adsorption liu et al 2020 the amide i regions of e coli without pre ozonation and with 1 h pre ozonation on al2o3 surfaces after normalization by area are shown in fig 3b obviously the amide i band shifted to a higher wavenumber 1655 cm 1 for the e coli with pre ozonation in comparison to that of the e coli without pre ozonation this result indicates that pre ozonation could change the secondary structure of proteins thus the secondary structure of proteins was further quantitatively analyzed using second derivative analysis and peak fitting as presented in fig s5 and table 1 the proteins of e coli without pre ozonation on al2o3 surface comprised more abundant proteins with β sheet and random coil structures corresponding to a looser proteins structure in contrast a higher proportion of α helix structure of proteins was observed for the e coli with pre ozonation suggesting a more rigid and tight proteins structure maintained by hydrogen bonds hou et al 2015 liu et al 2020 this structure might be beneficial for forming a denser gel layer lei et al 2021 which resulted in a lower water permeability taken together these results demonstrate ozonation could alter the proteins secondary structure leading to more severe membrane fouling which is consistent with previous reports song et al 2018 3 3 cross section morphologies and elemental analysis at early stage of filtration the cross section morphological features of the fouled ceramic membranes after 3 h filtration with or without pre ozonation were imaged by sem as a control a clean ceramic membrane was also observed using sem fig s6 compared to the clean ceramic membrane fig s6a and the fouled ceramic membrane without pre ozonation fig s6b foulants were obviously adsorbed within the pores of the fouled ceramic membrane with pre ozonation red circle in fig s6c the relative elemental contents of the clean and fouled ceramic membranes were evaluated using edx mapping fig 4 a the carbon contents of the fouled ceramic membranes without pre ozonation and with pre ozonation were 11 09 1 19 and 18 17 2 86 respectively which were much higher than that of the clean ceramic membrane 7 85 1 19 correspondingly the aluminum contents of the ceramic membrane decreased from 24 88 0 23 to 20 76 1 15 after fouling as the cross section of ceramic membranes were covered by foulants the fouled ceramic membrane with pre ozonation exhibited the lowest aluminum content of 18 50 1 75 indicating the most severe biofouling among the three samples in addition the fouled ceramic membranes without pre ozonation and with pre ozonation displayed nitrogen contents of 5 46 0 46 and 5 79 0 63 respectively which were comparable to that of the clean ceramic membrane 4 46 0 26 these results indicate that after pre ozonation the carbon containing organic foulants were easily deposited on the cross section of ceramic membrane causing a more severe pore blockage in addition nitrogen containing organic foulants also slightly contributed to the pore blockage the increase in carbon and nitrogen containing organic foulants on the cross section of the membrane might come from the release of dissolved organic matter from bacteria in the feed solution after pre ozonation to judge this possibility the concentrations of polysaccharides proteins and dna critical substances responsible for the initial fouling in dissolved organic matter of activated sludge were measured as depicted in fig 3b the concentrations of all the three substances increased with the increasing ozonation time validating the release of intracellular substances of activated sludge after oxidation by ozone apart from the three substances humic acid as a main component of dissolved organic matter of activated sludge was also measured using eem spectra three main eem peaks are displayed in fig s7 the peaks with ex em of 265 450 nm and 340 445 nm were attributable to type a and type c of humic like substances respectively jacquin et al 2017 while the peak located at ex em of 276 363 nm corresponded to tryptophan like substances jacquin et al 2017 with the increase in ozonation time from 0 to 60 min the fluorescence intensity of these peaks increased suggesting that more humic acid and proteins were released from the activated sludge flocs to the supernatant after ozonation however after the ozonation time was prolonged from 60 min to 120 min the fluorescence intensity decreased this result might be ascribed to the decrease in the aromaticity of humic like structures zhang et al 2008 and the oxidation of the tryptophan group cataldo 2003 3 4 compositions of the cake layer at the late stage of filtration the compositions of the cake layer after 10 h filtration were stained and characterized using clsm more dead cells were observed in the cake layer of the ceramic membrane with pre ozonation compared to that without pre ozonation fig 5 a this result indicates that the microbial growth was inhibited and the residual ozone in the feed solution might sterilize the cells in the 10 h filtration in addition to cells proteins polysaccharides and dna of cake layers of the ceramic membranes with pre ozonation and without pre ozonation after 10 h filtration were also observed as shown in fig 5b and s8 polysaccharides and proteins were evenly distributed throughout the cake layers of both ceramic membranes while dna contents were higher at the bottom of cake layer than those on the surface of cake layer for the two membranes moreover the ceramic membrane with pre ozonation exhibited a relatively higher dna content these results further demonstrate that the dna could covalently bind onto the ceramic membrane surface and pre ozonation could enhance the covalent interaction which is in accordance with the observation using in situ ftir spectroscopy fig 3a 3 5 comparison of the structure of cake layers at early late stages to further investigate the effects of pre ozonation on the structure of cake layer in the 10 h filtration the variations in thickness and porosity of the cake layers with and without pre ozonation were compared at different filtration times the thickness of cake layer is directly proportional to permeate resistance as shown in fig 6 a the cake layer with pre ozonation at 3 h was thicker 46 36 3 52 μm compared to that without pre ozonation 39 06 3 97 μm however for the ceramic membrane without pre ozonation at 10 h the thickness of the cake layer was about 51 08 3 60 μm while it decreased to 40 27 2 45 μm after pre ozonation the contrast changes which were statistically significant based on a t test of thickness at the early and late stages were in accordance with the flux behaviors to say for the ceramic membrane with pre ozonation a lower normalized flux at the early stage while a higher normalized flux at the late stage was observed fig 2a it is worth noting that the cake layer with pre ozonation at 10 h was thinner than that at 3 h which was probably caused by the continuous compression under pressure polysaccharides as the main component of eps are widely believed to cause severe membrane fouling problem the α and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides have different biodegradability and play different roles in different biofouling process chen et al 2006 as shown in fig s9 β d glucopyranose polysaccharides corresponding closely to microbial cells particularly the dead cells had a much greater contribution to the cake resistance than the other three foulants yang et al 2012 while α d glucopyranose polysaccharides was weakly correlated to cells indicating a loose binding of free polysaccharides onto the cell membranes yang et al 2007 observations on the distribution of these polysaccharides imply that a higher distribution of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides was found with pre ozonation o3 3 h in comparison to that without pre ozonation control 3 h fig s9 this result further suggests a great role of the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in permeate resistance for the cake layers with or without pre ozonation the porosity of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides decreased at the late stage control 10 h and o3 10 h relative to the early stage control 3 h and o3 3 h leading to a higher permeate resistance this can be used to reasonably explain the lower normalized flux observed at the late stage fig 2a the decreased porosity at the late stage also implies a structure compression under pressure ng and ng 2010 furthermore the pre ozonation decreased the porosity of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides for the cake layer o3 3 h at the early stage stemming from the decomposition of cell membrane by ozone oxidation this result could be ascribed to the conversion of bound polysaccharides mainly β d glucopyranose polysaccharides into free polysaccharides chen et al 2006 leading to the decreased porosity of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and the further increased membrane fouling with pre ozonation at the early stage in contrast the total porosity fig 6b and distribution fig s9 of polysaccharides exhibited a negligible change at the late stage with or without pre ozonation suggesting the contribution of polysaccharides to the development of cake layer was limited this warrants further investigations the porosity of dna became declined for the cake layer with pre ozonation at the early stage leading to a denser dna layer formation supporting the more severe fouling observed at this stage the denser dna layer was associated with more released extracellular dna from microbial cells after ozone oxidation the extracellular dna was further compressed under the transmembrane pressure resulting in a lower porosity of the cake layer with pre ozonation at 10 h fig 6b the change of proteins also displayed the same trend as other substances specifically compared with the cake layer without pre ozonation control 3 h the porosity of proteins for the cake layer with pre ozonation decreased at the early stage o3 3 h suggesting a tighter structure of proteins formed after pre ozonation the structure of proteins changed from β sheet and random coil to rigid and tight α helix after pre ozonation table 1 with the further filtration the porosity of proteins decreased at the late stage from 72 35 for control 3 h to 61 65 for control 10 h suggesting a denser structure of proteins formed at the late stage biofouling started from the initial deposition of free polysaccharides extracellular dna and rigid proteins on the ceramic membrane surface forming a thicker cake layer such a deposition could be enhanced after ozone oxidation which could convert bond polysaccharides to free ones increase the content of extracellular dna from microbial cells and change the structure of proteins thereby a thicker cake layer and a correspondingly higher permeate resistance were formed with pre ozonation at the early stage the evolution of the accumulated cake layer was mainly governed by the chemical compositions of feed solution and pressure it was proposed that the residual ozone in the feed solution could continuously sterilize microbial cells and the dead cells were compressed onto membrane surface under pressure forming a thinner cake layer 3 6 comparison of chemical compositions of cake layers at early late stages to further investigate the chemical compositions of cake layer sers spectroscopic characterization was performed the characteristic raman bands of the three substances polysaccharides dna and proteins could be identified in the region of 400 1800 cm 1 fig 7 the narrow corona in fig 7a proves that the spectral variation was negligibly affected by the heterogeneity of both biofilm and sers enhancement using thick silver sol fig 7b maps the relevant band intensities using collected spectra from an area of 20 μm 20 μm with a 2 μm step size higher raman bands at 1325 730 and 654 cm 1 were observed at the late stage with or without pre ozonation fig 7a which could be ascribed to the adenosine and guanosine related molecules of dna cui et al 2015 ivleva et al 2010 this result is consistent with the previous study in which higher edna related peaks were observed in mature biofilm and biofouling layer chao and zhang 2012 cui et al 2015 the cake layer with pre ozonation at 3 h had lower dna related peaks compared to the cake layer without pre ozonation fig 7b indicating an inhibition of microbial growth by ozone when the sers detection was performed within 3 nm the raman bands at 430 and 555 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o c glycosidic ring deformation and skeletal modes cc ccc ring deformation in dextran fig 7a respectively cui et al 2015 ivleva et al 2010 in addition the band at 1383 cm 1 could be attributable to coo symmetric stretching in polysaccharides fig 7a ivleva et al 2008 2010 the intensities of the two polysaccharides related bands were lower at the late stage compared to that at the early stage with or without pre ozonation fig 7b further demonstrating that polysaccharides were involved in the formation of cake layer at the early stage chen et al 2016 lei et al 2021 li et al 2021 the raman bands at 1690 1615 and 1000 cm 1 were assigned to the amide i and ring breathe of phenylalanine cui et al 2015 ivleva et al 2010 respectively during the development of the cake layer these bands displayed different changes specifically the band at 1690 cm 1 increased while the bands at 1615 and 1000 cm 1 decreased over time for the cake layer without pre ozonation fig 7a due to the sensitivity of sers proteins can be distinguished by different bands such as amide i 1615 cm 1 and phenylalanine 1000 cm 1 cui et al 2015 2011 for the cake layer with pre ozonation the band of amide i decreased at the early stage compared to the cake layer without pre ozonation fig 7b while this band enhanced at the late stage for the cake layer with pre ozonation the change of phenylalanine displayed the same trend as amide i these results indicate that proteins varied a lot in types and contents with the development of cake layer to further evaluate the differences of chemical compositions of cake layer pca lda analysis was performed based on the sers spectra fig 7c the differences of chemical compositions between the different cake layers became relatively larger at the late stage in comparison to those at the early stage this result indicates the microbial community of the cake layer might have been changed at the late stage with pre ozonation which could be used to explain the diversity of proteins observed in the cake layers fig 7b the change of the microbial community at the late stage with pre ozonation was verified by 16s rrna analysis as shown in fig s10 after pre ozonation the differences of the microbial community of the cake layer became larger for the 10 h sample compared to the 3 h sample consistent with the results of the chemical composition in addition proteobacteria which has been reported to play a pioneering role in cake layer formation ishizaki et al 2016 was the most dominant phylum in the cake layer after pre ozonation the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria increased which might contribute to the severer membrane fouling after pre ozonation at early stage 4 conclusions the role of pre ozonation in ceramic membrane biofouling is explored in this work at the early stage pre ozonation aggravated biofouling through forming a thicker cake layer caused by the stronger covalent interaction between the phosphate group from dna and al2o3 of ceramic membrane surface the more rigid proteins structure and the more severe pore blockage on the contrary pre ozonation could alleviate biofouling at the late stage by inhibiting the microbial growth to form a relatively thinner cake layer with a higher quantity of dead cells on ceramic membrane surface which are easily disrupted by water backwashing this results in a higher water recovery rate this work provides a new insight into the development of biofouling on ceramic membrane with pre ozonation highlights the spatial and temporal differences of fouling layer thereby guiding the design of more effective methods to apply pre ozonation for alleviating ceramic membrane biofouling especially in ceramic membrane bioreactor mbr processes longer term experiments in ceramic mbr should be systematically conducted to evaluate the effect of pre ozonation on biofouling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

15854,in this work peracetic acid paa ultraviolet uv paa and ultrasonic us paa pre oxidation were applied to enhance ultrafiltration uf performance during algae laden water treatment the results showed that 10 mg l paa exhibiting an optimal performance with membrane fouling resistance reduced by 76 26 low dosage of uv paa can effectively control fouling by enhancing the degradation of dissolved organics though more radicals were generated with the increasing dosage of paa during the uv paa process flux deterioration was occurred when paa dosage over 10 mg l owing to a negative correlation between fouling resistance and algal integrity loss compared with uv us exhibited a worse activation effect on paa with less reactive radicals produced even worse us can stimulate the stress metabolism of algal cells with slightly integrity loss which then resulted in an exacerbation of permeate quality fouling mechanism analysis revealed that the delay formation of cake layer with membrane fouling alleviation mainly through efficient degradation of macromolecular organics the investigation of synergistic and individual effect of eom degradation algae rupture and iom release on the filtration performance revealed that eom degradation was the primary mechanism for fouling control while algae rupture rather than iom release was crucial for membrane fouling aggravation this indicates that moderate oxidation with property of high organic degradation and low cell rupture was the working principal and objectives for algae laden water treatment additionally it was found that the oh radicals produced during uv paa process can efficiently degrade representative odors in general pretreatments of paa and low dosages of uv paa showed promising prospects in improving the uf

laden water treatment due to its high efficiency for algal cells rejection zhu et al 2022b nevertheless membrane fouling caused by algae cells and algae derived organic matters is the major obstacle for the extensive application of uf technology li et al 2014c to address the algal derived membrane fouling issues various pretreatment strategies have been explored in recent decades such as pre coagulation alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 zhu et al 2022a pre adsorption li et al 2014a and pre oxidation cheng et al 2022 wan et al 2019 among them pre oxidation is an attractive option because it can minimize the fouling tendency by altering the structure of organic components liu et al 2018 consequently a variety of oxidation strategies were utilized such as ozone liu et al 2018 kmno4 qu et al 2015 ferrate fe vi he et al 2021b fe2 persulfate liu et al 2017a fe2 calcium peroxide cheng et al 2022 ultraviolet uv persulfate wan et al 2019 uv h2o2 wan et al 2019 uv chlorine xing et al 2018 and satisfactory performances for fouling control were achieved however some studies highlighted that the oxidation pre treatment may also aggravate membrane fouling because it can cause serious algal cell breakage and promote the release of intracellular organic matter iom liu et al 2018 wan et al 2019 xie et al 2013 zhou et al 2014b hence we need to clarity the multiple effect of pre oxidation on

efficiently inactivate the algal cells mainly by destroying the proteins lipids and nucleic acids functional groups cao et al 2022 although there is no report about us ppa for algae laden water

respectively liu et al 2020 2 4 fouling contribution qualitative assessment in general oxidation of algae laden water can cause organic degradation and algae cell integrity loss three hypothetical consequence of the oxidation was proposed in this study ⅰ eom degradation ⅱ algae rupture ⅲ iom release to qualitatively determine the contribution mechanism of these three consequences under various oxidation condition independent influence experiments were employed to discuss the positive negative impact for the fouling performance to evaluate the impact of eom degradation on uf fouling performance the algae laden water was initially separated into eom solution and algae cell solution by centrifugation the eom solution after oxidized with various oxidation methods was re dosed to algal cells solution the mixed solution was conducted for fouling performance analysis fig 1 a to evaluate the impact of algae rupture on uf fouling performance various oxidation methods were employed to algal cells solution afterward the treated algae cell solution was separated again to discard the produced iom finally the resuspension of different proportions of debris and eom solution was filtrated to analysis the fouling performance fig 1b to evaluate the impact of iom release on uf fouling performance the treated algae cell solution was separated but discard the algal cells and then remixed with raw algae laden water the mixed solution was used for fouling performance analysis fig 1c 2 5 analytical methods an uv spectrophotometer tu 1810 general analysis beijing was applied to

spectrum one b perkin elmer usa a scanning electron microscopy gemini sem 300 zeiss germany was applied to observe the morphology of algal cells and cake layer on the membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of paa uv paa and us paa pre oxidation on algae laden water 3 1 1 algae cell integrity variation in algal cell integrity after pre oxidation was initially examined using flow cytometry technique as depicted in fig 2 the stronger the fluorescence intensity of channel fl1 the higher breakage rate of algae cells liu et al 2015 hence regions q1 and q4 represent the integrated cell population while regions q2 and q3 correspond to debris fig 2a shows that 94 5 of algal cells were intact before treatment revealing their high physiological activity the debris proportion exhibited a negligible change at 5 mg l paa and slightly increased to 11 2 and 11 7 when uv 5 mg l paa and us 5 mg l paa were applied respectively this verified that low concentrations of paa had less damage to the cell integrity despite the accompanying uv irradiation or ultrasound owing to the production of fewer reactive radicals wu et al 2020 fig 1e reveals that the integrity of cells maintained well at 10 mg l paa but the debris proportion increased to 24 3 when us 10 mg l paa was applied indicating that cell integrity is being lost with the increasing radicals cao et al 2022 notably the debris proportion was remarkably increased with uv 10 mg l paa treatment as compared to us 10 mg l paa 90 8 versus 24 3 illustrating the more reactive radicals produced by paa under uv irradiation than under us activation while severe algal cell rupture also occurred when 20 mg l paa was applied this is because higher paa concentration induced more severe paa self decomposition with more reactive radicals cao et al 2022 the most severe cell rupture occurred under uv 20 mg l paa treatment with a debris proportion up to 95 1 in general the algae can maintain integrity with moderate oxidation condition i e paa dosage below 10 mg l or paa dosage below 5 mg l with activation 3 1 2 characterization of the organic matters the apparent mw distribution of organic matters in pre oxidated algae laden water is displayed in fig 3 two peaks belonging to high mw substances peak a and low mw substances peak b can be clearly observed in raw water as the dosage of paa increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l the intensity of peak a decreased notably these results revealed that the increased paa and reactive radicals are conducive to the abatement of macromolecules peak b exerted the lowest intensity at 10 mg l paa while the intensity increased obviously with uv 10 mg l paa 20 mg l paa and uv 20 mg l paa treatments suggesting that the high concentration of paa and massive reactive radicals have adverse influence on the removal of small molecule substances the hydrophilicity of the pre oxidized organic matters fig s1 also suggests an unfavorable deterioration of doc content both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fraction during strong oxidation condition there are two interpretations for this phenomenon firstly the macromolecules could be decomposed into low molecular weight organics by oxidation he et al 2021a additionally severe algae cells rupture may induced the release of iom mainly composed of small molecules liu et al 2020 the fluorescence eem spectrum after pre oxidation was displayed in fig s2 notably all the peaks intensities were notably weakened at 10 mg l paa showing an optimum organics removal effect however the intensities of peaks a and c dramatically increased with uv 10 mg l 20 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa treatments attributed to the release of substantial humic like and fulvic acids like substances by cell rupture li et al 2014b liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 in general the reduction of the dissolved contents for paa and uv paa was negatively correlated with the cell integrity hence optimal pre oxidation strategy should obey the target of enhancing dissolved organic degradation and avoiding cell rupture interestingly though less cell integrity occurred us paa treatment was observed with a more deteriorated water quality demonstrating that ultrasound could stimulate the stress metabolism of algal cells to secrete substantial organics 3 2 membrane flux analysis the flux curves of paa uv paa and us paa pretreatments during the filtration of algae laden water is depicted in fig 4 a c regarding the first filtration cycle untreated algae laden water led to a serious flux decline with the final specific flux j j0 of 0 18 when 10 mg l paa pretreatments was applied the terminal normalized specific flux of first cycle was highly improved to 0 53 exhibiting a satisfactory flux improvement of paa it was attributed to the effective removal of dissolved organics with slight damage to cell integrity thereby mitigating membrane fouling for uv paa process uv 5 mg l paa pretreatment exerted a better flux improvement in the filtration however uv irradiation gradually played a negative role in flux improvement with the increasing paa dosage which is ascribed to the aggravated membrane fouling induced by the generation of debris and release of organic matters us paa was ineffective for improving the permeate flux which probably related to the organic matters secreted by the stress stimulation of algae in general moderate oxidation of 10 mg l paa for algae laden water contribute to the filtration resistance minimization and water production promotion while excessive dosage of paa and reactive radicals are detrimental for the flux improvement during uf treatment of algae laden water fig 4d f illustrates the fouling resistances during the first filtration cycle with different pretreatments the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance caused by raw water were 278 1010 m 1 and 5 44 1010 m 1 respectively revealing the dominance of reversible fouling induced by the deposition of algae cells and macromolecular organics on the membrane surface liu et al 2020 5 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa pretreatments caused less reversible and irreversible fouling owing to the efficient removal of macromolecule protein substances and micromolecular humic substances respectively the reversible and irreversible fouling were highly minimized to 65 2 1010 m 1 and 2 1 1010 m 1 with 10 mg l paa pretreatment exhibiting the optimal membrane fouling control effect to both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance regarding uv paa pretreatments increased paa dosage lead to aggravated irreversible membrane fouling which is relating to the more irreversible fouling caused by debris and iom in comparison with algae cells liu et al 2017b 3 3 synergistic effect of pre oxidation on fouling mechanism 3 3 1 effect of pre oxidation on dominant fouling mechanism to further investigate the effect of pre oxidation on the membrane fouling mechanism the membrane fouling model based on d2t dv2 and dt dv was applied ho and zydney 2000 the value of n indicated the dominant fouling mechanism and the conversion of the mechanism during the filtration process can be reflected by the value of n cheng et al 2021a as illustrated in fig 5 the fouling mechanism of untreated water filtration can be divided into two stages in initial stage both complete blocking and standard blocking governed the fouling mechanism at a filtration volume of approximately 33 ml the dominant fouling mechanism transformed to cake filtration liu et al 2020 when 5 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa us 5 mg l paa and us 10 mg l paa were applied the initial n values were 1 517 1 488 1 351 and 1 368 individually implying that standard blocking was the dominant fouling type at the first stage notably the transition points were all delayed the prolongation of transition point is attributed to the effective degradation for macromolecular organics that can completely block the membrane pores which is conductive to the membrane fouling alleviation cheng et al 2021b ren et al 2020 interestingly the characteristic curve was dramatically altered by pre oxidation of 10 mg l paa with standard blocking dominating the entire filtration process this variation was ascribed to the minimization of dissolved organics accompanied by slight algae integrity loss which lessened the amount of organic matters available to fill the voids in the cake layer thus evoking more water flow channels and mitigating the cake resistance liu et al 2020 however uv 10 mg l paa pretreatment exhibited a significant influence on the fouling mechanism and the transition point of cake filtration was brought forward to 22 ml the conversion to cake filtration was even earlier 12 ml after uv 20 mg l paa treatment which was relating to the rapid accumulation of debris flocs and released organic matters leading to a clipping formation of cake layer and exacerbation of membrane fouling wan et al 2019 3 3 2 synergistic and individual effect of pre oxidation on uf performance although the two stage fouling model can explain the fouling type during the filtration process the specific mechanisms for membrane fouling mitigation by oxidation during algae laden water treatment are still not well revealed cheng et al 2022 2021a wei et al 2016 zhang and fu 2018 in general the pre oxidation can cause eom degradation algal rupture and iom release and the primary and secondary foulants probably have synergistic impact on the membrane fouling performance to clarify the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation for algae laden water fouling contribution qualitative assessments with paa and uv paa pre oxidation were employed to investigate the positive negative synergistic and individual effect of eom degradation algal rupture and iom release on fouling performance as shown in fig 6 the synergistic effect of 5 mg l paa can improve the specific flux from 0 176 to 0 223 the terminal specific flux by individual effect of eom degradation was improved to 0 347 indicating that eom degradation has an excellent positive effect on uf fouling control the reversible fouling was highly mitigated by eom degradation this suggest the enhancement of cake layer porosity with less macromolecules filling the cake layer voids can greatly improve the flux liu et al 2017b individual effect of algae rupture and iom release both present negative result for uf fouling performance whereas compared to iom release the debris from algae rupture induced significantly aggravated membrane fouling this suggest simple algal rupture was still unfavorable for uf fouling control by causing complete pore blocking and cake layer regardless of the possible increase of dissolved organics considering the previous analysis of the released organics iom mainly composed of small molecule hydrophilic organics which cannot be rejected by the membrane and have potential to aggravate fouling the same trends were obtained with uv 5 mg l and 20 mg l paa treatments especially for 20 mg l paa amounts of debris led to a faster flux decline and higher irreversible fouling resistance the removal of eom by paa treatments was probably the dominated mechanism for fouling mitigation through cake layer porosity enhancement interestingly the algae rupture rather than iom is the crucial of membrane fouling aggravation in addition the ch3co3 was proved as the dominant radicals for the contribution of eom degradation and algal cell rupture through the quenching experiment fig s5 the synergistic and individual effect of pre oxidation on uf performance is a well explanation for the dominated and negative reason of fouling mitigation this provides working proposal and guidance on identifying efficient technology for algae laden water 3 4 characterization of uf effluent fig 7 shows the fluorescence eem spectra of uf effluents as for raw water the weak intensities of peaks t and d after uf treatment revealed a satisfactory rejection of uf on macromolecular organics cheng et al 2022 while the high intensities of peaks a and c exhibited an inferior rejection of micromolecular organics liu et al 2020 evidently after uv 10 mg l paa 20 mg l paa uv 20 mg l paa and us paa pretreatments the intensities of peaks a and c in the uf effluent was strengthened notably verifying that the substantial micromolecular organics generated after these pretreatments can deteriorate the uf permeate the intensities of all peaks in the permeate was remarkably weakened after 10 mg l paa pretreatment which suggests that 10 mg l paa also maintained its favorable effect on fluorescence reduction as secondary metabolites produced by microcysts aeruginosa 2 mib and gsm are the most common natural taste and odor compounds in water supply wert et al 2014 fig 8 shows the concentrations of 2 mib and gsm in the uf permeate the concentrations of 2 mib and gsm in raw water were 91 6 ng l and 936 9 ng l respectively and a poor removal efficiency for odors by uf was observed antonopoulou et al 2014 compared with 5 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa greatly promoted the removal rates of 2 mib and gsm due to the fact that oh radicals formed by the homolysis of uv based aop was the main degradation pathway for odors jo et al 2011 liu et al 2017c moreover gsm was observed with a higher removal rate than 2 mib due to the less steric hindrance in its chemical structure and thus more easily being oxidized by oh radicals antonopoulou et al 2014 liang et al 2007 westerhoff et al 2006 thanks to the large amount of oh radicals generated uv 10 mg l paa was promising for the 2 mib 42 9 and gsm 46 3 degradation it is noteworthy that 20 mg l paa exerted a worse odor removal even though it could produce amounts of oh radicals by self decomposition this phenomenon can be explained by two aspects on the one hand the released organic matters could compete for the oh radicals consumption on the other hand the release of intracellular odors into the aqueous solution was higher than their degradation liu et al 2018 wert et al 2014 when uv 20 mg l paa was applied the concentration of 2 mib decreased but it was still remarkably higher than that of other groups therefore when uv paa is applied for algae laden water treatment severe cell damage probably caused more odors formation in addition to the odors indicators the content of precursors of chlorination dbps after uf was also investigated as depicted in fig s3 10 mg l paa still exhibited the optimum elimination of tcmfp although the high concentration of paa and reactive radicals led to severe iom release the removal effect of tcmfp was more positive than that in raw water which may be due to a large tcmfp molecular weight fraction of iom and a higher rejection efficiency in the blocked membrane pores zhou et al 2015b 3 5 effect of paa uv paa and us paa pre oxidation on foulant and interface characteristics zeta potential is a significant indicator to characterize the dispersion stability liang et al 2021 as depicted in table 1 the zeta potential value of untreated algae laden water was 42 1 mv indicating a greater aggregation resistance between the negatively charged algal particles and a strong stability of the system he et al 2021b when 5 mg l paa was applied the zeta potential of algae laden water decreased to 17 mv revealing that the electronegativity of algal particles greatly decreased with the increase of paa dosage in the paa uv paa and us paa pretreatments the zeta potential of algae laden water continuously decreased this variation are due to the fact that the zeta potential of debris has been demonstrated to be remarkably lower than that of algal cells liu et al 2017b thus the solution with more debris exhibited a lower zeta potential though previous work demonstrated that the zeta potential decline can lessen the cake layer resistance zhu et al 2022a the cell rupture might counterweigh the alleviation according to above analysis to further investigate the fouling potential of algal foulants the cohesive free energy and adhesive free energy for algal foulants were calculated table s1 glw gab and gel refer to van der waals interaction polar interaction and electrostatic interaction of interface free energy individually and the sum of these three parts composes the total interface free energy gtot zhu et al 2022a after paa pre oxidation the electrostatic repulsion between algae particles was weakened which was consistent with the result of zeta potential when 5 and 10 mg l paa was applied the increased gtot 131 values render a repulsion trend among algae foulants during filtration process this result was attributed to a significant increment in polar repulsion which probably ascribed to the increase of hydrophilic organics caused by paa however after uv 10 mg l 20 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa application a noticeable reduction of gtot 131 was observed and a strong aggregation trend was shown among algal particles these phenomena are attributed to the fact that with greater hydrophobic attraction debris are prone to self aggregate in comparison with algae cells liu et al 2017b moreover a significant decrease in gtot 132 was observed in the presence of high concentration of paa and reactive radicals suggesting an enhanced attraction between the foulants and the membrane this is ascribed to the greater hydrophobicity and less electrostatic repulsion of the debris liu et al 2017b which allows the close bind between foulants and the membrane in general weak adhesive free energy 10 mg l paa was beneficial for fouling resistance mitigation 3 6 characterization of the membrane surface atr ftir was utilized to compare the effects of different pretreatments on the variation of functional groups on the surface of fouled membranes fig s4 the strong absorbance at around 3481 1684 1530 1389 and 1108 cm 1 could be observed after the filtration of algae laden water to be specific the broad peak at approximately 3481 cm 1 was related to o h stretching vibrations and the peak of 1108 cm 1 corresponded to c o c vibration both o h and c o c can be identified as indicators of polysaccharides which were the main components of algae cell walls wan et al 2019 zhou et al 2014a the peak of c o nh2 amide i was observed at around 1684 cm 1 and the signal of n h c n amide ii appeared in the range of 1530 cm 1 relating to the characteristics of protein substance gamage and chellam 2014 tian et al 2018 furthermore a relatively weak c h vibration at 1389 cm 1 revealed the deposition of humic substances cheng et al 2022 these results verified that the algal foulants on the membrane surface mainly consisted of polysaccharide protein and humic notably the intensities of each peak were weakened by 5 mg l uv 5 mg l and 10 mg l paa pretreatments especially by 10 mg l paa however the absorption peaks of polysaccharide and amide ii were significantly strengthened when 20 mg l uv 10 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa treatments were applied which was attributed to the unfavorable deposition of numerous polysaccharide debris on the membrane surface liu et al 2017b fig 9 shows scanning electron micrographs of the fouled membrane surface the algae cells without pre treatment were intact and homogeneously and tightly deposited onto the membrane surface algae cells could keep integral with 5 mg l paa treatment with the paa dosage increasing to 10 mg l the algae cells shrunk but remained intact with a loose cake layer which could evoke more water flow channels and lessen the resistance of cake layer through eom decomposition he et al 2021b liu et al 2020 notably uv 10 mg l paa pre treatment induced remarkable cell rupture and ablation after 20 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa application the released iom and debris covered the membrane surface with formation of a dense cake layer with strong adhesion which is difficult to be removed by hydraulic backwashing liu et al 2017b the integrity of algae cells was maintained well with us paa application which was consistent with the results of flow cytometry analysis 4 conclusion in this study the application of paa uv paa and us paa as pretreatments of uf for algae laden water was comprehensively investigated the performance shows that cell integrity was well maintained within the dose range of 10 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa and us 5 mg l paa paa at the dosage of 10 mg l was promising for the minimization of dissolved organics and exhibited an optimal performance in flux improvement and membrane fouling control these low concentrations of paa and reactive radicals contributed to delaying the formation of cake layer with alleviating the membrane fouling through the efficient degradation of macromolecular organics however high concentrations of paa or reactive radicals led to severe cell rupture and membrane fouling aggravation the us 5 mg l paa was proved to be an inefficient pretreatment due to the stimulation of algal stress metabolism to secrete substantial organics oh radicals produced in uv paa process can efficiently degrade 2 mib and gsm the synergistic and individual effect of paa based pre oxidation on uf performance through fouling contribution qualitative assessment was evaluated for the first time which indicates that the elimination of eom by paa treatments was the primary contribution for fouling mitigation due to the enhancement of cake layer porosity while the formation of debris rather than iom release is the crucial role for membrane fouling aggravation the

15854,in this work peracetic acid paa ultraviolet uv paa and ultrasonic us paa pre oxidation were applied to enhance ultrafiltration uf performance during algae laden water treatment the results showed that 10 mg l paa exhibiting an optimal performance with membrane fouling resistance reduced by 76 26 low dosage of uv paa can effectively control fouling by enhancing the degradation of dissolved organics though more radicals were generated with the increasing dosage of paa during the uv paa process flux deterioration was occurred when paa dosage over 10 mg l owing to a negative correlation between fouling resistance and algal integrity loss compared with uv us exhibited a worse activation effect on paa with less reactive radicals produced even worse us can stimulate the stress metabolism of algal cells with slightly integrity loss which then resulted in an exacerbation of permeate quality fouling mechanism analysis revealed that the delay formation of cake layer with membrane fouling alleviation mainly through efficient degradation of macromolecular organics the investigation of synergistic and individual effect of eom degradation algae rupture and iom release on the filtration performance revealed that eom degradation was the primary mechanism for fouling control while algae rupture rather than iom release was crucial for membrane fouling aggravation this indicates that moderate oxidation with property of high organic degradation and low cell rupture was the working principal and objectives for algae laden water treatment additionally it was found that the oh radicals produced during uv paa process can efficiently degrade representative odors in general pretreatments of paa and low dosages of uv paa showed promising prospects in improving the uf

for the extensive application of uf technology li et al 2014c to address the algal derived membrane fouling issues various pretreatment strategies have been explored in recent decades such as pre coagulation alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 zhu et al 2022a pre adsorption li et al 2014a and pre oxidation cheng et al 2022 wan et al 2019 among them pre oxidation is an attractive option because it

respectively liu et al 2020 2 4 fouling contribution qualitative assessment in general oxidation of algae laden water can cause organic degradation and algae cell integrity loss three hypothetical consequence of the oxidation was proposed in this study ⅰ eom degradation ⅱ algae rupture ⅲ iom release to qualitatively determine the contribution mechanism of these three consequences under various oxidation condition independent influence experiments were employed to discuss the positive negative impact for the fouling performance to evaluate the impact of eom degradation on uf fouling performance the algae laden water was initially separated into eom solution and algae cell solution by centrifugation the eom solution after oxidized with various oxidation methods was re dosed to algal cells solution the mixed solution was conducted for fouling performance analysis fig 1 a to evaluate the impact of algae rupture on uf fouling performance various oxidation methods were employed to algal cells solution afterward the treated algae cell solution was separated again to discard the produced iom finally the resuspension of different proportions of debris and eom solution was filtrated to analysis the fouling performance fig 1b to evaluate the impact of iom release on uf fouling performance the treated algae cell solution was separated but discard the algal cells and then remixed with raw algae laden water the mixed solution was used for fouling performance analysis fig 1c 2 5 analytical methods an uv spectrophotometer tu 1810 general analysis beijing was applied to

spectrum one b perkin elmer usa a scanning electron microscopy gemini sem 300 zeiss germany was applied to observe the morphology of algal cells and cake layer on the membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of paa uv paa and us paa pre oxidation on algae laden water 3 1 1 algae cell integrity variation in algal cell integrity after pre oxidation was initially examined using flow cytometry technique as depicted in fig 2 the stronger the fluorescence intensity of channel fl1 the higher breakage rate of algae cells liu et al 2015 hence regions q1 and q4 represent the integrated cell population while regions q2 and q3 correspond to debris fig 2a shows that 94 5 of algal cells were intact before treatment revealing their high physiological activity the debris proportion exhibited a negligible change at 5 mg l paa and slightly increased to 11 2 and 11 7 when uv 5 mg l paa and us 5 mg l paa were applied respectively this verified that low concentrations of paa had less damage to the cell integrity despite the accompanying uv irradiation or ultrasound owing to the production of fewer reactive radicals wu et al 2020 fig 1e reveals that the integrity of cells maintained well at 10 mg l paa but the debris proportion increased to 24 3 when us 10 mg l paa was applied indicating that cell integrity is being lost with the increasing radicals cao et al 2022 notably the debris proportion was remarkably increased with uv 10 mg l paa treatment as compared to us 10 mg l paa 90 8 versus 24 3 illustrating the more reactive radicals produced by paa under uv irradiation than under us activation while severe algal cell rupture also occurred when 20 mg l paa was applied this is because higher paa concentration induced more severe paa self decomposition with more reactive radicals cao et al 2022 the most severe cell rupture occurred under uv 20 mg l paa treatment with a debris proportion up to 95 1 in general the algae can maintain integrity with moderate oxidation condition i e paa dosage below 10 mg l or paa dosage below 5 mg l with activation 3 1 2 characterization of the organic matters the apparent mw distribution of organic matters in pre oxidated algae laden water is displayed in fig 3 two peaks belonging to high mw substances peak a and low mw substances peak b can be clearly observed in raw water as the dosage of paa increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l the intensity of peak a decreased notably these results revealed that the increased paa and reactive radicals are conducive to the abatement of macromolecules peak b exerted the lowest intensity at 10 mg l paa while the intensity increased obviously with uv 10 mg l paa 20 mg l paa and uv 20 mg l paa treatments suggesting that the high concentration of paa and massive reactive radicals have adverse influence on the removal of small molecule substances the hydrophilicity of the pre oxidized organic matters fig s1 also suggests an unfavorable deterioration of doc content both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fraction during strong oxidation condition there are two interpretations for this phenomenon firstly the macromolecules could be decomposed into low molecular weight organics by oxidation he et al 2021a additionally severe algae cells rupture may induced the release of iom mainly composed of small molecules liu et al 2020 the fluorescence eem spectrum after pre oxidation was displayed in fig s2 notably all the peaks intensities were notably weakened at 10 mg l paa showing an optimum organics removal effect however the intensities of peaks a and c dramatically increased with uv 10 mg l 20 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa treatments attributed to the release of substantial humic like and fulvic acids like substances by cell rupture li et al 2014b liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 in general the reduction of the dissolved contents for paa and uv paa was negatively correlated with the cell integrity hence optimal pre oxidation strategy should obey the target of enhancing dissolved organic degradation and avoiding cell rupture interestingly though less cell integrity occurred us paa treatment was observed with a more deteriorated water quality demonstrating that ultrasound could stimulate the stress metabolism of algal cells to secrete substantial organics 3 2 membrane flux analysis the flux curves of paa uv paa and us paa pretreatments during the filtration of algae laden water is depicted in fig 4 a c regarding the first filtration cycle untreated algae laden water led to a serious flux decline with the final specific flux j j0 of 0 18 when 10 mg l paa pretreatments was applied the terminal normalized specific flux of first cycle was highly improved to 0 53 exhibiting a satisfactory flux improvement of paa it was attributed to the effective removal of dissolved organics with slight damage to cell integrity thereby mitigating membrane fouling for uv paa process uv 5 mg l paa pretreatment exerted a better flux improvement in the filtration however uv irradiation gradually played a negative role in flux improvement with the increasing paa dosage which is ascribed to the aggravated membrane fouling induced by the generation of debris and release of organic matters us paa was ineffective for improving the permeate flux which probably related to the organic matters secreted by the stress stimulation of algae in general moderate oxidation of 10 mg l paa for algae laden water contribute to the filtration resistance minimization and water production promotion while excessive dosage of paa and reactive radicals are detrimental for the flux improvement during uf treatment of algae laden water fig 4d f illustrates the fouling resistances during the first filtration cycle with different pretreatments the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance caused by raw water were 278 1010 m 1 and 5 44 1010 m 1 respectively revealing the dominance of reversible fouling induced by the deposition of algae cells and macromolecular organics on the membrane surface liu et al 2020 5 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa pretreatments caused less reversible and irreversible fouling owing to the efficient removal of macromolecule protein substances and micromolecular humic substances respectively the reversible and irreversible fouling were highly minimized to 65 2 1010 m 1 and 2 1 1010 m 1 with 10 mg l paa pretreatment exhibiting the optimal membrane fouling control effect to both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance regarding uv paa pretreatments increased paa dosage lead to aggravated irreversible membrane fouling which is relating to the more irreversible fouling caused by debris and iom in comparison with algae cells liu et al 2017b 3 3 synergistic effect of pre oxidation on fouling mechanism 3 3 1 effect of pre oxidation on dominant fouling mechanism to further investigate the effect of pre oxidation on the membrane fouling mechanism the membrane fouling model based on d2t dv2 and dt dv was applied ho and zydney 2000 the value of n indicated the dominant fouling mechanism and the conversion of the mechanism during the filtration process can be reflected by the value of n cheng et al 2021a as illustrated in fig 5 the fouling mechanism of untreated water filtration can be divided into two stages in initial stage both complete blocking and standard blocking governed the fouling mechanism at a filtration volume of approximately 33 ml the dominant fouling mechanism transformed to cake filtration liu et al 2020 when 5 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa us 5 mg l paa and us 10 mg l paa were applied the initial n values were 1 517 1 488 1 351 and 1 368 individually implying that standard blocking was the dominant fouling type at the first stage notably the transition points were all delayed the prolongation of transition point is attributed to the effective degradation for macromolecular organics that can completely block the membrane pores which is conductive to the membrane fouling alleviation cheng et al 2021b ren et al 2020 interestingly the characteristic curve was dramatically altered by pre oxidation of 10 mg l paa with standard blocking dominating the entire filtration process this variation was ascribed to the minimization of dissolved organics accompanied by slight algae integrity loss which lessened the amount of organic matters available to fill the voids in the cake layer thus evoking more water flow channels and mitigating the cake resistance liu et al 2020 however uv 10 mg l paa pretreatment exhibited a significant influence on the fouling mechanism and the transition point of cake filtration was brought forward to 22 ml the conversion to cake filtration was even earlier 12 ml after uv 20 mg l paa treatment which was relating to the rapid accumulation of debris flocs and released organic matters leading to a clipping formation of cake layer and exacerbation of membrane fouling wan et al 2019 3 3 2 synergistic and individual effect of pre oxidation on uf performance although the two stage fouling model can explain the fouling type during the filtration process the specific mechanisms for membrane fouling mitigation by oxidation during algae laden water treatment are still not well revealed cheng et al 2022 2021a wei et al 2016 zhang and fu 2018 in general the pre oxidation can cause eom degradation algal rupture and iom release and the primary and secondary foulants probably have synergistic impact on the membrane fouling performance to clarify the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation for algae laden water fouling contribution qualitative assessments with paa and uv paa pre oxidation were employed to investigate the positive negative synergistic and individual effect of eom degradation algal rupture and iom release on fouling performance as shown in fig 6 the synergistic effect of 5 mg l paa can improve the specific flux from 0 176 to 0 223 the terminal specific flux by individual effect of eom degradation was improved to 0 347 indicating that eom degradation has an excellent positive effect on uf fouling control the reversible fouling was highly mitigated by eom degradation this suggest the enhancement of cake layer porosity with less macromolecules filling the cake layer voids can greatly improve the flux liu et al 2017b individual effect of algae rupture and iom release both present negative result for uf fouling performance whereas compared to iom release the debris from algae rupture induced significantly aggravated membrane fouling this suggest simple algal rupture was still unfavorable for uf fouling control by causing complete pore blocking and cake layer regardless of the possible increase of dissolved organics considering the previous analysis of the released organics iom mainly composed of small molecule hydrophilic organics which cannot be rejected by the membrane and have potential to aggravate fouling the same trends were obtained with uv 5 mg l and 20 mg l paa treatments especially for 20 mg l paa amounts of debris led to a faster flux decline and higher irreversible fouling resistance the removal of eom by paa treatments was probably the dominated mechanism for fouling mitigation through cake layer porosity enhancement interestingly the algae rupture rather than iom is the crucial of membrane fouling aggravation in addition the ch3co3 was proved as the dominant radicals for the contribution of eom degradation and algal cell rupture through the quenching experiment fig s5 the synergistic and individual effect of pre oxidation on uf performance is a well explanation for the dominated and negative reason of fouling mitigation this provides working proposal and guidance on identifying efficient technology for algae laden water 3 4 characterization of uf effluent fig 7 shows the fluorescence eem spectra of uf effluents as for raw water the weak intensities of peaks t and d after uf treatment revealed a satisfactory rejection of uf on macromolecular organics cheng et al 2022 while the high intensities of peaks a and c exhibited an inferior rejection of micromolecular organics liu et al 2020 evidently after uv 10 mg l paa 20 mg l paa uv 20 mg l paa and us paa pretreatments the intensities of peaks a and c in the uf effluent was strengthened notably verifying that the substantial micromolecular organics generated after these pretreatments can deteriorate the uf permeate the intensities of all peaks in the permeate was remarkably weakened after 10 mg l paa pretreatment which suggests that 10 mg l paa also maintained its favorable effect on fluorescence reduction as secondary metabolites produced by microcysts aeruginosa 2 mib and gsm are the most common natural taste and odor compounds in water supply wert et al 2014 fig 8 shows the concentrations of 2 mib and gsm in the uf permeate the concentrations of 2 mib and gsm in raw water were 91 6 ng l and 936 9 ng l respectively and a poor removal efficiency for odors by uf was observed antonopoulou et al 2014 compared with 5 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa greatly promoted the removal rates of 2 mib and gsm due to the fact that oh radicals formed by the homolysis of uv based aop was the main degradation pathway for odors jo et al 2011 liu et al 2017c moreover gsm was observed with a higher removal rate than 2 mib due to the less steric hindrance in its chemical structure and thus more easily being oxidized by oh radicals antonopoulou et al 2014 liang et al 2007 westerhoff et al 2006 thanks to the large amount of oh radicals generated uv 10 mg l paa was promising for the 2 mib 42 9 and gsm 46 3 degradation it is noteworthy that 20 mg l paa exerted a worse odor removal even though it could produce amounts of oh radicals by self decomposition this phenomenon can be explained by two aspects on the one hand the released organic matters could compete for the oh radicals consumption on the other hand the release of intracellular odors into the aqueous solution was higher than their degradation liu et al 2018 wert et al 2014 when uv 20 mg l paa was applied the concentration of 2 mib decreased but it was still remarkably higher than that of other groups therefore when uv paa is applied for algae laden water treatment severe cell damage probably caused more odors formation in addition to the odors indicators the content of precursors of chlorination dbps after uf was also investigated as depicted in fig s3 10 mg l paa still exhibited the optimum elimination of tcmfp although the high concentration of paa and reactive radicals led to severe iom release the removal effect of tcmfp was more positive than that in raw water which may be due to a large tcmfp molecular weight fraction of iom and a higher rejection efficiency in the blocked membrane pores zhou et al 2015b 3 5 effect of paa uv paa and us paa pre oxidation on foulant and interface characteristics zeta potential is a significant indicator to characterize the dispersion stability liang et al 2021 as depicted in table 1 the zeta potential value of untreated algae laden water was 42 1 mv indicating a greater aggregation resistance between the negatively charged algal particles and a strong stability of the system he et al 2021b when 5 mg l paa was applied the zeta potential of algae laden water decreased to 17 mv revealing that the electronegativity of algal particles greatly decreased with the increase of paa dosage in the paa uv paa and us paa pretreatments the zeta potential of algae laden water continuously decreased this variation are due to the fact that the zeta potential of debris has been demonstrated to be remarkably lower than that of algal cells liu et al 2017b thus the solution with more debris exhibited a lower zeta potential though previous work demonstrated that the zeta potential decline can lessen the cake layer resistance zhu et al 2022a the cell rupture might counterweigh the alleviation according to above analysis to further investigate the fouling potential of algal foulants the cohesive free energy and adhesive free energy for algal foulants were calculated table s1 glw gab and gel refer to van der waals interaction polar interaction and electrostatic interaction of interface free energy individually and the sum of these three parts composes the total interface free energy gtot zhu et al 2022a after paa pre oxidation the electrostatic repulsion between algae particles was weakened which was consistent with the result of zeta potential when 5 and 10 mg l paa was applied the increased gtot 131 values render a repulsion trend among algae foulants during filtration process this result was attributed to a significant increment in polar repulsion which probably ascribed to the increase of hydrophilic organics caused by paa however after uv 10 mg l 20 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa application a noticeable reduction of gtot 131 was observed and a strong aggregation trend was shown among algal particles these phenomena are attributed to the fact that with greater hydrophobic attraction debris are prone to self aggregate in comparison with algae cells liu et al 2017b moreover a significant decrease in gtot 132 was observed in the presence of high concentration of paa and reactive radicals suggesting an enhanced attraction between the foulants and the membrane this is ascribed to the greater hydrophobicity and less electrostatic repulsion of the debris liu et al 2017b which allows the close bind between foulants and the membrane in general weak adhesive free energy 10 mg l paa was beneficial for fouling resistance mitigation 3 6 characterization of the membrane surface atr ftir was utilized to compare the effects of different pretreatments on the variation of functional groups on the surface of fouled membranes fig s4 the strong absorbance at around 3481 1684 1530 1389 and 1108 cm 1 could be observed after the filtration of algae laden water to be specific the broad peak at approximately 3481 cm 1 was related to o h stretching vibrations and the peak of 1108 cm 1 corresponded to c o c vibration both o h and c o c can be identified as indicators of polysaccharides which were the main components of algae cell walls wan et al 2019 zhou et al 2014a the peak of c o nh2 amide i was observed at around 1684 cm 1 and the signal of n h c n amide ii appeared in the range of 1530 cm 1 relating to the characteristics of protein substance gamage and chellam 2014 tian et al 2018 furthermore a relatively weak c h vibration at 1389 cm 1 revealed the deposition of humic substances cheng et al 2022 these results verified that the algal foulants on the membrane surface mainly consisted of polysaccharide protein and humic notably the intensities of each peak were weakened by 5 mg l uv 5 mg l and 10 mg l paa pretreatments especially by 10 mg l paa however the absorption peaks of polysaccharide and amide ii were significantly strengthened when 20 mg l uv 10 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa treatments were applied which was attributed to the unfavorable deposition of numerous polysaccharide debris on the membrane surface liu et al 2017b fig 9 shows scanning electron micrographs of the fouled membrane surface the algae cells without pre treatment were intact and homogeneously and tightly deposited onto the membrane surface algae cells could keep integral with 5 mg l paa treatment with the paa dosage increasing to 10 mg l the algae cells shrunk but remained intact with a loose cake layer which could evoke more water flow channels and lessen the resistance of cake layer through eom decomposition he et al 2021b liu et al 2020 notably uv 10 mg l paa pre treatment induced remarkable cell rupture and ablation after 20 mg l and uv 20 mg l paa application the released iom and debris covered the membrane surface with formation of a dense cake layer with strong adhesion which is difficult to be removed by hydraulic backwashing liu et al 2017b the integrity of algae cells was maintained well with us paa application which was consistent with the results of flow cytometry analysis 4 conclusion in this study the application of paa uv paa and us paa as pretreatments of uf for algae laden water was comprehensively investigated the performance shows that cell integrity was well maintained within the dose range of 10 mg l paa uv 5 mg l paa and us 5 mg l paa paa at the dosage of 10 mg l was promising for the minimization of dissolved organics and exhibited an optimal performance in flux improvement and membrane fouling control these low concentrations of paa and reactive radicals contributed to delaying the formation of cake layer with alleviating the membrane fouling through the efficient degradation of macromolecular organics however high concentrations of paa or reactive radicals led to severe cell rupture and membrane fouling aggravation the us 5 mg l paa was proved to be an inefficient pretreatment due to the stimulation of algal stress metabolism to secrete substantial organics oh radicals produced in uv paa process can efficiently degrade 2 mib and gsm the synergistic and individual effect of paa based pre oxidation on uf performance through fouling contribution qualitative assessment was evaluated for the first time which indicates that the elimination of eom by paa treatments was the primary contribution for fouling mitigation due to the enhancement of cake layer porosity while the formation of debris rather than iom release is the crucial role for membrane fouling aggravation the generalizability of this inference requires to be demonstrated through broader research by other oxidation system in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
