quality standard in japan the document indicates that dd is potentially detectable in raw water for tap waters dd in raw water will be treated with chlorine at waterworks which raises concerns about formation of mutagenic chlorination by products through the treatment the objective of this work was to identify a mutagenic chlorination by product by using high resolution mass spectrometers and multivariate analyses mutagenicity of the chlorination by product was evaluated with the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay e 1 3 dichloropropene dcp was used as a model compound of dd the mutagenicity of chlorine treated model aqueous solutions of dd increased with increasing chlorine dosages up to 3 00 mol cl2 mol dcp from the chlorine treated aqueous solutions of dd 1 3 dichloroacetone dca was identified as a major mutagen by a cochromatography with an authentic standard precursor ion analyses and first generation product ion analyses with the high resolution mass spectrometers the mutagenicity of dca against ta100 strain without microsomal activation was 160 000 net revertant colony μmol the toxicity equivalent factor was 0 14 based on the mutagenicity of the chlorine treated dcp sample the specific mutagenicity of dca and the dca concentration in the sample the mutagenic contribution of dca to the chlorine treated dcp sample was calculated high

tap water quality management dd in the raw water for tap water will be chlorinated at waterworks one would expect that chlorine treatment of organic compounds produces hazardous by products so chlorination of dd may also be of concern for example wang et al 2007 revealed that toxicants causing luminescence inhibition had been produced through chlorine treatment of domestic wastewater treatment effluent and reclamation plant effluent the authors reported formation of mutagenic chlorination by products mcps from pesticides and their transformation products kishida et al 2008 takanashi et al 2013 2014 2016 the mcps from dd however has not been reported to the best of our knowledge in order to elucidate chemical structures of unknowns ft ir nmr and a high resolution ms have been utilized in the fields of organic chemistry köppen et al 2017 natural products chemistry abdelrahman et al 2017 and so on however isolation of targeted unknowns from complicated matrices is prerequisite for ft ir and nmr while it is difficult to be achieved for environmental samples in contrast a high resolution ms is generally compatible chromatographic techniques such as liquid chromatography or gas chromatography allowing us to achieve it without the isolations it should be noted that purification of a sample prior to an analysis is favorable because these separations are incomplete in some cases even so a high resolution ms has a capability of separating m z values of unknowns from complicated matrices because a state of the art ms has resolving powers greater than 1 00 000 fwhm at m z 400 takanashi et al 2012 another problem of ft ir and nmr is their insufficient sensitivity for example li et al 2017 and köppen et al 2017 reported that 10 mg of isolated analytes had been used to analyze their samples with ft ir and 1h nmr the sensitivity of a high resolution ms is generally superior to that of ft ir or nmr from one fg to one ng of analyte is typically required in a structural elucidation with a high resolution ms for example carpinteiro et al 2017 injected 50 ng of their samples into a lc tof ms and successfully elucidated the chemical structures in their sample thanks to these advantages a high resolution ms has been utilized in the research filed of environments and many papers carpinteiro et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 yuthawong et al 2017 cotton et al 2016 hosono et al 2016 phungsai et al 2016 wang et al 2016 matsushita et al 2015 can be found the objective of this work was to identify a mutagen produced by chlorine treatment of dd aqueous solution with the high resolution mss and multivariate analyses identification of the mutagen is expected to contribute to developing a safer water purification technology developing a safer pesticide and achieving a safer water resource management 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals a representative component of dd dcp 96 0 dca 97 0 and dnph wetted with ca 50 water were purchased

mutagen s dcp was added to 0 5 m phosphate buffer solutions ph 7 00 0 01 the concentration of the added dcp was 4 40 mm 500 mg l being greater than the expected environmental concentration this greater concentration was chosen to securely explore unknown mutagen s the solutions were stirred for 24 h under light shading at 21 c sodium hypochlorite was added to the solutions in the range from 0 to 4 00 mol cl2 mol dcp then the solutions were stirred again for 24 h under light shading at 21 c residual chlorine concentrations in the chlorine treated samples were determined by the dpd colorimetric method the residual chlorine was not quenched because dechlorination reagents may react with cbps produced from dcp an aliquot 100 ml of the solutions was acidified to ph 2 0 0 1 with 2 5 m sulfuric acid and then fed to a sep pak plus csp 800 cartridge nihon waters tokyo japan to adsorb the cbps takanashi et al 2001 this acidification was conducted to recover week acids with the csp 800 resin the adsorbed cbps were eluted from the cartridge with 2 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide and the eluates were applied to the ames test because dimethyl sulfoxide is difficult to inject to the lc ms another sample preparation procedure was applied another aliquot 100 ml of the solutions was mixed with 10 ml of dichloromethane to extract the cbps the extraction procedure was repeated twice to achieve a high recovery of the cbps the recovered compounds consisted of the cbps and impurities were derivatized with dnph this derivatization was conducted since almost no ion was detected from underivatized samples the detailed procedure of the derivatization is illustrated in supplemental information fig s2 the derivatized samples were analyzed by a lc ms blank samples contained no dcp and appropriate concentrations of chlorine 2 20 17 6 mm cl2 and a control sample contained 4 40 mm dcp and no chlorine were prepared to perform mvas the sample preparation conditions are summarized in table 1 2 2 2 practical concentration samples dcp was added to an actual tap water sample ph 7 15 residual chlorine 0 10 mg cl2 l collected at kagoshima university the concentrations of the added dcp

summing the residual chlorine in the collected tap water and the added one the total chlorine concentrations were 0 10 or 1 27 mg cl2 l 1 45 or 17 8 μmol cl2 residual chlorine concentrations were determined by the dpd colorimetric method the residual chlorine was not quenched because dechlorination reagents may react with cbps produced from dcp of the solutions 1000 ml were acidified to ph 2 0 0 1 with 2 5 m sulfuric acid and then fed to a sep pak plus ps 2 cartridge nihon waters to adsorb the cbps the adsorbed cbps were eluted from the cartridge with 10 ml of acetonitrile this concentration method was adapted because it is easy to perform the recovered cbps were derivartized in the same manner with the high concentration samples the sample preparation conditions are summarized in table 2 2 3 ames salmonella mutagenicity test the preincubation method of the ames test using salmonella typhimurium ta100 strains without exogenous activation s9 was adopted according to the guidebook published by japan s ministry of health labour and welfare ministry of labour japan 1991 the test was performed with four or seven dose steps and with duplicate plates for each step quadruplet plates were used for the negative control tests takanashi and urano 1998 positive control substance of 4nqo was used to confirm to the strains specific activities showing 7300 10 000 net revertant colonies μg 4nqo the negative control test results were 80 183 revertant colonies plate 2 4 lc ms analysis for multivariate analysis to obtain tic chromatograms of the derivatized cbps in a negative ion mode quantitative mass analyses were performed using a uplc acquity h class waters ma usa interfaced to a calibrated tof ms synapt g2 si hdms waters with an esi source an ods column beh c18 1 7 μm 2 1 50 mm waters was used as a uplc column the column temperature was maintained at 40 c injected sample volume was 1 μl mobile phase a was pure water and mobile phase b was acetonitrile containing 5 v of pure water both mobile phases contain acetate buffer consists of 1 mm ammonium acetate and 1 mm acetic acid the optimized binary program was as follows started at the mobile phase b at 10 v maintaining for 0 5 min increasing linearly up to 100 v over a period of 7 min the volumetric flowrate was maintained at 0 5 ml min lv 2 4 mm s before conducting consecutive analyses pure acetonitrile was injected to wash and equilibrate the ods column using a different binary program detailed conditions of the tof ms are summarized in supplemental information table s1 data processing was carried out using the masslynx v4 1 software waters so an obtained m z value did not account for the presence of an extra electron in an anion hereafter referred to masslynx mass 2 5 multivariate analysis obtained tic chromatograms were aligned their retention times by using a lc ms data analysis software progenesis qi v2 1 nonlinear dynamics newcastle upon tyne uk components in the chlorine treated dcp samples whose peak volumes were greater than or equal to twice their peak volumes in the blank samples hereafter referred to unique components were selected with progenesis qi the opls ra analysis was performed in a mva software pls toolbox v8 0 2 eigenvector research wa usa between the mutagenicities of the chlorine treated dcp samples and the peak volumes of the selected unique components the correlation analysis was performed in another mva software spss medical model 23 ibm ny usa between the mutagenicities and the peak volumes the multiple linear regression analysis stepwise selection method was performed in the spss medical model 23 software between the mutagenicities and the peak volumes whose vip score exceed one and pearson coefficient of correlation r exceeded 0 4 2 6 lc ms analysis for structural elucidation and identification structural elucidation of the component explored by the mva was conducted by accurate mass analyses and natural isotopologue pattern analyses identification of the component was conducted by cochromatography with an authentic standard and analyses of first generation product ion spectra chromatograms and spectra were obtained with a hplc lc 20ad shimadzu kyoto japan interfaced to a calibrated ft ms ltq orbitrap xl thermo fisher scientific ma usa with an apci source in a negative ion mode collision induced disassociation was performed to obtain the first generation product ion spectra using a linear ion trap helium 99 999 was used as buffer gas for the ion trap the apci source was employed because of its high sensitivity for dnph derivatives a silica column inertsil sil 100a 5 μm 4 6 75 mm gl sciences tokyo japan was used as a hplc column mobile phase a was n hexane and mobile phase b was 2 propanol isocratic analyses were conducted at 96 7 v of the mobile phase a at volumetric flowrate of 1 0 ml min lv 1 0 mm s injected sample volume was 20 μl detailed conditions are summarized in supplemental information table s2 data processing was carried out using the xcalibur v2 1 0 sp1 software thermo fisher scientific so an obtained m z value accounts for the presence of an extra electron in an anion hereafter referred to xcalibur mass 2 7 lc ms analysis for detecting 1 3 dichloroacetone in practical concentration samples the uplc acquity h class interfaced to a calibrated tof ms synapt g2 si hdms with an apci source was used to detect dca from the practical concentration samples this instrument was selected because of high sensitivity the stationary phase the mobile phases and the isocratic condition were the same with those for ft ms detailed conditions of the tof ms are summarized in supplemental information table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 multivariate analysis the residual chlorine concentrations and the mutagenicities of the chlorine treated dcp samples are shown in table 1 dose response curves of the ames mutagenicity assays are shown in supplemental information fig s3 no downturn was observed for all the results within the tested sample dose indicating that specific activities can be calculated from the initial slopes of the dose response curves the mutagenicity was detected from the control sample indicating that dcp is mutagenic against ta100 strain this test result was compared to the information in the ccris database which has peer reviewed mutagenicity test results https toxnet nlm nih gov cgi bin sis htmlgen ccris accessible august 9 2018 four positive test results and no negative test result using ta100 strain can be found in the database for dcp which is consistent with the result in the present study in contrast the mutagenicities of the blank samples were all below the detection limit showing no detectable mutagen was produced in the experimental apparatuses through the chlorine treatments the maximum mutagenicity of the chlorine treated dcp samples was 1800 net revertant colony μmol dcp which is ca five times greater than that of dcp itself and no mutagenicities were observed from the blank samples hence it is during the chlorine treatment that mutagenic cbps were produced from dcp the residual chlorine concentrations of the samples 1 4 increased with increasing the chlorine dosage up to 3 00 mol cl2 mol dcp sample 3 the mutagenicity increased with increasing the chlorine dosage but it decreased with the dosage at 4 00 mol cl2 mol dcp this may be attributed to decomposition of mutagenic cbps by residual chlorine even if the produced mutagenic cbps are decomposed the mva will be able to reveal the mutagenic cbps because their concentrations applied to the ames mutagenicity assay and those applied to the lc ms analyses will provide a certain relationship although the number of detected components in the lc ms data was 1 628 most of them were considered to be impurities the number of the unique components in the chlorine treated dcp samples was reduced to ten by subtracting components in the blank samples the opls ra analysis and the regression analysis were performed for these ten components the obtained results are plotted in fig 1 among these ten components three components were focused on as their vip score 1 and r 0 4 vip score 2 48 r 0 989 for component 1 vip score 4 35 r 0 921 for component 2 vip score 2 23 r 0 698 for component 3 the multiple linear regression analysis was performed for the three components resulting in elimination of component 2 and 3 because the number of selected component was one a simple linear regression analytical model was provided as shown in equation 1 1 y 4 13 10 3 x 219 where y is the mutagenicity of the chlorine treated dcp net revertant colony μmol dcp x is the peak volume of component 1 count in the lc ms analyses model summary anova results and coefficients are shown in tables s3 s5 the obtained model can be judged to be reliable and significant because the adjusted r square was greater than 0 8 and significance in anova was less than 0 05 multicollinearity among the independent variables would not be of concern in the regression model as vif value was less than 5 one major mutagenic cbp was expected to exist in the chlorine treated dcp samples since equation 1 contains one independent variable the peak volume of component 1 are plotted against the mutagenicities for each chlorine treated dcp sample fig 2 the proportional relationship between them suggests that component 1 is a major mutagen in the chlorine treated dcp sample 3 2 structural elucidation and identification of the found component data acquired by the tof ms showed that the accurate mass and the aligned retention time of component 1 were m z 304 9840 masslynx mass and 2 76 min the mass spectrum of component 1 is shown in supplemental information fig s4 the accurate mass and the natural isotopic pattern of component 1 were analyzed with the ft ms to examine its molecular formula fig 3 a monoisotopic mass of component 1 was determined as m z 304 9850 xcalibur mass the discrepancy between the masslynx mass and the xcalibur mass can be attributed to mass error in the measurements and the difference in the calculation manner of a m z value as described in the experimental section isotope peaks consisted of 13c 15n and 37cl c9h7cl2n4o4 c9h7cl2n3 15no4 c8 13ch7cl2n4o4 c9h7cl37cln4o4 c8 13ch7cl37cln4o4 and c9h7 37cl2n4o4 can be found in the observed mass spectrum in fig 3 from this isotopic pattern it is obvious that the charge number of component 1 was one and it has approximately nine carbon atoms and two chlorine atoms within its structure the accurate mass and the natural isotopic pattern suggest that the molecular formula of component 1 is c9h7cl2n4o4 mass error 0 11 ppm natural isotopic pattern of c9h7cl2n4o4 was simulated and shown in fig 3 the observed and the simulated natural isotopic patterns were in correspondence with each other from the nitrogen rule the ion of m z 304 9850 was confirmed to be an even electron ion these results supported that the molecular formula of component 1 was c9h7cl2n4o4 neutral formula may be c9h8cl2n4o4 because the ion may be a deprotonated ion the chemical structure of component 1 was speculated to elucidate the chemical structure of the found mutagenic cbp underivatized component 1 the molecular formula of the underivatized component 1 is estimated to be c3h4cl2o based on the reaction mechanism of dnph with carbonyl compounds carbonyl compounds having molecular formula of c3h4cl2o may be 1 1 dichloroacetone 1 3 dichloroacetone dca 2 2 dichloropropanal or 3 3 dichloropropanal among them dca was presumed as the underivatized component 1 a purchased chemical reagent of dca was derivatized with dnph to confirm this the derivatization and purification were performed in the same manner as conducted for the chlorine treated and concentrated dcp samples 1h nmr analysis 400 mhz chloroform d was performed to confirm whether the derivatization and purification went well the detected nmr peaks were as follows δ 11 49 s 1h 9 15 d j 2 7 hz 1h 8 39 dd j 9 6 2 7 hz 1h 8 00 d j 9 6 hz 1h 4 41 s 2h 4 36 s 2h all the detected peaks were assigned to be those of dca dnph or the solvent and no peak of impurity was found the derivatized and purified dca dnph was used as an authentic standard cochromatography between component 1 and the standard was performed each of the chlorine treated dcp sample and the standard dca dnph was injected twice in technical replicates component 1 and the standard had the identical retention time at 1 78 min and mass spectrum figs 3 and 4 further verification of the identification was made by comparing their first generation product ion spectra fig 5 the first generation product ion spectrum of the chlorine treated dcp sample derivatized with dnph was in correspondence with that of the standard because of the narrow isolation width of precursor ion 0 75 da isotopologue ions of 15n 13c and 37cl could not be observed on the mass spectra of both the samples product ion of m z 266 9921 was observed only in the mass spectrum of component 1 and none of the ion was observed in that of the standard compound this discrepancy may be caused by impurities in the chlorine treated dcp sample the identical retention times and mass spectra proved that component 1 was identified to be dca derivatized by dnph 3 3 toxicity of 1 3 dichloroacetone the mutagenicity test of dca was performed and its result is shown in supplemental information fig s5 the mutagenicity of 160 000 net revertant colony μmol dca was observed against ta100 strain without s9mix metabolic activation the tef of dca the mutagenicity of dca that of 4nqo was 0 14 the mutagenicity of dca was compared to the results in the ccris database three positive test results and no negative test result using ta100 strain without s9mix metabolic activation can be found in the database for dca which is consistent with the result in the present study the mutagenicity of dca was compared to three typical mutagens i e 4nqo mx and chlorodibromomethane the mutagenicity of 4nqo which is a typical standard substance of the ames mutagenicity assay ministry of labour japan 1991 was reported as 8900 10 300 net revertant μg 4nqo takanashi et al 2014 they are equal to 1 690 000 1 960 000 net revertant μmol 4nqo from these figures the mutagenicity of dca can be calculated as one eleventh to one twelfth of that of 4nqo the mutagenicity of mx was reported to be 2 800 000 10 000 000 net revertant μmol mx holmbom et al 1984 the mutagenicity of dca is one 63rd to one 18th of that of mx on the other hand the mutagenicities of trihalomethanes typical cbps in tap waters were reported to be weaker than that of dca simmon et al 1977 chlorodibromomethane was reported to be the strongest mutagen among trihalomethanes simmon et al 1977 but its mutagenicity was reported as 4 net revertant μmol the mutagenicity of dca is 40 000 times as great as that of chlorodibromomethane this fact intrigues our future research interest on dca concentration in tap waters the mutagenicity of the sample treated at 4 80 mol cl2 mol dcp was 5760 net revertant μmol dcp as shown in supplemental information fig s5 the dca dnph concentration in the sample was determined by using lc ms the obtained calibration curve and eics of dca dnph are shown in supplemental information figs s6 and s7 from these results the dca yield in the same sample was determined to be 3 5 mol dca mol dcp as shown in table 3 low yield of dca indicates that the formation reaction of dca is a miner one and major cbp s from dcp must be non mutagenic from the mutagenicity of the chlorine treated dcp sample the specific mutagenicity of dca and the dca concentration in the sample the mutagenic contribution of dca to the chlorine treated dcp sample was calculated and the result is shown in table 3 high contribution 98 clearly shows that dca is the major mutagen in the chlorine treated dcp sample as well as the mutagenicity dca was reported to have acute toxicity against mice who 1996 and cytotoxicity against isolated rat hepatocytes hammond and fry 1997 besides mutagenicity furthermore andres et al 2013 pointed out that dca had teratogenicity various toxicities particularly teratogenicity also intrigue our future research interest on dca concentration in tap waters 3 4 a possible reaction mechanism for 1 3 dichloroacetone formation and detection from practical concentration samples a possible reaction mechanism for dca formation through chlorine treatment in water is illustrated in fig 6 it was proposed based on a reaction mechanism between 2 3 dichloropropene and chlorine in water to give dca hopwood and williams 1968 dcp reacts in water with hclo to give 3 membered chloronium cation ii which is initiated by electrophilic attack of a positively charged chlorine atom like a complex i after that ii partially isomerizes to two kinds of carbocations 1 2 3 trichloroprop 1 yl cation iii and 1 1 3 trichloroprop 2 yl cation through opening the 3 membered ring of ii the latter cation could look more stable than former one iii because of triple substitutions with two chlorine atoms and one alkyl at an identical carbocation but it is not the case for this cation for the latter cation the repulsive interaction between two chlorine atoms helps one of them migrate into the adjacent carbon atom to form iii this hypothesis was tested theoretically by computational chemistry the test was performed with the 6 311 g d p level of theory with three types of density functionals of b3lyp becke 1993 m06 2x zhao and truhlar 2008 and ωb97xd chai and gordon 2008 resulting in unstable formation of 1 1 3 trichloroprop 2 yl a subsequent hydride shift toward the positively charged carbon atom to form carbocation iv which was confirmed by finding a ts of the hydride migration in the same level of theory with all the functionals the ts had electronic energy of 12 6 kcal mol higher than iii and iv had electronic energy of 16 4 kcal mol lower than the ts nucleophilic attack by oh to form v subsequent chloride release to give vi and dca formation by proton release are all rationally expected because the exploration of dca was performed by using the unrealistic high concentrations of dcp and chlorine formation of dca from the practical concentration samples was examined the results are shown in fig 7 dca was not detected from the blank samples which contain no dcp on the contrary it was detected from all the samples containing dcp including the control samples the concentration of formed dca increases almost proportionally with the initial dcp concentrations proving that dca formation reaction takes place in the practical concentrations of dca and chlorine also the proportional increase suggests that the dca formation reaction obeys first order kinetics 4 conclusions a strong mutagen was explored from a chlorine treated aqueous solution of dd a typical nematocide by coupling high resolution mass spectrometers with multivariable analyses 1 3 dichloroacetone dca was identified as a major mutagen in the model aqueous solutions containing dca 500 mg l dca formation reaction took place in the practical concentrations of dca and chlorine combination of high resolution mass spectrometry and multivariable analysis is effective to explore unknown contaminants in environmental samples acknowledgments this study was partially supported by the environment

tap water quality management dd in the raw water for tap water will be chlorinated at waterworks one would expect that chlorine treatment of organic compounds produces hazardous by products so chlorination of dd may also be of concern for example wang et al 2007 revealed that toxicants causing luminescence inhibition had been produced through chlorine treatment of domestic wastewater treatment effluent and reclamation plant effluent the authors reported formation of mutagenic chlorination by products mcps from pesticides and their transformation products kishida et al 2008 takanashi et al 2013 2014 2016 the mcps from dd however has not been reported to the best of our knowledge in order to elucidate chemical structures of unknowns ft ir nmr and a high resolution ms have been utilized in the fields of organic chemistry köppen et al 2017 natural products chemistry abdelrahman et al 2017 and so on however isolation of targeted unknowns from complicated matrices is prerequisite for ft ir and nmr while it is difficult to be achieved for environmental samples in contrast a high resolution ms is generally compatible chromatographic techniques such as liquid chromatography or gas chromatography allowing us to achieve it without the isolations it should be noted that purification of a sample prior to an analysis is favorable because these separations are incomplete in some cases even so a high resolution ms has a capability of separating m z values of unknowns from complicated matrices because a state of the art ms has resolving powers greater than 1 00 000 fwhm at m z 400 takanashi et al 2012 another problem of ft ir and nmr is their insufficient sensitivity for example li et al 2017 and köppen et al 2017 reported that 10 mg of isolated analytes had been used to analyze their samples with ft ir and 1h nmr the sensitivity of a high resolution ms is generally superior to that of ft ir or nmr from one fg to one ng of analyte is typically required in a structural elucidation with a high resolution ms for example carpinteiro et al 2017 injected 50 ng of their samples into a lc tof ms and successfully elucidated the chemical structures in their sample thanks to these advantages a high resolution ms has been utilized in the research filed of environments and many papers carpinteiro et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 yuthawong et al 2017 cotton et al 2016 hosono et al 2016 phungsai et al 2016 wang et al 2016 matsushita et al 2015 can be found the objective of this work was to identify a mutagen produced by chlorine treatment of dd aqueous solution with the high resolution mss and multivariate analyses identification of the mutagen is expected to contribute to developing a safer water purification technology developing a safer pesticide and achieving a safer water resource management 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals a representative component of dd dcp 96 0 dca 97 0 and dnph wetted with ca 50 water were purchased

mutagen s dcp was added to 0 5 m phosphate buffer solutions ph 7 00 0 01 the concentration of the added dcp was 4 40 mm 500 mg l being greater than the expected environmental concentration this greater concentration was chosen to securely explore unknown mutagen s the solutions were stirred for 24 h under light shading at 21 c sodium hypochlorite was added to the solutions in the range from 0 to 4 00 mol cl2 mol dcp then the solutions were stirred again for 24 h under light shading at 21 c residual chlorine concentrations in the chlorine treated samples were determined by the dpd colorimetric method the residual chlorine was not quenched because dechlorination reagents may react with cbps produced from dcp an aliquot 100 ml of the solutions was acidified to ph 2 0 0 1 with 2 5 m sulfuric acid and then fed to a sep pak plus csp 800 cartridge nihon waters tokyo japan to adsorb the cbps takanashi et al 2001 this acidification was conducted to recover week acids with the csp 800 resin the adsorbed cbps were eluted from the cartridge with 2 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide and the eluates were applied to the ames test because dimethyl sulfoxide is difficult to inject to the lc ms another sample preparation procedure was applied another aliquot 100 ml of the solutions was mixed with 10 ml of dichloromethane to extract the cbps the extraction procedure was repeated twice to achieve a high recovery of the cbps the recovered compounds consisted of the cbps and impurities were derivatized with dnph this derivatization was conducted since almost no ion was detected from underivatized samples the detailed procedure of the derivatization is illustrated in supplemental information fig s2 the derivatized samples were analyzed by a lc ms blank samples contained no dcp and appropriate concentrations of chlorine 2 20 17 6 mm cl2 and a control sample contained 4 40 mm dcp and no chlorine were prepared to perform mvas the sample preparation conditions are summarized in

summing the residual chlorine in the collected tap water and the added one the total chlorine concentrations were 0 10 or 1 27 mg cl2 l 1 45 or 17 8 μmol cl2 residual chlorine concentrations were determined by the dpd colorimetric method the residual chlorine was not quenched because dechlorination reagents may react with cbps produced from dcp of the solutions 1000 ml were acidified to ph 2 0 0 1 with 2 5 m sulfuric acid and then fed to a sep pak plus ps 2 cartridge nihon waters to adsorb the cbps the adsorbed cbps were eluted from the cartridge with 10 ml of acetonitrile this concentration method was adapted because it is easy to perform the recovered cbps were derivartized in the same manner with the high concentration samples the sample preparation conditions are summarized in table 2 2 3 ames salmonella mutagenicity test the preincubation method of the ames test using salmonella typhimurium ta100 strains without exogenous activation s9 was adopted according to the guidebook published by japan s ministry of health labour and welfare ministry of labour japan 1991 the test was performed with four or seven dose steps and with duplicate plates for each step quadruplet plates were used for the negative control tests takanashi and urano 1998 positive control substance of 4nqo was used to confirm to the strains specific activities showing 7300 10 000 net

c18 1 7 μm 2 1 50 mm waters was used as a uplc column the column temperature was maintained at 40 c injected sample volume was 1 μl mobile phase a was pure water and mobile phase b was acetonitrile containing 5 v of pure water both mobile phases contain acetate buffer consists of 1 mm ammonium acetate and 1 mm acetic acid the optimized binary program was as follows started at the mobile phase b at 10 v maintaining for 0 5 min increasing linearly up to 100 v over a period of 7 min the volumetric flowrate was maintained at 0 5 ml min lv 2 4 mm s before conducting consecutive analyses pure acetonitrile was injected to wash and equilibrate the ods column using a different binary program detailed conditions of the tof ms are summarized in supplemental information table s1 data processing was carried out using the masslynx v4 1 software waters so an obtained m z value did not account for the presence of an extra electron in an anion hereafter referred to masslynx mass 2 5 multivariate analysis obtained tic chromatograms were aligned their retention times by using a lc ms data analysis software progenesis qi v2 1 nonlinear dynamics newcastle upon tyne uk components in the chlorine

analysis was performed in a mva software pls toolbox v8 0 2 eigenvector research wa usa between the mutagenicities of the chlorine treated dcp samples and the peak volumes of the selected unique components the correlation analysis was performed in another mva software spss medical model 23 ibm ny usa between the mutagenicities and the peak volumes the multiple linear regression analysis stepwise selection method was performed in the spss medical model 23 software between the mutagenicities and the peak volumes whose vip score exceed one and pearson coefficient of correlation r exceeded 0 4 2 6 lc ms analysis for structural elucidation and identification structural elucidation of the component explored by the mva was conducted by accurate mass analyses and natural isotopologue pattern analyses identification of the component was conducted by cochromatography with an authentic standard and analyses of first generation product ion spectra chromatograms and spectra were obtained with a hplc lc 20ad shimadzu kyoto japan interfaced to a calibrated ft ms ltq orbitrap xl thermo fisher scientific ma usa with an apci source in a negative ion mode collision induced disassociation was performed to obtain the first generation product ion spectra using a linear ion trap helium 99 999 was used as buffer gas for the ion trap the apci source was employed because of its high sensitivity for dnph derivatives a silica column inertsil sil 100a 5 μm 4 6 75 mm gl sciences tokyo japan was used as a hplc column mobile phase a was n hexane and mobile phase b

ms synapt g2 si hdms with an apci source was used to detect dca from the practical concentration samples this instrument was selected because of high sensitivity the stationary phase the mobile phases and the isocratic condition were the same with those for ft ms detailed conditions of the tof ms are summarized in supplemental information table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 multivariate analysis the residual chlorine concentrations and the mutagenicities of the chlorine treated dcp samples are shown in table 1 dose response curves of the ames mutagenicity assays are shown in supplemental information fig s3 no downturn was observed for all the results within the tested sample dose indicating that specific activities can be calculated from the initial slopes of the dose response curves the mutagenicity was detected from the control sample indicating that dcp is mutagenic against ta100 strain this test result was compared to the information in the ccris database which has peer reviewed mutagenicity test results https toxnet nlm nih gov cgi bin sis htmlgen ccris accessible august 9 2018 four positive test results and no negative test result using ta100 strain can be found in the database for dcp which is consistent with the result in the present study in contrast the mutagenicities of the blank samples were all below the detection limit showing no detectable mutagen was produced in the experimental apparatuses through the chlorine treatments the maximum mutagenicity of the chlorine treated dcp samples was 1800 net revertant colony μmol dcp which is ca five times greater than that of dcp itself and no mutagenicities were observed from the blank samples hence it is during the chlorine treatment that mutagenic cbps were produced from dcp the residual chlorine concentrations of the samples 1 4 increased with increasing the chlorine dosage up to 3 00 mol cl2 mol dcp sample 3 the mutagenicity increased with increasing the chlorine dosage but it decreased with the dosage at 4 00 mol cl2 mol dcp this may be attributed to decomposition of mutagenic cbps by residual chlorine even if the produced mutagenic cbps are decomposed the mva will be able to reveal the mutagenic cbps because their concentrations applied to the ames mutagenicity assay and those applied to the lc ms analyses will provide a certain relationship although the number of detected components in the lc ms data was 1 628 most of them were considered to be impurities the number of the unique components in the chlorine treated dcp samples was reduced to ten by subtracting components in the blank samples the opls ra analysis and the regression analysis were performed for these ten components the obtained results are plotted in fig 1 among these ten components three components were focused on as their vip score 1 and r 0 4 vip score 2 48 r 0 989 for component 1 vip score 4 35 r 0 921 for component 2 vip score 2 23 r 0 698 for component 3 the multiple linear regression analysis was performed for the three components resulting in elimination of component 2 and 3 because the number of selected component was one a simple linear regression analytical model was provided as shown in equation 1 1 y 4 13 10 3 x 219 where y is the mutagenicity of the chlorine treated dcp net revertant colony μmol dcp x is the peak volume of component 1 count in the lc ms analyses model summary anova results and coefficients are shown in tables s3 s5 the obtained model can be judged to be reliable and significant because the adjusted r square was greater than 0 8 and significance in anova was less than 0 05 multicollinearity among the independent variables would not be of concern in the regression model as vif value was less than 5 one major mutagenic cbp was expected to exist in the chlorine treated dcp samples since equation 1 contains one independent variable the peak volume of component 1 are plotted against the mutagenicities for each chlorine treated dcp sample fig 2 the proportional relationship between them suggests that component 1 is a major mutagen in the chlorine treated dcp sample 3 2 structural elucidation and identification of the found component data acquired by the tof ms showed that the accurate mass and the aligned retention time of component 1 were m z 304 9840 masslynx mass and 2 76 min the mass spectrum of component 1 is shown in supplemental information fig s4 the accurate mass and the natural isotopic pattern of component 1 were analyzed with the ft ms to examine its molecular formula fig 3 a monoisotopic mass of component 1 was determined as m z 304 9850 xcalibur mass the discrepancy between the masslynx mass and the xcalibur mass can be attributed to mass error in the measurements and the difference in the calculation manner of a m z value as described in the experimental section isotope peaks consisted of 13c 15n and 37cl c9h7cl2n4o4 c9h7cl2n3 15no4 c8 13ch7cl2n4o4 c9h7cl37cln4o4 c8 13ch7cl37cln4o4 and c9h7 37cl2n4o4 can be found in the observed mass spectrum in fig 3 from this isotopic pattern it is obvious that the charge number of component 1 was one and it has approximately nine carbon atoms and two chlorine atoms within its structure the accurate mass and the natural isotopic pattern suggest that the molecular formula of component 1 is c9h7cl2n4o4 mass error 0 11 ppm natural isotopic pattern of c9h7cl2n4o4 was simulated and shown in fig 3 the observed and the simulated natural isotopic patterns were in correspondence with each other from the nitrogen rule the ion of m z 304 9850 was confirmed to be an even electron ion these results supported that the molecular formula of component 1 was c9h7cl2n4o4 neutral formula may be c9h8cl2n4o4 because the ion may be a deprotonated ion the chemical structure of component 1 was speculated to elucidate the chemical structure of the found mutagenic cbp underivatized component 1 the molecular formula of the underivatized component 1 is estimated to be c3h4cl2o based on the reaction mechanism of dnph with carbonyl compounds carbonyl compounds having molecular formula of c3h4cl2o may be 1 1 dichloroacetone 1 3 dichloroacetone dca 2 2 dichloropropanal or 3 3 dichloropropanal among them dca was presumed as the underivatized component 1 a purchased chemical reagent of dca was derivatized with dnph to confirm this the derivatization and purification were performed in the same manner as conducted for the chlorine treated and concentrated dcp samples 1h nmr analysis 400 mhz chloroform d was performed to confirm whether the derivatization and purification went well the detected nmr peaks were as follows δ 11 49 s 1h 9 15 d j 2 7 hz 1h 8 39 dd j 9 6 2 7 hz 1h 8 00 d j 9 6 hz 1h 4 41 s 2h 4 36 s 2h all the detected peaks were assigned to be those of dca dnph or the solvent and no peak of impurity was found the derivatized and purified dca dnph was used as an authentic standard cochromatography between component 1 and the standard was performed each of the chlorine treated dcp sample and the standard dca dnph was injected twice in technical replicates component 1 and the standard had the identical retention time at 1 78 min and mass spectrum figs 3 and 4 further verification of the identification was made by comparing their first generation product ion spectra fig 5 the first generation product ion spectrum of the chlorine treated dcp sample derivatized with dnph was in correspondence with that of the standard because of the narrow isolation width of precursor ion 0 75 da isotopologue ions of 15n 13c and 37cl could not be observed on the mass spectra of both the samples product ion of m z 266 9921 was observed only in the mass spectrum of component 1 and none of the ion was observed in that of the standard compound this discrepancy may be caused by impurities in the chlorine treated dcp sample the identical retention times and mass spectra proved that component 1 was identified to be dca derivatized by dnph 3 3 toxicity of 1 3 dichloroacetone the mutagenicity test of dca was performed and its result is shown in supplemental information fig s5 the mutagenicity of 160 000 net revertant colony μmol dca was observed against ta100 strain without s9mix metabolic activation the tef of dca the mutagenicity of dca that of 4nqo was 0 14 the mutagenicity of dca was compared to the results in the ccris database three positive test results and no negative test result using ta100 strain without s9mix metabolic activation can be found in the database for dca which is consistent with the result in the present study the mutagenicity of dca was compared to three typical mutagens i e 4nqo mx and chlorodibromomethane the mutagenicity of 4nqo which is a typical standard substance of the ames mutagenicity assay ministry of labour japan 1991 was reported as 8900 10 300 net revertant μg 4nqo takanashi et al 2014 they are equal to 1 690 000 1 960 000 net revertant μmol 4nqo from these figures the mutagenicity of dca can be calculated as one eleventh to one twelfth of that of 4nqo the mutagenicity of mx was reported to be 2 800 000 10 000 000 net revertant μmol mx holmbom et al 1984 the mutagenicity of dca is one 63rd to one 18th of that of mx on the other hand the mutagenicities of trihalomethanes typical cbps in tap waters were reported to be weaker than that of dca simmon et al 1977 chlorodibromomethane was reported to be the strongest mutagen among trihalomethanes simmon et al 1977 but its mutagenicity was reported as 4 net revertant μmol the mutagenicity of dca is 40 000 times as great as that of chlorodibromomethane this fact intrigues our future research interest on dca concentration in tap waters the mutagenicity of the sample treated at 4 80 mol cl2 mol dcp was 5760 net revertant μmol dcp as shown in supplemental information fig s5 the dca dnph concentration in the sample was determined by using lc ms the obtained calibration curve and eics of dca dnph are shown in supplemental information figs s6 and s7 from these results the dca yield in the same sample was determined to be 3 5 mol dca mol dcp as shown in table 3 low yield of dca indicates that the formation reaction of dca is a miner one and major cbp s from dcp must be non mutagenic from the mutagenicity of the chlorine treated dcp sample the specific mutagenicity of dca and the dca concentration in the sample the mutagenic contribution of dca to the chlorine treated dcp sample was calculated and the result is shown in table 3 high contribution 98 clearly shows that dca is the major mutagen in the chlorine treated dcp sample as well as the mutagenicity dca was reported to have acute toxicity against mice who 1996 and cytotoxicity against isolated rat hepatocytes hammond and fry 1997 besides mutagenicity furthermore andres et al 2013 pointed out that dca had teratogenicity various toxicities particularly teratogenicity also intrigue our future research interest on dca concentration in tap waters 3 4 a possible reaction mechanism for 1 3 dichloroacetone formation and detection from practical concentration samples a possible reaction mechanism for dca formation through chlorine treatment in water is illustrated in fig 6 it was proposed based on a reaction mechanism between 2 3 dichloropropene and chlorine in water to give dca hopwood and williams 1968 dcp reacts in water with hclo to give 3 membered chloronium cation ii which is initiated by electrophilic attack of a positively charged chlorine atom like a complex i after that ii partially isomerizes to two kinds of carbocations 1 2 3 trichloroprop 1 yl cation iii and 1 1 3 trichloroprop 2 yl cation through opening the 3 membered ring of ii the latter cation could look more stable than former one iii because of triple substitutions with two chlorine atoms and one alkyl at an identical carbocation but it is not the case for this cation for the latter cation the repulsive interaction between two chlorine atoms helps one of them migrate into the adjacent carbon atom to form iii this hypothesis was tested theoretically by computational chemistry the test was performed with the 6 311 g d p level of theory with three types of density functionals of b3lyp becke 1993 m06 2x zhao and truhlar 2008 and ωb97xd chai and gordon 2008 resulting in unstable formation of 1 1 3 trichloroprop 2 yl a subsequent hydride shift toward the positively charged carbon atom to form carbocation iv which was confirmed by finding a ts of the hydride migration in the same level of theory with all the functionals the ts had electronic energy of 12 6 kcal mol higher than iii and iv had electronic energy of 16 4 kcal mol lower than the ts nucleophilic attack by oh to form v subsequent chloride release to give vi and dca formation by proton release are all rationally expected because the exploration of dca was performed by using the unrealistic high concentrations of dcp and chlorine formation of dca from the practical concentration samples was examined the results are shown in fig 7 dca was not detected from the blank samples which contain no dcp on the contrary it was detected from all the samples containing dcp including the control samples the concentration of formed dca increases almost proportionally with the initial dcp concentrations proving that dca formation reaction takes place in the practical concentrations of dca and chlorine also the proportional increase suggests that the dca formation reaction obeys first order kinetics 4 conclusions a strong mutagen was explored from a chlorine treated aqueous solution of dd a typical nematocide by coupling high resolution mass spectrometers with multivariable analyses 1 3 dichloroacetone dca was identified as a major mutagen in the model aqueous solutions containing dca 500 mg l dca formation reaction took place in the practical concentrations of dca and chlorine combination of high resolution mass spectrometry and multivariable analysis is effective to explore unknown contaminants in environmental samples acknowledgments this study was partially supported by the environment

denitrifying bacteria belong to varied physiological and taxonomic groups and possess the ability to use different carbon sources lu and chandran 2010 and different levels of reduction of nitrogen oxides via partial or complete denitrification lu et al 2014 as carbon and nitrogen compound utilization is applied by different microbial pathways and functional groups most studies have focused on either nitrogen or carbon utilization pathways the ratio of carbon to nitrogen c n at the feed of wastewater streams 200 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod and 40 mg l n has a significant effect on the bacterial dynamics in the process in addition the level of degradability of the organic carbon is lower after the secondary treatment in comparison to wastewater shon et al 2006 bassin et al 2015 showed the significance of cod concentration on bacteria s functional activity and diversity while li et al 2012 showed that the level of organic carbon biodegradability influences community structure and function in soil columns in addition higher abundance and activity of nitrifiers was related to a lower 2 ratio of c n in the feed stream albuquerque et al 2012 xia et al 2008 where dominance of the genus nitrospira was demonstrated for wastewater streams and water sand filters bassin et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 thus the c n ratio is a key design parameter for downstream tertiary treatment most controlled studies simulating infiltration systems in the laboratory and on a pilot scale use saturated column set ups and do not simulate the effects of flooding drying conditions on process efficiency synthetic secondary effluent is commonly used to simulate laboratory effluent for infiltration in the sat microbial ecology and function in the sat process has especially been poorly studied the biotransformations in infiltration systems are mostly evaluated by performance while microbial structure and function are not deeply understood and need to be addressed abel et al 2013 boltz et al 2017 knowledge of the kinetics of carbon and nitrogen removal in infiltration systems is significant for process design and operation no study to date has designed or demonstrated i the effect of different c n ratios in the synthetic secondary effluent feed to be infiltrated into the sat or ii the process biokinetics by monitoring chemical and microbial profiles in columns operated with flooding and drying aeration cycles the main goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of c n in the feed on the sat process with column depth based on a detailed characterization of chemical content of the solute and microbial ecology of the soil in a simulated infiltration system to enable improvements in sat design 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated sat system set up soil

was mixed with a soil inoculum 5 by volume from the sat recharge basins at the mesa northwest water reclamation plant near arizona state university with a total porosity of 0 42 supplementary fig 1 supplementary text 2 although biogeochemical processes occur throughout the vadose zone of the sat the set up of this study was designed to simulate the top layer 1 m of the vadose zone which was shown to be the most active layer another consideration of the design was to conduct the experiments under controlled and monitored conditions with stable and constant secondary effluent content supplementary text 3 1 the column set up was designed to avoid any contact with air from the top of the column during the flooding period to maintain the solute level at least 10 cm above the soil a head of 23 cm above soil level was constructed and filled continuously every 1 5 h during the flooding cycle supplementary text 3 2 the feed was controlled automatically with a digital controller chrontrol corp san diego ca the hydraulic load rate was 0 88 m day designed to be similar to the sat hydraulic load rate in the field 1 m day to enable profile analyses throughout the column sampling taps were installed at 10 20 30 40 50 70 90 and 110 cm depth fig 1 the columns were operated under a 48 h cycle of 12 h flooding and 36 h aeration the flow rate was adjusted at the bottom of the columns to 0 6 l h and residence time determined by tracer measurements was 5 2 and 5 8 h for cod n hereafter termed c n 5 and 2 respectively supplementary text 3 3 2 2 synthetic secondary effluent

utilization and for autotrophs nitrogen as the sum of nitrite no2 ammonium nh4 and the organic nitrogen that is hydrolyzed and added to the ammonium pool the carbon content in this study simulated three rates of biodegradability fast glucose moderate lb broth and slow humic acid mp biomedical supplementary table s2 the content of humic acid which simulate slow biodegradability and the lb which simulate moderate biodegradability and organic nitrogen were determined by the annual average characterization of the shafdan wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent bixio et al 2008 zucker et al 2015 two secondary effluent feed solutions were designed one with a c n ratio of 5 c n5 and one with a c n ratio of 2 c n2 while the nitrogen species concentrations nh4 no2 and no3 were similar in both feeds the influent cod concentration of c n5 and c n2 was 56 mg l and 15 5 mg l respectively which also varied by the level of biodegradability in addition due to different content of lb the cod content also differed with respect to amount of organic nitrogen the synthetic feed did not contain any added bacteria in order to focus the examination on the effect of the solution content on the soil biomass and the process dynamics 2 3 sampling and analysis of bulk liquid and soil the columns were operated for 5 months until stable removal of cod and ammonia was obtained following which calibration and system characterization which were conducted for another 3 months then sampling campaigns were conducted after stable system performance were verified which will subsequently be detailed sampling campaigns were conducted after those 5 months of operation solute samples were taken from the sampling depths in 40 min increments starting 6 h after the first flood middle of the cycle to follow the bulk solute in the column the analysis confirmed steady state conditions for the reactor supplementary text 5 supplementary figs 3 and 4 water parameter analysis of the solute

calibration curves were plotted and used for calculation of concentrations detection limits were determined as 1 5 mg l for cod and 0 05 0 042 0 007 mg l n for ammonium nitrite and nitrate respectively as specified by park et al 2017 2 4 bacterial population analysis using qpcrand 16s rrna sequencing microbial concentrations throughout the column were determined by targeted qpcr analysis of dna extracted from soil samples as follows soil samples of 10 g each were taken the day after the solute sampling campaign during the drying period and mixed to homogenize supplementary fig 5 dna was extracted in duplicates using powersoil dna isolation kit mobio analysis by qpcr of the extracted dna samples was conducted in triplicate focusing on primer sets related to the following

park et al 2017 nob in this study refers to the sum of the concentrations number of dna copies per mg soil of the genera nitrospira and nitrobacter further the extracted duplicate dna of every sample at the top of each column was pooled together next generation sequencing of the amplicon library was conducted as detailed in park et al 2017 to gain an understand of the overall microbial community composition sequencing noise was filtered out by the cutadapt tool martin 2011 ribosomal database project rdp classifier software wang et al 2007 was used to classify the 16s sequences and assign them to the closest known genus in the ncbi database with an 80 threshold supplementary text 7 supplementary excel 1 in addition after excluding all genera with abundance lower than 2 every genus was classified as to its potential metabolic ability either aerobic or anoxic 2 5 nitrogen mass balance calculations nitrogen mass balance of the whole process considered the sum of nh4 no2 no3 and organic nitrogen which is assumed to be fully degraded and added to the nh4 pool assimilated nitrogen was calculated considering a yield of 0 5 mg cod as biomass per mg cod substrate grady et al 2011 according to the total measured reduction of cod supplementary text 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 profiles of organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations a minor decrease was documented in the do concentrations in both columns with a measured do concentration of 6 8 0 2 mg l at the top of both columns and measured doc concentrations of 6 2 0 3 and 6 4 0 4 at the bottom of c n2 and c n5 respectively the do values at the bottom indicate aerobic environment in both columns the heterotrophic activity was reflected by the cod profile fig 2 the highest cod removal rates were documented in the first 10 cm for both columns indicating removal of readily biodegradable glucose in the c n5 column fig 2a below 10 cm cod removal showed a gradual decrease until 50 cm depth with similarity to the lb moderately degradable content in parallel at 30 cm depth a slight increase of 10 0 12 in ammonia concentration was observed indicating some ammonification following the degradation of cod containing organic nitrogen lb farrell et al 2014 katipoglu yazan et al 2012 the parallel removal of ammonia and cod presumably of rapidly and moderately degradable glucose and lb between 30 and 90 cm depth for c n5 and between 10 and 40 cm depth for c n2 suggests assimilation for biomass buildup of heterotrophs and aob mostly by anoxic activity following nitritation as there was no significant change in the nitrite or nitrate levels as for the nitrifier activity parallel and opposite trends of nh4 removal and no3 production nitrification for c n5 appeared below 40 cm whereas no nitrite was observed fig 2a in addition at 40 cm depth the calculated nitrogen gas formation loss supplementary text 8 and reduction of organic nitrogen suggest balanced rates of denitrification and ammonification following cod degradation for c n2 the decrease in cod in the first 10 cm was similar to all rapidly and moderately degradable content of cod which also contains organic nitrogen lb the gradual decrease upon full removal at 40 cm depth indicated utilization of the slowly degradable humic acid fraction of cod fig 2b nh4 removal and no3 production were gradual and started below 10 cm although significant nh4 oxidation is assumed to occur at the top of both columns followed by ammonification of organic nitrogen in contrast to c n5 for c n2 the no3 was not fully reduced and no2 removal was gradual until 30 cm reflecting higher oxidation rates of nh4 than no2 the significant decrease in nh4 removal occurred between 20 and 50 cm in parallel to an increase in no3 concentration below 50 cm no significant change in no3 concentration was observed in addition a very strong linear relationship was calculated between nh4 and no3 profiles for c n2 r2 0 97 indicating that nitrification was more dominant nitrogen transformation pathway whereas with c n5 weaker linear correlations were obtained r2 0 79 suggesting involvement of other nitrogen transformation pathways such as denitrification closer observation of the first 10 cm of the c n2 column showed no reduction in no3 slight reduction in no2 0 8 mg l n and some decrease in ammonium concentration considering the reduction in cod this leads to the conclusion that most of the organic nitrogen was utilized via ammonification followed by nitrification and anoxic denitrification this strongly indicates that most of the nitrogen loss with c n2 occurred in the top 10 cm it is suggested that the different contents of cod in the secondary effluent were reflected in different confirm reduction rates also reported by farrell et al 2014 the mass balance of the first 10 cm of the c n5 column was calculated considering full reduction of no2 and no3 and assuming that the ammonification rate was at least similar to that in the c n2 column the higher nitrogen loss in the first 10 cm of c n5 led to the conclusion that a significant portion of the organic nitrogen was favored for denitrification calculations of the nitrogen assimilated for biomass synthesis rate supplementary eq 7 revealed similar rates of 30 nitrogen assimilated out of the nitrogen loss in both columns supplementary text 8 supplementary table 3 nitrogen mass balance calculations revealed 57 nitrogen loss 6 5 mg l for c n5 compared to only 16 0 45 mg l for c n2 which can be attributed to the lack of organic carbon supporting anoxic activity feng et al 2012 xia et al 2008 we suggest that the occurrence and rate of snd in the columns depend on carbon availability and high degradability while ammonification of organic nitrogen is the main source of nh4 3 2 community structure 16s sequencing to examine the effect of feed solution on the functional potential of the topsoil and especially the non nitrifiers 16s sequencing analysis was conducted on the samples from the topsoil of both columns fig 3 boltz et al 2017 the abundance of organisms capable of denitrification was higher for c n5 than for c n2 31 vs 13 and related to the genera defluvimonas and acidovorax in addition the genera exiguobacterium facultative anaerobe and azohydromonas hydrogen oxidizer by fermentation showed significant abundance of 7 and 10 respectively with c n5 whereas they were almost absent with c n2 this also raises the possibility of some fermentation activity with increased influent cod load in contrast to c n5 the microbial community structure in the topsoil of c n2 column showed significantly higher potential for aerobic activity 64 vs 32 for c n5 the genus marmoricola was the most dominant 17 whereas its amounts were not significant with c n5 although considered aerobic some species harbor the ability to reduce no3 dastager et al 2008 lee and lee 2010 a prominent difference in the functional groups between the two samples was observed in nob abundance and diversity the abundance of nitrospira was significant in both samples but higher for c n2 14 vs 4 unexpectedly the genus nitrolancea also showed significant abundance in the c n2 column 5 6 a higher c n ratio in the secondary effluent significantly shaped the functional potential of the topsoil community toward less aerobic and more anoxic activity which also corresponds to the significantly higher nitrogen removal rate obtained at the top of the c n5 column the opposite trend of dominance of the genus marmoricola nob with c n2 vs exiguobacterium with c n5 suggests opposite sensitivity to competition for oxygen nitrospira abundance reflects limited no2 availability and different rates of competition for no2 in those samples on the other hand although the no2 concentrations in both feeds were similar the high nitrospira abundance in the c n2 column offers diverse functionalities of this genus fig 3 a suggested explanation for the abundance of nitrolancea with c n2 can be symbiosis with ammonium oxidizers aob and higher local availability of no2 originating from ammonium oxidation sorokin et al 2012 also a thinner biofilm morphology could increase the availability of no2 originating in the feed in accordance with the chemical profiles shown in fig 2 when the rapidly degraded carbon was more available c n5 the community structure reflected significantly higher potential for denitrification and more limited oxygen conditions in general these findings support the conclusion that the content and biodegradability level of the organic carbon have a significant impact on the composition and potential function of the soil microbial community 3 3 analysis of microbial functional group profiles using qpcr as expected the total bacterial concentration was much higher at the top of the c n5 column 1 3 log as the richer feed increased the carrying capacity of the microbial community and showed a thicker biofilm morphology moreover at 20 cm depth the total bacterial concentration dropped dramatically 1 3 log in parallel to the significant decrease in cod which gradually decreased to 50 cm fig 2 these high concentrations are presumably due to favoring glucose utilization interestingly the profiles of aob with c n5 peaked below 10 cm where it is hypothesized that most of the fast degradable cod was consumed whereas nob followed and peaked downstream at 20 cm right where the removal rate of the cod decreased significant dominance of nob over aob was observed until nh4 was fully removed 50 cm depth similar trends have been documented in attached biomass systems where ammonia oxidizing archaea were shown to be secondary to aob in nitrification ouyang et al 2016 tatari et al 2017 at the top of c n2 column the dominance of nob over aob was even more significant 1 3 log in addition the strongest 0 9 correlations to the nh4 profile for c n2 were of the nob profile and the total bacteria suggesting ammonia utilization for either oxidation by nob or assimilation by heterotrophic growth all bacterial functional groups decreased gradually to 50 cm fig 4 although nitrifier concentrations were similar at the top of both columns a significant difference 12 vs 1 for c n2 and c n5 respectively in abundance was observed fig 4 xia et al 2008 also showed higher nitrifier abundance with lower c n ratio in wastewater feed the negligible amount of aob at the top of both columns on the one hand and the significant peak at 10 cm on the other reflect an increase in nh4 oxidation rate following the decrease in cod utilization rate thus the decrease in cod utilization due to either reduced activity or a change in the heterotrophic community structure will result in reduced competition for oxygen on the other hand nob showed clear dominance over aob in concentration and abundance mainly where coupled ammonia oxidation and ammonification is expected to occur this can be explained assuming that at 10 cm depth all ammonia originates from the secondary effluent solute and not from cod ammonification which might also explain the match between cod removal and the nob profile moreover the significant dominance of nob at the top and at 10 cm depth for the c n2 column where some nh4 and poor no2 removal is obtained suggests co occurence of aerobic respiration and ammonification by heterotrophs followed by nh4 oxidation by cmx daims et al 2016 3 4 abundance of the genera nitrospira and nitrobacter the abundance of nob in the c n5 column did not exceed 3 of the total bacterial community however in the c n2 column the abundance of nob was significantly higher with 13 1 throughout the top 30 cm the abundance of nitrospira was far higher 85 than that of nitrobacter in both columns and at all depths except for 90 cm in column c n5 a similar trend of high abundance of nob has also been observed in other studies bassin et al 2015 kindaichi et al 2004 li et al 2012 the abundance obtained from the qpcr analysis of the samples at the top of the columns agreed with the results of the 16s sequencing analysis fig 3 generally a preponderance of nitrospira in attached biomass systems indicates limited nitrite concentrations attard et al 2010 schramm et al 2000a b nitrobacter abundance was higher at depths where ammonia oxidation rates were assumed to be significant presumably due to higher availability of produced nitrite interestingly the profile of nob abundance in the c n2 column and especially of nitrospira showed a strong 90 positive and negative correlation to the nh4 and no3 profiles respectively this dynamic suggests that no2 concentration more than oxygen has a significant role in shaping the fraction of nob in the community structure and function when oxygen is sufficient as with unsaturated systems 3 5 observations on snd in sat the c n ratio in the secondary effluent was shown to have a significant impact on substrate utilization and nitrogen removal rates in general the concentration and level of degradability of the cod had a key role in shaping the heterotrophic microbial community structure and function in the process nitrifiers and nitrification activity were also affected presumably due to shifts in the rate of competition for oxygen with heterotrophs respectively the trends among the nob also reflected such competition on the one hand the clear dominance of the genus nitrospira which is characterized as a better competitor in limited oxygen limited substrate environments when some species are also capable of reducing nitrate in the absence of oxygen koch et al 2015 park et al 2017 van kessel et al 2015 on the other nitrobacter is found under high nitrite and typical aerobic conditions 2 mg l daims et al 2016 nowka et al 2015 schramm et al 2000a b vejmelkova et al 2012 generally the concentration and content of non nitrifier bacteria were the most influential parameters on bacterial community structure and potential function the paradox of the observed nh4 removal activity while the abundance of aob is negligible in comparison to the significance of nitrospira leads to the conclusion that organisms other than aob were responsible for most of the nh4 oxidation activity to explain this paradox and the difference between the columns in nitrogen removal in this study we suggest two mechanisms of symbiosis between nitrospira and heterotrophs inside the biofilm attached to the soil i under aerobic conditions the utilization of organic nitrogen by heterotrophs leads to the release of nh4 via ammonification which serves as a localized nh4 source for nitrification by nitrospira harboring cmx capability ii mutual feedback under anoxic conditions where no2 oxidation by nitrospira is a source of electron acceptors in the form of no3 for reduction back to no2 by heterotrophs and so on such a mechanism is possible under limited oxygen conditions when both groups are characterized by similar values of half saturation coefficients for the substrate ks no2 nob ks no3 heterotophs in addition the role of oxygen can also be reflected in the affinity to nitrite oxidizers or sensitivity of denitrifiers to oxygen inhibition half saturation rate coefficient of oxygen ko nob half saturation rate of oxygen inhibition coefficient koi oho daims et al 2016 park et al 2017 we suggest that the effect of carbon availability and degradability on snd in attached biomass systems not only occurs by providing electron donors for anoxic activity but also by supporting extensive aerobic heterotrophic growth which promotes thicker biofilms and creation of a localized anoxic microniche in parallel nitrification activity acts as a source of electron acceptors and promotes niche differentiation determined by oxygen and nitrite availability resulting in increased nitrogen removal 3 6 insights on the sat process some studies have claimed that the reduction in oxygen that enables nitrogen removal activity in sat systems is due to peripheral flow in the soil which creates limited oxygen pockets in the soil structure empirical models have correlated the limited oxygen conditions which support anaerobic events with respiration and the size of the soil aggregate which affects the oxygen diffusion rate kremen et al 2005 others have hypothesized that anoxic activity in infiltration systems promotes the drop in oxygen levels inside the soil aggregate which increases with soil depth ebrahimi and or 2015 2016 in this study we suggest that local limited oxygen regions within the biofilm attached to the soil result in microbial niche differentiation and have a significant role in supporting anoxic activity in infiltration systems as demonstrated at the shafdan sat goren et al 2014 lakretz et al 2017 mienis and arye 2018 moreover the occurrence of anoxic activity is not dependent only on insufficient aeration but also and mainly on the low degradability of organic carbon which allows oxygen utilization for nitrification the preponderance of nitrospira spp in this study indicates a greater and more important role for no2 and this genus in infiltration systems than previously considered the findings of this work show that the carbon and c n contents of secondary effluent result in shifting the dynamics of microbial population function in subsequent infiltration systems and could maximize carbon and nitrogen removal future research should address biofilm morphology and functional structure in sat systems 4 conclusions this work presents the first inclusive process analysis correlating chemical and functional microbial analyses of a simulated sat system the main conclusions are the c n ratio of the feed effluent has a significant role in shaping microbial structure and function in the media organic carbon concentration and degradability are the most influential parameters for shaping the heterotrophic microbial community size content and potential function and thus for influencing the process efficiency and performance snd occurs mostly in the upper layers of the column where organic carbon is sufficient and degradable the genus nitrospira is predominant over aob and the genus nitrobacter in all samples at all depths with a strong indication for cmx activity for analysis of the sat process c n 5 in the secondary effluent is recommended to achieve optimized nitrogen removal microbial ecology analysis of sat systems can provide a good reflection of the potential function of

risgaard petersen 2003 using microbial ecology for the study of engineered environments gives a deeper understanding of the process and offers tools for optimized systems operation and design boltz et al 2017 under aerobic conditions ammonium is utilized by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa gao et al 2013 pester et al 2012 recent studies have revealed that some species of the genus nitrospira traditionally classified as nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob also show complete ammonia oxidation cmx activity in general chemoorganotrophic heterotrophic organisms utilize organic carbon for assimilation and as an electron donor and vary in the obligatory demand for oxygen as electron acceptor with some harboring metabolic pathways to utilize oxidized nitrogen as the electron acceptor denitrifying bacteria belong to varied physiological and taxonomic groups and possess the ability to use different carbon sources lu and chandran 2010 and different levels of reduction of nitrogen oxides via partial or complete denitrification lu et al 2014 as carbon and nitrogen compound utilization is applied by different microbial pathways and functional groups most studies have focused on either nitrogen or carbon utilization pathways the ratio of carbon to nitrogen c n at the feed of wastewater streams 200 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod and 40 mg l n has a significant effect on the bacterial dynamics in the process in addition the level of degradability of the organic carbon is lower after the secondary treatment in comparison to wastewater shon et al 2006 bassin et al 2015 showed the significance of cod concentration on bacteria s functional activity and diversity while li et al 2012 showed that the level of organic carbon biodegradability influences community structure and function in soil columns in addition higher abundance and activity of nitrifiers was related to a lower 2 ratio of c n in the feed stream albuquerque et al 2012 xia et al 2008 where dominance of the genus nitrospira was demonstrated for wastewater streams and water sand filters bassin et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 thus the c n ratio is a key design parameter for downstream tertiary treatment most controlled studies simulating infiltration systems in the laboratory and on a pilot scale use saturated column set ups and do not simulate the effects of flooding drying conditions on process efficiency synthetic secondary effluent is commonly used to simulate laboratory effluent for infiltration in the sat microbial ecology and function in the sat process has especially been poorly

effect of different c n ratios in the synthetic secondary effluent feed to be infiltrated into the sat or ii the process biokinetics by monitoring chemical and microbial profiles in columns operated

simulate moderate biodegradability and organic nitrogen were determined by the annual average characterization of the shafdan wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent bixio et al 2008 zucker et al 2015 two secondary effluent feed solutions were designed one with a c n ratio of 5 c n5 and one with a c n ratio of 2 c n2 while the nitrogen species concentrations nh4 no2 and no3 were similar in both feeds the influent cod concentration of c n5 and c n2 was 56 mg l and 15 5 mg l respectively which also varied by the level of biodegradability in addition due to different content of lb the cod content also differed with respect to amount of organic nitrogen the synthetic feed did not contain any added bacteria in order to focus the examination on the effect of the solution content on the soil biomass and the process dynamics 2 3 sampling and analysis of bulk liquid and soil the columns were operated for 5 months until stable removal of cod and ammonia was obtained following which calibration and system characterization which were conducted for another 3 months then sampling campaigns were conducted after stable system performance were verified which will subsequently be

park et al 2017 nob in this study refers to the sum of the concentrations number of dna copies per mg soil of the genera nitrospira and nitrobacter further the extracted duplicate dna of every sample at the top of each column was pooled together next generation sequencing of the amplicon library was conducted as detailed in park et al 2017 to gain an understand of the overall microbial community composition sequencing noise was filtered out by the cutadapt tool martin 2011 ribosomal database project rdp classifier software wang et al 2007 was used to classify the 16s sequences and assign them to the closest known genus in the ncbi database with an 80 threshold supplementary text 7 supplementary excel 1 in addition after excluding all genera with abundance lower than 2 every genus was classified as to its potential metabolic ability either aerobic or anoxic 2 5 nitrogen mass balance calculations nitrogen mass balance of the whole process considered the sum of nh4 no2 no3 and organic nitrogen which is assumed to be fully degraded and added to the nh4 pool assimilated nitrogen was calculated considering a yield of 0 5 mg cod as biomass per mg cod substrate grady et al 2011 according to the total measured reduction of cod supplementary text 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 profiles of organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations a minor decrease was documented in the do concentrations in both columns with a measured do concentration of 6 8 0 2 mg l at the top of both columns and measured doc concentrations of 6 2 0 3 and 6 4 0 4 at the bottom of c n2 and c n5 respectively the do values at the bottom indicate aerobic environment in both columns the heterotrophic activity was reflected by the cod profile fig 2 the highest cod removal rates were documented in the first 10 cm for both columns indicating removal of readily biodegradable glucose in the c n5 column fig 2a below 10 cm cod removal showed a gradual decrease until 50 cm depth with similarity to the lb moderately degradable content in parallel at 30 cm depth a slight increase of 10 0 12 in ammonia concentration was observed indicating some ammonification following the degradation of cod containing organic nitrogen lb farrell et al 2014 katipoglu yazan et al 2012 the parallel removal of ammonia and cod presumably of rapidly and moderately degradable glucose and lb between 30 and 90 cm depth for c n5 and between 10 and 40 cm depth for c n2 suggests assimilation for biomass buildup of heterotrophs and aob mostly by anoxic activity following nitritation as there was no significant change in the nitrite or nitrate levels as for the nitrifier activity parallel and opposite trends of nh4 removal and no3 production nitrification for c n5 appeared below 40 cm whereas no nitrite was observed fig 2a in addition at 40 cm depth the calculated nitrogen gas formation loss supplementary text 8 and reduction of organic nitrogen suggest balanced rates of denitrification and ammonification following cod degradation for c n2 the decrease in cod in the first 10 cm was similar to all rapidly and moderately degradable content of cod which also contains organic nitrogen lb the gradual decrease upon full removal at 40 cm depth indicated utilization of the slowly degradable humic acid fraction of cod fig 2b nh4 removal and no3 production were gradual and started below 10 cm although significant nh4 oxidation is assumed to occur at the top of both columns followed by ammonification of organic nitrogen in contrast to c n5 for c n2 the no3 was not fully reduced and no2 removal was gradual until 30 cm reflecting higher oxidation rates of nh4 than no2 the significant decrease in nh4 removal occurred between 20 and 50 cm in parallel to an increase in no3 concentration below 50 cm no significant change in no3 concentration was observed in addition a very strong linear relationship was calculated between nh4 and no3 profiles for c n2 r2 0 97 indicating that nitrification was more dominant nitrogen transformation pathway whereas with c n5 weaker linear correlations were obtained r2 0 79 suggesting involvement of other nitrogen transformation pathways such as denitrification closer observation of the first 10 cm of the c n2 column showed no reduction in no3 slight reduction in no2 0 8 mg l n and some decrease in ammonium concentration considering the reduction in cod this leads to the conclusion that most of the organic nitrogen was utilized via ammonification followed by nitrification and anoxic denitrification this strongly indicates that most of the nitrogen loss with c n2 occurred in the top 10 cm it is suggested that the different contents of cod in the secondary effluent were reflected in different confirm reduction rates also reported by farrell et al 2014 the mass balance of the first 10 cm of the c n5 column was calculated considering full reduction of no2 and no3 and assuming that the ammonification rate was at least similar to that in the c n2 column the higher nitrogen loss in the first 10 cm of c n5 led to the conclusion that a significant portion of the organic nitrogen was favored for denitrification calculations of the nitrogen assimilated for biomass synthesis rate supplementary eq 7 revealed similar rates of 30 nitrogen assimilated out of the nitrogen loss in both columns supplementary text 8 supplementary table 3 nitrogen mass balance calculations revealed 57 nitrogen loss 6 5 mg l for c n5 compared to only 16 0 45 mg l for c n2 which can be attributed to the lack of organic carbon supporting anoxic activity feng et al 2012 xia et al 2008 we suggest that the occurrence and rate of snd in the columns depend on carbon availability and high degradability while ammonification of organic nitrogen is the main source of nh4 3 2 community structure 16s sequencing to examine the effect of feed solution on the functional potential of the topsoil and especially the non nitrifiers 16s sequencing analysis was conducted on the samples from the topsoil of both columns fig 3 boltz et al 2017 the abundance of organisms capable of denitrification was higher for c n5 than for c n2 31 vs 13 and related to the genera defluvimonas and acidovorax in addition the genera exiguobacterium facultative anaerobe and azohydromonas hydrogen oxidizer by fermentation showed significant abundance of 7 and 10 respectively with c n5 whereas they were almost absent with c n2 this also raises the possibility of some fermentation activity with increased influent cod load in contrast to c n5 the microbial community structure in the topsoil of c n2 column showed significantly higher potential for aerobic activity 64 vs 32 for c n5 the genus marmoricola was the most dominant 17 whereas its amounts were not significant with c n5 although considered aerobic some species harbor the ability to reduce no3 dastager et al 2008 lee and lee 2010 a prominent difference in the functional groups between the two samples was observed in nob abundance and diversity the abundance of nitrospira was significant in both samples but higher for c n2 14 vs 4 unexpectedly the genus nitrolancea also showed significant abundance in the c n2 column 5 6 a higher c n ratio in the secondary effluent significantly shaped the functional potential of the topsoil community toward less aerobic and more anoxic activity which also corresponds to the significantly higher nitrogen removal rate obtained at the top of the c n5 column the opposite trend of dominance of the genus marmoricola nob with c n2 vs exiguobacterium with c n5 suggests opposite sensitivity to competition for oxygen nitrospira abundance reflects limited no2 availability and different rates of competition for no2 in those samples on the other hand although the no2 concentrations in both feeds were similar the high nitrospira abundance in the c n2 column offers diverse functionalities of this genus fig 3 a suggested explanation for the abundance of nitrolancea with c n2 can be symbiosis with ammonium oxidizers aob and higher local availability of no2 originating from ammonium oxidation sorokin et al 2012 also a thinner biofilm morphology could increase the availability of no2 originating in the feed in accordance with the chemical profiles shown in fig 2 when the rapidly degraded carbon was more available c n5 the community structure reflected significantly higher potential for denitrification and more limited oxygen conditions in general these findings support the conclusion that the content and biodegradability level of the organic carbon have a significant impact on the composition and potential function of the soil microbial community 3 3 analysis of microbial functional group profiles using qpcr as expected the total bacterial concentration was much higher at the top of the c n5 column 1 3 log as the richer feed increased the carrying capacity of the microbial community and showed a thicker biofilm morphology moreover at 20 cm depth the total bacterial concentration dropped dramatically 1 3 log in parallel to the significant decrease in cod which gradually decreased to 50 cm fig 2 these high concentrations are presumably due to favoring glucose utilization interestingly the profiles of aob with c n5 peaked below 10 cm where it is hypothesized that most of the fast degradable cod was consumed whereas nob followed and peaked downstream at 20 cm right where the removal rate of the cod decreased significant dominance of nob over aob was observed until nh4 was fully removed 50 cm depth similar trends have been documented in attached biomass systems where ammonia oxidizing archaea were shown to be secondary to aob in nitrification ouyang et al 2016 tatari et al 2017 at the top of c n2 column the dominance of nob over aob was even more significant 1 3 log in addition the strongest 0 9 correlations to the nh4 profile for c n2 were of the nob profile and the total bacteria suggesting ammonia utilization for either oxidation by nob or assimilation by heterotrophic growth all bacterial functional groups decreased gradually to 50 cm fig 4 although nitrifier concentrations were similar at the top of both columns a significant difference 12 vs 1 for c n2 and c n5 respectively in abundance was observed fig 4 xia et al 2008 also showed higher nitrifier abundance with lower c n ratio in wastewater feed the negligible amount of aob at the top of both columns on the one hand and the significant peak at 10 cm on the other reflect an increase in nh4 oxidation rate following the decrease in cod utilization rate thus the decrease in cod utilization due to either reduced activity or a change in the heterotrophic community structure will result in reduced competition for oxygen on the other hand nob showed clear dominance over aob in concentration and abundance mainly where coupled ammonia oxidation and ammonification is expected to occur this can be explained assuming that at 10 cm depth all ammonia originates from the secondary effluent solute and not from cod ammonification which might also explain the match between cod removal and the nob profile moreover the significant dominance of nob at the top and at 10 cm depth for the c n2 column where some nh4 and poor no2 removal is obtained suggests co occurence of aerobic respiration and ammonification by heterotrophs followed by nh4 oxidation by cmx daims et al 2016 3 4 abundance of the genera nitrospira and nitrobacter the abundance of nob in the c n5 column did not exceed 3 of the total bacterial community however in the c n2 column the abundance of nob was significantly higher with 13 1 throughout the top 30 cm the abundance of nitrospira was far higher 85 than that of nitrobacter in both columns and at all depths except for 90 cm in column c n5 a similar trend of high abundance of nob has also been observed in other studies bassin et al 2015 kindaichi et al 2004 li et al 2012 the abundance obtained from the qpcr analysis of the samples at the top of the columns agreed with the results of the 16s sequencing analysis fig 3 generally a preponderance of nitrospira in attached biomass systems indicates limited nitrite concentrations attard et al 2010 schramm et al 2000a b nitrobacter abundance was higher at depths where ammonia oxidation rates were assumed to be significant presumably due to higher availability of produced nitrite interestingly the profile of nob abundance in the c n2 column and especially of nitrospira showed a strong 90 positive and negative correlation to the nh4 and no3 profiles respectively this dynamic suggests that no2 concentration more than oxygen has a significant role in shaping the fraction of nob in the community structure and function when oxygen is sufficient as with unsaturated systems 3 5 observations on snd in sat the c n ratio in the secondary effluent was shown to have a significant impact on substrate utilization and nitrogen removal rates in general the concentration and level of degradability of the cod had a key role in shaping the heterotrophic microbial community structure and function in the process nitrifiers and nitrification activity were also affected presumably due to shifts in the rate of competition for oxygen with heterotrophs respectively the trends among the nob also reflected such competition on the one hand the clear dominance of the genus nitrospira which is characterized as a better competitor in limited oxygen limited substrate environments when some species are also capable of reducing nitrate in the absence of oxygen koch et al 2015 park et al 2017 van kessel et al 2015 on the other nitrobacter is found under high nitrite and typical aerobic conditions 2 mg l daims et al 2016 nowka et al 2015 schramm et al 2000a b vejmelkova et al 2012 generally the concentration and content of non nitrifier bacteria were the most influential parameters on bacterial community structure and potential function the paradox of the observed nh4 removal activity while the abundance of aob is negligible in comparison to the significance of nitrospira leads to the conclusion that organisms other than aob were responsible for most of the nh4 oxidation activity to explain this paradox and the difference between the columns in nitrogen removal in this study we suggest two mechanisms of symbiosis between nitrospira and heterotrophs inside the biofilm attached to the soil i under aerobic conditions the utilization of organic nitrogen by heterotrophs leads to the release of nh4 via ammonification which serves as a localized nh4 source for nitrification by nitrospira harboring cmx capability ii mutual feedback under anoxic conditions where no2 oxidation by nitrospira is a source of electron acceptors in the form of no3 for reduction back to no2 by heterotrophs and so on such a mechanism is possible under limited oxygen conditions when both groups are characterized by similar values of half saturation coefficients for the substrate ks no2 nob ks no3 heterotophs in addition the role of oxygen can also be reflected in the affinity to nitrite oxidizers or sensitivity of denitrifiers to oxygen inhibition half saturation rate coefficient of oxygen ko nob half saturation rate of oxygen inhibition coefficient koi oho daims et al 2016 park et al 2017 we suggest that the effect of carbon availability and degradability on snd in attached biomass systems not only occurs by providing electron donors for anoxic activity but also by supporting extensive aerobic heterotrophic growth which promotes thicker biofilms and creation of a localized anoxic microniche in parallel nitrification activity acts as a source of electron acceptors and promotes niche differentiation determined by oxygen and nitrite availability resulting in increased nitrogen removal 3 6 insights on the sat process some studies have claimed that the reduction in oxygen that enables nitrogen removal activity in sat systems is due to peripheral flow in the soil which creates limited oxygen pockets in the soil structure empirical models have correlated the limited oxygen conditions which support anaerobic events with respiration and the size of the soil aggregate which affects the oxygen diffusion rate kremen et al 2005 others have hypothesized that anoxic activity in infiltration systems promotes the drop in oxygen levels inside the soil aggregate which increases with soil depth ebrahimi and or 2015 2016 in this study we suggest that local limited oxygen regions within the biofilm attached to the soil result in microbial niche differentiation and have a significant role in supporting anoxic activity in infiltration systems as demonstrated at the shafdan sat goren et al 2014 lakretz et al 2017 mienis and arye 2018 moreover the occurrence of anoxic activity is not dependent only on insufficient aeration but also and mainly on the low degradability of organic carbon which allows oxygen utilization for nitrification the preponderance of nitrospira spp in this study indicates a greater and more important role for no2 and this genus in infiltration systems than previously considered the findings of this work show that the carbon and c n contents of secondary effluent result in shifting the dynamics of microbial population function in subsequent infiltration systems and could maximize carbon and nitrogen removal future research should address biofilm morphology and functional structure in sat systems 4 conclusions this work presents the first inclusive process analysis correlating chemical and functional microbial analyses of a simulated sat system the main conclusions are the c n ratio of the feed effluent has a significant role in shaping microbial structure and function in the media organic carbon concentration and degradability are the most influential parameters for shaping the heterotrophic microbial community size content and potential function and thus for influencing the process efficiency and performance snd occurs mostly in the upper layers of the column where organic carbon is sufficient and degradable the genus nitrospira is predominant over aob and the genus nitrobacter in all samples at all depths with a strong indication for cmx activity for analysis of the sat process c n 5 in the secondary effluent is recommended to achieve optimized nitrogen removal microbial ecology analysis of sat systems can provide a good reflection of the potential function of

19277,photo fenton process is among the most effective advanced oxidation processes aops in urban wastewater treatment and disinfection but its application as tertiary treatment at full scale has not

phenol 95 was observed after 60 min treatment being the process more effective than all other investigated aops fenton and photo fenton processes this process was also proven to be more effective in the inactivation of e coli complete inactivation 3 5 log units in 10 min at natural ph 7 8 0 5 in real wastewater than the other processes investigated unlike of what observed for e coli inactivation the investigated processes only partially inactivated total bacterial population from 18 for uv c to 43 for uv c h2o2 cu according to flow cytometry measurements in particular cu based photo fenton processes resulted in the higher percentage of inactivated total cells thus being consistent with the results of e coli inactivation it is worthy to note that as h2o2 was decreased uv c h2o2 cu ids was more effective than uv c h2o2 cu process moreover the formation of small and large clusters decreased in the presence of cu and cu ids complex and process efficiency improved accordingly these results show that cu based aops can more effectively disaggregate clusters thus making disinfection process more effective than fe based aops graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes escherichia coli flow cytometry homogeneous photocatalysis wastewater disinfection 1 introduction disinfection of wastewater is typically achieved by chemical e g chlorine peracetic acid or physical uv c radiation processes in urban wastewater treatment plants uwtps di cesare et al 2016 among disinfection processes chlorination is the most widely used in uwtps but the formation of hazardous disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps lee et al 2007 results in environmental and public health concerns accordingly peracetic acid antonelli et al 2013 formisano et al 2016 and uv c radiation di cesare et al 2016 are increasingly replacing chlorine in urban wastewater disinfection however although these treatments can effectively inactivate bacteria to meet standards for effluent disposal into the environment they fail meeting stringent standards such as those for wastewater reuse at least under typical operating conditions in uwtps therefore in the last years advanced oxidation processes aops among which uv h2o2 photo fenton and tio2 photocatalysis have been investigated in wastewater disinfection due to the production of highly oxidizing reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals ho they were found to be not only effective in the inactivation of a wide range of waterborne pathogens gárcia fernández et al 2012 but also in the removal of a wide range of micropollutants klamerth et al 2010 ferro et al 2015 moreover aops seem to be more effective than chlorination to reduce bacterial regrowth after disinfection fiorentino et al 2015 which is a primary issue in wastewater reuse practices where disinfected wastewater may be stored for hours days before crops irrigation among aops the photo fenton uv h2o2 fe process demonstrated the higher potential in the inactivation of bacteria but its application to wastewater disinfection at full scale has not been a feasible attractive option so far because optimum conditions are typically achieved under acidic ph ferro et al 2016 as matter of fact as ph increases iron precipitates and it is no longer available for the reaction with h2o2 therefore in the recent years a number of different approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of photo fenton process in particular when photo fenton has been investigated as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater to remove contaminants of emerging concern cecs typically occurring at low concentrations from a few to hundreds ng l as well as to inactivate bacteria process operation under mild conditions ph 5 6 resulted in a good efficiency klamerth et al 2010 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 other possible approaches include the use of heterogeneous and homogeneous photo fenton like processes in particular in heterogeneous photo fenton like processes fe2 is replaced by a solid catalyst while homogeneous processes include a combination of other metal ion s metal ion organic ligand wang et al 2016 in homogeneous photo fenton like processes fe2 is replaced by other metals namely cu2 mn2 co2 and ag possibly combined to organic or inorganic ligands to form complexes and or to stabilize the metals over a wide ph range wang et al 2016 different ligands such as nitriloacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetracetic acid edta oxalic acid tartaric acid de luca et al 2014 and ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds papoutsakis et al 2015 have been successfully tested in tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater so far indeed the research and the design of new bio degradable and active ligands following the benign by design approach cucciniello et al 2016 is an active task of research ricciardi et al 2017 herein the use of iminodisuccinic acid

1998 in this study a cu ids complex was synthesized characterized and applied as active catalyst for photo fenton disinfection process in municipal wastewaters preliminarily the efficiency of photo

experimental set up of photo fenton and control tests preliminary experiments to evaluate the effect of the photo fenton like process uv c cu ids h2o2 on phenol were carried out in a 1 0 l cylindrical glass reactor 5 0 cm in diameter completely covered with aluminium paper and filled in with the 500 ml of phenol deionized water solution process efficiency was evaluated in terms of phenol mineralization through total organic carbon toc removal the reactor was placed in a water bath to control the temperature at 25 c during the experiments the solution in the reactor was stirred

where twelve 0 1 l cylindrical glass vessels were placed at 5 cm from the uvc lamp this experimental set up was adopted to compare in triplicate and simultaneously the different disinfection processes on real wastewater furthermore a negative control cylindrical glasses covered with aluminium paper for each photo driven aop was performed too 2 4 1 photo fenton like tests for phenol removal in order to identify the best h2o2 cu ids ratio for photo fenton like process fixed concentration of h2o2 2 94 mm and different concentration of cu ids from 0 016 to 0 5 mm were investigated according to the results of these preliminary tests the operating conditions selected for the subsequent tests for phenol removal in terms of h2o2 concentrations were 1 470 and 29 399 mm maintaining a constant cu ids

concentrations 0 735 mm a and 1 470 mm b in order to keep residual concentration as low as possible these concentrations of h2o2 were used for photo driven aops tests by coupling the oxidant with cu

on tryptone bile x glucuronide agar tbx sigma aldrich saint louis mo usa when very low concentrations of e coli were expected 50 or 500 μl samples were spread onto agar medium the detection limit of this experimental method was found to be 2 cfu ml 1 2 7 statistical analysis to address the effect of cu ids and h2o2 on toc a linear model was used six values were tested all at the same optimal h2o2 cu ids ratio previously identified the highest concentration was at 0 40 mm for cu ids and 29 39 mm for h2o2 whereas the other concentrations were at a 5 10 20 50 and 75 of the highest concentration analysis of variance anova test for model fit was used to identify whether a linear or a quadratic relationship with concentration could fit better the data the analyses were performed including also differences between the two times of exposition 20 and 60 min a liner model lm was used to test whether the performance in e coli inactivation vs time was significant and whether it was significantly different between methods anova tests were performed to identify 1 whether the performance in toc removal was different between the eight treatment methods and at different times of exposure 20 or 60 min 2 whether the performance in the removal of active and inactivated cells was different and 3 whether the number of small clusters and aggregates was affected by differences among the investigated methods tukey honestly significant difference tests were performed when necessary to identify which methods were different from the others all statistical tests were performed in r 3 3 3 r core team

and disinfection the results from stability tests showed a high stability of the complex in an extended range of ph 2 8 fig si3 in si file and temperature 20 80 c fig si4 in si file at ph value lower than 2 the complex seems to be not stable due to the ligand degradation groth 1998 3 2 degradation of phenol by advanced oxidation processes in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new complex as effective catalyst for fenton and photo fenton like process in wastewater treatment cu ids complex was investigated in the removal of phenol from water preliminary tests using different h2o2 cu ids ratios were performed at 20 min treatment time 2 94 mm of h2o2 and 0 53 mm of phenol initial concentration ph 6 to find the optimum condition in terms of toc removal the optimum ratio was found to be 75 when phenol mineralization resulted in 26 toc removal after 20 min treatment fig 2 as optimum h2o2 cu ids ratio was established six different concentrations of cu ids from 0 02 mm to 0 40 mm and h2o2 from 1 47 mm to 29 39 mm were investigated the effect on toc removal was better explained when including a quadratic term of the concentration of h2o2 cu ids anova f 162 11 p 0 0001 the higher mineralization rates were observed after 60 min treatment fig 3 table si1 and the concentration of h2o2 cu ids was positively related to toc removal in a non linear relationship with slightly differential trajectories between 20 and 60 min table si1 as h2o2 and cu ids initial concentrations were increased over 14 70 mm and 0 02 mm respectively no significant change in toc removal was observed after 60 min treatment moreover uv c h2o2 cu ids process was compared to i iron h2o2 fe2 copper h2o2 cu2 and cu ids h2o2 cu ids based fenton ii iron uv c h2o2 fe2 copper uv c h2o2 cu2 and cu ids uv c h2o2 cu ids based photo fenton as well as to iii uv c h2o2 processes h2o2 as standalone process was also investigated as control fig 4 treatment time affected toc removal with higher

revealed that iron copper and cu ids based fenton did not differ among each other and from simple h2o2 treatment at 20 min and that iron and copper based fenton had similar effects at 60 min as expected photo fenton processes resulted in higher efficiencies compared to fenton processes in particular photo fenton processes efficiencies were in the following order uv c h2o2 cu ids uv c h2o2 cu2 uv c h2o2 fe2 uv c h2o2 process resulted in a lower efficiency compared to photo fenton processes but in higher efficiency compared to fenton processes the initial ph of the solution was 5 7 but during the process the ph decreased to 3 7 due to the formation of oxidation by products although phenols are typically used as model pollutants to investigate the efficiency of different aops including photo fenton process only a few works are available on the effect of metal ligand complexes based photo fenton process on phenol prato garcia et al 2009 investigated the performance of solar driven photo fenton process compound parabolic collector cpc based photo reactor in the treatment of phenolic aqueous solutions 185 200 mg l 1 at natural ph in the presence of ferrioxalate the results achieved are consistent with the results of our experiment with uv c h2o2 cu ids because 85 100 cod reduction was observed after 120 min treatment ph 5 6 oxalate 300 mg l 1 h2o2 phenol 5 5 6 3 monteagudo et al 2011 also investigated ferrioxalate induced solar photo fenton process effect on phenols using a cpc reactor in particular aqueous solution contained a mixture of three phenolic compounds gallic p coumaric and protocatechuic acids and 94 toc removal was achieved in 194 min under optimal conditions h2o2 400 mg l 1 fe ii 20 mg l 1 h2c2o4 60 mg l 1 phenols 20 mg l 1 average solar power 35 w m 2 3 3 wastewater disinfection by advanced oxidation processes uv c h2o2 cu ids process was investigated in municipal wastewater disinfection through flow cytometry and plate count method e coli inactivation process efficiency was compared with uv c h2o2 fe2 and uv c h2o2 cu2 at natural ph 7 8 0 5 in order to meet the limits for residual copper and iron concentrations in uwtp effluents established by italian regulation for wastewater reuse 1 0 mg l 1 for copper and 2 mg l 1 for iron the metals were dosed to half of the limit due to the respective effects on bacterial inactivation tests with h2o2 0 735 mm 25 mgl 1 condition a and uv c as standalone processes were also performed for comparison e coli inactivation vs time was significant anova f1 96 566 5 p 0 0001 with all treatment methods performing significantly better than dark f5 96 157 4 p 0 0001 fig 5 in particular the best disinfection performance was observed with uv c h2o2 cu ids process a complete inactivation 3 5 log units of the initial e coli concentration 5 1 103 0 7 103 cfu ml 1 was achieved in 10 min while 15 and 20 min were necessary for uv c h2o2 cu and uv c h2o2 fe processes respectively unlike of photo fenton based processes h2o2 and uv c did not result in a complete inactivation of e coli within 20 min treatment although this is the first time that uv c h2o2 cu ids process has been investigated in e coli inactivation the parallel experiments with conventional photo fenton make possible a comparison with the scientific literature as matter of fact bacterial inactivation by photo fenton process uv h2o2 fe has been widely investigated and our results are really encouraging compared to the literature it is noteworthy that most of the papers deal with solar driven photo fenton rodríguez chueca et al 2014 ferro et al 2015 villegas guzman et al 2017 in particular when solar photo fenton under mild conditions ph 5 20 mg h2o2 l 1 10 mg fe l 1 was investigated in the inactivation of e coli in urban wastewater effluents a 3 log unit decrease was observed rodríguez chueca et al 2014 moreover natural iron and natural additives as complexing agents were also investigated in solar photo fenton process for the inactivation of e coli in municipal wastewater villegas guzman et al 2017 this new proposed green process resulted in a total inactivation of e coli 6 log units in 180 min in the presence of lime juice 5 mg fe l 1 25 mg h2o2 l 1 600 w m 2 lima perini et al 2018 investigated e coli inactivation in hospital wastewater by photo fenton with uv a and uv c as light sources respectively total inactivation 6 log units was observed after 90 min treatment by uv c photo fenton but only 2 log units inactivation was achieved by uva photo fenton although the use of e coli as microbial indicator is useful to evaluate the compliance of uwtps effluents with local regulations for wastewater disposal into the environment or reuse as well as to evaluate disinfection process efficiency and compare to scientific works available in the literature it is not sufficient to understand the real impact of the process on bacterial population manaia et al 2018 accordingly in this work an attempt to better characterize this impact was made through the comparison between the results from standard plate count method and flow cytometry to characterize cell abundance and size distribution in this case the experiments were conducted at two different concentrations and in particular the condition a the same used for e coli inactivation h2o2 0 735 mm 25 mg l 1 cu ids complex 0 01 mm corresponding to 0 25 mgl 1 of cu copper sulphate 0 008 mm corresponding to 0 25 mgl 1 of cu iron sulphate 0 018 mm corresponding to 1 mgl 1 of fe and the condition b h2o2 1 470 mm 50 mgl 1 cu ids complex 0 02 mm corresponding to 0 50 mgl 1 of cu copper sulphate 0 016 mm corresponding to 0 5 mgl 1 of cu iron sulphate 0 036 mm corresponding to 2 mgl 1 of fe the values of inactive active cells and the percentage of inactive cells with respect to the total cells are showed in fig 6 the higher efficiency in terms of cells inactivation among the photo fenton processes was observed for uv c h2o2 cu condition b in the samples treated with cu h2o2 at two different concentration a and b the number of active cell decreased when compared to samples treated with fe h2o2 respectively 3 0 and 2 9 log units cells 1 moreover samples treated with cu ids complex showed a similar decrease of the active cell number at the highest concentration b 2 95 log units cell 1 as showed in fig 6a looking at the number of inactivated cells fig 6b as absolute number photo fenton processes had similar results although treatment with cu h2o2 appears to be more aligned with the results of only uvc and uvc h2o2 however the interesting result is represented by the number of inactive cells with respect to the totals fig 6c among the lowest concentrations a investigated photo fenton by cu ids was the most performing process 37 of inactivated cells all other treatments with low concentrations a resulted in a percentage of inactivated cells less than 30 at the highest concentrations b the most performant treatment was the photo fenton process by cu h2o2 44 of inactivated cells immediately followed by the treatment by cu ids 40 in order to better understand the behaviour of bacterial cells under the action of the different disinfection processes investigated cytometric analysis has been also carried out to characterize cell clusters small clusters and aggregates fig 7 the higher formation of small clusters 5 4 and 5 6 log units ml 1 was observed for uv c fe h2o2 process at two different concentrations a and b respectively fig 7a interestingly fenton process fe2 h2o2 resulted in the formation of a higher amount 5 5 log units of small clusters compared to the cu ids h2o2 and cu2 h2o2 approximately 5 3 log units and the remaining processes approximately 5 1 log units looking at the formation of large clusters aggregates the higher formation was observed for cu h2o2 process approximately 3 3 log units fig 7b among photo fenton processes uv c fe h2o2 resulted in the higher formation of aggregates approximately 3 1 log units for the higher h2o2 concentration b the formation of small clusters and aggregates might promote resistance among cells to the disinfection process and slow down bacterial inactivation even in dark experiments the cells have a great capacity to form clusters therefore the uv c in photo driven aops might be the key factor affecting the process and speeding up the inactivation kinetics the cluster formation is the response of bacterial communities to stress such as uv light exposure kollu and ormeci 2015 predation corno and jurgens 2006 antibiotic pressure corno et al 2014 and chemical disinfection di cesare et al 2016 it is worthy to mention that when the effect of low doses of disinfectant peracetic acid was investigated cluster formation drastically decreased as the dose was increased from 0 to 25 mg l 1 min turolla et al 2017 according to the results of our work the bacterial cell response depends on the various oxidative stress factors affecting the cells the fe based aops investigated in this work promoted the formation of clusters decreasing bacterial inactivation efficiency especially at the highest concentrations b instead in the presence of cu and cu ids complex the formation of small and large clusters decreased and process efficiency improved accordingly 4 conclusions the new photo fenton like process uv c h2o2 cu ids investigated in this work was proven to be really effective in the inactivation of e coli complete inactivation 3 5 log units in 10 min at natural ph 7 8 0 5 in real wastewater also compared to the other processes investigated uv c h2o2 cu uv c h2o2 fe h2o2 and uv c unlike of what observed for e coli inactivation the investigated processes only partially inactivated total bacterial population from 18 for uv c to 42 for uv c h2o2 cu ids according to flow cytometry measurements in particular cu based photo fenton processes resulted in the higher percentage of inactivated total cells thus being consistent with the results of e coli inactivation it is worthy to note that as h2o2 was decreased uv c h2o2 cu ids was more effective than uv c h2o2 cu process flow cytometry also confirmed that both fenton and photo fenton processes are more effective than conventional disinfection processes uv c and h2o2 respectively in the inactivation of total bacteria population moreover the formation of small and large clusters decreased in the presence of cu and cu ids complex and process efficiency improved accordingly these results show that cu based aops can more effectively disaggregate clusters thus making disinfection process more effective than fe based aops and other investigated processes most important uv c h2o2

19277,photo fenton process is among the most effective advanced oxidation processes aops in urban wastewater treatment and disinfection but its application as tertiary treatment at full scale has not

phenol 95 was observed after 60 min treatment being the process more effective than all other investigated aops fenton and photo fenton processes this process was also proven to be more effective in the inactivation of e coli complete inactivation 3 5 log units in 10 min at natural ph 7 8 0 5 in real wastewater than the other processes investigated unlike of what observed for e coli inactivation

was more effective than uv c h2o2 cu process moreover the formation of small and large clusters decreased in the presence of cu and cu ids complex and process efficiency improved accordingly these results show that cu based aops can more effectively disaggregate clusters thus making disinfection process more effective than fe based aops graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes escherichia coli flow cytometry homogeneous photocatalysis wastewater disinfection 1 introduction disinfection of wastewater is typically achieved by chemical e g chlorine peracetic acid or physical uv c radiation processes in urban wastewater treatment plants uwtps di cesare et al 2016 among disinfection processes chlorination is the most widely used in uwtps but the formation of hazardous disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps lee et al 2007 results in environmental and public health concerns accordingly peracetic acid antonelli et al 2013 formisano et al 2016 and uv c radiation di cesare et al 2016 are increasingly replacing chlorine in urban wastewater disinfection however although these treatments can effectively inactivate bacteria to meet standards for effluent disposal into the environment they fail meeting stringent standards such as those for wastewater reuse at least under typical operating conditions in uwtps therefore in the last years advanced oxidation processes aops among which uv h2o2 photo fenton and tio2 photocatalysis have been investigated in wastewater disinfection due to the production of highly oxidizing reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals ho they were found to be not only effective in the inactivation of a wide range of waterborne pathogens gárcia fernández et al 2012 but also in the removal of a wide range of micropollutants klamerth et al 2010 ferro et al 2015 moreover aops seem to be more effective than chlorination to reduce bacterial regrowth after disinfection fiorentino et al 2015 which is a primary issue in wastewater reuse practices where disinfected wastewater may be stored for hours days before crops irrigation among aops the photo fenton uv h2o2 fe process demonstrated the higher potential in the inactivation of bacteria but its application to wastewater disinfection at full scale has not been a feasible attractive option so far because optimum conditions are typically achieved under acidic ph ferro et al 2016 as matter of fact as ph increases iron precipitates and it is no longer available for the reaction with h2o2 therefore in the recent years a number of different approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of photo fenton process in particular when photo fenton has been investigated as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater to remove contaminants of emerging concern cecs typically occurring at low concentrations from a few to hundreds ng l as well as to inactivate bacteria process operation under mild conditions ph 5 6 resulted in a good efficiency klamerth et al 2010 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 other possible approaches include the use of heterogeneous and homogeneous photo fenton like processes in particular in heterogeneous photo fenton like processes fe2 is replaced by a solid catalyst while homogeneous processes include a combination of other metal ion s metal ion organic ligand wang et al 2016 in homogeneous photo fenton like processes fe2 is replaced by other metals namely cu2 mn2 co2 and ag possibly combined to organic or inorganic ligands to form complexes and or to stabilize the metals over a wide ph range wang et al 2016 different ligands such as nitriloacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetracetic acid edta oxalic acid tartaric acid de luca et al 2014 and ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds papoutsakis et al 2015 have been successfully tested in tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater so far indeed the research and the design of new bio degradable and active ligands following the benign by design approach cucciniello et al 2016 is an active task of research ricciardi et al 2017 herein the use of iminodisuccinic acid

1998 in this study a cu ids complex was synthesized characterized and applied as active catalyst for photo fenton disinfection process in municipal wastewaters preliminarily the efficiency of photo fenton with cu ids complex was tested in the removal of a model compound phenol from water and compared to a classic photo fenton uv c fe h2o2 to uvc h2o2 and to a non iron photo fenton using copper sulphate subsequently the process was investigated as municipal wastewater disinfection system and its effect on complex microbial communities was assessed in terms of bacterial cell abundance and size distribution single cells cell clusters through flow cytometry as well as in terms of escherichia coli inactivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sample wastewater samples were collected

nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker avance 400 nmr the chemical shifts were reported in δ ppm referenced to sime4 and 5 mg of the complex in 0 5 ml of solvent were used for each experiment 2 4 experimental set up of photo fenton and control tests preliminary experiments to evaluate the effect of the photo fenton like process uv c cu ids h2o2 on phenol were carried out in a 1 0 l cylindrical glass reactor 5 0 cm in diameter completely covered with aluminium paper and filled in with the 500 ml of phenol deionized water solution process efficiency was evaluated in terms of phenol mineralization through total organic carbon toc removal the reactor was placed in a water bath to control the temperature at 25 c during the experiments the solution in the reactor was stirred continuously the uv c 16 w lamp sankyo denky g10t5l japan was located in vertical position at the centre of the glass reactor disinfection tests were carried out with a rotor engine based reactor where twelve 0 1 l cylindrical glass vessels were placed at 5 cm from the uvc lamp this experimental set up was adopted to compare in triplicate and simultaneously the different disinfection processes on real wastewater furthermore a negative control cylindrical glasses covered with aluminium paper for each photo driven aop was performed too 2 4 1 photo fenton like tests for phenol removal in order to identify the best h2o2 cu ids ratio for photo fenton like process fixed concentration of h2o2 2 94 mm and different concentration of cu ids from 0 016 to 0 5 mm were investigated according to the results of these preliminary tests the operating conditions selected for the subsequent tests for phenol removal in terms of h2o2 concentrations were 1 470 and 29 399 mm maintaining a constant cu ids

analysis of variance anova test for model fit was used to identify whether a linear or a quadratic relationship with concentration could fit better the data the analyses were performed including also differences between the two times of exposition 20 and 60 min a liner model lm was used to test whether the performance in e coli inactivation vs time was significant and whether it was significantly different between methods anova tests were performed to identify 1 whether the performance in toc removal was different between the eight treatment methods and at different times of exposure 20 or 60 min 2 whether the performance in the removal of active and inactivated cells was different and 3 whether the number of small clusters and aggregates was affected by differences among the investigated

effective catalyst for fenton and photo fenton like process in wastewater treatment cu ids complex was investigated in the removal of phenol from water preliminary tests using different h2o2 cu ids ratios were performed at 20 min treatment time 2 94 mm of h2o2 and 0 53 mm of phenol initial concentration ph 6 to find the optimum condition in terms of toc removal the optimum ratio was found to be 75 when phenol mineralization resulted in 26 toc removal after 20 min treatment fig 2 as optimum h2o2 cu ids ratio was established six different concentrations of cu ids from 0 02 mm to 0 40 mm and

mineralization rates were observed after 60 min treatment fig 3 table si1 and the concentration of h2o2 cu ids was positively related to toc removal in a non linear relationship with slightly differential trajectories between 20 and 60 min table si1 as h2o2 and cu ids initial concentrations were increased over 14 70 mm and 0 02 mm respectively no significant change in toc removal was observed after 60 min treatment moreover uv c h2o2 cu ids process was compared to i iron h2o2 fe2 copper h2o2 cu2 and cu ids h2o2 cu ids based fenton ii iron uv c h2o2 fe2 copper uv c h2o2 cu2 and cu ids uv c h2o2 cu ids based photo fenton as well as to iii uv c h2o2 processes h2o2 as standalone process was also investigated as control fig 4 treatment time affected toc removal with higher

revealed that iron copper and cu ids based fenton did not differ among each other and from simple h2o2 treatment at 20 min and that iron and copper based fenton had similar effects at 60 min as expected photo fenton processes resulted in higher efficiencies compared to fenton processes in particular photo fenton processes efficiencies were in the following order uv c h2o2 cu ids uv c h2o2 cu2 uv c h2o2 fe2 uv c h2o2 process resulted in a lower efficiency compared to photo fenton processes but in higher efficiency compared to fenton processes the initial ph of the solution was 5 7 but during the process the ph decreased to 3 7 due to the formation of oxidation by products although phenols are typically used as model pollutants to investigate the efficiency of different aops including photo fenton process only a few works are available on the effect of metal ligand complexes based photo fenton process on phenol prato garcia et al 2009 investigated the performance of solar driven photo fenton process compound parabolic collector cpc based photo reactor in the treatment of phenolic aqueous solutions 185 200 mg l 1 at natural ph in the presence of ferrioxalate the results achieved are consistent with the results of our experiment with uv c h2o2 cu ids because 85 100 cod reduction was observed after 120 min treatment ph 5 6 oxalate 300 mg l 1 h2o2 phenol 5 5 6 3 monteagudo et al 2011 also investigated ferrioxalate induced solar photo fenton process effect on phenols using a cpc reactor in particular aqueous solution contained a mixture of three phenolic compounds gallic p coumaric and protocatechuic acids and 94 toc removal was achieved in 194 min under optimal conditions h2o2 400 mg l 1 fe ii 20 mg l 1 h2c2o4 60 mg l 1 phenols 20 mg l 1 average solar power 35 w m 2 3 3 wastewater disinfection by advanced oxidation processes uv c h2o2 cu ids process was investigated in municipal wastewater disinfection through flow cytometry and plate count method e coli inactivation process efficiency was compared with uv c h2o2 fe2 and uv c h2o2 cu2 at natural ph 7 8 0 5 in order to meet the limits for residual copper and iron concentrations in uwtp effluents established by italian regulation for wastewater reuse 1 0 mg l 1 for copper and 2 mg l 1 for iron the metals were dosed to half of the limit due to the respective effects on bacterial inactivation tests with h2o2 0 735 mm 25 mgl 1 condition a and uv c as standalone processes were also performed for comparison e coli inactivation vs time was significant anova f1 96 566 5 p 0 0001 with all treatment methods performing significantly better than dark f5 96 157 4 p 0 0001 fig 5 in particular the best disinfection performance was observed with uv c h2o2 cu ids process a complete inactivation 3 5 log units of the initial e coli concentration 5 1 103 0 7 103 cfu ml 1 was achieved in 10 min while 15 and 20 min were necessary for uv c h2o2 cu and uv c h2o2 fe processes respectively unlike of photo fenton based processes h2o2 and uv c did not result in a complete inactivation of e coli within 20 min treatment although this is the first time that uv c h2o2 cu ids process has been investigated in e coli inactivation the parallel experiments with conventional photo fenton make possible a comparison with the scientific literature as matter of fact bacterial inactivation by photo fenton process uv h2o2 fe has been widely investigated and our results are really encouraging compared to the literature it is noteworthy that most of the papers deal with solar driven photo fenton rodríguez chueca et al 2014 ferro et al 2015 villegas guzman et al 2017 in particular when solar photo fenton under mild conditions ph 5 20 mg h2o2 l 1 10 mg fe l 1 was investigated in the inactivation of e coli in urban wastewater effluents a 3 log unit decrease was observed rodríguez chueca et al 2014 moreover natural iron and natural additives as complexing agents were also investigated in solar photo fenton process for the inactivation of e coli in municipal wastewater villegas guzman et al 2017 this new proposed green process resulted in a total inactivation of e coli 6 log units in 180 min in the presence of lime juice 5 mg fe l 1 25 mg h2o2 l 1 600 w m 2 lima perini et al 2018 investigated e coli inactivation in hospital wastewater by photo fenton with uv a and uv c as light sources respectively total inactivation 6 log units was observed after 90 min treatment by uv c photo fenton but only 2 log units inactivation was achieved by uva photo fenton although the use of e coli as microbial indicator is useful to evaluate the compliance of uwtps effluents with local regulations for wastewater disposal into the environment or reuse as well as to evaluate disinfection process efficiency and compare to scientific works available in the literature it is not sufficient to understand the real impact of the process on bacterial population manaia et al 2018 accordingly in this work an attempt to better characterize this impact was made through the comparison between the results from standard plate count method and flow cytometry to characterize cell abundance and size distribution in this case the experiments were conducted at two different concentrations and in particular the condition a the same used for e coli inactivation h2o2 0 735 mm 25 mg l 1 cu ids complex 0 01 mm corresponding to 0 25 mgl 1 of cu copper sulphate 0 008 mm corresponding to 0 25 mgl 1 of cu iron sulphate 0 018 mm corresponding to 1 mgl 1 of fe and the condition b h2o2 1 470 mm 50 mgl 1 cu ids complex 0 02 mm corresponding to 0 50 mgl 1 of cu copper sulphate 0 016 mm corresponding to 0 5 mgl 1 of cu iron sulphate 0 036 mm corresponding to 2 mgl 1 of fe the values of inactive active cells and the percentage of inactive cells with respect to the total cells are showed in fig 6 the higher efficiency in terms of cells inactivation among the photo fenton processes was observed for uv c h2o2 cu condition b in the samples treated with cu h2o2 at two different concentration a and b the number of active cell decreased when compared to samples treated with fe h2o2 respectively 3 0 and 2 9 log units cells 1 moreover samples treated with cu ids complex showed a similar decrease of the active cell number at the highest concentration b 2 95 log units cell 1 as showed in fig 6a looking at the number of inactivated cells fig 6b as absolute number photo fenton processes had similar results although treatment with cu h2o2 appears to be more aligned with the results of only uvc and uvc h2o2 however the interesting result is represented by the number of inactive cells with respect to the totals fig 6c among the lowest concentrations a investigated photo fenton by cu ids was the most performing process 37 of inactivated cells all other treatments with low concentrations a resulted in a percentage of inactivated cells less than 30 at the highest concentrations b the most performant treatment was the photo fenton process by cu h2o2 44 of inactivated cells immediately followed by the treatment by cu ids 40 in order to better understand the behaviour of bacterial cells under the action of the different disinfection processes investigated cytometric analysis has been also carried out to characterize cell clusters small clusters and aggregates fig 7 the higher formation of small clusters 5 4 and 5 6 log units ml 1 was observed for uv c fe h2o2 process at two different concentrations a and b respectively fig 7a interestingly fenton process fe2 h2o2 resulted in the formation of a higher amount 5 5 log units of small clusters compared to the cu ids h2o2 and cu2 h2o2 approximately 5 3 log units and the remaining processes approximately 5 1 log units looking at the formation of large clusters aggregates the higher formation was observed for cu h2o2 process approximately 3 3 log units fig 7b among photo fenton processes uv c fe h2o2 resulted in the higher formation of aggregates approximately 3 1 log units for the higher h2o2 concentration b the formation of small clusters and aggregates might promote resistance among cells to the disinfection process and slow down bacterial inactivation even in dark experiments the cells have a great capacity to form clusters therefore the uv c in photo driven aops might be the key factor affecting the process and speeding up the inactivation kinetics the cluster formation is the response of bacterial communities to stress such as uv light exposure kollu and ormeci 2015 predation corno and jurgens 2006 antibiotic pressure corno et al 2014 and chemical disinfection di cesare et al 2016 it is worthy to mention that when the effect of low doses of disinfectant peracetic acid was investigated cluster formation drastically decreased as the dose was increased from 0 to 25 mg l 1 min turolla et al 2017 according to the results of our work the bacterial cell response depends on the various oxidative stress factors affecting the cells the fe based aops investigated in this work promoted the formation of clusters decreasing bacterial inactivation efficiency especially at the highest concentrations b instead in the presence of cu and cu ids complex the formation of small and large clusters decreased and process efficiency improved accordingly 4 conclusions the new photo fenton like process uv c h2o2 cu ids investigated in this work was proven to be really effective in the inactivation of e coli complete inactivation 3 5 log units in 10 min at natural ph 7 8 0 5 in real wastewater also compared to the other processes investigated uv c h2o2 cu uv c h2o2 fe h2o2 and uv c unlike of what observed for e coli inactivation the investigated processes only partially inactivated total bacterial population from 18 for uv c to 42 for uv c h2o2 cu ids according to flow cytometry measurements in particular cu based photo fenton processes resulted in the higher percentage of inactivated total cells thus being consistent with the results of e coli inactivation it is worthy to note that as h2o2 was decreased uv c h2o2 cu ids was more effective than uv c h2o2 cu process flow cytometry also confirmed that both fenton and photo fenton processes are more effective than conventional disinfection processes uv c and h2o2 respectively in the inactivation of total bacteria population moreover the formation of small and large clusters decreased in the presence of cu and cu ids complex and process efficiency improved accordingly these results show that cu based aops can more effectively disaggregate clusters thus making disinfection process more effective than fe based aops and other investigated processes most important uv c h2o2

19278,this study investigated the impact of ph on the migration of cadmium ii ions cd2 in relation to montmorillonite ksf colloids through a water saturated sand column wssc the sorption isotherms of cd2 on colloids and sand at ph values of 3 6 and 8 were characterized by batch experiments cd2 sorption by colloids and sand fit well with the freundlich model in the column experiments increasing the ph increased the retardation factors and kf values of cd2 both with and without the presence of the colloids the amount of cd2 sorbed onto the montmorillonite ksf colloids in the column effluent increased from 0 29 to 0 97 mg as the ph increased the colloid increased cd2 mobility and acted as a carrier at a high solution ph the increasing level of cd2 sorbed on colloids as the ph increased resulted in a long tailing of the breakthrough curve btc of the total cd indicating that the total cd was controlled by rate limited reactions these findings indicate that when the solution ph was greater than the point of zero charge pzc of the colloids ph 6 the system tended to follow a nonequilibrium two site tsm model rather than an equilibrium cdeq model this implies that the pzc of the colloids in the groundwater system is the main factor in predicting facilitated cd2 transport graphical abstract image 1 keywords cadmium contaminant transport groundwater hydrus 1d montmorillonite

groundwater contamination lee et al 2005 cadmium cd contamination in the environment can be caused by fuel combustion and human activities such as mining and using fertilizers the exposure pathway of cd includes ingestion of contaminated food and water or inhalation of cd fumes from industry or cigarette smoking which can also lead to cd exposure järup 2003 who 2010 cd can be transported along with the flow of groundwater and therefore cause soil and groundwater pollution sen et al 2002 jameel et al 2012 the transportation of colloid particles in subsurface environments is one mechanism capable of contributing to the movement of contaminants that are sorbed onto these solids such as heavy metal ions colloids might be important in facilitating the transport of other contaminants particular heavy metals because of their strong sorption properties mccarthy 1986 mccarthy and mckay 2004 zhu et al 2014 tan et al 2017 these contaminants could travel much farther and faster than would be anticipated from traditional solute transport models based on batch sorption data mccarthy and mckay 2004 usman et al 2005 many studies have investigated the colloid facilitated transport of strongly sorbed heavy metals and a metalloid arsenic in soils and groundwater lichner et al 2007 serrano et al 2015 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 and found that colloids act as a carrier to migrate such metals in the subsurface media wang et al 2014 yuan and peng 2017 for example the study of sun et al 2010 investigated the sorption mechanism of lead ii onto both kaolinite and sand and found that the sorption capacity of kaolinite was approximately 30 times greater than that of sand moreover in a saturated sand column a kaolinite colloid could promote the mobility of cadmium ii ions cd2 because the ionic strength is is nearly 0 mm however the mobility is inhibited at greater is wikiniyadhanee 2012 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 previous research has shown that the structure of montmorillonite has a large specific surface area and can be bound with hydrated exchangeable cations between the cations and various heavy metal ions gao et al 2006 bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 the hypothesis of our research is that the presence of montmorillonite clay colloidal particles and an increase in solution ph will enhance the transport of cd2 in a wssc this research assumed that cd2 is released from the contaminated soils where montmorillonite is generally found and is transported through unconfined aquifers under various ph conditions in real world conditions soil ph is affected by natural processes such as acid rain as well as many human activities such as fertilizer application liming for neutralizing soil acidity and mining activities that drain acidic mine waste into downstream areas such factors can cause variation in soil ph which affects the interaction of montmorillonite and cd in groundwater systems other studies focus mainly on either the sorption behavior of cd2 onto montmorillonite under different environmental conditions in batch experiments zhu et al 2001 abollino et al 2003 bhattacharyya and gupta 2007 darrant et al 2018 or the migration of dissolved cd2 in

the effect of montmorillonite colloids on cd2 transport under various ph conditions in a subsurface environment is still limited to obtain a better understanding of the fate and transport of cd2 corresponding to montmorillonite colloids the present study applies the hydrus 1d mathematical model including a chemical non equilibrium module to describe the solute cd2 that interacts with montmorillonite colloids under various ph conditions in a natural groundwater system the objectives of this study are as follows a to assess the effect of solution ph on the migration of cd2 in relation to montmorillonite colloids b to investigate the influence of a montmorillonite colloid on cd mobility in a water saturated sand column wssc and c to identify the proper parameters of advection dispersion equilibrium and chemical non equilibrium models to describe cd2 transport accounting for montmorillonite colloids under different ph conditions our findings from experiments and modeling are reliable for predicting and establishing the predictive framework for the migration of cd2 with colloidal particles through hydrogeological formations under various subsurface environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercial clay montmorillonite ksf was purchased from sigma aldrich and was used to represent montmorillonite colloids in sorption and column experiments the cation exchange capacity cec and surface area were set at 30 meq 100 g and 20 40 m2 g respectively and particle size is was 20 25 μm the point of zero charge pzc for montmorillonite ksf is between ph 5 0 and 6 0 liu et al 2008 the clay minerals in the montmorillonite ksf were identified by x ray diffraction xrd using an equilibrium from bruker axz germany model d8 advance x ray diffractometer at the department of geology faculty of science chualongkorn university the xrd preparation was conducted followed the methods proposed by moore and reynolds 1997 the whole rock xrd analysis was conducted in reflection geometry to analyze the minerals in the montmorillonite ksf sample the sample was investigated as random powder under operating condition of 40 kv 30 ma and copper kα radiation λ 1 5404 å with a scan rate of 2 min and a step of 0 02 covering a range between 4 and 80 the database of x ray powder diffraction patterns is based on a powder diffraction file pdf maintained by the international centre for diffraction data icdd the chemical composition of the montmorillonite ksf clay was identified as an oxide compound through x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf bruker axs germany at the same location as that for the xrd analysis prior to analysis the sample was weighed and dried in an oven at 100 c overnight the sample was mixed with spectro blend a wax binder at a sample to binder mixing ratio of 10 2 the mixed sample was then compressed by a compressor for 2 min the formed pellet was placed in a desiccator prior to xrf analysis the loss of ignition was determined by calcination at 1000 c the mineralogical composition of the cleaned sand was analyzed only by xrd the dissolved cd solution as a representative of cd contaminated water from natural processes e g acid rain or human activities was prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 4h2o s in ultrapure water to obtain a 1000 ppm cd2 solution the ph was adjusted to 3 6 or 8 b y using 0 1 m nitric acid hno3 or 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh as required according to the phreeqc model result data not shown the dissolved cd ions as prepared in the solution with cd no3 2 4h2o generally remained stable with no precipitation forming in the experimental system moreover previous studies homann and zasoski 1987 naidu et al 1994 undabeytia et al 1998 bolan et al 1999 found that some anions related to other cd species such as cl so4 2 po4 3 can interfere with the sorption and transport of cd 2 2 material preparation the 0 6 0 8 mm ottawa sand quartz sand purchased from fisher chemical was sequentially cleaned by rinsing in excess 0 01 m naoh and 0 01 m hno3 for 30 min each to eliminate the sorbed elements and metal oxides on the quartz sand surface afterward the sample was dried in a hot air oven at 105 c overnight and was stored in a plastic container zhou et al 2011 the montmorillonite ksf clay did not require pretreatment by chemical or physical processes before use the montmorillonite ksf clay and ultrapure water were added into a volumetric flask to create a montmorillonite colloidal suspension then the upper portion of the suspended colloidal particles was drained into an incipient flask after being placed in a shaking water bath for 30 min the particles remained in the flask for a few hours the concentration of the montmorillonite ksf colloid was determined and was then diluted to 250 mg l to this end an evaporating dish was heated at approximately 550 c for 1 h cooled in an oven for 15 20 min and then placed in a desiccator until a constant weight was achieved next 50 ml of the montmorillonite ksf colloidal suspension was placed in an evaporating dish evaporated in a hot air oven at 100 c overnight and cooled in a desiccator until a constant weight was attained the gain in weight represented the dry mass of montmorillonite ksf per 50 ml the montmorillonite ksf colloidal suspension 250 mg l and cd2 solution were added to a volumetric flask and ultrasonicated for 10 min to producing the cd2 bearing montmorillonite suspension the ph of this suspension was adjusted as required the final volume was set to 500 ml with cd2 and montmorillonite colloid contents of 10 mg l and 100 mg l respectively for column experiments in addition the surface charges of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloidal suspensions were measured by using a malvern zetasizer nano before performing the transport test 2 3 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted at room temperature rt 30 c on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm in a 60 ml polypropylene bottle containing 250 mg l of the montmorillonite ksf colloid in 30 ml of 0 25 g l montmorillonite ksf clay or 1 0 g of sand which was set to ph 3 6 or 8 b y adding 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hno3 as required for evaluating the isotherms the cd2 concentration was taken from 10 to 200 mg l at the equilibrium time kiatvarangkul 2013 wikiniyadhanee et al 2016 after agitation each suspension was filtered through a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe syringe filter because montmorillonite ksf particles were larger than the pore size of the filter and the dissolved cd2 level was then analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas perkin elmer usa the amount of cd2 sorbed by the montmorillonite ksf clay and sand was then determined by using eq 1 1 q e v c 0 c e m where q e is the concentration of cd on the montmorillonite ksf mg g at equilibrium c 0 is the initial concentration of cd2 mg l c e is the cd concentration in a aqueous solution at equilibrium mg l v is the volume of the cd solution l and m is mass of montmorillonite ksf g next the freundlich and langmuir equations were used as equilibrium models to analyze the data the freundlich equation is based on sorption onto a heterogeneous surface and can be calculated from the linear form in eq 2 2 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe is the amount of sorbed metal per unit weight of the soil mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of the solute metal mg l and k f and n are the freundlich constants the langmuir model assumes that the uptake of metal ions occur on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption with no interaction between the sorbed metal ions the values of the langmuir constants can be calculated by using a linear form as shown in eq 3 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where qm is the maximum amount of sorbed metal ion per unit weight of the aquifer matrix mg g and kl represents the langmuir constant l mg 2 4 water saturated sand column experiments the columns used were acrylic tubes with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and a length of 10 cm initially each column was initially sequentially cleansed with excess 0 01 m naoh and 0 01 m hno3 and rinsed and quartz sand was then packed by applying the wet packing method the actual bulk density in the columns after use varied from 1 70 to 1 73 g cm3 with a pore volume pv of 16 01 16 80 cm3 the pv was determined from the volume of the solution filling the pore space of the saturated sand column this value can be estimated from the volume of water used in the wet packing technique by adding sand and deionized water in the column at depth increments of 0 5 cm in this study the volume of water used to saturate the sand column was 1 pv the influent was introduced at the bottom end of the column to eliminate trapped air at an influent velocity or average linear velocity of approximately 2 40 m day prior to performing the experiments the packed columns were equilibrated by injection with at least 5 pvs of deionized water afterward 10 mg l of bromide br was used as an influent tracer in the sand column to investigate groundwater movement of the saturated sand column the effluent was collected at the top at the regular time using a fraction collector which was then filtered and finally determined for bromide br by ion chromatography ic model dionex ics 2500 sunnyvale usa breakthrough curves btcs were plotted between pore volume v v0 and br concentration c c 0 then the columns were injected with a cd2 free background solution at fixed ph values of approximately 3 6 and 8 and is of 0 003 m to establish a steady state flow and to standardize the chemical conditions next the respective cd2 solution or the cd2 bearing montmorillonite suspension at the respective ph value was pumped into the column at a constant velocity of 2 40 m day for 21 pvs thereafter several pvs of a cd2 free background solution of identical chemical composition was injected into the column until the concentration of cd2 in the effluence returned to the background levels or 0 mg l the effluent was periodically collected in polypropylene tubes by a fractional collector the concentrations of cd2 in each effluent fraction were measured by using aas the seepage velocity of all columns was 2 40 m day the data of the column experiments are provided in table 1 the breakthrough curves btcs were characterized as the relative pv v v 0 vs the cd2 concentration c c 0 after termination of the column elution the sand was excavated from the inlet and the level of cd2 bearing montmorillonite ksf colloids retained in the sand column was qualitatively evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx analysis jeol jsm 6400 in addition the amount of montmorillonite ksf colloids in each sample was determined by using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis spectrophotometry thermo spectronic england at a 300 nm wavelength the btcs of cd2 and the montmorillonite ksf colloid were plotted after analyzing the concentration of the montmorillonite ksf colloid the sample was separated into two fractions the first fraction was used to measure the concentration of the dissolved cd2 in the solution and the second fraction was used to determine the total cd concentration including all species of dissolved cd table s2 in the aqueous solution by adding 14 5 m hno3 to digest the montmorillonite ksf colloid zhu et al 2012 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 the calculated speciation of free cd2 ions in solution is the dominant species at low is of 3 mm at different ph levels as shown in table s2 we found that at an initial cd concentration of 10 mg l the cd appeared mainly as free cd2 ions in the range of 86 90 and the cdcl ranged from 10 to 14 moreover no cd hydroxide precipitation was noted similarly the study of basualto et al 2006 revealed that cd2 is the dominant species of cd in the acidic ph conditions with low chloride concentration this is in agreement with the results of previous studies zachara et al 1992 srivastava et al 2005 tahervand and jalali 2016 showing that the speciation of all cd species at ph 4 9 were mainly cd2 according to the minteq software program finally the level of montmorillonite facilitated cd retained in the sand column was determined by evaluating the difference between the concentration of total cd and dissolved cd the retardation factor of cd2 onto the sand was determined by using the area method nkedi kizza et al 1987 the sorption capacity specifically the milligrams of cd per gram of sand was estimated from total mass of cd sorbed in the column divided by the mass of sand in the column 2 5 hydrus 1d model the hydrus 1d model šimunek et al 2008 chotpantarat et al 2011 2012 can be applied to assess the migration of heavy metal ions in variably saturated soils by using both the linear nonlinear equilibrium convection dispersion cdeq and chemical non equilibrium processes as shown in eqs 4 and 5 4 c t d l 2 c x 2 v x c

a particular solute concentration when reaching the equilibrium condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical properties of montmorillonite ksf clay and sand the results of the xrd analysis supported that the montmorillonite kfs clay used in this study was a montmorillonite mineral and that the sand was a pure quartz mineral figs s1 and s2 the reflection at the 2 theta value at approximately 6 66 corresponds to the montmorillonite the angle of which is generally 4 10 lucian 2016 semi quantitative xrd analysis was performed on montmorillonite ksf samples as a whole rock sample using the computer program diffracplus release 2004 ver 10 for immediate measurement the percentages of individual minerals in the montmorillonite ksf were calculated and the net areas of peaks were converted to the percentages the montmorillonite ksf contained five peaks corresponding to montmorillonite illite hematite goethite and chlorite with estimated mineral percentages of 78 77 14 48 3 25 2 30 and 1 20 respectively furthermore the mineral composition in the montmorillonite ksf clay was determined by xrf analysis to consist of sio2 30 70 so3 13 50 al2o3 11 60 fe2o3 5 85 mgo 2 19

the equilibrium amount of cd2 sorbed by the montmorillonite ksf clay increased as the initial concentration of cd2 increased from 10 to 250 ppm that for sand increased from 10 to 100 ppm inskeep and baham 1983 christensen 1984 tiller et al 1984 naidu et al 1994 1997 additionally kiatvarangkul 2013 reported that although the equilibrium time of cd2 sorption on sand was much longer at 1080 min than that of montmorillonite ksf clay within 200 min it showed the same trend as that of montmorillonite ksf clay the kinetic test showed that montmorillonite ksf clay sorbed cd instantaneously during the first hour and slowed before approaching an equilibrium state within 200 min since illite and iron oxides were found in montmorillonite ksf clay the sorption of cd onto the pure montmorillonite k10 colloid which was purchased from sigma aldrich was additionally performed in a similar manner to that of montmorillonite ksf clay only in the batch sorption experiment section this was done to obtain a reference of pure montmorillonite with pretreatment with cacl2 which resulted in 97 montmorillonite according to the semi quantitative analysis fig s3 moreover zachara et al 1992 found an interaction between iron oxide and layer silicates which restricts the accessibility of cd to the permanent charge sites thus crystalline iron oxides do not have high sorbent potential for cd moreover the percentages of iron oxides as hematite and goethite were semiquantitatively determined to be approximately 3 25 and 2 30 respectively of the montmorillonite ksf this implies that the sorption of cd onto iron hydroxide may be negligible as compared with the main portion of montmorillonite and illite 3 2 1 freundlich isotherm the actual structure of the phyllosilicates of montmorillonite ksf was revealed to consist mainly of montmorillonite and illite montmorillonite generally consists of two binding sites permanent charge sites that are not ph dependent and variable charge sites that are ph dependent on the basis of the chemically kinetic coefficients and structure of a 2 1 layer silicates such reactive sorption sites can be defined as heterogeneous surfaces consisting of an octahedral sheet between two silica tetrahedral uddin 2017 for illites the 2 1 type minerals are the same as monmorillonite however the interlayers are bonded with potassium to satisfy the charge which generally has difficulty entering the interlayer space and exchanging with other cations in the aqueous phase as a result the cec of montmorillonite is greater than that of illite this is in agreement with the study of liu et al 2018 which found that site densities of fixed and variable charge sites of montmorillonite are higher than those of illite as a result the sorption capacity of cd onto montmorillonite commonly is higher than that of illite rybicka et al 1995 hongpong et al 2000 liu et al 2018 as stated the montmorillonite ksf has heterogeneous surfaces thus the sorption experiments should be effectively explained by the freundlich isotherm moreover we measured the zeta potential and particle size of cd bearing montmorillonite ksf colloids and found that an increase in solution ph from 3 to 8 can cause zeta potential on the colloidal surface became more negative from 5 19 to 12 47 mv and decrease the colloid size from 14 119 to 6 801 μm respectively resulting in an increase in the specific surface area of the montmorillonite ksf colloid as a result the sorption of cd onto the montmorillonite increased owing to the more negative surface charge and available sorption sites with the increase in solution ph the freundlich equation model assumes that the sorption of cd2 ions occurs on a heterogeneous surface jiang et al 2010 the freundlich isotherm parameters of cd2 sorption onto sand fig 1 a and montmorillonite ksf clay fig 1b are summarized in table 2 the cd2 sorption onto montmorillonite ksf clay and sand were both non linear and fit reasonably well to the freundlich equation model with r 2 values of 0 9599 0 9902 and 0 8110 0 9827 for the clay and sand respectively the k f value for montmorillonite ksf clay increased from 0 130 to 0 462 l g when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 indicating that the capacity of cd2 sorption by montmorillonite ksf clay increased as the ph increased this increase occurred likely because the cd2 ions were strongly bound to the hydroxyl groups on the edges of the clay minerals at higher ph values angove et al 1998 moreover at lower ph the cd2 ions in the solution must compete with a large number of h ions for the available sorption sites at the surface therefore the cd2 sorption was relatively low in addition the 1 n values for montmorillonite ksf clay tended to decrease as the ph increased this indicates a preferential sorption of cd2 at a higher solution ph than that at a lower solution ph the sorption occurred most often onto the variable charge sites through inner sphere complexes of cd hydroxide complexes naidu et al 1994 jiang et al 2010 shahmohammadi kalalagh et al 2011 on the contrary the 1 n values for sand were higher than 1 which indicates that cd2 sorption by sand was not favorable and the k f values of the sand were very low when compared with those for montmorillonite ksf clay zachara and smith 1994 found that cd can form at least two types of complexes with layer silicates 1 ion exchange to the permanent charge sites on the basal plane through outer sphere complexation and 2 coordination complexes with sioh or aloh groups exposed at the crystalline edge sites which are mainly the variable charges sites kookana et al 1999 however they found that the edge complexation reactions were more important on soil smectite the sorption of cd increased with an increase in ph 8 owing to the preferential sorption of cd hydroxide complexes through inner sphere complexation at the crystal edge surfaces naidu et al 1994 at ph 8 the results showed hydrolyzed cd oh in the range of 0 57 0 68 table s2 this is in agreement with the studies of naidu et al 1994 1997 who found that the speciation of cd consists mainly of cd2 at ph 8 and that cd oh suddenly increases at ph 8 as a result the sorption of cd hydrolyzed species onto the edge sites was better than that of free cd2 ions naidu et al 1994 longanathan et al 2012 wang et al 2016 similarly the study of srivastava et al 2005 reported that cd oh 2 aq occurs in the system at ph 8 5 moreover we found that the freundlich isotherm parameters of cd2 sorption onto montmorillonite k10 colloids as summarized in table 2 and fig s4 were non linear and fit reasonably well to the freundlich and langmuir models with r 2 values of 0 9737 0 9930 and 0 9451 0 9856 respectively for the freundlich isotherm the k f value for montmorillonite k10 clay increased from 5 062 to 7 029 l g when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 in addition the 1 n values for this clay tended to decrease as the ph increased indicating that the sorption of cd is more favorable at a higher solution ph because the surface of montmorillonite k10 clay became more negatively charged than that at a lower solution ph the sorption results are in accordance with those of montmorillonite ksf clay the kf values of montmorillonite k10 clay were approximately 10 40 times higher than those of montmorillonite ksf clay owing to the higher specific surface area 220 270 m2 g and cec 60 meq mg representing permanent charge sites gu et al 2010 the higher k f and q m as well as the lower 1 n for montmorillonite k10 clay can be explained by the cd2 binding strongly to the hydroxyl groups on the edge sites of the montmorillonite k10 clay at higher ph values angove et al 1998 3 2 2 langmuir isotherm the langmuir equation model assumes that the uptake of metal ions occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption with no interaction among sorbed metal ions jiang et al 2010 the data in fig 1c and table 2 show that the sorption of cd2 on montmorillonite ksf colloids could be explained by the langmuir isotherm model with r 2 values of 0 9548 0 9877 in addition the sorption capacity of montmorillonite ksf clay and k l values increased from 25 974 to 263 158 mg g and 0 002 0 006 l g respectively as the ph increased from 3 to 8 thus raising the ph increased the sorption of cd2 to montmorillonite ksf clay which is consistent with previously reported results bhattacharyya and gupta 2007 on the contrary the cd2 sorption equilibrium onto sand could not be described using the langmuir isotherm model because langmuir parameters such as maximum sorption capacity qm and sorption rate were not applicable according to the sem results the surface roughness on the ottawa sand appeared to be heterogeneous moreover the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of ottawa sand is very low at approximately 0 004 0 006 m2 g avnir et al 1984 and amasvata 2014 reported that the bet surface area is not available thus no significant changes in sorption behavior appear to have occurred under different ph values in the system both the heterogeneous surface and very low specific area are possible reason why the langmuir isotherm is not applicable for montmorillonite k10 the q m of montmorillonite k10 was increased from 77 519 mg g to 175 439 mg g as the solution ph increased as previously mentioned the sorption of montmorillonite k10 has been effectively explained by the langmuir and freudlich isotherms table 2 and fig s4 thus increasing in the solution ph likely enhances the sorption capacity of cd onto montmorillonite k10 clay according to the obtained equilibrium sorption data fig 1 and table 2 the sorption capacity and sorption rate of cd2 onto montmorillonite ksf clay were much higher than those on sand under each ph condition montmorillonite has a large specific surface area and can be bound with hydrated exchangeable cations to form an outer surface complex to a greater extent than sand bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 thus the sorption of cd onto the sand is very low compared with that of montmorillonite ksf many studies moradi et al 2005 shen et al 2008 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 found that the freundlich isotherm can effectively explain well the sorption of cd onto soils for example karak et al 2014 and moradi et al 2005 reported that the freundlich isotherm can describe the sorption and transport of cd in a layered clay soil in the application of sewage sludge furthermore the sorption experiment can be explained by sorption reactions between the aqueous solution and surface of montmorillonite colloids by using the surface complexation module of the phreeqc geochemical model parkhurst and appelo 1999 according to the clay characterization the cd sorption has two binding sites permanent charge sites and variable charge sites therefore we used the surface complexation module to preliminarily investigate the sorption mechanism of cd onto the montmorillonite to simulate the sorption reaction of cd onto the montmorillonite colloids log k values were selected from previous studies gu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 the results showed that the sorption of cd onto montmorillonite colloids occurred in two types of binding sites consisting mainly permanent charge sites x to form the outer sphere surface complexes x2me on the fixed negative charge sites at ph values lower than approximately 6 however when the solution ph was higher point of zero charge pzc the variable charge sites soh generally had negative charge to form the inner sphere surface complex some takamatsu et al 2006 gu et al 2010 the variable charge sites gradually began to increase the proportion and mainly predominated at ph values exceeding 8 figure s5 interestingly the sorption experiment found that the final ph after finishing the sorption experiment at ph 8 appeared to decrease about one to two units of ph from ph 8 to 6 5 7 this indicates that the sorption of cd onto montmorilonite clay occurred mainly on the edge sites through the inner sphere complex however the final ph levels of sorption experiment samples at ph 3 and 6 were fairly constant the reaction for the permanent charge sites is 2 x cd 2 x 2 cd the reaction for the variable charge sites is soh cd 2 socd h the results of this study are in accordance with those of zachara et al 1992 who found that the sorption of cd onto smectites is controlled by the ion exchange on the permanent negative charge sites within the 2 1 layer lattice at ph values of approximately 6 5 and is of 0 01 mol l at ph values being higher than 6 5 however the sorption of cd was controlled by inner sphere complex reaction onto the variable charge sites which depend upon the environmental factors of solutions such as ph is and background solution 3 3 effect of solution ph on cd2 transport in the wsscs the cd2 solution was injected into the wsscs under different solution ph conditions to investigate the effect of the solution ph on cd2 transport the obtained btcs of cd2 transport through the wsscs fig 2 a revealed that the maximum relative concentration of cd2 c c 0 at every solution ph in the effluent was 1 however the time required to reach the maximum c c 0 was different at each ph level with values of at 5 5 7 and 13 pvs achieved at solution ph levels of 3 6 and 8 respectively the calculated retardation factor and sorption capacity of cd2 transported through the wsscs were increased from 3 36 to 8 77 and 7 48 10 4 to 6 65 10 3 mg g respectively when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 table 3 in addition the effects of ph 2 4 and 7 on the sorption and transport of cd2 in three soils of varying texture was evaluated in a column experiment by huang et al 2009 for example the retardation factor of two soils increased from 36 6 to 136 1 and 37 3 to 183 4 as the solution ph increased from 2 to 7 respectively thus higher solution ph values inhibited the transport of cd2 through the wsscs owing to increased cd2 sorption onto the sand the btcs of the cd2 movement for ph 3 and 6 revealed a symmetrical shape with a sharp cd2 concentration front and no tailing phenomena whereas those for ph 8 exhibited tailing phenomena this implies that the cd2 transport in the saturated sand column shifted to a more prominent non equilibrium condition as the ph values increased because more sorption sites are available at higher ph accordingly the percentage of recovered cd2 was lower as the ph increased from 3 to 8 with respective values of 98 23 83 67 this confirms that the sorption desorption mechanism appears to be irreversible sorption as the ph increases table 3 the ph effect on cd transport can be described by competition for sorption sites between cd2 ions and hydrogen ions in the system particularly at low ph conditions furthermore the effects of solution ph on cd sorption on soils can be explained by changes in the characteristics of the soil surface table 3 shows that the retardation factor of cd increases from 3 36 to 8 32 as the ph values increase from 3 to 8 this phenomenon can be explained by the following mechanisms the enhanced of ph can induce a more negative surface charge of quartz sand when the ph of the solution is higher than the pzc of quartz sand 5 0 causing an increase more in available sites to sorb cd in the columns chotpantarat et al 2011 the main group of pure quartz sand on the surface is sioh which is strongly deprotonated at higher ph sioh sio h thus these sites are available for sorption and naturally carry a negative charged to sorb cd similarly the study of naidu et al 1994 found that the adsorption of cd on soils depends upon the negative surface charge on the soils further sherene 2010 reported that soil maintained at a neutral to slightly alkaline ph showed low mobility of all heavy metal ions in general the sorption of heavy metal ions to soil increases with an increase in ph owing to fewer hydrogen ions thus at a lower ph value the mobility of heavy metal ions increases owing to the increased proton concentration sherene 2010 therefore in highly acidic soils the mobility of metallic elements is significantly higher than that in neutral or alkaline soils fijalkowski et al 2012 3 4 effect of solution ph on the facilitated transport of cd2 by a montmorillonite colloid in a wssc 3 4 1 cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloid the properties of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloidal suspensions are shown in table 4 the electrostatic potential of the edge sites decreased from approximately 5 19 to 12 47 mv as ph increased as a result the surface charge became more significantly more negative and the size of the montmorillonite colloids decreased by half from 14 119 to 6 801 μm respectively the transport of these colloid through a wssc at different solution ph values of 3 6 and 8 is presented as representative btcs in fig 2b as the ph increased the colloid effluent concentrations increased slowly with increasing pv towards a steady state level in addition the migration front or the initial breakthrough time of cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloids at ph 8 was substantially faster than that at ph 3 this occurred because when the solution ph increases the repulsive forces between the montmorillonite ksf colloids and quartz sand as well those among colloids alone also increases owing to the greater increase in the negative zeta potential as shown in table 4 moreover as the ph value increases it not only induces a more negative charge but also reduces the size of the colloids thus the solution ph affected the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloid transport through the wsscs the recovery of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloids increased from 71 08 to 87 92 as the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 although the sorption capacity of these colloids onto sand decreased table 4 the increase in solution ph inhibited the retention of cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloids in the wssc because the repulsive forces between the colloids and the sand were increased owing to an increase in the double layer zeta potential as shown in table 4 ryan and elimelech 1996 an increase in the solution ph increased the negative zeta potential of the montmorillonite clay colloids and the quartz sand which then enhanced the interaction of the electrostatic double layer repulsion elimelech et al 1995 and in turn drove the faster colloid release this finding is consistent with other studies on the effect of ph on colloid mobilization zhou et al 2011 moreover patil 2008 reported that in porous media the breakthrough peak was reduced with a decrease in solution ph at higher ph however the colloids were more negatively charged from the impact of a high level of oh on their surfaces which resulted in greater repulsive electrostatic interactions with the porous media 3 4 2 montmorillonite facilitated cd2 transport according to the co transport column assays the dissolved cd2 concentrations decreased from 9 29 to 5 06 mg l with an increase in ph from 3 to 8 whereas the concentration of montmorillonite facilitated cd2 increased from 0 63 to 3 06 ppm with the same increase in solution ph table s3 the results are somewhat similar to those obtained in the batch experiment in that the amount of cd2 sorbed onto the montmorillonite clay increased as the solution ph increased table 2 the btcs for the montmorillonite facilitated cd2 under the different solution ph conditions fig 3 table 5 showed that an increase in solution ph increased the concentration of this cd2 in the effluent moreover the concentration of montmorillonite facilitated cd2 compared with the total cd concentration in the effluent increased six fold from 6 71 to 38 96 table 5 when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 that is the migration of dissolved cd ions mainly cd2 in the column decreased from 93 29 to 61 04 as the solution ph increased it can be concluded that in subsurface environments with higher ph montmorillonite facilitated cd plays an important role in cd migration at approximately 40 of the total cd moreover at low ph conditions cd2 was sorbed through an ion exchange reaction to form outer sphere complexes on the permanent charge sites at ph values 6 the variable charge sites generally carry a negative charge to form the inner sphere surface complexes some this causes the concentration of cd2 sorbed onto montmorillonite ksf colloids to be enhanced with the reduced retention of these colloids in the sand column which promotes an increase the facilitated cd2 or total cd transport through the sand column the smaller sizes of the colloids and the greater electrostatic repulsion among them resulted in greater movement of cd sorbed onto the colloid and facilitated the migration of cd through the saturated sand column mitropoulou et al 2013 furthermore the retardation of cd decreased as the solution ph became lower table 3 and the retention of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloid decreased from 17 56 to 2 70 mg for ph values of 3 8 respectively table 4 similarly walshe et al 2010 reported that an increase in the solution ph led to more negative charges on the surfaces of aquifer media ms2 bacteriophages and kaolinite colloids greater electrostatic repulsion was reported among the phages as well as among the colloids resulting in greater movement of the ms2 phages attached to the colloids and increased removal rates of these phages through the saturated porous media ryan and elimelech 1996 found that when the ph was increased the colloidal deposition decreased because of an increase in the repulsive surface interaction energy and double layer thickness the sizes of the montmorillonite colloids increased when the ph condition decreases and can retain cd2 in the wssc due to size exclusion of montmorillonite colloids santos and bedrikovetsky 2006 reported that colloidal transport in the saturated soil column can be evaluated by the particle size of the colloids migrating in the column 3 4 3 effect of montmorillonite colloids on cd2 transport through a wssc to illustrate the effect of montmorillonite colloids on cd2 transport a comparison of the btcs of the total cd was conducted with and without the presence of montmorillonite the results indicated that the initial breakthrough time of total cd with montmorillonite colloids at the top of the column was slightly faster than that without montmorillonite at ph 3 fig 4 a in addition when the solution ph was increased the breakthrough time of total cd with montmorillonite was slower than that without montmorillonite for example the breakthrough times of the total cd with the montmorillonite colloids were slightly and much faster than those for dissolved cd2 at ph 6 fig 4b and ph 8 fig 4c respectively cd2 migration through the sand columns with and without the montmorillonite colloids was evaluated by cd recovery sorption capacity and the transport parameter known as the retardation factor table 3 retardation factor and sorption capacity tended to increase as the solution ph increased because more sorption sites are available at higher ph conditions table 3 the retardation factors of cd2 transport with the montmorillonite colloids were lower than those without montmorillonite at the same solution ph conditions because the montmorillonite colloid behaves as the carrier of cd and increases its mobility particular at higher ph for example at ph 8 the cd movement facilitated by the colloids increased to almost 40 of the total cd transport table 5 the retardation factor decrease owing to the mechanisms of the colloid facilitated cd transport when the solution ph increased from ph 3 to 8 it caused a decrease in the size of the colloids from 14 119 to 6 801 μm and led to the strong sorption of cd2 owing to a more negative charge on the montmorillonite surface from 5 19 to 12 47 mv respectively furthermore the sorption capacity of cd2 in sand columns with the montmorillonite ksf colloids increased approximately 10 fold from 5 07 10 4 to 4 87 10 3 mg g as the ph value increased from 3 to 8 because the variable negative charge sites on the surface increased however at the same ph conditions the sorption capacity of the cd in wsscs without the colloids were higher than those including the colloids this confirms that the colloids act as a carrier for cd transport accordingly under the same ph conditions the level of cd2 recovery in the wssc increased compared with that in the presence of the montmorillonite colloids this result indicates that the montmorillonite colloids reduced the retardation factors of cd2 transport through the wssc table 3 moreover we measured the zeta potential of cd bearing montmorillonite k10 colloids and found that an increase in solution ph from 3 to 8 increased the negative charge on the montmorillonite k10 surface from 18 0 to 26 9 mv and decreased the size of colloid from 4 641 to 1 321 μm respectively for montmorillonite ksf the negative charge increased from 5 19 to 12 47 mv and the colloid size decreased from 14 119 to 6 801 μm respectively as a result the electrostatic repulsion increased and the colloid retention in the sand media decreased which could indicate that the facilitated cd carried by the montmorillonite k10 colloid could be faster than that by montmorillonite ksf colloid thus increasing the solution ph increased the mobility of the cd2 and montmorillonite colloid transport at the rising limb figs 3 and 4 this indicates that increasing the ph increased the amount of cd2 sorption onto the montmorillonite colloid and also increased the repulsive forces of the montmorillonite particles to facilitate faster movement in the wssc table 2 in addition the proportion of montmorillonite facilitated cd2 compared with the total cd concentration in the effluent was increased from 6 71 to 38 96 when increasing the ph from 3 to ph 8 respectively table 5 it is assumed that at the higher ph condition most of the cd2 ions were sorbed onto the montmorillonite colloids and were transported along with the colloid therefore the mobility of the cd2 was significantly enhanced furthermore increasing the ph increased the tailing part of the btc indicating that deposition in the column was controlled by the kinetics and was significantly more important at higher ph values figs 3 and 4 at ph 3 symmetrical rising and decreasing limbs in the btc were apparent moreover the percentages of cd2 recovery of both cd2 transport alone and cd2 transport with the montmorillonite colloid were relatively high at 98 23 and 99 08 respectively indicating that the behavior of sorption and desorption for ph 3 tends to be reversible equilibrium sorption table 3 on the contrary at ph 6 and 8 figs 3 and 4 the rising and decreasing limbs appeared to be asymmetrically shaped illustrating that the tailings of the btc were long and became longer still as the ph increased to 8 in addition the cd2 transport alone and with the montmorillonite colloid at ph 6 yielding 92 45 and 95 49 cd recovery respectively and at ph 8 at 83 67 and 87 06 cd recovery respectively indicated that the kinetic behavior of sorption and desorption at ph 6 and 8 exhibited non equilibrium between the sorption and desorption rates table 3 these results agree with those of zhu et al 2012 who reported that the mercury i ion hg recovery from hg loaded kaolinite through sand was 93 compared with 22 from hg without kaolinite thus the kaolinite colloids served as carriers to enhance hg transport in porous media likewise wikiniyadhanee 2012 found that kaolinite colloids promoted cd2 mobility in a wssc under an extremely low is but inhibited the cd2 mobility under higher is however the impact of the is on the facilitated transport of cd2 by colloids showed only a small change in the cd2 mobility in the wsscs the percentage of cd2 sorbed in the sand decreased when cd2 was transported with the montmorillonite colloids and was affected by the solution ph owing to the ph dependent sorption capacity of the montmorillonite colloids table 4 as the ph increased most of the cd2 ions in the solution sorbed onto the montmorillonite colloids leading to a decline in the solution cd2 concentration thus the amount of cd2 sorbed in the wssc declined the increasing level of cd2 sorbed onto the montmorillonite affected the decreasing limb in the btc figs 3 and 4 for example the tailing of the btc of the total cd transport with the montmorillonite colloids at ph 6 was longer than that of cd2 transport without montmorillonite and the tailing showed longer tails at ph 8 these longer tails may have been caused by the strong sorption of cd2 onto the montmorillonite colloid that was retained in the wssc in contrast the tailing of the btc of the total cd transport with and without montmorillonite colloids at ph 3 appeared to be similar because of the low sorption capacity of cd2 onto the montmorillonite colloids at an acidic ph thus the long tailing of the btc of the total cd transport with the montmorillonite colloids at ph 8 was likely influenced by the kinetic behavior of sorption and desorption of cd2 from the montmorillonite colloids retained in the wssc as previously stated when the solution ph is higher than the pzc the edges of the montmorillonite colloids were deprotonated resulting in high negative charge density of the surface and preferential sorption of cd hydroxide complexes with sioh or aloh groups through inner sphere complexes at the crystalline edge surfaces however at low ph ph pzc the cd2 was bound through an ion exchange reaction which is the primary sorption mechanism by entering the interlayer plane of the montmorillonite furthermore as presented in table 4 the electrostatic potential of the edge sites decreased as ph increased from approximately 5 19 to 12 47 mv confirming that the negative charge edge sites became more significant with that specific sorption mechanism onto montmorillonite colloids a comparison of the transport of cd2 with and without the montmorillonite colloids demonstrated that the presence of the montmorillonite colloids increased the cd2 mobility at a high ph presumably owing to the decreased retardation factor furthermore the presence of the montmorillonite colloids tended result in faster transport cd2 at a high solution ph the major elements of the sand from the columns were identified by sem edx analysis fig 5 the surfaces of the granular sand grains were rough which likely induced the deposition of the montmorillonite colloid particles fig 5a the sem images of the sand excavated from the column after the transport test revealed the presence of retained montmorillonite particles at the grain surfaces at ph 3 6 and 8 fig 5b d confirming the deposition of montmorillonite colloids onto the surfaces of the quartz sand media 3 5 modeling of cd2 transport through the wssc by hydrus 1d hydrus 1d modeling analysis was applied to simulate cd2 transport in saturated sand columns with and without montmorillonite colloids using a cdeq model and a chemical non equilibrium model or two site model tsm as shown in fig 6 the model results revealed that the cdeq model with r 2 0 9644 0 9973 described the behavior better than the tsm except for cd2 transport with montmorillonite at ph 8 with r 2 0 9742 similarly the studies of chotpantarat et al 2011 and chotpantarat et al 2012 found that tsm effectively described the transport of divalent heavy metals such as manganese nickel lead and zinc in lateritic soils consisting mainly of 53 8 clay their results imply that the clay fraction in the column likely caused the sorption mechanism of the divalent heavy metals to have stronger irreversibility moreover fig 6e and f shows that the values of the c c 0 of the plateau portion of cd transport without montmorillonite in the saturated column at ph 8 were higher than those with montmorillonite colloids this implies that the cd sorption mechanisms onto the wssc changed significantly from equilibrium to nonequlibrium sorption when the montmorillonite colloids were present in the system this occurred likely because the sorption mechanisms of cd onto montmorillonite at ph 8 are predominately based on the sorption on ph dependent variable charge sites to form a chemical bond to negative variable charge sites through inner sphere surface complexes this exchange does not easily occur with other cations on the contrary with other sand columns including montmorillonite colloids at ph 3 and 6 the sorption mechanisms of cd onto the colloids are mainly on the basal plane through outer sphere complexes at those ph levels for this reason the sorption mechanism in the column experiment at ph 8 appeared to have stronger nonequilibrium sorption after fitting the experimental data by hydrus 1d the fitted parameters table 6 revealed that the freundlich constants k f increased with an increase in ph for the transport of both cd2 alone and with the montmorillonite colloidal particles which is in accordance with the batch sorption experiment moreover this result agreed with the increased retardation factors observed as previously mentioned however the k f values of movement of cd2 with montmorillonite ksf colloids was lower that of cd2 without these colloids at various ph conditions indicating that the montmorillonite ksf colloids can facilitate cd transport in wsscs particular at higher ph this resulted in a decrease of 40 for ph 6 and 8 this can be attributed to the increase in repulsive force among colloids and colloids as well as between colloids and sand media and the decrease in colloid size as the solution increased grolimund et al 1998 ryan and elimelech 1996 the transport data at ph 3 and 6 tended to fit with the cdeq model better than the tsm model for cd2 transport both alone and with montmorillonite colloids fig 6a d with the r 2 values shown in table 6 on the contrary at ph 8 fig 6e and f the data tended to fit better with the tsm compared with the cdeq model with a decrease in the fraction of instantaneous sorption sites f in general the interlayer bonding type was van der waals causing the sorbed cd to be easily released into the system at the higher ph however especially with ph pzc the specific sorption sites were sorbed by cd to form inner sphere complexes which is a chemical bond and is not easily exchanged with other cations in the system generally the inner sphere complexation can change in an ambient soil solution depending on the soil ph is and background solution therefore at ph 8 the transport of cd can be explained more effectively with the chemical non equilibrium model or tsm than with the cdeq model however for ph 3 and 6 the cdeq model can be well explained because the main reaction occurs in the system through the predominant exchange reaction furthermore according to the surface complexation model the binding constant of the nonspecifically sorbed cd via ion exchange reaction is generally higher than that of the inner sphere complexes at the edge sites gu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 possibly implying that the ion exchange reaction is faster in this case the front migration of the btc of cd2 transport at ph 8 followed the tsm model better than the cdeq model with r 2 0 9742 furthermore the 1 n values tended to decrease with an increase in ph this could imply that at a higher ph cd2 sorption becomes more irreversible than that at a lower ph owing to the additional heterogeneous surfaces of montmorillonite silva et al 2012 which is in accordance with the batch sorption experiment a possible reason is that the sorption of cd increases with increasing ph ph 8 owing to the sorption on the montmorillonite colloids through the inner sphere complex at the variable charge edge sites naidu et al 1994 the fraction of sorption site f is lower at the high ph suggesting that the cd sorption mechanism with montmorillonite ksf colloids onto the quartz sand has stronger non equilibrium in contrast the study of wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 found that with an increase in is in the system the sorption behavior of cd2 with kaolinite onto quartz sand in the column tends to be stronger equilibrium sorption owing to the increase ionic competition on the sorption sites therefore the freundlich constants k f and 1 n values are the main parameters that describe the sorption behavior in which a higher ph results in a higher freundlich constant kf and lower 1 n and f factor values as previously mentioned the experimental and theoretical results imply that the pzc of the colloid played an important role if the solution ph is higher than the pzc of the montmorillonite colloids ph 6 the system tends to follow the tsm model rather than the cdeq model table 6 therefore the pzc of the colloids in the system is the main factor that impacts the modeling of cd2 transport 4 conclusions the sorption capacities of montmorillonite ksf clay and sand were both increased as the solution ph increased because of the competition between the cd2 and h ions for the sorption sites the langmuir and freundlich isotherms yielded good fits with the sorption data but the freundlich isotherm more effectively fit the experimental data for both montmorillonite ksf and k10 clays particularly at higher ph the k f and 1 n values for the montmorillonite clays presented similar behavior such that the sorption capacity and binding affinity increased as the ph increased because the sorption of cd was controlled by the inner sphere complexes onto the variable charge sites with respect to cd2 transport with and without the presence of the montmorillonite ksf colloids through the wssc a low solution ph enhanced the transport of cd2 through the wssc on the contrary at a higher solution ph decreased retention of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite ksf colloids on the sand surface occurred owing to the increase in electrostatic repulsive forces between the montmorillonite colloids and sand the solution ph had a significant influence on the montmorillonite facilitated cd2 movement through the wssc and the concentration of montmorillonite facilitated an increase in cd2 movement as the solution ph increased thus the montmorillonite ksf colloids acted as carrier for the cd mobility in a wssc at a high solution ph decreasing the retardation factor by approximately 14 82 the sem images indicated the presence of retained montmorillonite particles at the grain surfaces of the sand excavated from the column after the cd transport experiment at ph 3 6 and 8 the modeling of cd2 transport by hydrus 1d revealed that at a lower ph compared with the pzc of montmorillonite colloids i e ph 6 the equilibrium cdeq model best fit the data whereas at a ph greater than the pzc the tsm provided a better fit moreover the freundlich constants k f increased with an increase in ph whereas the 1 n and f factor values decreased the findings in this study revealed that the cdeq model cannot be applied directly for cd migration in a groundwater system with a high concentration of montmorillonite colloids and a high ph especially at a ph greater than the pzc of the colloids instead the tsm is more suitable for predicting and establishing the predictive framework for the migration of cd2 with colloidal particles through natural groundwater environments thus in real world conditions montmorillonite facilitated transport of cd and other divalent heavy metals may be a potential issue in various areas such as mining sites disposal sites from industrial waste and agricultural areas where heavy metals might be present with montmorillonite colloids these colloids can as facilitators to move such heavy metals faster than those dissolved in groundwater to reach groundwater wells used for water supply systems faster than expected which poses a threat to human health therefore evaluation of cd and divalent heavy metal migration in groundwater systems should consider both site specific conditions and groundwater chemistry such as clay mineral composition and solution ph such criteria could be useful for selecting the most effective mathematical model for assessing the plume of heavy metals furthermore the chemical nonequilibrium model or tsm should be applied in assessing the transport of cd in subsurface environments where montmorillonite colloid are dominant

19278,this study investigated the impact of ph on the migration of cadmium ii ions cd2 in relation to montmorillonite ksf colloids through a water saturated sand column wssc the sorption isotherms of cd2 on colloids and sand at ph values of 3 6 and 8 were characterized by batch experiments cd2 sorption by colloids and sand fit well with the freundlich model in the column experiments increasing the ph increased the retardation factors and kf values of cd2 both with and without the presence of the colloids the amount of cd2 sorbed onto the montmorillonite ksf colloids in the column effluent increased from 0 29 to 0 97 mg as the ph increased the colloid increased cd2 mobility and acted as a carrier at a high solution ph the increasing level of cd2 sorbed on colloids as the ph increased resulted in a long tailing of the breakthrough curve btc of the total cd indicating that the total cd was controlled by rate limited reactions these findings indicate that when the solution ph was greater than the point of zero charge pzc of the colloids ph 6 the system tended to follow a nonequilibrium two site tsm model rather than an equilibrium cdeq model this implies that the pzc of the colloids in the groundwater system is the main factor in predicting facilitated cd2 transport graphical abstract image 1 keywords cadmium contaminant transport groundwater hydrus 1d montmorillonite

groundwater contamination lee et al 2005 cadmium cd contamination in the environment can be caused by fuel combustion and human activities such as mining and using fertilizers the exposure pathway of cd includes ingestion of contaminated food and water or inhalation of cd fumes from industry or cigarette smoking which can also lead to cd exposure järup 2003 who 2010 cd can be transported along with the flow of groundwater and therefore cause soil and groundwater pollution sen et al 2002 jameel et al 2012 the transportation of colloid particles in subsurface environments is one mechanism capable of contributing to the movement of contaminants that are sorbed onto these solids such as heavy metal ions colloids might be important in facilitating the transport of other contaminants particular heavy metals because of their strong sorption properties mccarthy 1986 mccarthy and mckay 2004 zhu et al 2014 tan et al 2017 these contaminants could travel much farther and faster than would be anticipated from traditional solute transport models based on batch sorption data mccarthy and mckay 2004 usman et al 2005 many studies have investigated the colloid facilitated transport of strongly sorbed heavy metals and a metalloid arsenic in soils and groundwater lichner et al 2007 serrano et al 2015 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 and found that colloids act as a carrier to migrate such metals in the subsurface media wang et al 2014 yuan and peng 2017 for example the study of sun et al 2010 investigated the sorption mechanism of lead ii onto both kaolinite and sand and found that the sorption capacity of kaolinite was approximately 30 times greater than that of sand moreover in a saturated sand column a kaolinite colloid could promote the mobility of cadmium ii ions cd2 because the ionic strength is is nearly 0 mm however the mobility is inhibited at greater is wikiniyadhanee 2012 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 previous research has shown that the structure of montmorillonite has a large specific surface area and can be bound with hydrated exchangeable cations between the cations and various heavy metal ions gao et al 2006 bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 the hypothesis of our research is that the presence of montmorillonite clay colloidal particles and an increase in solution ph will enhance the transport of cd2 in a wssc this research assumed that cd2 is released from the contaminated soils where montmorillonite is generally found and is transported through unconfined aquifers under various ph conditions in real world conditions soil ph is affected by natural processes such as acid rain as well as many human activities such as fertilizer application liming for neutralizing soil acidity and mining activities that drain acidic mine waste into downstream areas such factors can cause variation in soil ph which affects the interaction of montmorillonite and cd in groundwater systems other studies focus mainly on either the sorption behavior of cd2 onto montmorillonite under different environmental conditions in batch experiments zhu et al 2001 abollino et al 2003 bhattacharyya and gupta 2007 darrant et al 2018 or the migration of dissolved cd2 in saturated soil columns but do not account for colloidal particles under different environmental conditions i e ionic strength ph other ions pang et al 2002 zhi ming et al 2012 thus knowledge regarding the effect of montmorillonite colloids on cd2 transport under various ph conditions in a subsurface environment is still limited to obtain a better understanding of the fate and transport of cd2 corresponding to montmorillonite colloids the present study applies the hydrus 1d mathematical model including a chemical non equilibrium module to describe the solute cd2 that interacts with montmorillonite colloids under various ph conditions in a natural groundwater system the objectives of this study are as follows a to assess the effect of solution ph on the migration of cd2 in relation to montmorillonite colloids b to investigate the influence of a montmorillonite colloid on cd mobility in a water saturated sand column wssc and c to identify the proper parameters of advection dispersion equilibrium and chemical non equilibrium models to describe cd2 transport accounting for montmorillonite colloids under different ph conditions our findings from experiments and modeling are reliable for predicting and establishing the predictive framework for the migration of cd2 with colloidal particles through hydrogeological formations under various subsurface environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercial clay montmorillonite ksf was purchased from sigma aldrich and was used to represent montmorillonite colloids in sorption and column experiments the cation exchange capacity cec and surface area were set at 30 meq 100 g and 20 40 m2 g respectively and particle size is was 20 25 μm the point of zero charge pzc for montmorillonite ksf is between ph 5 0 and 6 0 liu et al 2008 the clay minerals in the montmorillonite ksf were identified by x ray diffraction xrd using an equilibrium from bruker axz germany model d8 advance x ray diffractometer at the department of geology faculty of science chualongkorn university the xrd preparation was conducted followed the methods proposed by moore and reynolds 1997 the whole rock xrd analysis was conducted in reflection geometry to analyze the minerals in the montmorillonite ksf sample the sample was investigated as random powder under operating condition of 40 kv 30 ma and copper kα radiation λ 1 5404 å with a scan rate of 2 min and a step of 0 02 covering a range between 4 and 80 the database of x ray powder diffraction patterns is based on a powder diffraction file pdf maintained by the international centre for diffraction data icdd the chemical composition of the montmorillonite ksf clay was identified as an oxide compound through x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf bruker axs germany at the same location as that for the xrd analysis prior to analysis the sample was weighed and dried in an oven at 100 c overnight the sample was mixed with spectro blend a wax binder at a sample to binder mixing ratio of 10 2 the mixed sample was then compressed by a compressor for 2 min the formed pellet was placed in a desiccator prior to xrf analysis the loss of ignition was determined by calcination at 1000 c the mineralogical composition of the cleaned sand was analyzed only by xrd the dissolved cd solution as a representative of cd contaminated water from natural processes e g acid rain or human activities was prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 4h2o s in ultrapure water to obtain a 1000 ppm cd2 solution the ph was adjusted to 3 6 or 8 b y using 0 1 m nitric acid hno3 or 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh as required according to the phreeqc model result data not shown the dissolved cd ions as prepared in the solution with cd no3 2 4h2o generally remained stable with no precipitation forming in the experimental system moreover previous studies homann and zasoski 1987 naidu et al 1994 undabeytia et al 1998 bolan et al 1999 found that some anions related to other cd species such as cl so4 2 po4 3 can interfere with the sorption and transport of cd 2 2 material preparation the 0 6 0 8 mm ottawa sand quartz sand purchased from fisher chemical was sequentially cleaned by rinsing in excess 0 01 m naoh and 0 01 m hno3 for 30 min each to eliminate the sorbed elements and metal oxides on the quartz sand surface afterward the sample was dried in a hot air oven at 105 c overnight and was stored in a plastic container zhou et al 2011 the montmorillonite ksf clay did not require pretreatment by chemical or physical processes before use the montmorillonite ksf clay and ultrapure water were added into a volumetric flask to create a montmorillonite colloidal suspension then the upper portion of the suspended colloidal particles was drained into an incipient flask after being placed in a shaking water bath for 30 min the particles remained in the flask for a few hours the concentration of the montmorillonite ksf colloid was determined and was then diluted to 250 mg l to this end an evaporating dish was heated at approximately 550 c for 1 h cooled in an oven for 15 20 min and then placed in a desiccator until a constant weight was achieved next 50 ml of the montmorillonite ksf colloidal suspension was placed in an evaporating dish evaporated in a hot air oven at 100 c overnight and cooled in a desiccator until a constant weight was attained the gain in weight represented the dry mass of montmorillonite ksf per 50 ml the montmorillonite ksf colloidal suspension 250 mg l and cd2 solution were added to a volumetric flask and ultrasonicated for 10 min to producing the cd2 bearing montmorillonite suspension the ph of this suspension was adjusted as required the final volume was set to 500 ml with cd2 and montmorillonite colloid contents of 10 mg l and 100 mg l respectively for column experiments in addition the surface charges of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloidal suspensions were measured by using a malvern zetasizer nano before performing the transport test 2 3 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted at room temperature rt 30 c on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm in a 60 ml polypropylene bottle containing 250 mg l of the montmorillonite ksf colloid in 30 ml of 0 25 g l montmorillonite ksf clay or 1 0 g of sand which was set to ph 3 6 or 8 b y adding 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hno3 as required for evaluating the isotherms the cd2 concentration was taken from 10 to 200 mg l at the equilibrium time kiatvarangkul 2013 wikiniyadhanee et al 2016 after agitation each suspension was filtered through a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe syringe filter because montmorillonite ksf particles were larger than the pore size of the filter and the dissolved cd2 level was then analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas perkin elmer usa the amount of cd2 sorbed by the montmorillonite ksf clay and sand was then determined by using eq 1 1 q e v c 0 c e m where q e is the concentration of cd on the montmorillonite ksf mg g at equilibrium c 0 is the initial concentration of cd2 mg l c e is the cd concentration in a aqueous solution at equilibrium mg l v is the volume of the cd solution l and m is mass of montmorillonite ksf g next the freundlich and langmuir equations were used as equilibrium models to analyze the data the freundlich equation is based on sorption onto a heterogeneous surface and can be calculated from the linear form in eq 2 2 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe is the amount of sorbed metal per unit weight of the soil mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of the solute metal mg l and k f and n are the freundlich constants the langmuir model assumes that the uptake of metal ions occur on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption with no interaction between the sorbed metal ions the values of the langmuir constants can be calculated by using a linear form as shown in eq 3 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where qm is the maximum amount of sorbed metal ion per unit weight of the aquifer matrix mg g and kl represents the langmuir constant l mg 2 4 water saturated sand column experiments the columns used were acrylic tubes with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and a length of 10 cm initially each column was initially sequentially cleansed with excess 0 01 m naoh and 0 01 m hno3 and rinsed and quartz sand was then packed by applying the wet packing method the actual bulk density in the columns after use varied from 1 70 to 1 73 g cm3 with a pore volume pv of 16 01 16 80 cm3 the pv was determined from the volume of the solution filling the pore space of the saturated sand column this value can be estimated from the volume of water used in the wet packing technique by adding sand and deionized water in the column at depth increments of 0 5 cm in this study the volume of water used to saturate the sand column was 1 pv the influent was introduced at the bottom end of the column to eliminate trapped air at an influent velocity or average linear velocity of approximately 2 40 m day prior to performing the experiments the packed columns were equilibrated by injection with at least 5 pvs of deionized water afterward 10 mg l of bromide br was used as an influent tracer in the sand column to investigate groundwater movement of the saturated sand column the effluent was collected at the top at the regular time using a fraction collector which was then filtered and finally determined for bromide br by ion chromatography ic model dionex ics 2500 sunnyvale usa breakthrough curves btcs were plotted between pore volume v v0 and br concentration c c 0 then the columns were injected with a cd2 free background solution at fixed ph values of approximately 3 6 and 8 and is of 0 003 m to establish a steady state flow and to standardize the chemical conditions next the respective cd2 solution or the cd2 bearing montmorillonite suspension at the respective ph value was pumped into the column at a constant velocity of 2 40 m day for 21 pvs thereafter several pvs of a cd2 free background solution of identical chemical composition was injected into the column until the concentration of cd2 in the effluence returned to the background levels or 0 mg l the effluent was periodically collected in polypropylene tubes by a fractional collector the concentrations of cd2 in each effluent fraction were measured by using aas the seepage velocity of all columns was 2 40 m day the data of the column experiments are provided in table 1 the breakthrough curves btcs were characterized as the relative pv v v 0 vs the cd2 concentration c c 0 after termination of the column elution the sand was excavated from the inlet and the level of cd2 bearing montmorillonite ksf colloids retained in the sand column was qualitatively evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx analysis jeol jsm 6400 in addition the amount of montmorillonite ksf colloids in each sample was determined by using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis spectrophotometry thermo spectronic england at a 300 nm wavelength the btcs of cd2 and the montmorillonite ksf colloid were plotted after analyzing the concentration of the montmorillonite ksf colloid the sample was separated into two fractions the first fraction was used to measure the concentration of the dissolved cd2 in the solution and the second fraction was used to determine the total cd concentration including all species of dissolved cd table s2 in the aqueous solution by adding 14 5 m hno3 to digest the montmorillonite ksf colloid zhu et al 2012 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 the calculated speciation of free cd2 ions in solution is the dominant species at low is of 3 mm at different ph levels as shown in table s2 we found that at an initial cd concentration of 10 mg l the cd appeared mainly as free cd2 ions in the range of 86 90 and the cdcl ranged from 10 to 14 moreover no cd hydroxide precipitation was noted similarly the study of basualto et al 2006 revealed that cd2 is the dominant species of cd in the acidic ph conditions with low chloride concentration this is in agreement with the results of previous studies zachara et al 1992 srivastava et al 2005 tahervand and jalali 2016 showing that the speciation of all cd species at ph 4 9 were mainly cd2 according to the minteq software program finally the level of montmorillonite facilitated cd retained in the sand column was determined by evaluating the difference between the concentration of total cd and dissolved cd the retardation factor of cd2 onto the sand was determined by using the area method nkedi kizza et al 1987 the sorption capacity specifically the milligrams of cd per gram of sand was estimated from total mass of cd sorbed in the column divided by the mass of sand in the column 2 5 hydrus 1d model the hydrus 1d model šimunek et al 2008 chotpantarat et al 2011 2012 can be applied to assess the migration of heavy metal ions in variably saturated soils by using both the linear nonlinear equilibrium convection dispersion cdeq and chemical non equilibrium processes as shown in eqs 4 and 5 4 c t d l 2 c x 2 v x c

porosity ρ g cm3 is the bulk density of the sand media c mg g is the contaminant concentration in the sand media and rxn mg l day is a subscript describing a chemical or biological reaction other than sorption of the contaminant in addition the chemical non equilibrium model known as the two site model tsm was incorporated with the freundlich isotherm the tsm can be used to elucidate the sorption and transport of contaminants that are dominated by the rate limited reaction 5a θ c t ρ s e t ρ s k t x θ d l c x ν x c x c t r x n 5b s e f k f c 1 n 5c ρ s k t α k ρ s e k s k φ k 5d s k 1 f k f c

a particular solute concentration when reaching the equilibrium condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical properties of montmorillonite ksf clay and sand the results of the xrd analysis supported that the montmorillonite kfs clay used in this study was a montmorillonite mineral and that the sand was a pure quartz mineral figs s1 and s2 the reflection at the 2 theta value at approximately 6 66 corresponds to the montmorillonite the angle of which is generally 4 10 lucian 2016 semi quantitative xrd analysis was performed on montmorillonite ksf samples as a whole rock sample using the computer program diffracplus release 2004 ver 10 for immediate measurement the percentages of individual minerals in the montmorillonite ksf were calculated and the net areas of peaks were converted to the percentages the montmorillonite ksf contained five peaks corresponding to montmorillonite illite hematite goethite and chlorite with estimated mineral percentages of 78 77 14 48 3 25 2 30 and 1 20 respectively furthermore the mineral composition in the montmorillonite ksf clay was determined by xrf analysis to consist of sio2 30 70 so3 13 50 al2o3 11 60 fe2o3 5 85 mgo 2 19 k2o 1 40 cao 1 39 tio2 0 38 and p2o5 0 22 with 32 77 loss of ignition as shown in table s1 3 2 equilibrium sorption of cd2 on montmorillonite clay and sand when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 the equilibrium amount of cd2 sorbed by the montmorillonite ksf clay increased as the initial concentration of cd2 increased from 10 to 250 ppm that for sand increased from 10 to 100 ppm inskeep and baham 1983 christensen 1984 tiller et al 1984 naidu et al 1994 1997 additionally kiatvarangkul 2013 reported that although the equilibrium time of cd2 sorption on sand was much longer at 1080 min than that of montmorillonite ksf clay within 200 min it showed the same trend as that of montmorillonite ksf clay the kinetic test showed that montmorillonite ksf clay sorbed cd instantaneously during the first hour and slowed before approaching an equilibrium state within 200 min since illite and iron oxides were found in montmorillonite ksf clay the sorption of cd onto the pure montmorillonite k10 colloid which was purchased from sigma aldrich was additionally performed in a similar manner to that of montmorillonite ksf clay only in the batch sorption experiment section this was done to obtain a reference of pure montmorillonite with pretreatment with cacl2 which resulted in 97 montmorillonite according to the semi quantitative analysis fig s3 moreover zachara et al 1992 found an interaction between iron oxide and layer silicates which restricts the accessibility of cd to the permanent charge sites thus crystalline iron oxides do not have high sorbent potential for cd moreover the percentages of iron oxides as hematite and goethite were semiquantitatively determined to be approximately 3 25 and 2 30 respectively of the montmorillonite ksf this implies that the sorption of cd onto iron hydroxide may be negligible as compared with the main portion of montmorillonite and illite 3 2 1 freundlich isotherm the actual structure of the phyllosilicates of montmorillonite ksf was revealed to consist mainly of montmorillonite and illite montmorillonite generally consists of two binding sites permanent charge sites that are not ph dependent and variable charge sites that are ph dependent on the basis of the chemically kinetic coefficients and structure of a 2 1 layer silicates such reactive sorption sites can be defined as heterogeneous surfaces consisting of an octahedral sheet between two silica tetrahedral uddin 2017 for illites the 2 1 type minerals are the same as monmorillonite however the interlayers are bonded with potassium to satisfy the charge which generally has difficulty entering the interlayer space and exchanging with other cations in the aqueous phase as a result the cec of montmorillonite is greater than that of illite this is in agreement with the study of liu et al 2018 which found that site densities of fixed and variable charge sites of montmorillonite are higher than those of illite as a result the sorption capacity of cd onto montmorillonite commonly is higher than that of illite rybicka et al 1995 hongpong et al 2000 liu et al 2018 as stated the montmorillonite ksf has heterogeneous surfaces thus the sorption experiments should be effectively explained by the freundlich isotherm moreover we measured the zeta potential and particle size of cd bearing montmorillonite ksf colloids and found that an increase in solution ph from 3 to 8 can cause zeta potential on the colloidal surface became more negative from 5 19 to 12 47 mv and decrease the colloid size from 14 119 to 6 801 μm respectively resulting in an increase in the specific surface area of the montmorillonite ksf colloid as a result the sorption of cd onto the montmorillonite increased owing to the more negative surface charge and available sorption sites with the increase in solution ph the freundlich equation model assumes that the sorption of cd2 ions occurs on a heterogeneous surface jiang et al 2010 the freundlich isotherm parameters of cd2 sorption onto sand fig 1 a and montmorillonite ksf clay fig 1b are summarized in table 2 the cd2 sorption onto montmorillonite ksf clay and sand were both non linear and fit reasonably well to the freundlich equation model with r 2 values of 0 9599 0 9902 and 0 8110 0 9827 for the clay and sand respectively the k f value for montmorillonite ksf clay increased from 0 130 to 0 462 l g when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 indicating that the capacity of cd2 sorption by montmorillonite ksf clay increased as the ph increased this increase occurred likely because the cd2 ions were strongly bound to the hydroxyl groups on the edges of the clay minerals at higher ph values angove et al 1998 moreover at lower ph the cd2 ions in the solution must compete with a large number of h ions for the available sorption sites at the surface therefore the cd2 sorption was relatively low in addition the 1 n values for montmorillonite ksf clay tended to decrease as the ph increased this indicates a preferential sorption of cd2 at a higher solution ph than that at a lower solution ph the sorption occurred most often onto the variable charge sites through inner sphere complexes of cd hydroxide complexes naidu et al 1994 jiang et al 2010 shahmohammadi kalalagh et al 2011 on the contrary the 1 n values for sand were higher than 1 which indicates that cd2 sorption by sand was not favorable and the k f values of the sand were very low when compared with those for montmorillonite ksf clay zachara and smith 1994 found that cd can form at least two types of complexes with layer silicates 1 ion exchange to the permanent charge sites on the basal plane through outer sphere complexation and 2 coordination complexes with sioh or aloh groups exposed at the crystalline edge sites which are mainly the variable charges sites kookana et al 1999 however they found that the edge complexation reactions were more important on soil smectite the sorption of cd increased with an increase in ph 8 owing to the preferential sorption of cd hydroxide complexes through inner sphere complexation at the crystal edge surfaces naidu et al 1994 at ph 8 the results showed hydrolyzed cd oh in the range of 0 57 0 68 table s2 this is in agreement with the studies of naidu et al 1994 1997 who found that the speciation of cd consists mainly of cd2 at ph 8 and that cd oh suddenly increases at ph 8 as a result the sorption of cd hydrolyzed species onto the edge sites was better than that of free cd2 ions naidu et al 1994 longanathan et al 2012 wang et al 2016 similarly the study of srivastava et al 2005 reported that cd oh 2 aq occurs in the system at ph 8 5 moreover we found that the freundlich isotherm parameters of cd2 sorption onto montmorillonite k10 colloids as summarized in table 2 and fig s4 were non linear and fit reasonably well to the freundlich and langmuir models with r 2 values of 0 9737 0 9930 and 0 9451 0 9856 respectively for the freundlich isotherm the k f value for montmorillonite k10 clay increased from 5 062 to 7 029 l g when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 in addition the 1 n values for this clay tended to decrease as the ph increased indicating that the sorption of cd is more favorable at a higher solution ph because the surface of montmorillonite k10 clay became more negatively charged than that at a lower solution ph the sorption results are in accordance with those of montmorillonite ksf clay the kf values of montmorillonite k10 clay were approximately 10 40 times higher than those of montmorillonite ksf clay owing to the higher specific surface area 220 270 m2 g and cec 60 meq mg representing permanent charge sites gu et al 2010 the higher k f and q m as well as the lower 1 n for montmorillonite k10 clay can be explained by the cd2 binding strongly to the hydroxyl groups on the edge sites of the montmorillonite k10 clay at higher ph values angove et al 1998 3 2 2 langmuir isotherm the langmuir equation model assumes that the uptake of metal ions occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption with no interaction among sorbed metal ions jiang et al 2010 the data in fig 1c and table 2 show that the sorption of cd2 on montmorillonite ksf colloids could be explained by the langmuir isotherm model with r 2 values of 0 9548 0 9877 in addition the sorption capacity of montmorillonite ksf clay and k l values increased from 25 974 to 263 158 mg g and 0 002 0 006 l g respectively as the ph increased from 3 to 8 thus raising the ph increased the sorption of cd2 to montmorillonite ksf clay which is consistent with previously reported results bhattacharyya and gupta 2007 on the contrary the cd2 sorption equilibrium onto sand could not be described using the langmuir isotherm model because langmuir parameters such as maximum sorption capacity qm and sorption rate were not applicable according to the sem results the surface roughness on the ottawa sand appeared to be heterogeneous moreover the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of ottawa sand is very low at approximately 0 004 0 006 m2 g avnir et al 1984 and amasvata 2014 reported that the bet surface area is not available thus no significant changes in sorption behavior appear to have occurred under different ph values in the system both the heterogeneous surface and very low specific area are possible reason why the langmuir isotherm is not applicable for montmorillonite k10 the q m of montmorillonite k10 was increased from 77 519 mg g to 175 439 mg g as the solution ph increased as previously mentioned the sorption of montmorillonite k10 has been effectively explained by the langmuir and freudlich isotherms table 2 and fig s4 thus increasing in the solution ph likely enhances the sorption capacity of cd onto montmorillonite k10 clay according to the obtained equilibrium sorption data fig 1 and table 2 the sorption capacity and sorption rate of cd2 onto montmorillonite ksf clay were much higher than those on sand under each ph condition montmorillonite has a large specific surface area and can be bound with hydrated exchangeable cations to form an outer surface complex to a greater extent than sand bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 thus the sorption of cd onto the sand is very low compared with that of montmorillonite ksf many studies moradi et al 2005 shen et al 2008 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 found that the freundlich isotherm can effectively explain well the sorption of cd onto soils for example karak et al 2014 and moradi et al 2005 reported that the freundlich isotherm can describe the sorption and transport of cd in a layered clay soil in the application of sewage sludge furthermore the sorption experiment can be explained by sorption reactions between the aqueous solution and surface of montmorillonite colloids by using the surface complexation module of the phreeqc geochemical model parkhurst and appelo 1999 according to the clay characterization the cd sorption has two binding sites permanent charge sites and variable charge sites therefore we used the surface complexation module to preliminarily investigate the sorption mechanism of cd onto the montmorillonite to simulate the sorption reaction of cd onto the montmorillonite colloids log k values were selected from previous studies gu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 the results showed that the sorption of cd onto montmorillonite colloids occurred in two types of binding sites consisting mainly permanent charge sites x to form the outer sphere surface complexes x2me on the fixed negative charge sites at ph values lower than approximately 6 however when the solution ph was higher point of zero charge pzc the variable charge sites soh generally had negative charge to form the inner sphere surface complex some takamatsu et al 2006 gu et al 2010 the variable charge sites gradually began to increase the proportion and mainly predominated at ph values exceeding 8 figure s5 interestingly the sorption experiment found that the final ph after finishing the sorption experiment at ph 8 appeared to decrease about one to two units of ph from ph 8 to 6 5 7 this indicates that the sorption of cd onto montmorilonite clay occurred mainly on the edge sites through the inner sphere complex however the final ph levels of sorption experiment samples at ph 3 and 6 were fairly constant the reaction for the permanent charge sites is 2 x cd 2 x 2 cd the reaction for the variable charge sites is soh cd 2 socd h the results of this study are in accordance with those of zachara et al 1992 who found that the sorption of cd onto smectites is controlled by the ion exchange on the permanent negative charge sites within the 2 1 layer lattice at ph values of approximately 6 5 and is of 0 01 mol l at ph values being higher than 6 5 however the sorption of cd was controlled by inner sphere complex reaction onto the variable charge sites which depend upon the environmental factors of solutions such as ph is and background solution 3 3 effect of solution ph on cd2 transport in the wsscs the cd2 solution was injected into the wsscs under different solution ph conditions to investigate the effect of the solution ph on cd2 transport the obtained btcs of cd2 transport through the wsscs fig 2 a revealed that the maximum relative concentration of cd2 c c 0 at every solution ph in the effluent was 1 however the time required to reach the maximum c c 0 was different at each ph level with values of at 5 5 7 and 13 pvs achieved at solution ph levels of 3 6 and 8 respectively the calculated retardation factor and sorption capacity of cd2 transported through the wsscs were increased from 3 36 to 8 77 and 7 48 10 4 to 6 65 10 3 mg g respectively when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 table 3 in addition the effects of ph 2 4 and 7 on the sorption and transport of cd2 in three soils of varying texture was evaluated in a column experiment by huang et al 2009 for example the retardation factor of two soils increased from 36 6 to 136 1 and 37 3 to 183 4 as the solution ph increased from 2 to 7 respectively thus higher solution ph values inhibited the transport of cd2 through the wsscs owing to increased cd2 sorption onto the sand the btcs of the cd2 movement for ph 3 and 6 revealed a symmetrical shape with a sharp cd2 concentration front and no tailing phenomena whereas those for ph 8 exhibited tailing phenomena this implies that the cd2 transport in the saturated sand column shifted to a more prominent non equilibrium condition as the ph values increased because more sorption sites are available at higher ph accordingly the percentage of recovered cd2 was lower as the ph increased from 3 to 8 with respective values of 98 23 83 67 this confirms that the sorption desorption mechanism appears to be irreversible sorption as the ph increases table 3 the ph effect on cd transport can be described by competition for sorption sites between cd2 ions and hydrogen ions in the system particularly at low ph conditions furthermore the effects of solution ph on cd sorption on soils can be explained by changes in the characteristics of the soil surface table 3 shows that the retardation factor of cd increases from 3 36 to 8 32 as the ph values increase from 3 to 8 this phenomenon can be explained by the following mechanisms the enhanced of ph can induce a more negative surface charge of quartz sand when the ph of the solution is higher than the pzc of quartz sand 5 0 causing an increase more in available sites to sorb cd in the columns chotpantarat et al 2011 the main group of pure quartz sand on the surface is sioh which is strongly deprotonated at higher ph sioh sio h thus these sites are available for sorption and naturally carry a negative charged to sorb cd similarly the study of naidu et al 1994 found that the adsorption of cd on soils depends upon the negative surface charge on the soils further sherene 2010 reported that soil maintained at a neutral to slightly alkaline ph showed low mobility of all heavy metal ions in general the sorption of heavy metal ions to soil increases with an increase in ph owing to fewer hydrogen ions thus at a lower ph value the mobility of heavy metal ions increases owing to the increased proton concentration sherene 2010 therefore in highly acidic soils the mobility of metallic elements is significantly higher than that in neutral or alkaline soils fijalkowski et al 2012 3 4 effect of solution ph on the facilitated transport of cd2 by a montmorillonite colloid in a wssc 3 4 1 cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloid the properties of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloidal suspensions are shown in table 4 the electrostatic potential of the edge sites decreased from approximately 5 19 to 12 47 mv as ph increased as a result the surface charge became more significantly more negative and the size of the montmorillonite colloids decreased by half from 14 119 to 6 801 μm respectively the transport of these colloid through a wssc at different solution ph values of 3 6 and 8 is presented as representative btcs in fig 2b as the ph increased the colloid effluent concentrations increased slowly with increasing pv towards a steady state level in addition the migration front or the initial breakthrough time of cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloids at ph 8 was substantially faster than that at ph 3 this occurred because when the solution ph increases the repulsive forces between the montmorillonite ksf colloids and quartz sand as well those among colloids alone also increases owing to the greater increase in the negative zeta potential as shown in table 4 moreover as the ph value increases it not only induces a more negative charge but also reduces the size of the colloids thus the solution ph affected the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloid transport through the wsscs the recovery of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloids increased from 71 08 to 87 92 as the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 although the sorption capacity of these colloids onto sand decreased table 4 the increase in solution ph inhibited the retention of cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloids in the wssc because the repulsive forces between the colloids and the sand were increased owing to an increase in the double layer zeta potential as shown in table 4 ryan and elimelech 1996 an increase in the solution ph increased the negative zeta potential of the montmorillonite clay colloids and the quartz sand which then enhanced the interaction of the electrostatic double layer repulsion elimelech et al 1995 and in turn drove the faster colloid release this finding is consistent with other studies on the effect of ph on colloid mobilization zhou et al 2011 moreover patil 2008 reported that in porous media the breakthrough peak was reduced with a decrease in solution ph at higher ph however the colloids were more negatively charged from the impact of a high level of oh on their surfaces which resulted in greater repulsive electrostatic interactions with the porous media 3 4 2 montmorillonite facilitated cd2 transport according to the co transport column assays the dissolved cd2 concentrations decreased from 9 29 to 5 06 mg l with an increase in ph from 3 to 8 whereas the concentration of montmorillonite facilitated cd2 increased from 0 63 to 3 06 ppm with the same increase in solution ph table s3 the results are somewhat similar to those obtained in the batch experiment in that the amount of cd2 sorbed onto the montmorillonite clay increased as the solution ph increased table 2 the btcs for the montmorillonite facilitated cd2 under the different solution ph conditions fig 3 table 5 showed that an increase in solution ph increased the concentration of this cd2 in the effluent moreover the concentration of montmorillonite facilitated cd2 compared with the total cd concentration in the effluent increased six fold from 6 71 to 38 96 table 5 when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 that is the migration of dissolved cd ions mainly cd2 in the column decreased from 93 29 to 61 04 as the solution ph increased it can be concluded that in subsurface environments with higher ph montmorillonite facilitated cd plays an important role in cd migration at approximately 40 of the total cd moreover at low ph conditions cd2 was sorbed through an ion exchange reaction to form outer sphere complexes on the permanent charge sites at ph values 6 the variable charge sites generally carry a negative charge to form the inner sphere surface complexes some this causes the concentration of cd2 sorbed onto montmorillonite ksf colloids to be enhanced with the reduced retention of these colloids in the sand column which promotes an increase the facilitated cd2 or total cd transport through the sand column the smaller sizes of the colloids and the greater electrostatic repulsion among them resulted in greater movement of cd sorbed onto the colloid and facilitated the migration of cd through the saturated sand column mitropoulou et al 2013 furthermore the retardation of cd decreased as the solution ph became lower table 3 and the retention of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite colloid decreased from 17 56 to 2 70 mg for ph values of 3 8 respectively table 4 similarly walshe et al 2010 reported that an increase in the solution ph led to more negative charges on the surfaces of aquifer media ms2 bacteriophages and kaolinite colloids greater electrostatic repulsion was reported among the phages as well as among the colloids resulting in greater movement of the ms2 phages attached to the colloids and increased removal rates of these phages through the saturated porous media ryan and elimelech 1996 found that when the ph was increased the colloidal deposition decreased because of an increase in the repulsive surface interaction energy and double layer thickness the sizes of the montmorillonite colloids increased when the ph condition decreases and can retain cd2 in the wssc due to size exclusion of montmorillonite colloids santos and bedrikovetsky 2006 reported that colloidal transport in the saturated soil column can be evaluated by the particle size of the colloids migrating in the column 3 4 3 effect of montmorillonite colloids on cd2 transport through a wssc to illustrate the effect of montmorillonite colloids on cd2 transport a comparison of the btcs of the total cd was conducted with and without the presence of montmorillonite the results indicated that the initial breakthrough time of total cd with montmorillonite colloids at the top of the column was slightly faster than that without montmorillonite at ph 3 fig 4 a in addition when the solution ph was increased the breakthrough time of total cd with montmorillonite was slower than that without montmorillonite for example the breakthrough times of the total cd with the montmorillonite colloids were slightly and much faster than those for dissolved cd2 at ph 6 fig 4b and ph 8 fig 4c respectively cd2 migration through the sand columns with and without the montmorillonite colloids was evaluated by cd recovery sorption capacity and the transport parameter known as the retardation factor table 3 retardation factor and sorption capacity tended to increase as the solution ph increased because more sorption sites are available at higher ph conditions table 3 the retardation factors of cd2 transport with the montmorillonite colloids were lower than those without montmorillonite at the same solution ph conditions because the montmorillonite colloid behaves as the carrier of cd and increases its mobility particular at higher ph for example at ph 8 the cd movement facilitated by the colloids increased to almost 40 of the total cd transport table 5 the retardation factor decrease owing to the mechanisms of the colloid facilitated cd transport when the solution ph increased from ph 3 to 8 it caused a decrease in the size of the colloids from 14 119 to 6 801 μm and led to the strong sorption of cd2 owing to a more negative charge on the montmorillonite surface from 5 19 to 12 47 mv respectively furthermore the sorption capacity of cd2 in sand columns with the montmorillonite ksf colloids increased approximately 10 fold from 5 07 10 4 to 4 87 10 3 mg g as the ph value increased from 3 to 8 because the variable negative charge sites on the surface increased however at the same ph conditions the sorption capacity of the cd in wsscs without the colloids were higher than those including the colloids this confirms that the colloids act as a carrier for cd transport accordingly under the same ph conditions the level of cd2 recovery in the wssc increased compared with that in the presence of the montmorillonite colloids this result indicates that the montmorillonite colloids reduced the retardation factors of cd2 transport through the wssc table 3 moreover we measured the zeta potential of cd bearing montmorillonite k10 colloids and found that an increase in solution ph from 3 to 8 increased the negative charge on the montmorillonite k10 surface from 18 0 to 26 9 mv and decreased the size of colloid from 4 641 to 1 321 μm respectively for montmorillonite ksf the negative charge increased from 5 19 to 12 47 mv and the colloid size decreased from 14 119 to 6 801 μm respectively as a result the electrostatic repulsion increased and the colloid retention in the sand media decreased which could indicate that the facilitated cd carried by the montmorillonite k10 colloid could be faster than that by montmorillonite ksf colloid thus increasing the solution ph increased the mobility of the cd2 and montmorillonite colloid transport at the rising limb figs 3 and 4 this indicates that increasing the ph increased the amount of cd2 sorption onto the montmorillonite colloid and also increased the repulsive forces of the montmorillonite particles to facilitate faster movement in the wssc table 2 in addition the proportion of montmorillonite facilitated cd2 compared with the total cd concentration in the effluent was increased from 6 71 to 38 96 when increasing the ph from 3 to ph 8 respectively table 5 it is assumed that at the higher ph condition most of the cd2 ions were sorbed onto the montmorillonite colloids and were transported along with the colloid therefore the mobility of the cd2 was significantly enhanced furthermore increasing the ph increased the tailing part of the btc indicating that deposition in the column was controlled by the kinetics and was significantly more important at higher ph values figs 3 and 4 at ph 3 symmetrical rising and decreasing limbs in the btc were apparent moreover the percentages of cd2 recovery of both cd2 transport alone and cd2 transport with the montmorillonite colloid were relatively high at 98 23 and 99 08 respectively indicating that the behavior of sorption and desorption for ph 3 tends to be reversible equilibrium sorption table 3 on the contrary at ph 6 and 8 figs 3 and 4 the rising and decreasing limbs appeared to be asymmetrically shaped illustrating that the tailings of the btc were long and became longer still as the ph increased to 8 in addition the cd2 transport alone and with the montmorillonite colloid at ph 6 yielding 92 45 and 95 49 cd recovery respectively and at ph 8 at 83 67 and 87 06 cd recovery respectively indicated that the kinetic behavior of sorption and desorption at ph 6 and 8 exhibited non equilibrium between the sorption and desorption rates table 3 these results agree with those of zhu et al 2012 who reported that the mercury i ion hg recovery from hg loaded kaolinite through sand was 93 compared with 22 from hg without kaolinite thus the kaolinite colloids served as carriers to enhance hg transport in porous media likewise wikiniyadhanee 2012 found that kaolinite colloids promoted cd2 mobility in a wssc under an extremely low is but inhibited the cd2 mobility under higher is however the impact of the is on the facilitated transport of cd2 by colloids showed only a small change in the cd2 mobility in the wsscs the percentage of cd2 sorbed in the sand decreased when cd2 was transported with the montmorillonite colloids and was affected by the solution ph owing to the ph dependent sorption capacity of the montmorillonite colloids table 4 as the ph increased most of the cd2 ions in the solution sorbed onto the montmorillonite colloids leading to a decline in the solution cd2 concentration thus the amount of cd2 sorbed in the wssc declined the increasing level of cd2 sorbed onto the montmorillonite affected the decreasing limb in the btc figs 3 and 4 for example the tailing of the btc of the total cd transport with the montmorillonite colloids at ph 6 was longer than that of cd2 transport without montmorillonite and the tailing showed longer tails at ph 8 these longer tails may have been caused by the strong sorption of cd2 onto the montmorillonite colloid that was retained in the wssc in contrast the tailing of the btc of the total cd transport with and without montmorillonite colloids at ph 3 appeared to be similar because of the low sorption capacity of cd2 onto the montmorillonite colloids at an acidic ph thus the long tailing of the btc of the total cd transport with the montmorillonite colloids at ph 8 was likely influenced by the kinetic behavior of sorption and desorption of cd2 from the montmorillonite colloids retained in the wssc as previously stated when the solution ph is higher than the pzc the edges of the montmorillonite colloids were deprotonated resulting in high negative charge density of the surface and preferential sorption of cd hydroxide complexes with sioh or aloh groups through inner sphere complexes at the crystalline edge surfaces however at low ph ph pzc the cd2 was bound through an ion exchange reaction which is the primary sorption mechanism by entering the interlayer plane of the montmorillonite furthermore as presented in table 4 the electrostatic potential of the edge sites decreased as ph increased from approximately 5 19 to 12 47 mv confirming that the negative charge edge sites became more significant with that specific sorption mechanism onto montmorillonite colloids a comparison of the transport of cd2 with and without the montmorillonite colloids demonstrated that the presence of the montmorillonite colloids increased the cd2 mobility at a high ph presumably owing to the decreased retardation factor furthermore the presence of the montmorillonite colloids tended result in faster transport cd2 at a high solution ph the major elements of the sand from the columns were identified by sem edx analysis fig 5 the surfaces of the granular sand grains were rough which likely induced the deposition of the montmorillonite colloid particles fig 5a the sem images of the sand excavated from the column after the transport test revealed the presence of retained montmorillonite particles at the grain surfaces at ph 3 6 and 8 fig 5b d confirming the deposition of montmorillonite colloids onto the surfaces of the quartz sand media 3 5 modeling of cd2 transport through the wssc by hydrus 1d hydrus 1d modeling analysis was applied to simulate cd2 transport in saturated sand columns with and without montmorillonite colloids using a cdeq model and a chemical non equilibrium model or two site model tsm as shown in fig 6 the model results revealed that the cdeq model with r 2 0 9644 0 9973 described the behavior better than the tsm except for cd2 transport with montmorillonite at ph 8 with r 2 0 9742 similarly the studies of chotpantarat et al 2011 and chotpantarat et al 2012 found that tsm effectively described the transport of divalent heavy metals such as manganese nickel lead and zinc in lateritic soils consisting mainly of 53 8 clay their results imply that the clay fraction in the column likely caused the sorption mechanism of the divalent heavy metals to have stronger irreversibility moreover fig 6e and f shows that the values of the c c 0 of the plateau portion of cd transport without montmorillonite in the saturated column at ph 8 were higher than those with montmorillonite colloids this implies that the cd sorption mechanisms onto the wssc changed significantly from equilibrium to nonequlibrium sorption when the montmorillonite colloids were present in the system this occurred likely because the sorption mechanisms of cd onto montmorillonite at ph 8 are predominately based on the sorption on ph dependent variable charge sites to form a chemical bond to negative variable charge sites through inner sphere surface complexes this exchange does not easily occur with other cations on the contrary with other sand columns including montmorillonite colloids at ph 3 and 6 the sorption mechanisms of cd onto the colloids are mainly on the basal plane through outer sphere complexes at those ph levels for this reason the sorption mechanism in the column experiment at ph 8 appeared to have stronger nonequilibrium sorption after fitting the experimental data by hydrus 1d the fitted parameters table 6 revealed that the freundlich constants k f increased with an increase in ph for the transport of both cd2 alone and with the montmorillonite colloidal particles which is in accordance with the batch sorption experiment moreover this result agreed with the increased retardation factors observed as previously mentioned however the k f values of movement of cd2 with montmorillonite ksf colloids was lower that of cd2 without these colloids at various ph conditions indicating that the montmorillonite ksf colloids can facilitate cd transport in wsscs particular at higher ph this resulted in a decrease of 40 for ph 6 and 8 this can be attributed to the increase in repulsive force among colloids and colloids as well as between colloids and sand media and the decrease in colloid size as the solution increased grolimund et al 1998 ryan and elimelech 1996 the transport data at ph 3 and 6 tended to fit with the cdeq model better than the tsm model for cd2 transport both alone and with montmorillonite colloids fig 6a d with the r 2 values shown in table 6 on the contrary at ph 8 fig 6e and f the data tended to fit better with the tsm compared with the cdeq model with a decrease in the fraction of instantaneous sorption sites f in general the interlayer bonding type was van der waals causing the sorbed cd to be easily released into the system at the higher ph however especially with ph pzc the specific sorption sites were sorbed by cd to form inner sphere complexes which is a chemical bond and is not easily exchanged with other cations in the system generally the inner sphere complexation can change in an ambient soil solution depending on the soil ph is and background solution therefore at ph 8 the transport of cd can be explained more effectively with the chemical non equilibrium model or tsm than with the cdeq model however for ph 3 and 6 the cdeq model can be well explained because the main reaction occurs in the system through the predominant exchange reaction furthermore according to the surface complexation model the binding constant of the nonspecifically sorbed cd via ion exchange reaction is generally higher than that of the inner sphere complexes at the edge sites gu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 possibly implying that the ion exchange reaction is faster in this case the front migration of the btc of cd2 transport at ph 8 followed the tsm model better than the cdeq model with r 2 0 9742 furthermore the 1 n values tended to decrease with an increase in ph this could imply that at a higher ph cd2 sorption becomes more irreversible than that at a lower ph owing to the additional heterogeneous surfaces of montmorillonite silva et al 2012 which is in accordance with the batch sorption experiment a possible reason is that the sorption of cd increases with increasing ph ph 8 owing to the sorption on the montmorillonite colloids through the inner sphere complex at the variable charge edge sites naidu et al 1994 the fraction of sorption site f is lower at the high ph suggesting that the cd sorption mechanism with montmorillonite ksf colloids onto the quartz sand has stronger non equilibrium in contrast the study of wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 found that with an increase in is in the system the sorption behavior of cd2 with kaolinite onto quartz sand in the column tends to be stronger equilibrium sorption owing to the increase ionic competition on the sorption sites therefore the freundlich constants k f and 1 n values are the main parameters that describe the sorption behavior in which a higher ph results in a higher freundlich constant kf and lower 1 n and f factor values as previously mentioned the experimental and theoretical results imply that the pzc of the colloid played an important role if the solution ph is higher than the pzc of the montmorillonite colloids ph 6 the system tends to follow the tsm model rather than the cdeq model table 6 therefore the pzc of the colloids in the system is the main factor that impacts the modeling of cd2 transport 4 conclusions the sorption capacities of montmorillonite ksf clay and sand were both increased as the solution ph increased because of the competition between the cd2 and h ions for the sorption sites the langmuir and freundlich isotherms yielded good fits with the sorption data but the freundlich isotherm more effectively fit the experimental data for both montmorillonite ksf and k10 clays particularly at higher ph the k f and 1 n values for the montmorillonite clays presented similar behavior such that the sorption capacity and binding affinity increased as the ph increased because the sorption of cd was controlled by the inner sphere complexes onto the variable charge sites with respect to cd2 transport with and without the presence of the montmorillonite ksf colloids through the wssc a low solution ph enhanced the transport of cd2 through the wssc on the contrary at a higher solution ph decreased retention of the cd2 bearing montmorillonite ksf colloids on the sand surface occurred owing to the increase in electrostatic repulsive forces between the montmorillonite colloids and sand the solution ph had a significant influence on the montmorillonite facilitated cd2 movement through the wssc and the concentration of montmorillonite facilitated an increase in cd2 movement as the solution ph increased thus the montmorillonite ksf colloids acted as carrier for the cd mobility in a wssc at a high solution ph decreasing the retardation factor by approximately 14 82 the sem images indicated the presence of retained montmorillonite particles at the grain surfaces of the sand excavated from the column after the cd transport experiment at ph 3 6 and 8 the modeling of cd2 transport by hydrus 1d revealed that at a lower ph compared with the pzc of montmorillonite colloids i e ph 6 the equilibrium cdeq model best fit the data whereas at a ph greater than the pzc the tsm provided a better fit moreover the freundlich constants k f increased with an increase in ph whereas the 1 n and f factor values decreased the findings in this study revealed that the cdeq model cannot be applied directly for cd migration in a groundwater system with a high concentration of montmorillonite colloids and a high ph especially at a ph greater than the pzc of the colloids instead the tsm is more suitable for predicting and establishing the predictive framework for the migration of cd2 with colloidal particles through natural groundwater environments thus in real world conditions montmorillonite facilitated transport of cd and other divalent heavy metals may be a potential issue in various areas such as mining sites disposal sites from industrial waste and agricultural areas where heavy metals might be present with montmorillonite colloids these colloids can as facilitators to move such heavy metals faster than those dissolved in groundwater to reach groundwater wells used for water supply systems faster than expected which poses a threat to human health therefore evaluation of cd and divalent heavy metal migration in groundwater systems should consider both site specific conditions and groundwater chemistry such as clay mineral composition and solution ph such criteria could be useful for selecting the most effective mathematical model for assessing the plume of heavy metals furthermore the chemical nonequilibrium model or tsm should be applied in assessing the transport of cd in subsurface environments where montmorillonite colloid are dominant

underconstant magneticstirringat 25 0 1 c during the reaction a certain amount of catalyst was loaded into the and then fe2 was added finally ps was added into the solution to trigger oxidation the initial unadjusted ph of the apap solution was approximately 6 5 100 mg l 1 in the ph experiment sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide were added to adjust the ph of the solution at designated sampling

apapwere investigated all experiments were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 apap removal using different catalysts fig 1 shows the removal rate of apap in cuo ps fe2 ps and fe2 cuo ps systems the usage of cuo alone as catalyst to activate ps cannot approach the desired result and only 10 of apap can be efficiently scavenge in 90 min this result corresponds to the research of duan et al 2015 who used cuo to activate ps for the removal of phenol however significant enhancement of apap removal was observed when ferrous ions were added and 79 degradation rate of apap was obtained in thefe2 ps system this result is because ferrous ions are the effective catalyst for ps and mounts of so4 can be generated according to eq 1 liu et al 2017b which results in rapid removal of apap in the fe2 cuo ps system 92 of apap was removed during the 90 min reaction compared with different processes cuo probably plays an important accelerate effect in the fe2 cuo ps system 1 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 s o 4 2 3 2 mechanism of fe2 cuo active ps 3 2 1 change of fe2 concentration according to fig 1 the addition of cuo in thefe2 ps system can improve the degradation rate of apap this phenomenon means that a certain synergistic effect exists between cuo and ferrous ions therefore the change in fe2 concentration during the oxidation process is determined as an assistance to speculate the synergistic effect fig 2 shows the change in fe2 concentration during the 90 min reaction in thefe2 ps system the concentration of fe2 declined rapidly in the first minute and continued to fall to 0 32 mm 17 92 mg l 1 until the end of reaction the decrease in fe2 was attributed to the rapid transformation of fe2 to fe3 via fe2 active ps bu et al 2017 after the addition of cuo the concentration of fe2 was reduced to 0 24 mm 13 44 mg l 1 results indicated that a difference exists in the concentration of fe2 after the cuo addition and indirectly proved that a part of fe2 was dropped on the cuo surface leading to the decrease in dissolved fe2 in the degradation of apap in fe2 cuo activated ps to further verify the synergistic effect between fe2 and cuo the before and after surface structure of the used cuo were characterized fig 3 reveals the fesem of cuo the size of cuo was around 15 μm and the surface structure of cuo was made up of a sheet structure of around 200 nm fig 3b no distinct difference was discovered in the overall structure of cuo before and after use fig 3a and c but the sheet structure was worn out after use fig 3d the result proved the cu leaching in the process of fe2 cuo ps system the surface elements of cuo used before and after were analyzed by eds and the result is shown in fig 4 and table 1 the element of o and cu in fresh cuo are 22 22 and 77 78 wt respectively and in the used cuo were 42 25 and 57 35 wt respectively fe was detected on the surface of used cuo and approached 0 4 wt this phenomenon attested that fe2 canindeed adsorb onto the cuo surface in the fe2 cuo pssystem 3 2 2 change of cu2 and cu concentration metal leaching may occur when the metal catalyst activated ps therefore in the process of removing apap via fe2 cuo ps the leaching of cu2 may occur according to the research of zhang et al 2017b on using fe2 cuo to oxidize apap under acidic environment fe2 can adsorbed onto the cuo surface to form fe ii which can reduce cu ii to obtained cu i eq 2 zhang et al 2017b and to produce cu in the solution based on this research the concentration of cu2 and cu were measured during the reaction and the result is shown in fig 5 the concentration of cu2 increased with the reaction reaching 23 5 mg l 1 at 90 min and that of cu was stable at 8 5 mg l 1 probably because cu and cu2 have achieved dynamic balance the dissolved cu participated in activating ps to generate so4 for removing apap via eq 3 zhou et al 2016 surface absorbed fe ii can also form an extra activation site to improve the catalytic activity maithreepala and doong 2004 owing to a series of synergistic effect caused by the absorption of fe2 on the cuo surface the general oxidation capacity of the whole system was strengthened the analysis based on the xrd spectrum fig 6 a indicated that cuo jcpds pdf 45 0937 is the main component of the catalyst used before and after the reaction zhou et al 2018 no cu i and fe ii were detected in the xrd but cu i and fe iii were identified in xps fig 6b and d this result was probably because xrd detects deeper than xps yang et al 2018b and all the crystal forms were covered by cuo making cu i and fe iii detectable by xps and cuo by xrd 935 3 933 2 and711 9 ev werethe characteristic peaks of cu ii cu i fig 6b and c and fe iii fig 6d respectively lei et al 2015b xu et al 2016 li et al 2017b the form of fe iii proved that fe ii was adsorbed ontothe cuo surface 2 c u i i f e i i c u i f e i i i 3 c u s 2 o 8 2 c u 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 3 2 3 contribution of dissolved oxygen in the fe2 cuo ps system do affects the oxidization rate of fe2 and series of reactions between cu and o2 eqs 4 7 zhou et al 2018 therefore n2 aeration of fe2 cuo ps system was carried out to investigate the effect of do on the reaction as shown in fig 7 the degradation rate of apap was significantly inhibited under n2 aeration and the degradation rate decreased to 70 this result confirmed that do had a significant impact on the fe2 cuo ps system as do decreased o2 the intermediate which functioned between cu2 and cu decreased which resulted to the decrease in oh produced using eq 6 thus the degradation rate of apap is suppressed 4 c u o 2 c u 2 o 2 5 c u o 2 2 h c u 2 h 2 o 2 6 c u h 2 o 2 c u 2 o h o h 7 c u 2 o 2 c u o 2 3 2 4 effect of catalyst doses quenching experiment in the system of fe2 cuo ps so4 is produced by fe2 cu activates ps eqs 1 3 and oh forms by the combination of so4 and h2o and the catalytic effect of cu thus to classify the contribution of different free radicals on the apap degradation via the fe2 cuo ps system different free radical detectors were selected to identify free radicals the detectors had diverse reaction rates in combining with different free radicals which can be used to identify the kinds of free radicals in the ps system oh et al 2016 among these detectors the most often used was methanol and tba ji et al 2017 ismail et al 2016 in accordance with the effect of α h on reaction rate in the combination of alcohols with free radicals ding et al 2013 the reaction rate of methanol with so4 and oh were 1 6 7 7 107 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively liang et al 2013 whereas the reaction rate of tba with so4 and oh were 9 1 105and 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 respectively liang et al 2013 liang and su 2009 based on the differences in reaction rates between alcohols with so4 and with oh methanol was selected as the scavenger of so4 and oh and tba as the scavenger of oh the results are shown in fig 8 after adding 100 mm methanol and 100 mm tba the removal rate declined to 79 and 89 respectively logically so4 and oh participated in the process of apap degradation by fe2 cuo ps 3 2 5 catalytic mechanism the mechanism of fe2 cuo ps in the removal of apap is summarized in fig 9 first fe2 in the solution can directly activate ps to form so4 and can be absorbed on the cuo surface to form fe ii to reduce cu ii to cu i which dissolved to cu in the solution and activate ps to form so4 second cu can be combined with dissolved oxygen to form o2 which formed h2o2 the circulation of cu cu2 fenton like reaction can produce oh to oxidize apap eqs 4 7 3 3 the influence of different factors 3 3 1 fe2 concentration fe2 was an important influencing factor in the system of ps oxidization processes the effect of fe2 on apap degradation by adding fe2 in different concentrations is discussed fig 10 a showed that the degradation rate of apap initially increased and later decreased 65 91 to 87 with increased fe2 0 3 1 0 mm notably the removal of apap at 5 min was the highest when adding 1 0 mm fe2 in comparison with other fe2 concentration conditions nevertheless the final degradation rate can reach only 87 because the degradation efficiency canbe promoted by adding an appropriate amount of fe2 to accelerate the generation of so4 through eq 8 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 overloaded fe2 can form a large amount of so4 to approach rapid oxidization in short time and consumes the persulfate ion as the generator of so4 to form fe3 and so4 2 eq 9 peng et al 2017 8 f e 2 s o 4 f e 3 s o 4 2 9 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 2 3 3 2 cuo dosage fig 10b shows the effect of cuo dosage on apap degradation the increase in cuo dosage promoted the removal rate of apap the degradation rate of apap reached 85 when the cuo dosage was 0 1 g l 1 whereas 91 can be approached when the cuo dosage reached 0 3 g l 1 this result is because the lower cuo dosage in the system cannot provide sufficient attachment sites for fe2 resulting in the insufficient amount of fe ii formed on the cuo surface in triggering a chain reaction that produces free radicals zhang et al 2017b low dosage cuo also resulted in decreased cu leaching to form cu in the solution which limited the occurrence of eq 3 3 3 3 ps concentration ps plays a vital role in the fe2 cuo ps system as a source of so4 to affirm the optimal ps concentration to achieve the maximum apap removal rate a series of experiments of different ps dosages 0 2 0 8 g l 1 to remove apap were carried out as shown in fig 10c under the condition of ps concentration of 0 2 g l 1 the degradation rate of apap was only 59 the increase in ps concentration would result in increase in the removal rate when the concentration of ps reached 0 8 g l 1 the removal rate of apap increased to 91 the reason for this phenomenon is that so4 was generated by ps and low concentration ps is not enough to produce large amount of so4 to oxidize apap eqs 1 and 3 therefore the degradation rate of apap was enhanced with the increase in ps concentration 3 3 4 ph according to the study of fang et al the initial ph is crucial to the advanced oxidization technology based on fe2 catalysis fang et al 2013 therefore the initial ph was adjusted to investigate its effect on the degradation of apap in the fe2 cuo ps system as shown in fig 11 a the degradation rates of apap were 85 90 and 91 respectively when the initial ph was 3 5 and 6 5 although the rate of fe2 oxidation to fe3 was slower in an acidic atmosphere the increase in h would inhibit the surface activity of the catalyst and reduce the synergistic effect between fe2 and cuo thus reducing the degradation rate of apap 14 when the initial ph was 11 the reaction rate of apap was rapid in the beginning of the reaction the degradation rate of apap reached 66 at 5 min but the final degradation rate was only 76 this result maybe due to the hydroxides under alkaline conditions caused by the combination of oh and fe2 a certain flocculation results and made apap precipitate the rapid reduction of fe2 concentration under alkaline conditions resulted in an insufficient synergistic effect of fe2 and cuo thus limiting the degradation of apap by measuring the change in ph in the reaction process fig 11b shows that the final ph of the reaction was stable at about 3 this result was because ps generated a large amount of h with h2o eq 10 which reduced the ph of the reaction system wu et al 2014 10 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 h o 2 3 h to further study the effect of ph conditions on the treatment of apap by persulfate a series of buffers were used to maintain the ph in d i water samples and real water samples as presented in fig 11c when the ph of the buffer solution is equal to 3 the degradation of apap is not much different from that of the nonbuffer solution however when the ph is equal to 5 or 6 5 the degradation of apap is better than that of the nonbuffer solution this phenomenon occurred because the buffer system acted to regulate h concentration and reduced the inhibition of the catalyst surface activity when the ph is equal to 11 the degradation of apap deteriorated because the metal ions precipitated and weakened the synergistic effect between fe2 and cuo to determine the ph variation in real water the decomposition experiments of apap in surface water by the fe2 cuo ps system were conducted as shown in fig 12 a in different initial ph reaction processes the degradation of apap was somewhat inhibited in surface water compared with ultrapure water this phenomenon is because the cl 1 co3 2 hco3 and humic acid in surface water would suppress apap degradation liu et al 2018 in particular when the ph is equal to 11 the degradation of apap is greatly affected because of the precipitation of fe2 changes in ph in the surface water in different initial ph reaction processes are shown in fig 12b in surface water when the initial ph ranged from 3 to 6 5 the ph dropped to 3 when the ps was added to the solution when the initial ph was 11 the ph can only be reduced to 10 because the surface water has a certain concentration of buffers and can adjust the h concentration to further discuss the implications of the investigated procedure for real water treatment a drug cold granule fu ren tang pharmaceutical containing apap 0 02 g g was purchased from the pharmacy dissolved in 100 ml surface water and degraded via the fe2 cuo ps system the results are shown in fig 12c the ph decreased to 3 and the removal rate of apap reached up to 90 in the surface water after 90 min of reaction these results indicated that the fe2 cuo ps system is effective for the degradation of apap in real water 3 4 oxidation products and pathway of apap degraded in surface water to extrapolate the results obtained in the present investigation to environmental samples the fate of acetaminophen in the environmental sample oxidation was investigated apap in surface water was degraded under the following condition apap 100 mg l 1 ps 0 8 g l 1 cuo 0 3 g l 1 fe2 0 7 mm the removal rate is shown in fig 13 a to elucidate the possible pathway behind apap degradation the intermediates of apap degradation were analyzed using gc ms fig 13 presented the proposed pathway for apap degradation at first 2 acetylamino 2 propenoic acid and hydroquinone were initially generated because aromatic rings were preferentially attacked by free radicals then the hydroquinone reacted with acetone to form hydroquinone acetate and the n aminocarbonyl acetamide was also detected the benzene ring in hydroquinone acetate was degraded through oxidation and produced 2 pentanol acetate and 1 2 ethanediol monoacetate subsequently these compounds have also been degraded further into low molecular weight organic matter ethers esters acids via the cleavage of c c bond the pathway of apap degradation is through the aop process 4 conclusion in the present paper cuo was introduced into the fe2 ps system to accelerate the degradation of apap a series of synergistic effects between fe and cuo enhanced the oxidization of the persulfate system which resulted in the change in fe2 concentration the generation of cu and combined with the characterization of cuo the degradation mechanism was considered that i fe2 directed active ps to remove apap ii fe2 adsorbed onto the surface to formfe ii and reduce cu ii to cu i iii cu dissolved into the solution and reacted with do to form h2o2 which can be activated by cu to generate oh quenching experiments proved that so4 and oh participated in the oxidization process in summary removing organic pollution via the synergistic effect during the usage of persulfate oxidization process is effective besides the fe2 cuo ps system is also effective for the degradation of apap in natural water acknowledgments this work was financially supported by fujian province science and technology project foundation 2017i01010015 xiamen technology project foundation

s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 s o 4 2 3 2 mechanism of fe2 cuo active ps 3 2 1 change of fe2 concentration according to fig 1 the addition of cuo in thefe2 ps system can improve the degradation rate of apap this phenomenon means that a certain synergistic effect exists between cuo and ferrous ions therefore the change in fe2 concentration during the oxidation process is determined as an assistance to speculate the synergistic effect fig 2 shows the change in fe2 concentration during the 90 min reaction in thefe2 ps system the concentration of fe2 declined rapidly in the first minute and continued to fall to 0 32 mm 17 92 mg l 1 until the end of reaction the decrease in fe2 was attributed to the rapid transformation of fe2 to fe3 via fe2 active ps bu et al 2017 after the addition of cuo the concentration of fe2 was reduced to 0 24 mm 13 44 mg l 1 results indicated that a difference exists in the concentration of fe2 after the cuo addition and indirectly proved that a part of fe2 was dropped on the cuo surface leading to the decrease in dissolved fe2 in the degradation of apap in fe2 cuo activated ps to further verify the synergistic effect between fe2 and cuo the before and after surface structure of the used cuo were characterized fig 3 reveals the fesem of cuo the size of cuo was around 15 μm and the surface structure of cuo was made up of a sheet structure of around 200 nm fig 3b no distinct difference was discovered in the overall structure of cuo before and after use fig 3a and c but the sheet structure was worn out after use fig 3d the result proved the cu leaching in the process of fe2 cuo ps system the surface elements of cuo used before and after were analyzed by eds and the result is shown in fig 4 and table 1 the element of o and cu in fresh cuo are 22 22 and 77 78 wt respectively and in the used cuo were 42 25 and 57 35 wt respectively fe was detected on the surface of used cuo and approached 0 4 wt this phenomenon attested that fe2 canindeed adsorb onto the cuo surface in the fe2 cuo pssystem 3 2 2 change of cu2 and cu concentration metal leaching may occur when the metal catalyst activated ps therefore in the process of removing apap via fe2 cuo ps the leaching of cu2 may occur according to the research of zhang et al 2017b on using fe2 cuo to oxidize apap under acidic environment fe2 can adsorbed onto the cuo surface to form fe ii which can reduce cu ii to obtained cu i eq 2 zhang et al 2017b and to produce cu in the solution based on this research the concentration of cu2 and cu were measured during the reaction and the result is shown in fig 5 the concentration of cu2 increased with the reaction reaching 23 5 mg l 1 at 90 min and that of cu was stable at 8 5 mg l 1 probably because cu and cu2 have achieved dynamic balance the dissolved cu participated in activating ps to generate so4 for removing apap via eq 3 zhou et al 2016 surface absorbed fe ii can also form an extra activation site to improve the catalytic activity maithreepala and doong 2004 owing to a series of synergistic effect caused by the absorption of fe2 on the cuo surface the general oxidation capacity of the whole system was strengthened the analysis based on the xrd spectrum fig 6 a indicated that cuo jcpds pdf 45 0937 is the main component of the catalyst used before and after the reaction zhou et al 2018 no cu i and fe ii were detected in the xrd but cu i and fe iii were identified in xps fig 6b and d this result was probably because xrd detects deeper than xps yang et al 2018b and all the crystal forms were covered by cuo making cu i and fe iii detectable by xps and cuo by xrd 935 3 933 2 and711 9 ev werethe characteristic peaks of cu ii cu i fig 6b and c and fe iii fig 6d respectively lei et al 2015b xu et al 2016 li et al 2017b the form of fe iii proved that fe ii was adsorbed ontothe cuo surface 2 c u i i f e i i c u i f e i i i 3 c u s 2 o 8 2 c u 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 3 2 3 contribution of dissolved oxygen in the fe2 cuo ps system do affects the oxidization rate of fe2 and series of reactions between cu and o2 eqs 4 7 zhou et al 2018 therefore n2 aeration of fe2 cuo ps system was carried out to investigate the effect of do on the reaction as shown in fig 7 the degradation rate of apap was significantly inhibited under n2 aeration and the degradation rate decreased to 70 this result confirmed that do had a significant impact on the fe2 cuo ps system as do decreased o2 the intermediate which functioned between cu2 and cu decreased which resulted to the decrease in oh produced using eq 6 thus the degradation rate of apap is suppressed 4 c u o 2 c u 2 o 2 5 c u o 2 2 h c u 2 h 2 o 2 6 c u h 2 o 2 c u 2 o h o h 7 c u 2 o 2 c u o 2 3 2 4 effect of catalyst doses quenching experiment in the system of fe2 cuo ps so4 is produced by fe2 cu activates ps eqs 1 3 and oh forms by the combination of so4 and h2o and the catalytic effect of cu thus to classify the contribution of different free radicals on the apap degradation via the fe2 cuo ps system different free radical detectors were selected to identify free radicals the detectors had diverse reaction rates in combining with different free radicals which can be used to identify the kinds of free radicals in the ps system oh et al 2016 among these detectors the most often used was methanol and tba ji et al 2017 ismail et al 2016 in accordance with the effect of α h on reaction rate in the combination of alcohols with free radicals ding et al 2013 the reaction rate of methanol with so4 and oh were 1 6 7 7 107 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively liang et al 2013 whereas the reaction rate of tba with so4 and oh were 9 1 105and 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 respectively liang et al 2013 liang and su 2009 based on the differences in reaction rates between alcohols with so4 and with oh methanol was selected as the scavenger of so4 and oh and tba as the scavenger of oh the results are shown in fig 8 after adding 100 mm methanol and 100 mm tba the removal rate declined to 79 and 89 respectively logically so4 and oh participated in the process of apap degradation by fe2 cuo ps 3 2 5 catalytic mechanism the mechanism of fe2 cuo ps in the removal of apap is summarized in fig 9 first fe2 in the solution can directly activate ps to form so4 and can be absorbed on the cuo surface to form fe ii to reduce cu ii to cu i which dissolved to cu in the solution and activate ps to form so4 second cu can be combined with dissolved oxygen to form o2 which formed h2o2 the circulation of cu cu2 fenton like reaction can produce oh to oxidize apap eqs 4 7 3 3 the influence of different factors 3 3 1 fe2 concentration fe2 was an important influencing factor in the system of ps oxidization processes the effect of fe2 on apap degradation by adding fe2 in different concentrations is discussed fig 10 a showed that the degradation rate of apap initially increased and later decreased 65 91 to 87 with increased fe2 0 3 1 0 mm notably the removal of apap at 5 min was the highest when adding 1 0 mm fe2 in comparison with other fe2 concentration conditions nevertheless the final degradation rate can reach only 87 because the degradation efficiency canbe promoted by adding an appropriate amount of fe2 to accelerate the generation of so4 through eq 8 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 overloaded fe2 can form a large amount of so4 to approach rapid oxidization in short time and consumes the persulfate ion as the generator of so4 to form fe3 and so4 2 eq 9 peng et al 2017 8 f e 2 s o 4 f e 3 s o 4 2 9 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 2 3 3 2 cuo dosage fig 10b shows the effect of cuo dosage on apap degradation the increase in cuo dosage promoted the removal rate of apap the degradation rate of apap reached 85 when the cuo dosage was 0 1 g l 1 whereas 91 can be approached when the cuo dosage reached 0 3 g l 1 this result is because the lower cuo dosage in the system cannot provide sufficient attachment sites for fe2 resulting in the insufficient amount of fe ii formed on the cuo surface in triggering a chain reaction that produces free radicals zhang et al 2017b low dosage cuo also resulted in decreased cu leaching to form cu in the solution which limited the occurrence of eq 3 3 3 3 ps concentration ps plays a vital role in the fe2 cuo ps system as a source of so4 to affirm the optimal ps concentration to achieve the maximum apap removal rate a series of experiments of different ps dosages 0 2 0 8 g l 1 to remove apap were carried out as shown in fig 10c under the condition of ps concentration of 0 2 g l 1 the degradation rate of apap was only 59 the increase in ps concentration would result in increase in the removal rate when the concentration of ps reached 0 8 g l 1 the removal rate of apap increased to 91 the reason for this phenomenon is that so4 was generated by ps and low concentration ps is not enough to produce large amount of so4 to oxidize apap eqs 1 and 3 therefore the degradation rate of apap was enhanced with the increase in ps concentration 3 3 4 ph according to the study of fang et al the initial ph is crucial to the advanced oxidization technology based on fe2 catalysis fang et al 2013 therefore the initial ph was adjusted to investigate its effect on the degradation of apap in the fe2 cuo ps system as shown in fig 11 a the degradation rates of apap were 85 90 and 91 respectively when the initial ph was 3 5 and 6 5 although the rate of fe2 oxidation to fe3 was slower in an acidic atmosphere the increase in h would inhibit the surface activity of the catalyst and reduce the synergistic effect between fe2 and cuo thus reducing the degradation rate of apap 14 when the initial ph was 11 the reaction rate of apap was rapid in the beginning of the reaction the degradation rate of apap reached 66 at 5 min but the final degradation rate was only 76 this result maybe due to the hydroxides under alkaline conditions caused by the combination of oh and fe2 a certain flocculation results and made apap precipitate the rapid reduction of fe2 concentration under alkaline conditions resulted in an insufficient synergistic effect of fe2 and cuo thus limiting the degradation of apap by measuring the change in ph in the reaction process fig 11b shows that the final ph of the reaction was stable at about 3 this result was because ps generated a large amount of h with h2o eq 10 which reduced the ph of the reaction system wu et al 2014 10 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 h o 2 3 h to further study the effect of ph conditions on the treatment of apap by persulfate a series of buffers were used to maintain the ph in d i water samples and real water samples as presented in fig 11c when the ph of the buffer solution is equal to 3 the degradation of apap is not much different from that of the nonbuffer solution however when the ph is equal to 5 or 6 5 the degradation of apap is better than that of the nonbuffer solution this phenomenon occurred because the buffer system acted to regulate h concentration and reduced the inhibition of the catalyst surface activity when the ph is equal to 11 the degradation of apap deteriorated because the metal ions precipitated and weakened the synergistic effect between fe2 and cuo to determine the ph variation in real water the decomposition experiments of apap in surface water by the fe2 cuo ps system were conducted as shown in fig 12 a in different initial ph reaction processes the degradation of apap was somewhat inhibited in surface water compared with ultrapure water this phenomenon is because the cl 1 co3 2 hco3 and humic acid in surface water would suppress apap degradation liu et al 2018 in particular when the ph is equal to 11 the degradation of apap is greatly affected because of the precipitation of fe2 changes in ph in the surface water in different initial ph reaction processes are shown in fig 12b in surface water when the initial ph ranged from 3 to 6 5 the ph dropped to 3 when the ps was added to the solution when the initial ph was 11 the ph can only be reduced to 10 because the surface water has a certain concentration of buffers and can adjust the h concentration to further discuss the implications of the investigated procedure for real water treatment a drug cold granule fu ren tang pharmaceutical containing apap 0 02 g g was purchased from the pharmacy dissolved in 100 ml surface water and degraded via the fe2 cuo ps system the results are shown in fig 12c the ph decreased to 3 and the removal rate of apap reached up to 90 in the surface water after 90 min of reaction these results indicated that the fe2 cuo ps system is effective for the degradation of apap in real water 3 4 oxidation products and pathway of apap degraded in surface water to extrapolate the results obtained in the present investigation to environmental samples the fate of acetaminophen in the environmental sample oxidation was investigated apap in surface water was degraded under the following condition apap 100 mg l 1 ps 0 8 g l 1 cuo 0 3 g l 1 fe2 0 7 mm the removal rate is shown in fig 13 a to elucidate the possible pathway behind apap degradation the intermediates of apap degradation were analyzed using gc ms fig 13 presented the proposed pathway for apap degradation at first 2 acetylamino 2 propenoic acid and hydroquinone were initially generated because aromatic rings were preferentially attacked by free radicals then the hydroquinone reacted with acetone to form hydroquinone acetate and the n aminocarbonyl acetamide was also detected the benzene ring in hydroquinone acetate was degraded through oxidation and produced 2 pentanol acetate and 1 2 ethanediol monoacetate subsequently these compounds have also been degraded further into low molecular weight organic matter ethers esters acids via the cleavage of c c bond the pathway of apap degradation is through the aop process 4 conclusion in the present paper cuo was introduced into the fe2 ps system to accelerate the degradation of apap a series of synergistic effects between fe and cuo enhanced the oxidization of the persulfate system which resulted in the change in fe2 concentration the generation of cu and combined with the characterization of cuo the degradation mechanism was considered that i fe2 directed active ps to remove apap ii fe2 adsorbed onto the surface to formfe ii and reduce cu ii to cu i iii cu dissolved into the solution and reacted with do to form h2o2 which can be activated by cu to generate oh quenching experiments proved that so4 and oh participated in the oxidization process in summary removing organic pollution via the synergistic effect during the usage of persulfate oxidization process is effective besides the fe2 cuo ps system is also effective for the degradation of apap in natural water acknowledgments this work was financially supported by fujian province science and technology project foundation 2017i01010015 xiamen technology project foundation
