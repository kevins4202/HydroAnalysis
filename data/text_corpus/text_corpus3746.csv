18730,chromate is considered to be a toxic contaminant because of its potential to harm animal and human health in this study polypyrrole calcium rectorite clay composites ppy ca rec composites were prepared as a potential adsorbent via in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer for adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution the xrd results indicated that the clay sheets were exfoliated in the prepared composites sem results showed good dispersion of the ppy on the clay sheets the adsorption of cr vi onto the ppy ca rec adsorbent was highly ph dependent and the removal efficiency by ppy ca rec composites was much higher than the ppy homopolymer adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order kinetic model with an equilibrium reached within 30 180 min the adsorption isotherm data were fitted well by the langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 714 29 833 33 mg g at 25 45 c the ppy ca rec composites could be regenerated and reused for three consecutive adsorption desorption cycles without loss of the original removal efficiency for cr vi removal furthermore the selective adsorption of cr vi was demonstrated in binary adsorption systems with coexisting ions the mechanisms of cr vi removal containing electrostatic interactions ionic interaction as well as reduction of cr vi to cr iii which could be observed by the xps results graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metal wastewater treatment clay based materials cr vi removal mechanism pyrrolic nitrogen 1 introduction water pollution by heavy metal ions is a global concern today among these various kinds of heavy metal ions chromium cr appears to be the foremost typical heavy metal pollutant that exists widely in the effluents produced from metal plating tannery textile industries and chemical manufacturing kera et al 2016 yao et al 2012 zehhaf et al 2015 cr vi an effective mutagen and potential carcinogen with high fluidity in soil and aquatic systems is carcinogenic mutagenic and 500 times more toxic than cr iii cr vi may be present in various forms such as cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 depending on the ph and concentration of the cr vi solution the world health organization who set maximum contaminant limits for surface water of 0 1 mg l and the permissible limit is 0 05 mg l for potable water ballav et al 2012 however the concentration of cr vi in contaminated water is generally higher than 100 mg l ballav et al 2014 setshedi et al 2013 therefore there is an urgent need to reduce limit the concentration of cr vi in these industrial wastewaters to the permissible level prior to discharge into the environment a variety of traditional methods such as chemical precipitation membrane filtration ion exchange electrochemical process baral et al 2006 kozlowski and walkowiak 2002 tian and yang 2007 and adsorption setshedi et al 2013 for removing cr vi from water have been employed adsorption has attracted more and more attention because of its simple operation feasible technology low operating cost and other excellent characteristics khaldi et al 2018 zehhaf et al 2015 a large number of traditional adsorbents have been diffusely applied for the cr vi removal including activated carbon pérez candela et al 1995 clay minerals gier and johns 2000 metal oxide goshu et al 2009 polymers baig et al 2015 zeolites biškup and subotić 2004 and agricultural residues o connell et al 2008 these methods suffer from some disadvantages due to unsatisfactory removal efficiencies polypyrrole ppy has attracted increasing attention for heavy metal removal from water because of its nontoxicity environmental stability inexpensiveness easy synthesis and ion exchange properties chen et al 2014b ppy shows excellent adsorption capacity for cr vi because of the pyrrolic n structure katal et al 2011 in addition with two or more oxidation states toxic cr vi can be spontaneously reduced to less toxic cr iii by chemical reaction ballav et al 2012 karthik and meenakshi 2014 however limited by the aggregation of ppy particles of π π stacking the dopant anion such as cl and no3 diffusion out of the polymer is difficult which will result in a finite capacity for cr vi removal gupta et al 2010 li et al 2012 to overcome this shortcoming as well as increase the specific surface area synthetic composites are considered to be one of the most effective modification methods for ppy zhou et al 2017 mohamed et al 2018 much attention has been paid to the combination of ppy and clay minerals in recent years such as sepiolite chen et al 2014a montmorillonite setshedi et al 2013 halloysite ballav et al 2014 and palygorskite yao et al 2012 rectorite rec is considered to have a higher aspect ratio and longer interlayer distance than some clays such as montmorillonite and rec can form promising interlaminated exfoliated polymer nanocomposites with improved properties that can expose inaccessible sites on the layers kotal and bhowmick 2015 hong et al 2008 furthermore there are large reserves of calcium rectorite ca rec in the natural environment therefore there are broad application prospects for developing composite materials based on ca rec that can increase adsorption capacity and expose inaccessible sites rec has been successfully used as a carrier in many composites such as bi2wo6 rec composites guo et al 2012 and rec supported nanoscale zero valent iron na et al 2016 in this study ppy coated ca rec composites were synthesized through in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer in the presence of ca rec ppy exhibited special adsorption reduction capacity for cr vi ions dissolved in aqueous media whereas the presence of ca rec can solve the problem of agglomeration and dispersion of ppy in aqueous solutions we have discussed the adsorption capacity and mechanism when using ppy ca rec composites as an active adsorbent to remove cr vi from aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ca rec was obtained from zibo kangnengda rare earth materials co ltd pyrrole monomer was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd and stored at 4 c before use ammonium persulfate aps hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab ortho phosphoric acid anhydrous ethanol sodium hydroxide diphenylcarbazide and hydrochloric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate were purchased from xilong scientific co ltd all reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification 2 2 synthesis of the ppy ca rec composites and characterization methods the ppy ca rec composites were synthesized by an in situ oxidative polymerization technique using aps as an oxidant at room temperature the preparation of ppy ca rec composites are described in detail in text s1 in supporting information all characterization methods are listed in text s2 in supporting information 2 3 batch adsorption experiments 2 3 1 adsorption equilibrium and kinetic experiments the effects of the dosage preparation ratio ph value of solution interaction time initial concentration and temperature on the cr vi removal were investigated aqueous cr vi solutions with different concentrations were obtained by diluting a stock solution 1000 mg l with water the adsorption study was performed in a temperature controlled shaking bath at 200 rpm the value of the initial solution ph was adjusted by addition of naoh solution 0 1 m 1 m and h2so4 solution 0 1 m 1 m batch adsorption experiments were performed with the ppy ca rec composites 20 mg of ppy ca rec composites was mixed with 20 ml of cr vi solution at different concentrations the adsorption solution was shaken at 25 c for a predetermined time interval after the adsorption reaction the solution was then filtered through a 0 22 μm filter the cr vi concentration in the filtrate was analyzed using a uv visible spectrometer uv 2700 shimadzu corporation at 540 nm gb 7467 87 the cr vi adsorption efficiency removal and equilibrium adsorption capacity q e were calculated from the following equations 1 re m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 2 q e c 0 c e m v where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations mg l of cr vi respectively m is the adsorbent mass g and v is the volume of solution l for the kinetics study 300 mg of ppy ca rec composites was added to 300 ml of cr vi solution at ph 1 5 and then vibrated at 25 c the initial cr vi concentration was varied from 50 to 200 mg l at time zero and preselected time intervals 0 780 min 5 ml samples were taken out and filtered quickly with a 0 22 μm filter and analyzed for cr vi as previously mentioned all control and adsorption experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 2 effect of the preparation ratio adsorbent dosage and ph the effect of the ppy ca rec composites preparation ratio on adsorption of cr vi was investigated by varying the ratio of ca rec to ppy from 1 0 5 to 1 2 ppy ca rec composites 20 mg at different ratios were mixed with 20 ml of cr vi solution ph 1 5 the initial concentration of cr vi solution in this study was 250 mg l after vibrating for 8 h the solution was filtered to analyze the content of cr vi different dosages 5 40 mg of ppy ca rec composites were added to 20 ml of simulated cr vi solution with a procedure similar to the procedure used above to investigate the effect of ph on the removal of cr vi by the ppy ca rec composites adsorption studies were conducted by varying the ph of the cr vi solution from 1 5 to 11 5 with a procedure similar to the procedure used above 2 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm experiments at three different temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c were carried out by changing the initial concentration of cr vi from 300 to 1500 mg l the procedure was like the procedure above except for vibrating for 14 h isotherm models such as the freundlich the langmuir and the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm were employed to interpret the adsorption isotherm data thermodynamic parameters associated with the adsorption process such as the standard free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were also obtained from the isotherm data 2 3 4 effect of coexisting ions the effect of coexisting ions during cr vi adsorption was carried out in a binary sorption mode the coexisting ions used zinc zn2 copper cu2 nickel ni2 nitrates no3 chloride cl and carbonate co3 2 in a typical experiment 20 ml of 250 mg l cr vi solution containing the ion of interest was in contact with 20 mg of ppy ca rec composites by shaking at 25 c the concentration of the coexisting ions in the cr vi solution was varied from 20 to 100 mg l after equilibrium was reached the solutions were filtered and the cr vi concentration of the solutions determined as previously described 2 3 5 desorption experiment the regeneration and reusability of ppy ca rec composites were investigated by adsorption desorption experiments that were conducted in a batch process a dosage of 1 g l ppy ca rec composites was added to 200 ml of cr vi solution 100 mg l ph 1 5 for an 8 h adsorption then desorption of cr vi loaded ppy ca rec composites was accomplished with 100 ml of 1 m naoh solution and vibrating for 1 5 h and the solutions were filtered and analyzed for the residual cr vi concentrations in this step thereafter to regenerate the adsorption sites of adsorbent ppy ca rec composites after desorption were recovered by adding the adsorbent to 100 ml of a 2 m hcl solution and vibrating for 1 5 h and the adsorbent was then separated and dried the adsorbent regenerated using hcl was reused in the next adsorption cycle under the same adsorption conditions and five adsorption regeneration cycles were carried out to evaluate the adsorbent reusability in particular the results of experiments were also used to compare with those of adsorbents without desorption and regeneration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the ppy ca rec composites wide angle x ray diffraction plots of ca rec ppy and ppy ca rec composites before and after cr vi adsorption are depicted in fig 1 a the diffraction peaks at 19 97 29 09 35 15 and 62 61 were attributed to ca rec hong et al 2008 the decreased peak intensity in ppy ca rec composites might be due to the coating of the polymer matrix onto ca rec the broad peak at 25 in ppy ca rec composites was the characteristic peak of amorphous ppy ballav et al 2012 small angle x ray diffraction plots fig 1b were studied to judge the degree of intercalation and exfoliation of ca rec in the polymer matrix the crystalline peak at 3 59 d spacing 1 23 nm corresponded to the periodicity in the direction of 001 for the ca rec clay sample huang et al 2008 for ppy ca rec composites the characteristic peak shifted to a lower value of 3 19 d spacing 1 38 nm that might be due to the incorporation of ppy into the interlayer of ca rec x ray diffraction patterns also showed that the characteristic peak shifted to a higher value of 3 21 d spacing 1 38 nm after cr vi adsorption which was due to the consumption of ppy in the interlayer and that could be confirmed by ft ir fig s1 text s3 the surface morphologies of the ca rec ppy and ppy ca rec composites were observed by using sem as shown in fig 2 a the ca rec was sheet like in shape with a smooth surface and layer structure with wrinkled edges fig 2b shows that the ppy homopolymers were agglomerated as nearly spherical particles and agglomeration of both large and small particles was observed in the ppy sample the ca rec was primarily covered by ppy homopolymer during the formation of the composites fig 2c the ppy homopolymer grew up onto the surface of ca rec or between the exfoliated interlayer and the surface of the ca rec became highly rough as ppy uniformly covered the surface of ca rec the structure of the composites after cr vi adsorption fig 2d remained unchanged except for the consumption of a part of polypyrrole which was in good agreement with the xrd analysis the xps spectra obtained for ppy ca rec composites before and after cr vi adsorption are presented in fig 3 the xps survey spectrum for ppy ca rec composites fig 3a displays energy bands due to c 1s 284 ev n 1s 400 ev o 1s 532 ev and cl 2p 199 ev which could be confirmed by edx fig s2 text s4 furthermore the n 1s core level spectrum of ppy ca rec composites fig 3b could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 399 5 ev 399 9 ev and 401 85 ev attributed to the quinonoid imine n benzenoid amine nh and doped imine nh electronic states respectively hou et al 2015 3 2 cr vi adsorption onto ppy ca rec composites 3 2 1 effect of the preparation ratio on cr vi removal different composites were prepared by varying the ratio of ca rec to ppy from 1 0 5 to 1 2 as shown in fig s3 when the ppy ca rec ratio was 1 5 1 the maximum removal percentage of cr vi was 100 with a decrease in the ppy load the removal efficiency decreased based on this conclusion the best preparation ratio 1 5 1 of ppy to ca rec was selected as the model composites for all experiments 3 2 2 effect of the adsorbent dosage on cr vi removal the effect of the dosage of ppy ca rec composites 0 25 2 g l on the removal of cr vi was investigated and is presented in fig s4 this essential parameter determines the capacity of an adsorbent for a given initial concentration the cr vi removal efficiency increased from 66 67 at a dosage of 0 25 g l to 99 99 at a dosage of 1 g l and remained unchanged after a dosage of 1 g l the increase in removal efficiency may be due to an increase in surface area and availability of more adsorbent sites with the increase in the dosage the optimum dosage was 1 g l for the present experiment 3 2 3 effect of the initial ph on cr vi removal the solution ph was one of the most significant factors that controls the adsorption of metal ions on the adsorbent sites the adsorption efficiency of cr vi onto ppy ca rec composites ppy and ca rec clays as a function of ph 1 5 11 5 is shown in fig s5 the results showed that the highest adsorption capacity of ppy ca rec composites for cr vi was 250 mg g while the highest capabilities of ppy and ca rec were 237 24 mg g and 43 84 mg g respectively a gradual decrease in the cr vi removal efficiency was observed as the ph value increased for ppy ca rec composites the recorded adsorption capacity decreased from 250 mg g at ph 1 5 to 3 51 mg g at ph 11 5 the improvement in the adsorption capacity of ppy ca rec composites was because of the increased bet surface area of ppy ca rec composites compared with ca rec clay table s1 as well as the improved dispersion of ppy ca rec composites compared with ppy when the ph value is from 1 to 5 most of cr vi are hcro4 and only a small amount of cr vi are cr2o7 2 and h2cro4 when ph 5 hcro4 rapidly converted to cro4 2 with increasing ph value hcro4 is a negative monovalent ion when interacted with adsorbents hcro4 occupied the least active sites and required the least adsorption free energy baral et al 2006 furthermore as ph values increased a larger amount of oh existed in the solution oh would compete with cr vi for the adsorbent active sites on the ppy surface and and bai 2003 further experiments were performed to explain the observed adsorption behaviors of cr vi as a function of ph values the electrostatic adsorption capacity can be determined by zeta potential fig s6 when the zeta potential is positive ph 1 5 10 cr vi can be adsorbed by ppy ca rec composites when the zeta potential becomes negative ph 11 ppy ca rec composites have no adsorption capacity on cr vi as shown in fig 4 the cr iii in aqueous solution was detected and decreased with the increase of ph from 1 5 to 3 5 in addition the enhanced cr vi reduction at low ph was due to the high redox potential of cr vi 1 33 ev chávez guajardo et al 2015 the concentration of cl after cr vi adsorption at different initial ph is shown in fig s7 at lower ph values the ppy chains became highly protonated which favored the anion exchange between the cl dopant of the ppy and the oxyanions of cr vi bhaumik et al 2016 therefore the release of cl decreased with the increase of ph 3 3 adsorption kinetics the effect of contact time on cr vi adsorption by ppy ca rec composites for four initial cr vi concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l is therefore presented in fig 5 a the adsorption of cr vi onto ppy ca rec composites increased rapidly in the first 30 min and obviously slowed down as the reaction approached equilibrium due to the decrease in the adsorbent active sites furthermore the cr vi adsorption by ppy ca rec composites increased with an increase in the initial concentration adsorption is a process in which the concentration gradient of adsorbed species acts as a driving force in the reaction process accordingly the higher initial concentration led to a higher adsorption driving force and hence an increase in adsorption capacity mekhloufi et al 2013 pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were employed to evaluate the kinetic data of cr vi on the ppy ca rec composites and their linearized equations are given in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q t where q e and q t are the amounts of adsorbed cr vi mg g at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 1 and k 2 are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order rate constants respectively the values of q e and k 1 obtained from the pseudo first order model fig s8a are shown in table 1 along with the correlation coefficients r 2 the results indicate that the values of r 2 were in the range of 0 9448 0 9939 although the r 2 values of some studies were high the calculated q e values were still low 37 76 172 68 mg g when compared with the corresponding experimental values 50 200 mg g linear plots of the pseudo second order model for all predetermined initial concentrations are presented in fig s8b and the data obtained from the equation are given in table 1 for the pseudo second order kinetic model the r 2 values varied from 0 9998 to 0 9999 and the calculated q e values agreed well with the experimental values the values of r 2 and q e indicate that the adsorption kinetics of cr vi adsorption were well described by the pseudo second order model table 1 also shows that the values of the pseudo second order rate constant k2 decreased with an increase in the initial cr vi concentration this finding implies that the removal of cr vi by ppy ca rec composites was faster for the lower cr vi initial concentration of 50 mg l than for the higher concentrations of 100 150 and 200 mg l to evaluate the existence and the function of the diffusion mechanism the adsorption kinetics data were further analyzed to understand the role of intraparticle diffusion in the whole adsorption process the intraparticle diffusion model was evaluated by the relationship between the time dependent adsorption capacity q t and t 1 2 eq 5 5 q t k i t 1 2 c i where k i is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c i is intercept of the stage i associated with the thickness of the boundary layer linear plots of the intraparticle diffusion model for all predetermined concentrations are depicted in fig 5b three different linear regions were observed throughout the plot which meant that the adsorption of cr vi involved more than one kinetic mechanism the initial sharp linear region up to 5 min could be attributed to the surface adsorption of cr vi which was controlled by boundary layer diffusion in the second linear portion of the plot 5 60 min the adsorption rate slowed down gradually indicating that intraparticle diffusion was the rate limiting mechanism during this stage thereafter due to the decrease in the concentration in solution the diffusion rate in the particles further slowed down thus reaching the final equilibrium stage the values of the intraparticle rate constant k i and boundary layer thickness intercept c i for four different initial concentrations were calculated from the second linear portion of the plot and are shown in table 1 the larger intraparticle rate constant 8 18 18 70 and boundary layer thickness 12 69 45 73 suggested that surface diffusion had a larger role as the rate limiting step bhaumik et al 2016 3 4 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms play a vital role in investigating chemical interactions between homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces isa et al 2008 the adsorption isotherms of cr vi sorption onto ppy ca rec composites at three different temperatures are shown in fig 5c to predict the adsorption capacity the most important parameter for designing an adsorption system of the adsorbent two widely used isotherm models langmuir and freundlich were verified to analyze the adsorption isotherm data the linearized langmuir isotherm model and the freundlich isotherm model are expressed by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 c e q e 1 q m b c e q m 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and b l mg is the langmuir constant related with the adsorption energy k f mg g is the freundlich adsorption isotherm constant related to the extent of adsorption and 1 n is related to the intensity of adsorption the dimensionless separation factor r l which is a basic characteristic of the langmuir model can be used to determine the favorability of an adsorption process r l is represented by eq 8 8 r l 1 1 b c 0 the equilibrium isotherm plots for the three different temperatures were shown in fig s8c and fig s8d the freundlich and langmuir isotherm parameters the slope and the intercept determined from the linear equations are given in table 2 the value of k f q m and b increased with the increase of temperature indicating that the adsorption process is endothermic mohan et al 2005 the r 2 values of the langmuir model 0 9923 0 9939 were much higher than that of the freundlich model 0 8652 0 9696 at three different temperatures the values of r l at different temperatures were found to be in the range of 0 0096 0 0186 and the lower value of r l demonstrated that the adsorption process was favorable setshedi et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity was increased from 714 29 mg g to 833 33 mg g as the temperature increased from 25 c to 45 c the endothermic property of the adsorption process might be due to the increase in the thermal energy of the adsorbing species with the increase of temperature bhaumik et al 2016 accordingly it is considered that the adsorption of cr vi occurred through the formation of monolayers on a limited number of identical adsorption sites on a homogeneous surface langmuir and freundlich isotherms are insufficient to explain the chemical or physical properties of the adsorption process the d r isotherm model can be applied to distinguish between physical and chemical adsorption lin et al 2011 the linearized form of d r isotherm can be expressed by eq 9 9 ln q e ln q m k d ε 2 where q e is the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium mol g q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mol g k d is the constant related to adsorption energy mol2 kj2 ε is the polanyi potential which is equal to rt ln 1 1 c e c e is the equilibrium concentration of cr vi mol l r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature in kelvin k the mean sorption energy e kj mol defined as the free energy change when one mole of ion is transferred to the surface of the solid from infinity in the solution is calculated by eq 10 10 e 1 2 k d the q m k d e values and the r 2 are also listed in table 2 and the linear forms of the equation is shown in fig s9 the relatively high correlation coefficients r 2 0 8897 0 9515 reflect that the experimental data agree well with the d r isotherm model the values of e in this study were found to be 17 44 19 15 kj mol suggesting that the adsorption of cr vi onto ppy ca rec composites involves a chemical adsorption process and the chemical adsorption process was more important than ion exchange and physisorption argun et al 2007 lin et al 2011 this conclusion was in agreement with that from the analysis on the adsorption activation energy the maximum adsorption capacities of some clays and clay based materials for removing cr vi as reported in the literature are shown in table s2 as table s2 shows the adsorption capacity of the ppy ca rec composites 714 29 mg g was relatively higher than the adsorption capacity of the clay based materials even higher than graphene oxide alpha cyclodextrin polypyrrole nanocomposites 606 06 mg g chauke et al 2015 though the experimental conditions might be different from those currently studied the higher adsorption capacity of the ppy ca rec composites suggested that it could be applied for wastewater treatment as a potential adsorbent 3 5 thermodynamic parameters thermodynamic parameters such as the standard free energy change δg standard enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs at three different temperatures were calculated by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 δ g o r t ln k c 12 ln k c δ s o r δ h o r t where kc is the distribution coefficient obtained from the langmuir isotherm l mol δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln kc versus 1 t fig 5d the negative values of δg 18 62 to 21 63 kj mol and positive δh 26 21 kj mol shown in table 3 indicate that the cr vi adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic unuabonah et al 2007 the δg values decreased with the increase in temperature which indicated an increased spontaneity with temperature the positive value of δs 0 1500 kj mol k indicated that the randomness of the solid solute interface increased during adsorption due to the release of cl ions displaced water and the desorption of cr iii bhaumik et al 2016 erden and donat 2017 romerogonzález et al 2006 3 6 effect of coexisting ions in addition to cr vi industrial wastewater also contains a range of other metal elements that compete with cr vi for adsorption sites and influence the cr vi removal percentage the effect of selected ions including cu2 zn2 ni2 cl no3 and co3 2 on the removal of cr vi by ppy ca rec composites was therefore studied and the results are presented in fig 6 the absorption of cr vi by ppy ca rec composites was not affected by the presence of other coexisting ions these results could be explained by the surface properties of ppy ca rec composites at lower ph cations in the solution were excluded from the positively charged surface of ppy ca rec composites so the removal of cr vi was not affected as expected anions such as cl no3 and co3 2 were negatively charged so it is expected that they would compete with cr vi ions hcro4 for positively charged adsorption sites on ppy ca rec composites however due to the weak interaction between the adsorption sites and cl no3 and co3 2 anions in solution so their competitive effect in the adsorption process of cr vi could be neglected kera et al 2017 the high selectivity of ppy ca rec composites for cr vi has also been attributed to the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by the electron rich ppy polymer according to le chatelier s principle the transfer equilibrium moved forward thus promoting further adsorption and reduction of cr vi because cl no3 and co3 2 were weaker oxidizing agents than cr vi hcro4 they were not reduced by ppy ca rec composites setshedi et al 2013 3 7 regeneration studies to make the material more economical desorption of adsorbed metal ions was of great significance for the reuse of adsorbents batch adsorption studies were carried out using 1 m naoh solution as the desorption agent desorption efficiency of the ppy ca rec composites was evaluated by performing adsorption desorption experiments for five consecutive cycles only 4 93 of the adsorbed cr vi was extracted in the first cycle of desorption a lower desorption efficiency was due to the reduction of adsorbed cr vi to cr iii by electron rich polymeric moieties as observed by xps analysis wang et al 2014 the cr iii species was released upon treatment with 2 m hcl to regenerate the adsorption sites of the ppy ca rec composites for the next adsorption cycle the removal efficiency of ppy ca rec composites in each adsorption cycle was shown in fig 7 the removal efficiency of the first three cycles remained unchanged more than 85 the second and third cycles of desorption were 16 84 and 18 99 respectively this characteristic indicated that the reduction property of ppy to cr vi was diminished after the first adsorption in the subsequent fourth and fifth cycles the adsorption and desorption were reduced rapidly because of the disintegration and deterioration of ppy on ppy ca rec composites krishnani et al 2013 in contrast there was an interesting phenomenon in which materials without any recycling treatment were better than those mentioned above because reduction was the main factor in the treatment of cr vi desorption experiments could regenerate cl which could exchange cr vi ions in water but it would accelerate the degradation process of ppy and affect the reduction ability of ppy ca rec composites this result suggested that the ppy ca rec composites could be successfully reused for three successive cycles without any treatment 3 8 investigation of the cr vi removal mechanism to explore the mechanism involved in the removal of cr vi 100 mg of ppy ca rec composites was added to 100 ml of cr vi solution 100 mg l ph 1 5 cr vi and total cr were typically analyzed and the change in the cl concentration in the solution was measured during the adsorption process cr vi removal total cr removal and chloride release are shown in fig 8 a the removal of cr vi 99 99 and total cr 29 65 reached the maximum at 120 min and the chloride ion concentration in the solution was the highest at this time total cr removal decreased after 120 min due to the desorption of cr iii on the ppy ca rec composites the ppy ca rec composites before and after adsorption 120 min and 600 min were analyzed with xps the ion exchange process could be confirmed by the reduction of cl 2p peaks fig 8b and the increase in chloride ions in solution the two additional peaks fig 8c at 576 ev and 586 ev were due to cr 2p in the spectrum the presence of cr iii on the surface of adsorbents originates from the chemical reduction interaction by the electron rich ppy moieties aigbe et al 2017 the intensity of these two peaks decreased with time suggesting that the cr vi adsorbed on the material was reduced to cr iii and eventually entered the solution the xps n 1s peak of the ppy ca rec composites is shown in fig 8d and the n 1s peak appeared at 399 87 ev which was found to be slightly shifted to a higher binding energy compared with the pristine adsorbent and the peak width w increased from 1 38 ev to 1 50 ev after adsorption as listed in table s2 the relative amount of n and nh groups in the adsorbent increased after cr vi removal in contrast the proportion of nh groups decreased after cr vi removal indicating that the nitrogen group was involved in binding and reducing cr vi as expected hou et al 2015 more importantly cr iii could be adsorbed by the deprotonated pyrrolic n through cr iii n covalent bonding ko et al 2018 and si oh on the surface of ca rec with liberation of h fang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the mechanism of cr vi removal by ppy ca rec composites could be described via four stages fig 9 1 the cr vi and the surface protonated nitrogen n are bound to the adsorption site via the electrostatic interactions 2 cr vi anion species replaces the doped cl ions of ppy by an ion exchange process 3 cr vi was reduced to cr iii through shuttling back and forth between ppy0 and ppy with the aid of the nitrogen group of ppy 4 finally a part of cr iii was adsorbed by the deprotonated pyrrolic n and si oh on the surface of ca rec 4 conclusion the removal of cr vi ion as a model heavy metal pollutant from aqueous solution was studied with the batch adsorption method by using ppy ca rec composites as an adsorbent the best preparation ratio of ppy to ca rec was 1 5 1 the adsorption was dependent mainly on the initial solution ph whereas the optimal cr vi adsorption was achieved at ph 1 5 adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption isotherm data were well described

18730,chromate is considered to be a toxic contaminant because of its potential to harm animal and human health in this study polypyrrole calcium rectorite clay composites ppy ca rec composites were prepared as a potential adsorbent via in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer for adsorption of cr vi from aqueous solution the xrd results indicated that the clay sheets were exfoliated in the prepared composites sem results showed good dispersion of the ppy on the clay sheets the adsorption of cr vi onto the ppy ca rec adsorbent was highly ph dependent and the removal efficiency by ppy ca rec composites was much higher than the ppy homopolymer adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order kinetic model with an equilibrium reached within 30 180 min the adsorption isotherm data were fitted well by the langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 714 29 833 33 mg g at 25 45 c the ppy ca rec composites could be regenerated and reused for three consecutive

coexisting ions the mechanisms of cr vi removal containing electrostatic interactions ionic interaction as well as reduction of cr vi to cr iii which could be observed by the xps results graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metal wastewater treatment clay based materials cr vi removal mechanism pyrrolic nitrogen 1 introduction water pollution by heavy metal ions is a global concern today among these various kinds of heavy metal ions chromium cr appears to be the foremost typical heavy metal pollutant that exists widely in the effluents produced from metal plating tannery textile industries and chemical manufacturing kera et al 2016 yao et al 2012 zehhaf et al 2015 cr vi an effective mutagen and potential carcinogen with high fluidity in soil and aquatic systems is carcinogenic mutagenic and 500 times more toxic than cr iii cr vi may be present in various forms such as cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 depending on the ph and concentration of the cr vi solution the world health organization who set maximum contaminant limits for surface water of 0 1 mg l and the permissible limit is 0 05 mg l for potable water ballav et al 2012 however the concentration of cr vi in contaminated water is generally higher than 100 mg l ballav et al 2014 setshedi et al 2013 therefore there is an urgent need to reduce limit the concentration of cr vi in these industrial wastewaters to the permissible level prior to discharge into the environment a variety of traditional methods such as chemical precipitation membrane filtration ion exchange electrochemical process baral et al 2006 kozlowski and walkowiak 2002 tian and yang 2007 and adsorption setshedi et al 2013 for removing cr vi from water have been employed adsorption has attracted more and more attention because of its simple operation feasible technology low operating cost and other excellent characteristics khaldi et al 2018 zehhaf et al 2015 a large number of traditional adsorbents have been diffusely applied for the cr vi removal including activated carbon pérez candela et al 1995 clay minerals gier and johns 2000 metal oxide goshu et al 2009 polymers baig et al 2015 zeolites biškup and subotić 2004 and agricultural residues o connell et al 2008 these methods suffer from some disadvantages due to unsatisfactory removal efficiencies polypyrrole ppy has attracted increasing attention for heavy metal removal from water because of its nontoxicity environmental stability inexpensiveness easy synthesis and ion exchange properties chen et al 2014b ppy shows excellent adsorption capacity for cr vi because of the pyrrolic n structure katal et al 2011 in addition with two or more oxidation states toxic cr vi can be spontaneously reduced to less toxic cr iii by chemical reaction ballav et al 2012 karthik and meenakshi 2014 however limited by the aggregation of ppy particles of π π stacking the dopant anion such as cl and no3 diffusion out of the polymer is difficult which will result in a finite capacity for cr vi removal gupta et al 2010 li et al 2012 to overcome this shortcoming as well as increase the specific surface area synthetic composites are considered to be one of the most effective modification methods for ppy zhou et al 2017 mohamed et al 2018 much attention has been paid to the combination of ppy and clay minerals in recent years such as sepiolite chen et al 2014a montmorillonite setshedi et al 2013 halloysite ballav et al 2014 and palygorskite yao et al 2012 rectorite rec is considered to have a higher aspect ratio and longer interlayer distance than some clays such as montmorillonite and rec can form promising interlaminated exfoliated polymer nanocomposites with improved properties that can expose inaccessible sites on the layers kotal and bhowmick 2015 hong et al 2008 furthermore there are large reserves of calcium rectorite ca rec in the natural environment therefore there are broad application prospects for developing composite materials based on ca rec that can increase adsorption capacity and expose inaccessible sites rec has been successfully used as a carrier in many composites such as bi2wo6 rec composites guo et al 2012 and rec supported nanoscale zero valent iron na et al 2016 in this study ppy coated ca rec composites were synthesized through in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer in the presence of ca rec ppy exhibited special adsorption reduction capacity for cr vi ions dissolved in aqueous media whereas the presence of ca rec can solve the problem of agglomeration and dispersion of ppy in aqueous solutions we have discussed the adsorption capacity and mechanism when using ppy ca rec composites as an active adsorbent to remove cr vi from aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ca rec was obtained from zibo kangnengda rare earth materials co ltd pyrrole monomer was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd and stored at 4 c before use ammonium persulfate aps hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab ortho phosphoric acid anhydrous ethanol sodium hydroxide diphenylcarbazide and hydrochloric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate were purchased from xilong scientific co ltd all reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification 2 2 synthesis of the ppy ca rec composites and characterization methods the ppy ca rec composites were synthesized by an in situ oxidative polymerization technique using aps as an oxidant at room temperature the preparation of ppy ca rec composites are described in detail in text s1 in supporting information all characterization methods are listed in text s2 in supporting information 2 3 batch adsorption experiments 2 3 1 adsorption equilibrium and kinetic experiments the effects of the dosage preparation ratio ph value of solution interaction time initial concentration and temperature on the cr vi removal were investigated aqueous cr vi solutions with different concentrations were obtained by diluting a stock solution 1000 mg l with water the adsorption study was performed in a temperature controlled shaking bath at 200 rpm the value of the initial solution ph was adjusted by addition of naoh solution 0 1 m 1 m and h2so4 solution 0 1 m 1 m batch adsorption experiments were performed with the ppy ca rec composites 20 mg of ppy ca rec composites was mixed with 20 ml of cr vi solution at different concentrations the adsorption solution was shaken at 25 c for a predetermined time interval after the adsorption reaction the solution was then filtered through a 0 22 μm filter the cr vi concentration in the filtrate was analyzed using a uv visible spectrometer uv 2700 shimadzu corporation at 540 nm gb 7467 87 the cr vi adsorption efficiency removal and equilibrium adsorption capacity q e were calculated from the following equations 1 re m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 2 q e c 0 c e m v where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations mg l of cr vi respectively m is the adsorbent mass g and v is the volume of solution l for the kinetics study 300 mg of ppy ca rec composites was added to 300 ml of cr vi solution at ph 1 5 and then vibrated at 25 c the initial cr vi concentration was varied from 50 to 200 mg l at time zero and preselected time intervals 0 780 min 5 ml samples were taken out and filtered quickly with a 0 22 μm filter and analyzed for cr vi as previously mentioned all control and adsorption experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 2 effect of the preparation ratio adsorbent dosage and ph the effect of the ppy ca rec composites preparation ratio on adsorption of cr vi was investigated by varying the ratio of ca rec to ppy from 1 0 5 to 1 2 ppy ca rec composites 20 mg at different ratios were mixed with 20 ml of cr vi solution ph 1 5 the initial concentration of cr vi solution in this study was 250 mg l after vibrating for 8 h the solution was filtered to analyze the content of cr vi different dosages 5 40 mg of ppy ca rec composites were added to 20 ml of simulated cr vi solution with a procedure similar to the procedure used above to investigate the effect of ph on the removal of cr vi by the ppy ca rec composites adsorption studies were conducted by varying the ph of the cr vi solution from 1 5 to 11 5 with a procedure similar to the procedure used above 2 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm experiments at three different temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c were carried out by changing the initial concentration of cr vi from 300 to 1500 mg l the procedure was like the procedure above except for vibrating for 14 h isotherm models such as the freundlich the langmuir and the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm were employed to interpret the adsorption isotherm data thermodynamic parameters associated with the adsorption process such as the standard free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were also obtained from the isotherm data 2 3 4 effect of coexisting ions the effect of coexisting ions during cr vi adsorption was carried out in a binary sorption mode the coexisting ions used zinc zn2 copper cu2 nickel ni2 nitrates no3 chloride cl and carbonate co3 2 in a typical experiment 20 ml of 250 mg l cr vi solution containing the ion of interest was in contact with 20 mg of ppy ca rec composites by shaking at 25 c the concentration of the coexisting ions in the cr vi solution was varied from 20 to 100 mg l after equilibrium was reached the solutions were filtered and the cr vi concentration of the solutions determined as previously described 2 3 5 desorption experiment the regeneration and reusability of ppy ca rec composites were investigated by adsorption desorption experiments that were conducted in a batch process a dosage of 1 g l ppy ca rec composites was added to 200 ml of cr vi solution 100 mg l ph 1 5 for an 8 h adsorption then desorption of cr vi loaded ppy ca rec composites was accomplished with 100 ml of 1 m naoh solution and vibrating for 1 5 h and the solutions were filtered and analyzed for the residual cr vi concentrations in this step thereafter to regenerate the adsorption sites of adsorbent ppy ca rec composites after desorption were recovered by adding the adsorbent to 100 ml of a 2 m hcl solution and vibrating for 1 5 h and the adsorbent was then separated and dried the adsorbent regenerated using hcl was reused in the next adsorption cycle under the same adsorption conditions and five adsorption regeneration cycles were carried out to evaluate the adsorbent reusability in particular the results of experiments were also used to compare with those of adsorbents without desorption and regeneration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the ppy ca rec composites wide angle x ray diffraction plots of ca rec ppy and ppy ca rec composites before and after cr vi adsorption are depicted in fig 1 a the diffraction peaks at 19 97 29 09 35 15 and 62 61 were attributed to ca rec hong et al 2008 the decreased peak intensity in ppy ca rec composites might be due to the coating of the polymer matrix onto ca rec the broad peak at 25 in ppy ca rec composites was the characteristic peak of amorphous ppy ballav et al 2012 small angle x ray diffraction plots fig 1b were studied to judge the degree of intercalation and exfoliation of ca rec in the polymer matrix the crystalline peak at 3 59 d spacing 1 23 nm corresponded to the periodicity in the direction of 001 for the ca rec clay sample huang et al 2008 for ppy ca rec composites the characteristic peak shifted to a lower value of 3 19 d spacing 1 38 nm that might be due to the incorporation of ppy into the interlayer of ca rec x ray diffraction patterns also showed that the characteristic peak shifted to a higher value of 3 21 d spacing 1 38 nm after cr vi adsorption which was due to the consumption of ppy in the interlayer and that could be confirmed by ft ir fig s1 text s3 the surface morphologies of the ca rec ppy and ppy ca rec composites were observed by using sem as shown in fig 2 a the ca rec was sheet like in shape with a smooth surface and layer structure with wrinkled edges fig 2b shows that the ppy homopolymers were agglomerated as nearly spherical particles and agglomeration of both large and small particles was observed in the ppy sample the ca rec was primarily covered by ppy homopolymer during the formation of the composites fig 2c the ppy homopolymer grew up onto the surface of ca rec or between the exfoliated interlayer and the surface of the ca rec became highly rough as ppy uniformly covered the surface of ca rec the structure of the composites after cr vi adsorption fig 2d remained unchanged except for the consumption of a part of polypyrrole which was in good agreement with the xrd analysis the xps spectra obtained for ppy ca rec composites before and after cr vi adsorption are presented in fig 3 the xps survey spectrum for ppy ca rec composites fig 3a displays energy bands due to c 1s 284 ev n 1s 400 ev o 1s 532 ev and cl 2p 199 ev which could be confirmed by edx fig s2 text s4 furthermore the n 1s core level spectrum of ppy ca rec composites fig 3b could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 399 5 ev 399 9 ev and 401 85 ev attributed to the quinonoid imine n benzenoid amine nh and doped imine nh electronic states respectively hou et al 2015 3 2 cr vi adsorption onto ppy ca rec composites 3 2 1 effect of the preparation ratio on cr vi removal different composites were prepared by varying the ratio of ca rec to ppy from 1 0 5 to 1 2 as shown in fig s3 when the ppy ca rec ratio was 1 5 1 the maximum removal percentage of cr vi was 100 with a decrease in the ppy load the removal efficiency decreased based on this conclusion the best preparation ratio 1 5 1 of ppy to ca rec was selected as the model composites for all experiments 3 2 2 effect of the adsorbent dosage on cr vi removal the effect of the dosage of ppy ca rec composites 0 25 2 g l on the removal of cr vi was investigated and is presented in fig s4 this essential parameter determines the capacity of an adsorbent for a given initial concentration the cr vi removal efficiency increased from 66 67 at a dosage of 0 25 g l to 99 99 at a dosage of 1 g l and remained unchanged after a dosage of 1 g l the increase in removal efficiency may be due to an increase in surface area and availability of more adsorbent sites with the increase in the dosage the optimum dosage was 1 g l for the present experiment 3 2 3 effect of the initial ph on cr vi removal the solution ph was one of the most significant factors that controls the adsorption of metal ions on the adsorbent sites the adsorption efficiency of cr vi onto ppy ca rec composites ppy and ca rec clays as a function of ph 1 5 11 5 is shown in fig s5 the results showed that the highest adsorption capacity of ppy ca rec composites for cr vi was 250 mg g while the highest capabilities of ppy and ca rec were 237 24 mg g and 43 84 mg g respectively a gradual decrease in the cr vi removal efficiency was observed as the ph value increased for ppy ca rec composites the recorded adsorption capacity decreased from 250 mg g at ph 1 5 to 3 51 mg g at ph 11 5 the improvement in the adsorption capacity of ppy ca rec composites was because of the increased bet surface area of ppy ca rec composites compared with ca rec clay table s1 as well as the improved dispersion of ppy ca rec composites compared with ppy when the ph value is from 1 to 5 most of cr vi are hcro4 and only a small amount of cr vi are cr2o7 2 and h2cro4 when ph 5 hcro4 rapidly converted to cro4 2 with increasing ph value hcro4 is a negative monovalent ion when interacted with adsorbents hcro4 occupied the least active sites and required the least adsorption free energy baral et al 2006 furthermore as ph values increased a larger amount of oh existed in the solution oh would compete with cr vi for the adsorbent active sites on the ppy surface and and bai 2003 further experiments were performed to explain the observed adsorption behaviors of cr vi as a function of ph values the electrostatic adsorption capacity can be determined by zeta potential fig s6 when the zeta potential is positive ph 1 5 10 cr vi can be adsorbed by ppy ca rec composites when the zeta potential becomes negative ph 11 ppy ca rec composites have no adsorption capacity on cr vi as shown in fig 4 the cr iii in aqueous solution was detected and decreased with the increase of ph from 1 5 to 3 5 in addition the enhanced cr vi reduction at low ph was due to the high redox potential of cr vi 1 33 ev chávez guajardo et al 2015 the concentration of cl after cr vi adsorption at different initial ph is shown in fig s7 at lower ph values the ppy chains became highly protonated which favored the anion exchange between the cl dopant of the ppy and the oxyanions of cr vi bhaumik et al 2016 therefore the release of cl decreased with the increase of ph 3 3 adsorption kinetics the effect of contact time on cr vi adsorption by ppy ca rec composites for four initial cr vi concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l is therefore presented in fig 5 a the adsorption of cr vi onto ppy ca rec composites increased rapidly in the first 30 min and obviously slowed down as the reaction approached equilibrium due to the decrease in the adsorbent active sites furthermore the cr vi adsorption by ppy ca rec composites increased with an increase in the initial concentration adsorption is a process in which the concentration gradient of adsorbed species acts as a driving force in the reaction process accordingly the higher initial concentration led to a higher adsorption driving force and hence an increase in adsorption capacity mekhloufi et al 2013 pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were employed to evaluate the kinetic data of cr vi on the ppy ca rec composites and their linearized equations are given in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q t where q e and q t are the amounts of adsorbed cr vi mg g at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 1 and k 2 are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order rate constants respectively the values of q e and k 1 obtained from the pseudo first order model fig s8a are shown in table 1 along with the correlation coefficients r 2 the results indicate that the values of r 2 were in the range of 0 9448 0 9939 although the r 2 values of some studies were high the calculated q e values were still low 37 76 172 68 mg g when compared with the corresponding experimental values 50 200 mg g linear plots of the pseudo second order model for all predetermined initial concentrations are presented in fig s8b and the data obtained from the equation are given in table 1 for the pseudo second order kinetic model the r 2 values varied from 0 9998 to 0 9999 and the calculated q e values agreed well with the experimental values the values of r 2 and q e indicate that the adsorption kinetics of cr vi adsorption were well described by the pseudo second order model table 1 also shows that the values of the pseudo second order rate constant k2 decreased with an increase in the initial cr vi concentration this finding implies that the removal of cr vi by ppy ca rec composites was faster for the lower cr vi initial concentration of 50 mg l than for the higher concentrations of 100 150 and 200 mg l to evaluate the existence and the function of the diffusion mechanism the adsorption kinetics data were further analyzed to understand the role of intraparticle diffusion in the whole adsorption process the intraparticle diffusion model was evaluated by the relationship between the time dependent adsorption capacity q t and t 1 2 eq 5 5 q t k i t 1 2 c i where k i is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c i is intercept of the stage i associated with the thickness of the boundary layer linear plots of the intraparticle diffusion model for all predetermined concentrations are depicted in fig 5b three different linear regions were observed throughout the plot which meant that the adsorption of cr vi involved more than one kinetic mechanism the initial sharp linear region up to 5 min could be attributed to the surface adsorption of cr vi which was controlled by boundary layer diffusion in the second linear portion of the plot 5 60 min the adsorption rate slowed down gradually indicating that intraparticle diffusion was the rate limiting mechanism during this stage thereafter due to the decrease in the concentration in solution the diffusion rate in the particles further slowed down thus reaching the final equilibrium stage the values of the intraparticle rate constant k i and boundary layer thickness intercept c i for four different initial concentrations were calculated from the second linear portion of the plot and are shown in table 1 the larger intraparticle rate constant 8 18 18 70 and boundary layer thickness 12 69 45 73 suggested that surface diffusion had a larger role as the rate limiting step bhaumik et al 2016 3 4 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms play a vital role in investigating chemical interactions between homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces isa et al 2008 the adsorption isotherms of cr vi sorption onto ppy ca rec composites at three different temperatures are shown in fig 5c to predict the adsorption capacity the most important parameter for designing an adsorption system of the adsorbent two widely used isotherm models langmuir and freundlich were verified to analyze the adsorption isotherm data the linearized langmuir isotherm model and the freundlich isotherm model are expressed by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 c e q e 1 q m b c e q m 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and b l mg is the langmuir constant related with the adsorption energy k f mg g is the freundlich adsorption isotherm constant related to the extent of adsorption and 1 n is related to the intensity of adsorption the dimensionless separation factor r l which is a basic characteristic of the langmuir model can be used to determine the favorability of an adsorption process r l is represented by eq 8 8 r l 1 1 b c 0 the equilibrium isotherm plots for the three different temperatures were shown in fig s8c and fig s8d the freundlich and langmuir isotherm parameters the slope and the intercept determined from the linear equations are given in table 2 the value of k f q m and b increased with the increase of temperature indicating that the adsorption process is endothermic mohan et al 2005 the r 2 values of the langmuir model 0 9923 0 9939 were much higher than that of the freundlich model 0 8652 0 9696 at three different temperatures the values of r l at different temperatures were found to be in the range of 0 0096 0 0186 and the lower value of r l demonstrated that the adsorption process was favorable setshedi et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity was increased from 714 29 mg g to 833 33 mg g as the temperature increased from 25 c to 45 c the endothermic property of the adsorption process might be due to the increase in the thermal energy of the adsorbing species with the increase of temperature bhaumik et al 2016 accordingly it is considered that the adsorption of cr vi occurred through the formation of monolayers on a limited number of identical adsorption sites on a homogeneous surface langmuir and freundlich isotherms are insufficient to explain the chemical or physical properties of the adsorption process the d r isotherm model can be applied to distinguish between physical and chemical adsorption lin et al 2011 the linearized form of d r isotherm can be expressed by eq 9 9 ln q e ln q m k d ε 2 where q e is the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium mol g q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mol g k d is the constant related to adsorption energy mol2 kj2 ε is the polanyi potential which is equal to rt ln 1 1 c e c e is the equilibrium concentration of cr vi mol l r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature in kelvin k the mean sorption energy e kj mol defined as the free energy change when one mole of ion is transferred to the surface of the solid from infinity in the solution is calculated by eq 10 10 e 1 2 k d the q m k d e values and the r 2 are also listed in table 2 and the linear forms of the equation is shown in fig s9 the relatively high correlation coefficients r 2 0 8897 0 9515 reflect that the experimental data agree well with the d r isotherm model the values of e in this study were found to be 17 44 19 15 kj mol suggesting that the adsorption of cr vi onto ppy ca rec composites involves a chemical adsorption process and the chemical adsorption process was more important than ion exchange and physisorption argun et al 2007 lin et al 2011 this conclusion was in agreement with that from the analysis on the adsorption activation energy the maximum adsorption capacities of some clays and clay based materials for removing cr vi as reported in the literature are shown in table s2 as table s2 shows the adsorption capacity of the ppy ca rec composites 714 29 mg g was relatively higher than the adsorption capacity of the clay based materials even higher than graphene oxide alpha cyclodextrin polypyrrole nanocomposites 606 06 mg g chauke et al 2015 though the experimental conditions might be different from those currently studied the higher adsorption capacity of the ppy ca rec composites suggested that it could be applied for wastewater treatment as a potential adsorbent 3 5 thermodynamic parameters thermodynamic parameters such as the standard free energy change δg standard enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs at three different temperatures were calculated by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 δ g o r t ln k c 12 ln k c δ s o r δ h o r t where kc is the distribution coefficient obtained from the langmuir isotherm l mol δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln kc versus 1 t fig 5d the negative values of δg 18 62 to 21 63 kj mol and positive δh 26 21 kj mol shown in table 3 indicate that the cr vi adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic unuabonah et al 2007 the δg values decreased with the increase in temperature which indicated an increased spontaneity with temperature the positive value of δs 0 1500 kj mol k indicated that the randomness of the solid solute interface increased during adsorption due to the release of cl ions displaced water and the desorption of cr iii bhaumik et al 2016 erden and donat 2017 romerogonzález et al 2006 3 6 effect of coexisting ions in addition to cr vi industrial wastewater also contains a range of other metal elements that compete with cr vi for adsorption sites and influence the cr vi removal percentage the effect of selected ions including cu2 zn2 ni2 cl no3 and co3 2 on the removal of cr vi by ppy ca rec composites was therefore studied and the results are presented in fig 6 the absorption of cr vi by ppy ca rec composites was not affected by the presence of other coexisting ions these results could be explained by the surface properties of ppy ca rec composites at lower ph cations in the solution were excluded from the positively charged surface of ppy ca rec composites so the removal of cr vi was not affected as expected anions such as cl no3 and co3 2 were negatively charged so it is expected that they would compete with cr vi ions hcro4 for positively charged adsorption sites on ppy ca rec composites however due to the weak interaction between the adsorption sites and cl no3 and co3 2 anions in solution so their competitive effect in the adsorption process of cr vi could be neglected kera et al 2017 the high selectivity of ppy ca rec composites for cr vi has also been attributed to the reduction of cr vi to cr iii by the electron rich ppy polymer according to le chatelier s principle the transfer equilibrium moved forward thus promoting further adsorption and reduction of cr vi because cl no3 and co3 2 were weaker oxidizing agents than cr vi hcro4 they were not reduced by ppy ca rec composites setshedi et al 2013 3 7 regeneration studies to make the material more economical desorption of adsorbed metal ions was of great significance for the reuse of adsorbents batch adsorption studies were carried out using 1 m naoh solution as the desorption agent desorption efficiency of the ppy ca rec composites was evaluated by performing adsorption desorption experiments for five consecutive cycles only 4 93 of the adsorbed cr vi was extracted in the first cycle of desorption a lower desorption efficiency was due to the reduction of adsorbed cr vi to cr iii by electron rich polymeric moieties as observed by xps analysis wang et al 2014 the cr iii species was released upon treatment with 2 m hcl to regenerate the adsorption sites of the ppy ca rec composites for the next adsorption cycle the removal efficiency of ppy ca rec composites in each adsorption cycle was shown in fig 7 the removal efficiency of the first three cycles remained unchanged more than 85 the second and third cycles of desorption were 16 84 and 18 99 respectively this characteristic indicated that the reduction property of ppy to cr vi was diminished after the first adsorption in the subsequent fourth and fifth cycles the adsorption and desorption were reduced rapidly because of the disintegration and deterioration of ppy on ppy ca rec composites krishnani et al 2013 in contrast there was an interesting phenomenon in which materials without any recycling treatment were better than those mentioned above because reduction was the main factor in the treatment of cr vi desorption experiments could regenerate cl which could exchange cr vi ions in water but it would accelerate the degradation process of ppy and affect the reduction ability of ppy ca rec composites this result suggested that the ppy ca rec composites could be successfully reused for three successive cycles without any treatment 3 8 investigation of the cr vi removal mechanism to explore the mechanism involved in the removal of cr vi 100 mg of ppy ca rec composites was added to 100 ml of cr vi solution 100 mg l ph 1 5 cr vi and total cr were typically analyzed and the change in the cl concentration in the solution was measured during the adsorption process cr vi removal total cr removal and chloride release are shown in fig 8 a the removal of cr vi 99 99 and total cr 29 65 reached the maximum at 120 min and the chloride ion concentration in the solution was the highest at this time total cr removal decreased after 120 min due to the desorption of cr iii on the ppy ca rec composites the ppy ca rec composites before and after adsorption 120 min and 600 min were analyzed with xps the ion exchange process could be confirmed by the reduction of cl 2p peaks fig 8b and the increase in chloride ions in solution the two additional peaks fig 8c at 576 ev and 586 ev were due to cr 2p in the spectrum the presence of cr iii on the surface of adsorbents originates from the chemical reduction interaction by the electron rich ppy moieties aigbe et al 2017 the intensity of these two peaks decreased with time suggesting that the cr vi adsorbed on the material was reduced to cr iii and eventually entered the solution the xps n 1s peak of the ppy ca rec composites is shown in fig 8d and the n 1s peak appeared at 399 87 ev which was found to be slightly shifted to a higher binding energy compared with the pristine adsorbent and the peak width w increased from 1 38 ev to 1 50 ev after adsorption as listed in table s2 the relative amount of n and nh groups in the adsorbent increased after cr vi removal in contrast the proportion of nh groups decreased after cr vi removal indicating that the nitrogen group was involved in binding and reducing cr vi as expected hou et al 2015 more importantly cr iii could be adsorbed by the deprotonated pyrrolic n through cr iii n covalent bonding ko et al 2018 and si oh on the surface of ca rec with liberation of h fang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the mechanism of cr vi removal by ppy ca rec composites could be described via four stages fig 9 1 the cr vi and the surface protonated nitrogen n are bound to the adsorption site via the electrostatic interactions 2 cr vi anion species replaces the doped cl ions of ppy by an ion exchange process 3 cr vi was reduced to cr iii through shuttling back and forth between ppy0 and ppy with the aid of the nitrogen group of ppy 4 finally a part of cr iii was adsorbed by the deprotonated pyrrolic n and si oh on the surface of ca rec 4 conclusion the removal of cr vi ion as a model heavy metal pollutant from aqueous solution was studied with the batch adsorption method by using ppy ca rec composites as an adsorbent the best preparation ratio of ppy to ca rec was 1 5 1 the adsorption was dependent mainly on the initial solution ph whereas the optimal cr vi adsorption was achieved at ph 1 5 adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption isotherm data were well described by the langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 714 29 833 33 mg g at 25 45 c the ppy ca rec composites could be regenerated and reused for three consecutive adsorption desorption cycles without loss of the original removal efficiency for cr vi removal the mechanism of cr vi removal by ppy ca rec composites involved in electrostatic interactions ion exchange process and chemical reduction therefore ppy ca rec composites could be a promising material in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with cr vi declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

18731,in this study landfill sludge ls was excavated from a 10 year old full scale sludge landfill and used to investigate effects of dosage on sludge dewaterability rheological properties and extracellular polymeric substances eps variations by fecl3 lime conditioning ls had lower content of organic matters 0 28 and smaller particle size than excess sludge es and greatly lower viscosity and high flowability the suitable concentration of ls for conditioning 107 2 118 6 g l was much higher than that of es 34 g l by rheological analysis both fecl3 and lime improved dewaterability of ls and caused decline of slime and loosely bound eps lb eps fecl3 destroyed proteins in slime and lb eps owing to coagulation and acidification effects weakened internal structure strength and thus improved dewaterability lime addition caused alkaline hydrolysis of polysaccharides in slime and lb eps reduced viscosity and flowability and improved flowability and dewaterability for ls the optimal dosage for dewatering using 57 6 mg lime g dried solids ds and 53 6 mg fecl3 g ds was obtained by using an integrative response surface methodology rsm coupled nonlinear programming approach under water content constraint of 55 the integrative optimization achieved 26 0 cost saving in comparison to rsm optimized condition graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill sludge conditioning rheology

treatment activated sludge produces large quantities of excess sludge es which requires proper and environmentally accepted treatment and disposal strategy sludge treatment systems can be perceived in two main ways 1 thickening conditioning dewatering and drying to remove water from sludge and 2 digestion stabilization composting and incineration to treat or stabilize organic matters in sludge tchobanoglous et al 2003 sludge disposal majorly consists of landfill agricultural application and building material application among these disposal methods sludge landfill was listed as the lowest hierarchy in five waste management strategies according to european policy because it is an inefficient environmental approach and was discouraged and even prohibited in many countries kacprzak et al 2017 kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 however landfill used to be the major sludge disposal methods all over the world and was still commonly applied in eu 12 countries new member states joining eu after 2004 kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 china yang et al 2015 2017a etc in 2013 landfill of sludge also accounted for 14 2 11 6 9 6 5 8 and 3 6 in norway slovakia estonia poland and france respectively kacprzak et al 2017 in usa about 30 2 of sewage sludge 1 97 tg yr were sent to municipal landfill and sludge landfill in 2007 seiple et al 2017 the massive landfill sludge ls endured long term anaerobic digestion which enhanced biodegradation of organic matters and thus decreased their contents in sludge on the other hand the standard of landfill is much stricter than before for instance water content wc required for sludge landfill is reduced from 80 to 60 since 2008 in china yang et al 2015 therefore excavation and re dewatering of ls became an economic and sustainable alternative because the new wc requirement saved at least 50 landfill volume ls dewatering is expected to be a hotspot for sludge disposal and land utilization because large capacity of ls was accumulated all over the world and landfill volume requirement as land resource is scarce however to our knowledge literature on characterization and dewatering of ls are not found and research regarding this field should be very useful for understanding mechanisms and providing valuable information about ls dewatering sludge are chemically conditioned expressly to improve their dewaterability tchobanoglous et al 2003 and only a few formula were successfully applied to reduce wc of dewatered sludge below 60 including fecl3 lime ren et al 2015 coal fly ash chen et al 2010 fenton s reagent lime dai et al 2017 etc among these formula fecl3 lime conditioning was the most cost effective and widely used in municipal wastewater treatment platns wwtp in china ren et al 2015 lime was considered as skeleton builder shaping channels in the cellular surfaces and releasing the bound water for further dewatering dai et al 2017 and highly acidic fecl3 was used as coagulant and lysing reagent that causes destruction of sludge flocs and the disruption of microorganism cells hu et al 2017 for ls long term anaerobic digestion in landfill destructed flocs and loosened sludge structure fecl3 lime formula was probably applicable to ls conditioning because fecl3 can coagulate fine particles generated from flocs destruction and lime can strengthen skeleton of ls for dewatering in recent years many researchers have correlated sludge dewaterability with physicochemical characteristics rheological properties and extracellular polymeric substances eps components dai et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 reported that lower sludge ph resulted in hydrolysis of eps and intracellular materials weakening network strength and shrinking linear viscoelastic regime and concluded that rheological analysis can act as a bridge to reveal mechanism of sludge dewatering zhang et al 2017 found that rheological characterization combined with fractal dimension analysis of porous network structure was applicable in quantitative evaluation of sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 demonstrated that loosely bound eps lb eps played a greater role in sludge dewatering than tightly bound eps tb eps while wang et al 2010 reported that proteins and polysaccharides had a high affinity for water and deteriorated sludge filterability those intensive efforts are very helpful to clarify the mechanism of conventional sludge dewatering but most of the previous studies were conducted for es with dewatering target of wc 80 more detailed investigations are required to better elucidate sludge dewatering mechanism to low wc 60 by bridging sludge dewaterability with rheological properties and eps components in this study ls was excavated from a full scale sludge landfill and used to investigate effects of dosage on sludge dewaterability rheological properties and eps components by fecl3 lime conditioning fig 1 rheological analysis were conducted to determine the suitable concentration of ls for conditioning and characterize fluidibility and structure strength of conditioned ls correlation analysis was calculated to explore sludge dewatering mechanism by further studying the relationship between sludge dewaterability eps components and rheological parameters finally an integrative response surface methodology rsm coupled nonlinear programming nlp approach was constructed to minimize cost of fecl3 lime conditioning and overcome shortcomings of rsm yang et al 2017b because sludge dewatering only requires wc below a threshold value rather than reaching the extreme value 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and coagulants the sludge landfill was located at bailonggang wwtp in shanghai china 31 11 north latitude 121 43 east longitude in landfill process dewatered sludge with wc of 80 produced by bailonggang wwtp and other adjacent wwtps in shanghai were poured into the landfill before closure by polyvinyl chloride geomembrane in 2008 the top area and height of a landfill unit were 21 500 m2 172 m 125 m and 6 m respectively the annual average temperature is 15 5 c with extreme maximum and minimum temperature of 37 9 and 10 8 c in this region the ls sample was taken from one of twelve landfill units fig 1 in july 2018 at the same depth of 2 3 m through six vents by using soil sampler after assembling a floating bridge on the surface of geomembranes and then mixed and homogenized to form a representative sample es sample was obtained from mechanical thickening process in bailonggang wwtp for control fecl3 solution purity of 38 and lime which were commonly used for es dewatering to 60 in bailonggang wwtp were used as sludge conditioner in this study 2 2 batch test for sludge conditioning and dewatering 2 2 1 estimation of proper concentration of ls for dewatering firstly raw ls with wc around 80 was diluted with filtrate from ls dewatering and sifted through a 0 25 mm stainless steel sieve to remove large particles and impurities and then adjusted the concentration to 135 3 g l then the sludge was further diluted to 7 samples of 250 ml at different concentrations of 124 8 115 6 104 0 95 5 84 3 75 2 and 34 0 g l the sifted es with concentration of 34 0 g l was concentrated to 44 8 g l by buchner funnel and diluted to 25 3 g l with filtrate from es dewatering respectively then the steady shear flow of ls and es was determined and fitted by the herschel bulkley model to determine the appropriate concentration for conditioning 2 2 2 effects of fecl3 and lime dosage on sludge dewaterability batch tests of conditioning was conducted to compare dewaterability of ls and es after conditioning by fecl3 and lime after sieving ls and es were adjusted to concentrations of 109 5 and 34 0 g l proper to dewatering respectively two batch tests were conducted for sludge conditioning by adding different dosages of fecl3 27 32 38 44 50 56 and 61 mg g dried solids ds at fixed lime dosage of 100 mg g ds and different dosages of lime 58 70 85 100 115 130 and 142 mg g ds at fecl3 dosage of 44 mg g ds in each test a 250 ml sludge sample was mixed at 250 rpm for 10 min after adding fecl3 solution and then for another 10 min after dosing lime milk mixture was stirred by using a program controlled six paddle stirrer zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china the conditioned sludge samples were carefully collected to analyze specific resistance of filtration srf capillary suction time cst dewatering efficiency rheological behavior and eps components 2 2 3 sludge dewatering efficiency measurements the sludge dewatering efficiency was measured by wc after obtaining sludge cake using an mmp 3 mini filter press afmitech netherlands which was composed of a steel piston filter pressure system and an air compressor sludge was pressed for 6 min under squeezing pressure of 0 8 bar which is equivalent to actual output pressure of 1 6 mpa by mechanical efficiency conversion using action area of push rod wc of sludge cake was determined by a hc103 moisture analyzer mettler toledo switzerland 2 3 integrative rsm nlp approach for cost optimization based on batch results of ls conditioning rsm with central composite design was used to optimize chemical dosages for ls dewatering the two factors with three levels of fecl3 dosage x 1 32 44 and 56 mg g dried solids ds and lime dosage x 2 70 100 and 130 mg g ds were selected and wc of dewatered ls was recognized as the response variable y in total 13 runs were conducted for rsm optimization experimental design and analysis of variance anova were performed for rsm optimization using the design expert 8 0 software based on the data obtained from rsm experiments the relationship between y and the set of factors is usually fitted by a second order polynomial model given in eq 1 1 y b 0 i 1 m b i x i i 1 m b i i x i 2 i 1 m j 1 m b i j x i x j where x i and x j represent the independent factors m is the number of factors b 0 is the constant term b i b ii and b ij are coefficients of the linear quadratic and interaction terms in order to minimize conditioning cost under wc constraints of relevant standards the objective function is established based on sum of costs related to the level of independent factors x i and x j and minimized subject to a series of constraints in the constraints the rsm model of eq 1 was incorporated and d i and f i in the rsm design were set as the minimum and maximum values of x i it is also assumed that y is required to be lower than the threshold value t the cost optimization is an nlp problem because the rsm model is nonlinear therefore the integrative rsm nlp model is constructed and shown in eq 2 2 minimize f i 1 m c x i subject to b 0 i 1 m b i x i i 1 m b i i x i 2 i 1 m j 1 m b i j x i x j t d i x i f i where f is the total cost of all the factors the fmincon function mishra et al 2016 was selected as the main function and objective function and constraints were also constructed to solve the rsm nlp model by matlab r2014a mathworks usa 2 4 rheological test rheological behavior of sludge was measured by a mcr102 rotary rheometer anton paar austria with concentric cylinder system measuring bob and cup as a rotational couette geometry 20 ml sludge sample was filled into the cup at 20 0 0 1 c in the controlled shear rate test a continuous shear ramp test was applied by continuously increasing shear rate from 1 to 1000 s 1 and then decreasing from 1000 back to 1 s 1 in linear manner the herschel bulkley model eq 3 which previously shown to be useful in describing sludge rheology dai et al 2014 was used to fit the rheological data by nonlinear curve fit in origin 9 0 originlab usa 3 τ k γ n τ y where τ and τ y are the shear stress and yield stress pa γ is the shear rate s 1 k is the consistency index pa sn n is the flow behavior index in strain amplitude sweep test strain amplitude was logarithmically varied from 0 01 to 1000 in a sinusoidal manner and the frequency was remained at 1 hz to exploit the linear viscoelastic lve domain and analyze structure feature of sludge 2 5 analytical and calculation methods suspended solids ss and volatile ss vss were measured by weight method at 105 c for 8 h and 600 c for 1 h respectively chinese nepa 2012 concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the filtrate were analyzed according to standard methods chinese nepa 2012 five day biological oxygen demand bod5 of filtrate was measured by a bod trak analyzer hach usa the ph was monitored by an hq30d portable meter hach usa srf of sludge was measured by pressure filtration method niu et al 2013 cst was determined by a portable 304b instrument equipped with an 18 mm diameter funnel triton uk and whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper eps components including slime eps lb eps and tb eps were stratified from the sludge samples by a heat extraction method niu et al 2016 and were analyzed by total organic carbon toc proteins and polysaccharides concentrations of toc were determined by a multi n c 3100 analyzer analyti jena germany proteins and polysaccharides were determined by lowry method and anthrone method niu et al 2016 respectively the pearson s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to accurately study the mechanism of fecl3 and lime on dewaterability through variation of eps contents and rheological characteristics using spss v19 package 3 results and discussion 3 1 ls characterization table 1 shows sludge and filtrate characteristics of ls and es compared to es ls had greatly lower vss ss 0 28 and smaller particle size it was because anaerobic digestion in landfill about 10 yr destructed sludge aggregates and degraded organic matters in sludge ls had higher srf and cst but greatly lower viscosity than es the results suggested that the deteriorated dewaterability of ls was majorly attributed to fine particles rather than viscous substances and was probably easy to improve by conditioning as fine particles could be coagulated long term anaerobic digestion also resulted in integration of flocs and release of intracellular compounds therefore concentrations of cod toc nh4 n tn and tp in ls were 10 6 21 1 45 0 30 9 and 2 4 times of those in es pollutants concentration in the filtrate of ls was in the typical range of landfill leachate of 5 20 yr costa et al 2019 the biodegradability of filtrate of ls was higher bod5 cod of 0 23 than es 0 18 but greatly lower than that of municipal wastewater 0 30 0 80 tchobanoglous et al 2003 3 2 estimation of proper concentration of ls for dewatering by rheological analysis as shown in table 1 ls had higher solid content and distinct sludge property and filtrate characteristics from es therefore comparisons on rheological behaviors of ls and es were conducted by using the steady shear flow to reflect the internal structure deformation and determine proper ss for dewatering fig 2 flow curves in fig 2a and b shows an ascending trend in shear stress with the increasing concentration at the same shear rate for ls or es due to the increased interactions between constituent particles present in sludge which required more energy i e shear stress to keep the sludge fluid in a prescribed motion radhakrishnan et al 2018 on the other hand the hysteresis loop area formed by the up and down flow curves indicated that higher ss concentration resulted in more obvious thixotropic behavior liu et al 2012 especially for es shear stress of es was higher than that of ls at the same concentration and the range of es at 34 0 g l was equivalent to that of ls at 95 5 104 0 g l which was probably attributed to lower organic contents of ls than es flow curves were fitted with the herschel bulkley model to determine an exact concentration range of ls for dewatering in which higher n value and k value indicate higher flowability and apparent viscosity liu et al 2016 xiao et al 2017b respectively sludge conditioning was carried out under flow state therefore rheological parameters n and k were two important factors to characterize sludge for conditioning on the other hand τy is the minimum stress to overcome for irreversible deformation to flow state and is unsuitable to describe mixing in the sludge conditioning process many literatures xiao et al 2017a 2017b usually investigated flowability and consistency of samples by rheological parameters n and k and τ y was not adopted thus only the rheological parameters k and n were used to characterize the sludge in this study fig 2c and d illustrate variations of fitted n and k values all with r2 0 9995 of ls and es at concentrations of 34 0 135 3 and 25 3 44 8 g l respectively the suitable concentration of ss for dewatering to 60 was 34 g l for es which provides a criterion of rheological status n 0 536 k 0 539 pa s n for dewatering of ls the n value of es and ls in fig 2c both decreased monotonously with increasing ss concentration and was equal to the criterion value of 0 536 at 118 6 g l for ls as shown in fig 2d the k value of es and ls both increased with rising ss and was intersected with the criterion line of 0 539 pa s n at 107 2 g l for ls comprehensively considering the viscosity and flowability 107 2 118 6 g l was chosen as suitable range for conditioning of ls which was much higher than that of es 3 3 effects of fecl3 lime dosage on sludge dewaterability and eps components 3 3 1 sludge dewaterability effects of fecl3 and lime dosages on sludge dewaterability by wc of sludge cake srf and cst are illustrated in fig 3 it should be noted that wc of sludge cake pressed by mini filter press is normally 5 lower than that pressed by industrial filter press based on engineering experience and thus wc of 55 was applied as threshold value according to chinese standard of gb t 23485 2009 with fecl3 dosage rising from 27 0 to 60 1 mg g ds wc of sludge cake decreased almost linearly from 78 8 to 47 7 for ls but slowly decreased from 64 7 to 58 3 at fecl3 dosage of 50 0 mg g ds and then increased to 61 2 for es fig 3a like fecl3 effects of lime dosage on wc was more obvious on ls than es with wc decreased almost linearly from 66 5 to 48 3 for ls at dosage of 57 6 142 4 mg g ds fecl3 and lime dosage required for controlling wc of conditioned ls below 55 were 44 and 100 mg g ds which is greatly lower than those of es with fecl3 and lime dosage of 80 and 200 mg g ds as shown in fig 3c f compared to those of es srf and cst values of ls were higher and were more affected by conditioner dosage higher srf and cst indicated worse dewaterability and the results were consistent with wc of sludge cake obtained by mini filter press however srf and cst data of ls were all higher than those of es but wc of sludge cake of ls was lower than that of es at fecl3 dosage and lime dosage above 62 4 and 58 8 mg g ds it was because ls contained more small particles that was difficult to be coagulated by fecl3 and lime and thus supernatant of conditioned sludge was difficult to filtrate by filter paper for srf determination and to permeate through whatman paper for cst nevertheless the supernatant was easy to pass through the industrial grade filter cloth under high pressure of 1 6 mpa low vss ss decreased the water binding capacity liang et al 2015 of ls which confirmed that impact of fecl3 and lime dosage on dewaterability was better reflected by wc of sludge cake rather than srf and cst for sludge with different characteristics as shown in fig 3e and f ph of filtrated of conditioned ls reduced from 6 4 to 3 6 and increased from 8 3 to 11 2 with rising dosage of fecl3 and lime respectively suggesting that ph effects on sludge dewaterability should be considered 3 3 2 eps stratification and components sludge with higher eps content generally results in higher viscosities and poor dewaterability because eps are hydrophilic compounds ruiz hernando et al 2015b fig 4 showed the toc proteins and polysaccharides in different eps layers of ls conditioned with different dosages of fecl3 and lime in ls slime lb and tb eps accounted for 85 3 6 0 and 8 7 in the total eps which is contradictory to conventional es with tb eps as the dominant constituent in eps 60 80 cheng et al 2018 niu et al 2013 it was because long term anaerobic digestion in the sludge landfill stimulated the diffusion of eps from inner layer bound eps to outer layer slime eps ahn et al 2009 which resulted in worse dewaterability of ls than es table 1 the contents of slime and lb eps in conditioned sludge decreased with rising dosages of fecl3 and lime as shown in fig 4a and b slime contents decreased more drastically for fecl3 5 4 mg mol fe3 than lime 0 6 mg mol ca2 the reduced level of lb eps contents for fecl3 1 9 mg mol fe3 was higher than that for lime 0 1 mg mol ca2 as well previous research also found that fe3 exhibited more effective biding affinity to lb eps than ca2 and thus lb eps contents decreased greatly by fe3 coagulation li et al 2012 li and yang 2007 variations of slime and lb eps in conditioned ls was consistent with the trend of dewaterability in fig 3 because ratios of slime tb eps and lb tb eps were extensively accepted indices of sludge dewaterability and filterability niu et al 2016 in fig 4c and e rising dosage of fecl3 declined proteins contents in both slime and lb eps but had insignificant effect on polysaccharides contents contrary to fecl3 lime dosage increment resulted in obvious decrease of polysaccharides contents in both slime and lb eps but was ineffective to proteins contents dai et al 2017 also found that fe3 coagulation on proteins were higher than that on polysaccharides while wang et al 2019 reported that structure of polysaccharides was destructed at alkaline ph after adding lime 3 4 rheological properties of ls with different fecl3 lime dosages 3 4 1 steady shear flow according to flow curves in fig 5 a and b shear stress decreased with the increasing dosage of fecl3 and lime at the same shear rate because non newtonian flow characteristics of sludge were weakened and internal structure was broken under acidic fecl3 or alkaline condition lime wang et al 2017 flow curves in fig 5a and b was fitted by herschel bulkley model to obtain parameter n and k and limiting viscosity μ defined as the asymptote value of viscosity shear rate curve tixier et al 2003 was also calculated to compare rheological behavior of sludge under different fecl3 or lime dosages as showed in fig 5c k value increased firstly and then decreased with the increasing dosage of fecl3 and n value showed the opposite pattern it was because ls was coagulated by fecl3 at dosage below 44 mg g ds and showed worse flowability while the repulsion of fe3 and acidification effect increased flowability of ls at higher dosage decreasing k value and increasing n value in fig 5d with the rising dosage of lime indicated the improvement of flowability due to alkaline hydrolysis which agreed well with the trend of slime eps in fig 4b as shown in fig 5c and d μ values decreased with the increasing dosages of fecl3 and lime μ is considered as a rheological index of sludge corresponding to the maximum dispersion of flocs under the influence of shear rate tixier et al 2003 and its decrease also suggested internal structure was damaged due to acidic or alkaline hydrolysis 3 4 2 dynamic measurement effects of fecl3 and lime dosages on viscoelastic properties of conditioned sludge are shown in fig 6 a and b the elastic modulus g and viscous modulus g reflects the structure strength and deformation energy of sample during the shear process mezger 2011 for all conditioned ls samples the elastic behaviors dominate the viscous ones in the lve range which means the samples exhibiting a certain rigidity the g value of ls 18 1 pa at 109 5 g l were much lower than that of es 16 6 228 9 pa at 80 120 g l which indicated that ls had weaker structure and lower resistance to deformation than es feng et al 2014 g and g both begun to decline when exceeding the lve range indicating the structure of sludge was changed irreversibly as the mixed liquor started to flow the decline rate of g was higher than that of g and eventually viscous behaviors dominated the elastic in non lve range in fig 6a and its enlarged figure to show effects of fecl3 g decreased monotonously with the increasing dosage of fecl3 from lve range to the range exceeding lve strain range of 0 01 9 however for lime effects in fig 6b and its enlarged figure g showed no obvious trend in the lve range strain range of 0 01 3 and then decreased outside the lve range 3 9 the results indicated that fecl3 weakened internal structure and improved flowability of sludge while lime only improved flowability wang et al 2017 also observed that network strength and colloidal forces of floc were weakened as ph decreases which can interpret effects of fecl3 on viscoelastic property in this study high complex modulus g value reflected a strong ability to resist deformation feng et al 2014 in fig 6c g value decreased with the increasing dosage of fecl3 but changed irregularly with the rising dosage of lime which were consistent with variations of g for ls samples in fig 6a and b calcium hydroxide and a small amount of calcium carbonate in lime conditioned ls would aggregate to large particles and form heterogeneous mixture which probably led to the irregular variation of g value 3 5 correlation of rheological behavior with dewaterability and eps the results of correlation coefficients are divided into two groups for fecl3 and lime addition and shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 correlation coefficients highlighted in green indicated the variables had significant relationships in both groups fecl3 and lime dosage both had significant correlation with dewatering indicators wc srf and cst at 0 01 level meanwhile dewatering indicators were all significantly related to each other at 0 01 level which confirmed that conditioning improved dewaterability of ls and three dewatering indicators reliably reflected the similar trend dosages were negatively correlated with both slime and lb eps while dewatering indicators showed positive correlation the results indicated the rising dosages of fecl3 and lime decreased slime and lb eps content and thus improved dewaterability of ls correlation coefficients highlighted in blue in table 2 indicated the variables had significant relationships in fecl3 group but insignificant in lime group the dosage of fecl3 was negatively correlated with proteins of slime and lb eps at 0 01 level and all dewatering indicators and g had positive correlation with proteins of slime and lb eps proteins has a high content of negatively charged amino acids which is more involved than polysaccharides in electrostatic bonds with multivalent cations laspidou and rittmann 2002 and is responsible for aggregation of sludge cells and formation of gel like matrix to maintains cell cohesion dogsa et al 2005 the results illustrated that coagulation and acidification of acidic fecl3 destroyed proteins in slime and lb eps owing to complexation and dissociation of protons on acidic functional groups omoike and chorover 2004 and thus reduced internal structure strength and improved dewaterability the data highlighted in yellow in table 2 indicated the variables had significant correlation in lime group but insignificant in fecl3 group the dosage of lime and n value had negative correlation with polysaccharides of slime and lb eps at 0 05 level while dewatering indicators and k value were positively correlated with polysaccharides of slime and lb eps suggesting that alkaline hydrolysis of polysaccharides in slime and lb eps caused by lime led to decline of flowability and improved dewaterability for ls lime addition created an alkaline condition to reduce content of low molecular weight polysaccharides ruiz hernando et al 2015a which contributes to high water retention thomas et al 2010 and increases sludge viscosity wang et al 2010 and thus improved flowability of ls illustrated as high n value and low k value in fig 5 as mentioned above it could be clarified that fecl3 and lime played distinct roles in ls conditioning from the perspective of rheology and eps improvement of sludge dewaterability was achieved by releasing of bound water owing to decreasing polysaccharides coelho et al 2011 and weakening internal structure caused by decreasing proteins wang et al 2017 correlation analysis showed a novel mechanism of dewaterability improvement in terms of eps components variations through rheological measurement therefore fecl3 lime conditioning can be optimized aiming at sludge with different eps components explanation about changes of eps components supplemented and developed the theory of acidification and skeleton builder during ls conditioning which provided more perspectives for guidance of dewatering and conditioning 3 6 technical economic optimization 3 6 1 conventional rsm optimization based on experimental results of rsm experiments the second order quadratic model was fitted and described as eq 4 4 y 210 9 0 78x2 3 85x1 0 013x1x2 0 000062x2 2 0 0198x1 2 anova results showed that f value of 71 48 and p value below 0 0001 implied that the quadratic model is significant and the experimental method is reliable predicted values of the fitted model well corresponded to the experimental results with adjusted r2 of 0 9671 indicating the quadratic model is suitable for evaluating wc of sludge cake the low relative deviation of 3 33 verified the applicability of the rsm model anova showed that both fecl3 and lime were the dominant parameter with positive influence on wc p 0 001 and interaction between the two variables was also significant at the 0 05 level the rsm optimized wc value was 46 7 under condition of 56 0 mg fecl3 g ds and 130 0 mg lime g ds the rsm recommended dosages at wc of 55 were 44 8 mg fecl3 g ds and 103 7 mg lime g ds and the experimental wc of 53 6 under the recommended condition validated the quadratic model 3 6 2 rsm nlp optimization the target of conventional rsm optimization was to maximize or minimize values of response variables without regard for treatment costs while the optimization target in environment engineering field usually requires the response variable above or below a threshold value with the lowest cost yang et al 2017b to overcome the shortcomings of rsm the rsm nlp methodology was applied to optimize chemical costs of fecl3 lime conditioning at wc below 55 the costs of fecl3 solution purity of 38 and lime powder were 89 0 and 74 1 ton respectively thus the objective function of cost was constructed for ls with concentration of 109 5 g l and is showed in eq 5 5 min f 0 234 x 1 0 0741 x 2 the constraints were established with y in eq 4 below relevant dewatering standard and x 1 and x 2 limits in the rsm experiment taking wc standard of gb t 23485 2009 as an example the constraint is showed in eq 6 6 s t 210 9 0 78 x 2 3 85 x 1 0 013 x 1 x 2 0 000062 x 2 2 0 0198 x 1 2 55 27 0 x 1 60 9 57 5 x 2 142 4 the rsm nlp optimized condition was obtained by combining objective function of eq 5 and constraints of eq 6 in matlab r2014a table 3 shows the comparison between rsm recommended dosages and rsm nlp optimized condition the rsm nlp optimized dosage consisted of 53 6 mg fecl3 g ds and 57 6 mg lime g ds yielding 4 3 7 4 of cost saving in comparison to the rsm recommended dosages and 26 0 of cost saving in comparison to rsm optimized condition a better way for techno economic optimization of a desirable response is provided by a combination of rsm and nlp under certain circumstances the rsm analysis provides a correlation model between factors and the response which can be utilized as a constraint inequation for nlp optimization the results showed that the rsm nlp integrated approach could optimize fecl3 lime conditioning of ls effectively using few data sets and becomes very attractive for techno economic optimization of systems with multiple influential factors and threshold requirements for response variables yang et al 2017b 4 conclusions this study investigated effects and mechanism of fecl3 lime conditioning on ls dewaterability by analyzing physicochemical characteristics rheological properties and variations of eps components the conclusions can be drawn as follow 1 ls had lower vss ss 0 28 and smaller particle size than es and greatly lower viscosity and high flowability after 10 years landfill long term landfill causes great changes in sludge properties which makes the countermeasures of conditioning and dewatering worthy of further study 2 the suitable concentration of ls for conditioning 107 2 118 6 g l was much higher than that of es 34 g l the data showed that rheological analysis could act as a powerful tool to determine target concentration of sludge with different organic contents for dewatering 3 both fecl3 and lime improved dewaterability of ls and caused decline of slime and lb eps with different mechanisms fecl3 destroyed proteins in slime and lb eps owing to coagulation and acidification effects weakened internal structure strength and thus improved dewaterability lime addition caused alkaline hydrolysis of polysaccharides in slime and lb eps reduced sludge viscosity and improved both flowability and dewaterability for ls 4 optimization by the integrative rsm nlp methodology obtained optimal dosage of 53 6 mg fecl3 g ds and 57 6 mg lime g ds under wc constraint of 55 and achieved 26 0 cost saving in comparison to rsm optimized condition rsm nlp optimization is an effective and powerful approach to minimize cost for systems with multiple influential factors and threshold

18731,in this study landfill sludge ls was excavated from a 10 year old full scale sludge landfill and used to investigate effects of dosage on sludge dewaterability rheological properties and extracellular polymeric substances eps variations by fecl3 lime conditioning ls had lower content of organic matters 0 28 and smaller particle size than excess sludge es and greatly lower viscosity and high flowability the suitable concentration of ls for conditioning 107 2 118 6 g l was much higher than that of es 34 g l by rheological analysis both fecl3 and lime improved dewaterability of ls and caused decline of slime and loosely bound eps lb eps fecl3 destroyed proteins in slime and lb eps owing to coagulation and acidification effects weakened internal structure strength and thus improved dewaterability lime addition caused alkaline hydrolysis of polysaccharides in slime and lb eps reduced viscosity and flowability and improved flowability and dewaterability for ls the optimal

treatment activated sludge produces large quantities of excess sludge es which requires proper and environmentally accepted treatment and disposal strategy sludge treatment systems can be perceived in two main ways 1 thickening conditioning dewatering and drying to remove water from sludge and 2 digestion stabilization composting and incineration to treat or stabilize organic matters in sludge tchobanoglous et al 2003 sludge disposal majorly consists of landfill agricultural application and building material application among these disposal methods sludge landfill was listed as the lowest hierarchy in five waste management strategies according to european policy because it is an inefficient environmental approach and was discouraged and even prohibited in many countries kacprzak et al 2017 kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 however landfill used to be the major sludge disposal methods all over the world and was still commonly applied in eu 12 countries new member states joining eu after 2004 kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 china yang et al 2015 2017a etc in 2013 landfill of sludge also accounted for 14 2 11 6 9 6 5 8 and 3 6 in norway slovakia estonia poland and france respectively kacprzak et al 2017 in usa about 30 2 of sewage sludge 1 97 tg yr were sent to municipal landfill and sludge landfill in 2007 seiple et al 2017 the massive landfill sludge ls endured long term anaerobic digestion which enhanced biodegradation of organic matters and thus decreased their contents in sludge on the other hand the standard of landfill is much stricter than before for instance water content wc required for sludge landfill is reduced from 80 to 60 since 2008 in china yang et al 2015 therefore excavation and re dewatering of ls became an economic and sustainable alternative because the new wc requirement saved at least 50 landfill volume ls dewatering is expected to be a hotspot for sludge disposal and land utilization because large capacity of ls was accumulated all over the world and landfill volume requirement as land resource is scarce however to our knowledge literature on characterization and dewatering of ls are not found and research regarding this field should be very useful for understanding mechanisms and providing valuable information about ls dewatering sludge are chemically conditioned expressly to improve their dewaterability tchobanoglous et al 2003 and only a few formula were successfully applied to reduce wc of dewatered sludge below 60 including fecl3 lime ren et al 2015 coal fly ash chen et al 2010 fenton s reagent lime dai et al 2017 etc among these formula fecl3 lime conditioning was the most cost effective and widely used in municipal wastewater treatment platns wwtp in china ren et al 2015 lime was considered as skeleton builder shaping channels in the cellular surfaces and releasing the bound water for further dewatering dai et al 2017 and highly acidic fecl3 was used as coagulant and lysing reagent that causes destruction of sludge flocs and the disruption of microorganism cells hu et al 2017 for ls long term anaerobic digestion in landfill destructed flocs and loosened sludge structure fecl3 lime formula was probably applicable to ls conditioning because fecl3 can coagulate fine particles generated from flocs destruction and lime can strengthen skeleton of ls for dewatering in recent years many researchers have correlated sludge dewaterability with physicochemical characteristics rheological properties and extracellular polymeric substances eps components dai et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 reported that lower sludge ph resulted in hydrolysis of eps and intracellular materials weakening network strength and shrinking linear viscoelastic regime and concluded that rheological analysis can act as a bridge to reveal mechanism of sludge dewatering zhang et al 2017 found that rheological characterization combined with fractal dimension analysis of porous network structure was applicable in quantitative evaluation of sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 demonstrated that loosely bound eps lb eps played a greater role in sludge dewatering than tightly bound eps tb eps while wang et al 2010 reported that proteins and polysaccharides had a high affinity for water and deteriorated sludge filterability those intensive efforts are very helpful to clarify the mechanism of conventional sludge dewatering but most of the previous studies were conducted for es with dewatering target of wc 80 more detailed investigations are required to better elucidate sludge dewatering mechanism to low wc 60 by bridging sludge dewaterability with rheological properties and eps components in this study ls was excavated from a full scale sludge landfill and used to investigate effects of dosage on sludge dewaterability rheological properties and eps components by fecl3 lime conditioning fig 1 rheological analysis were conducted to determine the suitable concentration of ls for conditioning and characterize fluidibility and structure strength of conditioned ls correlation analysis was calculated to explore sludge dewatering mechanism by further studying the relationship between sludge dewaterability eps components and rheological parameters finally an integrative response surface methodology rsm coupled nonlinear programming nlp approach was constructed to minimize cost of fecl3 lime conditioning and overcome shortcomings of rsm yang et al 2017b because sludge dewatering only requires wc below a threshold value rather than reaching the extreme value 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and coagulants the sludge landfill was located at bailonggang wwtp in shanghai china 31 11 north latitude 121 43 east longitude in landfill process dewatered sludge with wc of 80 produced by bailonggang wwtp and other adjacent wwtps in shanghai were poured into the landfill before closure by polyvinyl chloride geomembrane in 2008 the top area and height of a landfill unit were 21 500 m2 172 m 125 m and 6 m respectively the annual average temperature is 15 5 c with extreme maximum and minimum temperature of 37 9 and 10 8 c in this region the ls sample was taken from one of twelve landfill units fig 1 in july 2018 at the same depth of 2 3 m through six vents by using soil sampler after assembling a floating bridge on the surface of geomembranes and then mixed and homogenized to form a representative sample es sample was obtained from mechanical thickening process in bailonggang wwtp for control fecl3 solution purity of 38 and lime which were commonly used for es dewatering to 60 in bailonggang wwtp were used as sludge conditioner in this study 2 2 batch test for sludge conditioning and dewatering 2 2 1 estimation of proper concentration of ls for dewatering firstly raw ls with wc around 80 was diluted with filtrate from ls dewatering and sifted through a 0 25 mm stainless steel sieve to remove large particles and impurities and then adjusted the concentration to 135 3 g l then the sludge was further diluted to 7 samples of 250 ml at different concentrations of 124 8 115 6 104 0 95 5 84 3 75 2 and 34 0 g l the sifted es with concentration of 34 0 g l was concentrated to 44 8 g l by buchner funnel and diluted to 25 3 g l with filtrate from es dewatering respectively then the steady shear flow of ls and es was determined and fitted by the herschel bulkley model to determine the appropriate concentration for conditioning 2 2 2 effects of fecl3 and lime dosage on sludge dewaterability batch tests of conditioning was conducted to compare dewaterability of ls and es after conditioning by fecl3 and lime after sieving ls and es were adjusted to concentrations of 109 5 and 34 0 g l proper to dewatering respectively two batch tests were conducted for sludge conditioning by adding different dosages of fecl3 27 32 38 44 50 56 and 61 mg g dried solids ds at fixed lime dosage of 100 mg g ds and different dosages of lime 58 70 85 100 115 130 and 142 mg g ds at fecl3 dosage of 44 mg g ds in each test a 250 ml sludge sample was mixed at 250 rpm for 10 min after adding fecl3 solution and then for another 10 min after dosing lime milk mixture was stirred by using a program controlled six paddle stirrer zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china the conditioned sludge samples were carefully collected to analyze specific resistance of filtration srf capillary suction time cst dewatering efficiency rheological behavior and eps components 2 2 3 sludge dewatering efficiency measurements the sludge dewatering efficiency was measured by wc after obtaining sludge cake using an mmp 3 mini filter press afmitech netherlands which was composed of a steel piston filter pressure system and an air compressor sludge was pressed for 6 min under squeezing pressure of 0 8 bar which is equivalent to actual output pressure of 1 6 mpa by mechanical efficiency conversion using action area of push rod wc of sludge cake was determined by a hc103 moisture analyzer mettler toledo switzerland 2 3 integrative rsm nlp approach for cost optimization based on batch results of ls conditioning rsm with central composite design was used to optimize chemical dosages for ls dewatering the two factors with three levels of fecl3 dosage x 1 32 44 and 56 mg g dried solids ds and lime dosage x 2 70 100 and 130 mg g ds were selected and wc of dewatered ls was recognized as the response variable y in total 13 runs were conducted for rsm optimization experimental design and analysis of variance anova were performed for rsm optimization using the design expert 8 0 software based on the data obtained from rsm experiments the relationship between y and the set of factors is usually fitted by a second order polynomial model given in eq 1 1 y b 0 i 1 m b i x i i 1 m b i i x i 2 i 1 m j 1 m b i j x i x j where x i and x j represent the independent factors m is the number of factors b 0 is the constant term b i b ii and b ij are coefficients of the linear quadratic and interaction terms in order to minimize conditioning cost under wc constraints of relevant standards the objective function is established based on sum of costs related to the level of independent factors x i and x j and minimized subject to a series of constraints in the constraints the rsm model of eq 1 was incorporated and d i and f i in the rsm design were set as the minimum and maximum values of x i it is also assumed that y is required to be lower than the threshold value t the cost optimization is an nlp problem because the rsm model is nonlinear therefore the integrative rsm nlp model is constructed and shown in eq 2 2 minimize f i 1 m c x i subject to b 0 i 1 m b i x i i 1 m b i i x i 2 i 1 m j 1 m b i j x i x j t d i x i f i where f is the total cost of all the factors the fmincon function mishra et al 2016 was selected as the main function and objective function and constraints were also constructed to solve the rsm nlp model by matlab r2014a mathworks usa 2 4 rheological test rheological behavior of sludge was measured by a mcr102 rotary rheometer anton paar austria with concentric cylinder system measuring bob and cup as a rotational couette geometry 20 ml sludge sample was filled into the cup at 20 0 0 1 c in the controlled shear rate test a continuous shear ramp test was applied by continuously increasing shear rate from 1 to 1000 s 1 and then decreasing from 1000 back to 1 s 1 in linear manner the herschel bulkley model eq 3 which previously shown to be useful in describing sludge rheology dai et al 2014 was used to fit the rheological data by nonlinear curve fit in origin 9 0 originlab usa 3 τ k γ n τ y where τ and τ y are the shear stress and yield stress pa γ is the shear rate s 1 k is the consistency index pa sn n is the flow behavior index in strain amplitude sweep test strain amplitude was logarithmically varied from 0 01 to 1000 in a sinusoidal manner and the frequency was remained at 1 hz to exploit the linear viscoelastic lve domain and analyze structure feature of sludge 2 5 analytical and calculation methods suspended solids ss and volatile ss vss were measured by weight method at 105 c for 8 h and 600 c for 1 h respectively chinese nepa 2012 concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the filtrate were analyzed according to standard methods chinese nepa 2012 five day biological oxygen demand bod5 of filtrate was measured by a bod trak analyzer hach usa the ph was monitored by an hq30d portable meter hach usa srf of sludge was measured by pressure filtration method niu et al 2013 cst was determined by a portable 304b instrument equipped with an 18 mm diameter funnel triton uk and whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper eps components including slime eps lb eps and tb eps were stratified from the sludge samples by a heat extraction method niu et al 2016 and were analyzed by total organic carbon toc proteins and polysaccharides concentrations of toc were determined by a multi n c 3100 analyzer analyti jena germany proteins and polysaccharides were determined by lowry method and anthrone method niu et al 2016 respectively the pearson s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to accurately study the mechanism of fecl3 and lime on dewaterability through variation of eps contents and rheological characteristics using spss v19 package 3 results and discussion 3 1 ls characterization table 1 shows sludge and filtrate characteristics of ls and es compared to es ls had greatly lower vss ss 0 28 and smaller particle size it was because anaerobic digestion in landfill about 10 yr destructed sludge aggregates and degraded organic matters in sludge ls had higher srf and cst but greatly lower viscosity than es the results suggested that the deteriorated dewaterability of ls was majorly attributed to fine particles rather than viscous substances and was probably easy to improve by conditioning as fine particles could be coagulated long term anaerobic digestion also resulted in integration of flocs and release of intracellular compounds therefore concentrations of cod toc nh4 n tn and tp in ls were 10 6 21 1 45 0 30 9 and 2 4 times of those in es pollutants concentration in the filtrate of ls was in the typical range of landfill leachate of 5 20 yr costa et al 2019 the biodegradability of filtrate of ls was higher bod5 cod of 0 23 than es 0 18 but greatly lower than that of municipal wastewater 0 30 0 80 tchobanoglous et al 2003 3 2 estimation of proper concentration of ls for dewatering by rheological analysis as shown in table 1 ls had higher solid content and distinct sludge property and filtrate characteristics from es therefore comparisons on rheological behaviors of ls and es were conducted by using the steady shear flow to reflect the internal structure deformation and determine proper ss for dewatering fig 2 flow curves in fig 2a and b shows an ascending trend in shear stress with the increasing concentration at the same shear rate for ls or es due to the increased interactions between constituent particles present in sludge which required more energy i e shear stress to keep the sludge fluid in a prescribed motion radhakrishnan et al 2018 on the other hand the hysteresis loop area formed by the up and down flow curves indicated that higher ss concentration resulted in more obvious thixotropic behavior liu et al 2012 especially for es shear stress of es was higher than that of ls at the same concentration and the range of es at 34 0 g l was equivalent to that of ls at 95 5 104 0 g l which was probably attributed to lower organic contents of ls than es flow curves were fitted with the herschel bulkley model to determine an exact concentration range of ls for dewatering in which higher n value and k value indicate higher flowability and apparent viscosity liu et al 2016 xiao et al 2017b respectively sludge conditioning was carried out under flow state therefore rheological parameters n and k were two important factors to characterize sludge for conditioning on the other hand τy is the minimum stress to overcome for irreversible deformation to flow state and is unsuitable to describe mixing in the sludge conditioning process many literatures xiao et al 2017a 2017b usually investigated flowability and consistency of samples by rheological parameters n and k and τ y was not adopted thus only the rheological parameters k and n were used to characterize the sludge in this study fig 2c and d illustrate variations of fitted n and k values all with r2 0 9995 of ls and es at concentrations of 34 0 135 3 and 25 3 44 8 g l respectively the suitable concentration of ss for dewatering to 60 was 34 g l for es which provides a criterion of rheological status n 0 536 k 0 539 pa s n for dewatering of ls the n value of es and ls in fig 2c both decreased monotonously with increasing ss concentration and was equal to the criterion value of 0 536 at 118 6 g l for ls as shown in fig 2d the k value of es and ls both increased with rising ss and was intersected with the criterion line of 0 539 pa s n at 107 2 g l for ls comprehensively considering the viscosity and flowability 107 2 118 6 g l was chosen as suitable range for conditioning of ls which was much higher than that of es 3 3 effects of fecl3 lime dosage on sludge dewaterability and eps components 3 3 1 sludge dewaterability effects of fecl3 and lime dosages on sludge dewaterability by wc of sludge cake srf and cst are illustrated in fig 3 it should be noted that wc of sludge cake pressed by mini filter press is normally 5 lower than that pressed by industrial filter press based on engineering experience and thus wc of 55 was applied as threshold value according to chinese standard of gb t 23485 2009 with fecl3 dosage rising from 27 0 to 60 1 mg g ds wc of sludge cake decreased almost linearly from 78 8 to 47 7 for ls but slowly decreased from 64 7 to 58 3 at fecl3 dosage of 50 0 mg g ds and then increased to 61 2 for es fig 3a like fecl3 effects of lime dosage on wc was more obvious on ls than es with wc decreased almost linearly from 66 5 to 48 3 for ls at dosage of 57 6 142 4 mg g ds fecl3 and lime dosage required for controlling wc of conditioned ls below 55 were 44 and 100 mg g ds which is greatly lower than those of es with fecl3 and lime dosage of 80 and 200 mg g ds as shown in fig 3c f compared to those of es srf and cst values of ls were higher and were more affected by conditioner dosage higher srf and cst indicated worse dewaterability and the results were consistent with wc of sludge cake obtained by mini filter press however srf and cst data of ls were all higher than those of es but wc of sludge cake of ls was lower than that of es at fecl3 dosage and lime dosage above 62 4 and 58 8 mg g ds it was because ls contained more small particles that was difficult to be coagulated by fecl3 and lime and thus supernatant of conditioned sludge was difficult to filtrate by filter paper for srf determination and to permeate through whatman paper for cst nevertheless the supernatant was easy to pass through the industrial grade filter cloth under high pressure of 1 6 mpa low vss ss decreased the water binding capacity liang et al 2015 of ls which confirmed that impact of fecl3 and lime dosage on dewaterability was better reflected by wc of sludge cake rather than srf and cst for sludge with different characteristics as shown in fig 3e and f ph of filtrated of conditioned ls reduced from 6 4 to 3 6 and increased from 8 3 to 11 2 with rising dosage of fecl3 and lime respectively suggesting that ph effects on sludge dewaterability should be considered 3 3 2 eps stratification and components sludge with higher eps content generally results in higher viscosities and poor dewaterability because eps are hydrophilic compounds ruiz hernando et al 2015b fig 4 showed the toc proteins and polysaccharides in different eps layers of ls conditioned with different dosages of fecl3 and lime in ls slime lb and tb eps accounted for 85 3 6 0 and 8 7 in the total eps which is contradictory to conventional es with tb eps as the dominant constituent in eps 60 80 cheng et al 2018 niu et al 2013 it was because long term anaerobic digestion in the sludge landfill stimulated the diffusion of eps from inner layer bound eps to outer layer slime eps ahn et al 2009 which resulted in worse dewaterability of ls than es table 1 the contents of slime and lb eps in conditioned sludge decreased with rising dosages of fecl3 and lime as shown in fig 4a and b slime contents decreased more drastically for fecl3 5 4 mg mol fe3 than lime 0 6 mg mol ca2 the reduced level of lb eps contents for fecl3 1 9 mg mol fe3 was higher than that for lime 0 1 mg mol ca2 as well previous research also found that fe3 exhibited more effective biding affinity to lb eps than ca2 and thus lb eps contents decreased greatly by fe3 coagulation li et al 2012 li and yang 2007 variations of slime and lb eps in conditioned ls was consistent with the trend of dewaterability in fig 3 because ratios of slime tb eps and lb tb eps were extensively accepted indices of sludge dewaterability and filterability niu et al 2016 in fig 4c and e rising dosage of fecl3 declined proteins contents in both slime and lb eps but had insignificant effect on polysaccharides contents contrary to fecl3 lime dosage increment resulted in obvious decrease of polysaccharides contents in both slime and lb eps but was ineffective to proteins contents dai et al 2017 also found that fe3 coagulation on proteins were higher than that on polysaccharides while wang et al 2019 reported that structure of polysaccharides was destructed at alkaline ph after adding lime 3 4 rheological properties of ls with different fecl3 lime dosages 3 4 1 steady shear flow according to flow curves in fig 5 a and b shear stress decreased with the increasing dosage of fecl3 and lime at the same shear rate because non newtonian flow characteristics of sludge were weakened and internal structure was broken under acidic fecl3 or alkaline condition lime wang et al 2017 flow curves in fig 5a and b was fitted by herschel bulkley model to obtain parameter n and k and limiting viscosity μ defined as the asymptote value of viscosity shear rate curve tixier et al 2003 was also calculated to compare rheological behavior of sludge under different fecl3 or lime dosages as showed in fig 5c k value increased firstly and then decreased with the increasing dosage of fecl3 and n value showed the opposite pattern it was because ls was coagulated by fecl3 at dosage below 44 mg g ds and showed worse flowability while the repulsion of fe3 and acidification effect increased flowability of ls at higher dosage decreasing k value and increasing n value in fig 5d with the rising dosage of lime indicated the improvement of flowability due to alkaline hydrolysis which agreed well with the trend of slime eps in fig 4b as shown in fig 5c and d μ values decreased with the increasing dosages of fecl3 and lime μ is considered as a rheological index of sludge corresponding to the maximum dispersion of flocs under the influence of shear rate tixier et al 2003 and its decrease also suggested internal structure was damaged due to acidic or alkaline hydrolysis 3 4 2 dynamic measurement effects of fecl3 and lime dosages on viscoelastic properties of conditioned sludge are shown in fig 6 a and b the elastic modulus g and viscous modulus g reflects the structure strength and deformation energy of sample during the shear process mezger 2011 for all conditioned ls samples the elastic behaviors dominate the viscous ones in the lve range which means the samples exhibiting a certain rigidity the g value of ls 18 1 pa at 109 5 g l were much lower than that of es 16 6 228 9 pa at 80 120 g l which indicated that ls had weaker structure and lower resistance to deformation than es feng et al 2014 g and g both begun to decline when exceeding the lve range indicating the structure of sludge was changed irreversibly as the mixed liquor started to flow the decline rate of g was higher than that of g and eventually viscous behaviors dominated the elastic in non lve range in fig 6a and its enlarged figure to show effects of fecl3 g decreased monotonously with the increasing dosage of fecl3 from lve range to the range exceeding lve strain range of 0 01 9 however for lime effects in fig 6b and its enlarged figure g showed no obvious trend in the lve range strain range of 0 01 3 and then decreased outside the lve range 3 9 the results indicated that fecl3 weakened internal structure and improved flowability of sludge while lime only improved flowability wang et al 2017 also observed that network strength and colloidal forces of floc were weakened as ph decreases which can interpret effects of fecl3 on viscoelastic property in this study high complex modulus g value reflected a strong ability to resist deformation feng et al 2014 in fig 6c g value decreased with the increasing dosage of fecl3 but changed irregularly with the rising dosage of lime which were consistent with variations of g for ls samples in fig 6a and b calcium hydroxide and a small amount of calcium carbonate in lime conditioned ls would aggregate to large particles and form heterogeneous mixture which probably led to the irregular variation of g value 3 5 correlation of rheological behavior with dewaterability and eps the results of correlation coefficients are divided into two groups for fecl3 and lime addition and shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 correlation coefficients highlighted in green indicated the variables had significant relationships in both groups fecl3 and lime dosage both had significant correlation with dewatering indicators wc srf and cst at 0 01 level meanwhile dewatering indicators were all significantly related to each other at 0 01 level which confirmed that conditioning improved dewaterability of ls and three dewatering indicators reliably reflected the similar trend dosages were negatively correlated with both slime and lb eps while dewatering indicators showed positive correlation the results indicated the rising dosages of fecl3 and lime decreased slime and lb eps content and thus improved dewaterability of ls correlation coefficients highlighted in blue in table 2 indicated the variables had significant relationships in fecl3 group but insignificant in lime group the dosage of fecl3 was negatively correlated with proteins of slime and lb eps at 0 01 level and all dewatering indicators and g had positive correlation with proteins of slime and lb eps proteins has a high content of negatively charged amino acids which is more involved than polysaccharides in electrostatic bonds with multivalent cations laspidou and rittmann 2002 and is responsible for aggregation of sludge cells and formation of gel like matrix to maintains cell cohesion dogsa et al 2005 the results illustrated that coagulation and acidification of acidic fecl3 destroyed proteins in slime and lb eps owing to complexation and dissociation of protons on acidic functional groups omoike and chorover 2004 and thus reduced internal structure strength and improved dewaterability the data highlighted in yellow in table 2 indicated the variables had significant correlation in lime group but insignificant in fecl3 group the dosage of lime and n value had negative correlation with polysaccharides of slime and lb eps at 0 05 level while dewatering indicators and k value were positively correlated with polysaccharides of slime and lb eps suggesting that alkaline hydrolysis of polysaccharides in slime and lb eps caused by lime led to decline of flowability and improved dewaterability for ls lime addition created an alkaline condition to reduce content of low molecular weight polysaccharides ruiz hernando et al 2015a which contributes to high water retention thomas et al 2010 and increases sludge viscosity wang et al 2010 and thus improved flowability of ls illustrated as high n value and low k value in fig 5 as mentioned above it could be clarified that fecl3 and lime played distinct roles in ls conditioning from the perspective of rheology and eps improvement of sludge dewaterability was achieved by releasing of bound water owing to decreasing polysaccharides coelho et al 2011 and weakening internal structure caused by decreasing proteins wang et al 2017 correlation analysis showed a novel mechanism of dewaterability improvement in terms of eps components variations through rheological measurement therefore fecl3 lime conditioning can be optimized aiming at sludge with different eps components explanation about changes of eps components supplemented and developed the theory of acidification and skeleton builder during ls conditioning which provided more perspectives for guidance of dewatering and conditioning 3 6 technical economic optimization 3 6 1 conventional

results showed that f value of 71 48 and p value below 0 0001 implied that the quadratic model is significant and the experimental method is reliable predicted values of the fitted model well corresponded to the experimental results with adjusted r2 of 0 9671 indicating the quadratic model is suitable for evaluating wc of sludge cake the low relative deviation of 3 33 verified the applicability of the rsm model anova showed that both fecl3 and lime were the dominant parameter with positive influence on wc p 0 001 and interaction between the two variables was also significant at the 0 05 level the rsm optimized wc value was 46 7 under condition of 56 0 mg fecl3 g ds and 130 0 mg lime g ds the rsm recommended dosages at wc of 55 were 44 8 mg fecl3 g ds and 103 7 mg lime g ds and the experimental wc of 53 6 under the recommended condition validated the quadratic model 3 6 2 rsm nlp optimization the target of conventional rsm optimization was to maximize or minimize values of response variables without regard for treatment costs while the optimization target in environment engineering field usually requires the response variable above or below a threshold value with the lowest cost yang et al 2017b to overcome the shortcomings of rsm the rsm nlp methodology was applied to optimize chemical costs of fecl3 lime conditioning at wc below 55 the costs of fecl3 solution purity of 38 and lime powder were 89 0 and 74 1 ton respectively thus the objective function of cost was constructed for ls with concentration of 109 5 g l and is showed in eq 5 5 min f 0 234 x 1 0 0741 x 2 the constraints were established with y in eq 4 below relevant dewatering standard and x 1 and x 2 limits in the rsm experiment taking wc standard of gb t 23485 2009 as an example the constraint is showed in eq 6 6 s t 210 9 0 78 x 2 3 85 x 1 0 013 x 1 x 2 0 000062 x 2 2 0 0198 x 1 2 55 27 0 x 1 60 9 57 5 x 2 142 4 the rsm nlp optimized condition was obtained by combining objective function of eq 5 and constraints of eq 6 in matlab r2014a table 3 shows the comparison between rsm recommended dosages and rsm nlp optimized condition the rsm nlp optimized dosage consisted of 53 6 mg fecl3 g ds and 57 6 mg lime g ds yielding 4 3 7 4 of cost saving in comparison to the rsm recommended dosages and 26 0 of cost saving in comparison to rsm optimized condition a better way for techno economic optimization of a desirable response is provided by a combination of rsm and nlp under certain circumstances the rsm analysis provides a correlation model between factors and the response which can be utilized as a constraint inequation for nlp optimization the results showed that the rsm nlp integrated approach could optimize fecl3 lime conditioning of ls effectively using few data sets and becomes very attractive for techno economic optimization of systems with multiple influential factors and threshold requirements for response variables yang et al 2017b 4 conclusions this study investigated effects and mechanism of fecl3 lime conditioning on ls dewaterability by analyzing physicochemical characteristics rheological properties and variations of eps components the conclusions can be drawn as follow 1 ls had lower vss ss 0 28 and smaller particle size than es and greatly lower viscosity and high flowability after 10 years landfill long term landfill causes great changes in sludge properties which makes the countermeasures of conditioning and dewatering worthy of further study 2 the suitable concentration of ls for conditioning 107 2 118 6 g l was much higher than that of es 34 g l the data showed that rheological analysis could act as a powerful tool to determine target concentration of sludge with different organic contents for dewatering 3 both fecl3 and lime improved dewaterability of ls and caused decline of slime and lb eps with different mechanisms fecl3 destroyed proteins in slime and lb eps owing to coagulation and acidification effects weakened internal structure strength and thus improved dewaterability lime addition caused alkaline hydrolysis of polysaccharides in slime and lb eps reduced sludge viscosity and improved both flowability and dewaterability for ls 4 optimization by the integrative rsm nlp methodology obtained optimal dosage of 53 6 mg fecl3 g ds and 57 6 mg lime g ds under wc constraint of 55 and achieved 26 0 cost saving in comparison to rsm optimized condition rsm nlp optimization is an effective and powerful approach to minimize cost for systems with multiple influential factors and threshold

18732,in this study enhanced nitrogen removal through in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria was successfully obtained in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp the wwtp was an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process and upgraded by adding moving carriers into the anoxic zone enhanced nitrogen removal was obtained during almost two years of operation the significant nitrogen removal might be associated with the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria on the adding carriers as revealed by the comprehensive results of molecular analysis and 15n stable isotope tracing tests quantitative pcr results indicated that anammox bacteria in the anoxic carrier biofilms presented a higher abundance than flocculent sludge 16s rrna p 0 005 hzsb p 0 042 the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing showed significant differences in the phylum planctomycetes p 0 001 between anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge and metagenomic sequencing analysis further revealed the anammox relative abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly higher than the reported level in the flocculent sludge of conventional wwtps in addition 15n stable isotope tracing tests showed that anammox could be combined with nitrate reduction by the anoxic carrier biofilms thus enriched anammox bacteria might contribute to nitrogen loss and lead to improvements in the nitrogen removal which was also supported by the mass balance analysis of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of the wwtp overall this study suggests that anoxic carrier biofilms might be a candidate to enhance nitrogen removal through partial anammox in municipal wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological nitrogen removal anammox anoxic carrier biofilms low c n ratio metagenomic analysis municipal wastewater 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a promising nitrogen removal process van loosdrecht et al 2014 in this process ammonium is oxidized using nitrite as the electron acceptor to dinitrogen gas under an anoxic condition and no organic carbon source is required kuenen 2008 strous et al 1998 to date anammox technology has been successfully industrialized for treating high ammonia wastewater under moderate conditions lackner et al 2014 the recent focus of anammox technology has moved to applications in mainstream treatments kartal et al 2010 gilbert et al 2014 lotti et al 2014a winkler et al 2012 because anammox exhibits great energy saving potential for municipal wastewater treatment compared with the conventional nitrification denitrification process siegrist et al 2008 from the perspective of nitrogen transformation the sewage anammox process is primarily associated with two different pathways one is anammox combined with partial nitrification ammonia to nitrite gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 poot et al 2016 van dongen et al 2001 wang et al 2014 and the other is anammox combined with the reduction of nitrate nitrate to nitrite castrobarros et al 2017 du et al 2016 kartal et al 2008 ma et al 2017 xie et al 2018 the above pathways involve different processes and provide a variety of possible routes for mainstream applications of anammox agrawal et al 2018 ma et al 2016 moreover different research groups have conducted the important studies investigating the stability of sewage anammox technology including low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 influent composition laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b li et al 2017 and microbial community shifts reino et al 2018 wen et al 2017 these significant progresses strongly support the potential of applying anammox technology to treat low ammonia municipal wastewater although sewage anammox technology has been widely studied the application of anammox in the full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp remains to be fully studied one of the most concerning obstacles is the slow growth rate of anammox bacteria gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 previous studies have reported that anammox bacteria exist universally in traditional full scale municipal wwtps guo et al 2017 nejidat et al 2018 shu et al 2015 tsushima et al 2007 wang et al 2015 however the direct application of anammox technology to wwtps is difficult since anammox bacteria are low in abundance and sensitive to environmental conditions such as high dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon concentrations jetten et al 1998 recent pilot and full scale demonstrations of sewage anammox technology have usually been tested using the inoculation of anammox sludge from a side stream treatment lemaire 2014 lotti et al 2014a and the reduction of influent organic carbon through pretreatment laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b anammox bacteria enrichment under mainstream conditions in the strass wwtp was achieved by bioaugmentation from a side stream to mainstream wett et al 2013 but unstable nitrite oxidizing bacteria activity and nitrogen removal performance have been occasionally reported thus these processes still need more effort before being generalized for the inoculation of anammox in full scale wwtps recent studies have suggested that the anoxic zone might be the hotspot for the occurrence of the anammox reaction since it provides favorable conditions low do and low organic carbon concentrations cao et al 2016 ma et al 2017 shu et al 2015 moreover significant nitrogen loss through anammox has been recently observed in anoxic zone of the singapore changi water reclamation plant cao et al 2016 despite the favorable conditions for anammox in the anoxic zones of wwtps stable anammox has been rarely confirmed in a long term operation it is probably because the sludge retention time srt of a wwtp is generally not sufficient to retain low growth anammox bacteria strous et al 2006 to enhance biomass retention biofilms are regarded as an effective strategy to enrich low growth biomass owing to the long srt ali et al 2015 gu et al 2017 li et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 given these facts it is hypothesized that biofilms in the anoxic zone of a wwtp would enrich anammox bacteria in situ it has great significance for the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria since sewage anammox process would be not limited to biomass inoculation moreover the enrichment of anammox bacteria might contribute to overall nitrogen removal performance in wwtps especially for wastewater with the low influent carbon source the hypothesis of this study is that anoxic biofilms could enhance nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater and the anammox reaction could be involved a retrofitted full scale wwtp integrating an anoxic moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao system was investigated the nitrogen removal performance was monitored for almost two years the abundance distribution and composition of anammox bacteria on anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge were systematically analyzed using quantitative real time pcr qpcr 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic gene sequencing then the relationship between anammox and denitrification was evaluated based on activity batch tests 15n stable isotope tracing tests and mass balance analysis lastly the underlying mechanism of nitrogen removal is elucidated and potential strategies for the optimization of municipal wwtps are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characteristics and operation of the am aao in this study the municipal wwtp located in xi an city northwest of china was investigated it has a current treatment capacity of 25 104 m3 d the classical aao was used as the main treatment process to remove organics and nutrients to improve the removal rate of nutrients an anoxic mbbr fig 1 was built in the anoxic zone rather than oxic zone and carriers gong et al 2012 were added to retain the microorganisms with an approximately 25 filling rate in this study the biosystem was named am aao integrating anoxic moving bed biofilm reactor with anaerobic anoxic oxic system submersible mixers and guide walls were equipped within the anoxic zone to ensure that the carriers and wastewater were in full contact furthermore intercept screens were installed in the outlet of each zone to avoid loss in the suspended carriers sludge recycling and nitrifying liquid reflux ratios were set at 100 and 180 respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt was approximately 10 h including anaerobic conditions for 2 h anoxic conditions for 2 6 h and oxic conditions for 6 4 h the srt was controlled at 14 18 days the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and do in the oxic zone were maintained at 3021 3585 mg l and 1 5 3 4 mg l respectively whereas the temperature was in the range of 10 7 25 2 c 2

chemical oxygen demand cod during 600 days of monitoring nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured using a lachat quikchem 8500 series 2 flow injection analyzer hach company usa moreover the do and temperature were monitored using wtw oxi 340i oxygen probes wtw company germany and the cod and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined using standard methods apha 1998 2 3 mass balance calculations to determine the proportional characteristics of the pollutants during the transformation the mass balances of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed table s1 based on the long term observation of am aao previous study has already reported specific mass balance analysis for activated sludge systems but did not include phosphorus removal barker and dold 1995 based on the above results the effects of phosphorus removal along with oxygen and nitrate denitrifying phosphorus removal were then considered into the mass balance calculation following by the activated sludge model asm henze et al 2000 2 4 microbial activity tests microbial activities denitrification anammox were monitored to the measure nitrogen conversion in oct 2016 a sealed equipment with a working volume of 500 ml equipped with an online monitoring system was placed in a shaking water bath gfl1092 germany at 135 rpm and 30 1 c to ensure the movement of carriers and substrate transfer the online monitoring system was equipped with temperature ph and do sensors wtw oxi 340i germany and a n2o microelectrode for each test the carriers were taken from the anoxic zone and carefully rinsed thrice with milli q water to remove the residual substrate before submerging into the medium 60 carriers l the biomass of anoxic carrier biofilms was 0 0704 0 0083 gvss carrier the minerals and trace element solutions were prepared according to van de graaf et al 1996 anammox activity of the anoxic carrier biofilms was measured using ammonia and nitrite to investigate the co existing denitrification and anammox activity batch tests were also conducted to simulate the anoxic zone fed with ammonia nitrate and sodium acetate dinitrogen injection was stopped until the do concentration reached below 0 03 mg l to establish an anoxic environment for anammox and denitrification the percentage of anammox and denitrification contribution to total nitrogen tn removal were calculated according to du et al 2016 the activity of anammox and denitrifying bacteria were also detected using the 15n isotopic tracing technique wang et al 2012 2015 zhu et al 2011 one anoxic carrier biofilm or 2 ml of flocculent sludge with known biomass was transferred into the 12 ml vials exetainer labco uk then the vials were mixed with high purity dinitrogen 99 999 purged in situ wastewater filtered influent and pre incubated at 25 c for 36 h to deplete the residual nitrate nitrite subsequently 100 μl of nitrogen purged stock solution of each isotopic mixture i 15nh4 99 15n ii 15nh4 14no3 and iii 14nh4 15no3 99

contribution ratio of n2 with anammox and denitrification were calculated according to previous studies thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 wang et al 2015 2 5 qpcr anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge collected on oct 2016 and apr nov and dec 2017 and jan 2018 taken from the anoxic zone were freeze dried using a freeze dryer labconco free zone2 0 usa the biomass collection procedure was repeated three times the genetic material was then extracted using the fast dna spin kits for soil bio 101 vista ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol extracted triplicate dna samples were mixed to create one homogenized single dna sample the concentrations of dna samples were measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 instrument wilmington de usa to determine the variations in the abundance of

majorbio biopharm biotechnology co ltd shanghai china raw sequences were deposited to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi with accession no srp131584 the effective sequences with 41 995 anoxic carrier biofilms and 38 256 flocculent sludge were obtained after removing low quality sequences and chimeras the sequence number of each sample was normalized and the trimmed sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus using 97 identity thresholds by the usearch software program taxonomy was assigned via the rdp classifier using the silva databases these data were analyzed on the free online platform of majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com the richness and diversity of samples were calculated with alpha diversity including shannon simpson ace and chao table s3 based on the community abundance data the hypothesis tests of phylum between anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge were performed by the fisher s exact test for metagenomic sequencing the extracted dna samples apr 2017 were fragmented by sonication to 350 bp then the dna fragments were end polished a tailed and ligated with a full length adaptor for illumina sequencing with further pcr amplification after the construction of library a bioanalyzer system agilent 2100 usa was used to detect the inserted size of library sequencing was performed using an illumina pe150

and viruses which were all extracted from the ncbi nr database version nov 2016 perl scripting language was used to draw the phylogenetic of planctomycetes by novogene institute beijing china functional annotations were performed through blasting the ncbi and the kyoto encyclopedi1a of genes and genomes kegg functional database as described by guo et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nutrient removal in the am aao system the aao integrated with auxiliary anoxic mbbr was used to enhance nutrient removal fig 1 the results of 600 day tests fig 2 and s1 showed that the influent cod tn ammonia and phosphorus were in the ranges of 1 2 7 9 20 3 40 8 mg l and 2 8 20 6 mg l respectively the average removal efficiencies of cod and phosphorus were 97 7 1 1 and 98 0 1 3 during the entire test period and the average tin total inorganic nitrogen concentration of effluent was 6 4 1 4 mg l from day 120 to day 424 fig 2 despite the increase in influent ammonia to 27 2 4 9 mg l since day 400 the effluent tin concentration remained at 8 0 1 5 mg l most biological nutrient removal bnr systems have a poor nitrogen removal efficiency when the wastewater has low c n ratio 5 2 and no carbon source is added for denitrification chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the nitrogen removal efficiency nre was only 61 39 10 71 in a continuous flow bioreactor containing carriers in the anaerobic and anoxic zones under an influent c n ratio of 2 2 leyva díaz et al 2016 the nre was maintained at approximately 65 in a modified aao process with an effluent tin of 13 9 1 27 mg l under an influent c n ratio of 5 1 zhang et al 2017 feng et al 2016 also reported that nre of the hybrid membrane bioreactors with different carriers was lower than 70 when treating sewage with low c n ratios 3 5 in this study the average effluent tin concentration before upgrading was 16 1 2 9 mg l with the nre of 52 6 9 5 fig s2 which was similar to previous reports in contrast the average effluent tin concentration after the upgrade substantially decreased to 7 6 2 0 mg l during the 600 days of experiment fig 2 the addition of carriers to anoxic zones successfully enhanced the nitrogen removal of sewage moreover assuming that the organic carbon source was sufficient the theoretical maximum nre of the aao process should have been 73 7 at the sludge recycle ratio of 100 and the nitrifying liquid reflux ratio of 180 however the tin removal efficiency was higher than the theoretical maximum level with an operational period of 111 days 18 5 of the total test period fig 2 which might be attributed to the enhancement of nitrogen transformation pathway by anoxic carrier biofilms 3 2 microbial community analysis anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge were separately collected and the microbial community structures were analyzed and compared fig 3 proteobacteria accounted for most of the total bacterial sequences in the flocculent sludge fig 3a which corresponds to previous findings that it was the most abundant phylum in all samples from 14 wwtps zhang et al 2012 the microbial community of anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly different containing more chloroflexi bacterioidetes and actinobacteria in the phylum level for the biological nitrogen conversions of wwtps typical key microorganisms including ammonia oxidizing bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrite oxidizing bacteria e g nitrospira and nitrobacter and some denitrifying bacteria e g thauera were observed in this study besides the deep metagenomic sequencing results show a consistent community composition and the corresponding coding genes fig 4 and s3 were further annotated to determine the key functional microorganisms overall functional genes narg nirk nirs norb and nosz in the denitrification reaction were enriched and a relatively low abundance of nitrifying functional genes amoa hao was found fig 4 similar patterns of functional genes were also observed by guo et al 2017 and ye et al 2012 the total denitrification genes in anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly higher than that in flocculent sludge which was probably due to the anoxic carrier biofilms being only in anoxic zone with low dissolved oxygen and organic carbon concentrations the gene nrfa for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium was also detected in anoxic carrier biofilms with higher hits than flocculent sludge moreover anammox bacteria were observed in anoxic carrier biofilms fig 3b as well as the corresponding functional genes hzs and hdh fig 4 anammox bacterial abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms 0 11 was higher than in flocculent sludge 0 04 by the metagenomic sequencing analysis significant differences fisher s exact test p 0 001 of anammox in the phylum level planctomycetes were also found between anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge fig 3a moreover qpcr results obtained from both the 16s rrna and hzsb genes showed that the anammox abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly higher than flocculent sludge 16s rrna p 0 005 hzsb p 0 042 fig 5a and s4 the differences in the anammox bacterial abundance by qpcr might be relevant to different primers wang et al 2012 2017 especially the composition of anammox bacteria in anoxic carrier biofilms was associated with ca brocadia ca scalindua ca jettenia and ca kuenenia fig 3b and s5 the dominance of ca brocadia in this study was consistent with the typical dominated genus detected in anammox based systems under mainstream conditions gilbert et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 especially for treating real municipal wastewater lotti et al 2014b laureni et al 2015 2016 reino et al 2018 in addition microorganisms were attached to the inner layer of biofilms fig s6 and exhibited typical anammox bacterial color and a cauliflower appearance fig s7 egli et al 2003 the metagenomic sequencing results show that the anammox bacteria relative abundance 0 11 in anoxic carrier biofilms within the am aao system is at least ten times higher than previous studies anammox bacteria relative abundance in the flocculent sludge was 0 003 using qpcr wang et al 2015 and 0 01 using metagenomic sequencing guo et al 2017 no anammox bacteria were found in the full scale oxic zone analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish kallistova et al 2014 in this study such a high abundance indicated that anammox bacteria were enriched in the anoxic carrier biofilms of the full scale wwtp 3 3 contribution of anammox to nitrogen transformation the activity of anammox bacteria was investigated through 15n stable isotope tracing tests as well as the specific anammox activity test results of the 15n stable isotope tracing tests showed that anoxic carrier biofilms contributed to nitrogen loss with anammox at a rate of 5 41 μmoln gvss 1 d 1 fig 5 additionally the anammox activity of anoxic carrier biofilms was also evaluated with nitrite and ammonia as the main substrates fig s8 a specific anammox activity of 18 8 mgn l 1 d 1 was observed considering the decrease in ammonium mass balance analysis of the full scale wwtp was conducted to reveal the nitrogen conversion pathway fig 6 generally apart from bacterial assimilation through cell growth n exp and heterotrophic denitrification n dn 1 f snd simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and n2o emission were considered to contribute to the high nitrogen removal in this upgraded wwtp based on the mass balance analysis the snd in oxic zone should have contributed to a nitrogen removal of 53 2 9 2 table s1 however only a small amount of nitrogen loss 8 7 6 0 was observed in the oxic zone fig 6 the significant disparity between the calculated value and the actual observation indicates that the improvement of nitrogen removal in the upgraded system was not caused by snd on the other hand n2o generation could have also led to nitrogen loss during the anoxic denitrification ni and yuan 2015 because of the higher abundance of the norb gene no to n2o in anoxic carrier biofilms 3416 hits than in flocculent sludge 1480 hits n2o emission was quantitively simulated in the anoxic zone fig s9 the results show that the proportion of n2o liquid and gas to nitrogen loss was less than 0 08 and further reduced to 0 02 with an extension in the reaction time meaning that this pathway was trivial for nitrogen removal therefore nitrogen loss in the anoxic zone can be attributed to other nitrogen removal pathways approximately 15 9 of nitrogen loss in mass balance could not be explained using conventional denitrification reactions fig 6 which is very likely due to the anammox reaction according to the experimental results first anammox bacteria were enriched in the anoxic carrier biofilms figs 3 and 5a and had high abundance and activity fig 5b based on the 15n stable isotope tracing tests the contribution of anammox to nitrogen loss accounted for 32 4 within the anoxic carrier biofilms the specific anammox activity measured in the batch tests also showed that the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal accounted for 21 4 5 5 of influent ammonium table s1 these results explain the gap 15 9 of nitrogen loss in the mass balance fig 6 second the results of the carbon balance analysis indicated that the stoichiometric transformation value of nitrate reduction in the anoxic zone was 2 10 0 03 gcod gno3 n table s1 which was lower than the theoretical cod consumption 2 86 gcod gno3 n this supports the hypothesis that anammox bacteria might be partially involved in the nitrogen conversion process based on their characteristic of not needing organic matter strous et al 1998 these results indicate that the anammox in anoxic carrier biofilms might contribute to nitrogen removal and fill the gap of nitrogen loss in the mass balance 3 4 mechanism of anammox reaction in the am aao in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria in the anoxic zone to treat low ammonia wastewater is difficult although the anoxic zone had a certain amount of ammonium 7 4 2 3 mg l in this study the nitrite concentration was below the detection limit 0 1 mg l after nitrification considering that a certain amount of nitrate is being generated from nitrification 7 6 2 0 mg l in this study and then fed to the anoxic zone one possible way for the occurrence of anammox was the nitrite production from nitrate reduction in anoxic zone and then being utilized by anammox bacteria the nitrate to nitrite process could be performed by heterotrophic organisms through denitrification previous studies have shown that stable nitrite production was accomplished through nitrate reduction cao et al 2016 in the conversion of nitrate into dinitrogen by heterotrophic bacteria there is bound to be intermediate product nitrite du et al 2016 revealed that some heterotrophic bacteria possibly played a key role in high nitrite accumulation through nitrate reduction on the other hand some anammox species could produce intermediate nitrite through dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra kartal et al 2008 from thermodynamic calculations low cod n influent ratios favor the dnra transformation over heterotrophic conversions to combine intermediate nitrite with ammonium to yield dinitrogen via anammox castrobarros et al 2017 in this study the key genes narg 6026 hits napa 1361 hits for nitrate to nitrite conversion were observed in the anoxic carrier biofilms showing the potential pathway of nitrate to nitrite conversion for anammox enrichment to investigate the metabolic pathway of nitrite batch tests were conducted to simulate the anoxic zone fed with ammonia nitrate and sodium acetate fig s8 the results showed that nitrite could be derived from nitrate reduction and then utilized by anammox bacteria and this contribution accounted for 43 1 the 15n stable isotope tracing tests further showed anammox could be combined with nitrate reduction within anoxic carrier biofilms leading to partial nitrogen loss fig 5b besides the metagenomic sequencing analysis shows that the abundance of narg in anoxic carrier biofilms was much higher than that in flocculent sludge fig 4 this indicated a higher potential for nitrate reduction in anoxic carrier biofilms than in flocculent sludge which could have promoted anammox widespread potential for nitrate reduction suggests a nitrite loop increases treatment efficiency in the anaerobic community speth et al 2016 also the ability of several heterotrophic organisms to recycle nitrate back to nitrite might be critical for anammox growth enhancing overall nitrogen removal performance in the bioreactor lawson et al 2017 in this study the obtained results corresponded with previous studies that nitrate to nitrite conversion might play a crucial role in the metabolism of anammox based above biofilms in the anoxic zone could indeed enrich anammox bacteria not only anoxic carrier biofilms with low do and long srt favor the growth of anammox bacteria but also nitrate reduction could provide matrix for the gradual enrichment of anammox 3 5 potential engineering implications and further studies for the treatment of municipal wastewater via mbbr most previous studies have focused on the oxic zone because of its high efficiency for organic matter removal and nitrification bassin et al 2012 onnis hayden et al 2011 regmi et al 2011 especially at low temperatures young et al 2017 compared with the oxic zone fewer studies have applied carrier biofilms into the anoxic zone to improve the nitrogen removal of the municipal wwtps with push flow processes heather m phillips et al 2008 kermani et al 2008 leyva díaz et al 2016 and the microbial community composition and function of anoxic carrier biofilms have not been fully understood this study evaluated the nitrogen metabolism in anoxic carrier biofilms during long term system operation and performed a comprehensive analysis of mass balance microbial activity and microbial community these results suggest that the anoxic carrier biofilms positively contributed to nitrogen removal in addition the anaerobic zone has similar environmental conditions e g matrix conditions dissolved oxygen temperature in the future the effect of biofilms in anaerobic zone on nitrogen loss should also not be neglected which this deserves to be illustrated in future studies the systematic study of anammox technology for treating low ammonia wastewater demands an integration of engineering microbiome and modeling insights agrawal et al 2018 although this study illustrates the existence and potential contribution of anammox more studies on possible microbial pathways should be considered including phototrophic nitrite oxidation complete ammonia oxidation comammox to nitrate and their contribution to nitrogen removal kuypers et al 2018 the relationship between the operating parameters and environmental factors in the biosystem on the autotrophic nitrogen removal needs to be further assessed using activated sludge dynamic models e g considering anammox hubaux et al 2015 in addition further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between nitrogen removal and anammox dominant strain under varying environmental parameters e g seasons temperature and influent fluctuation for instance the performance of nitrogen removal in this study was not significantly affected by the temperature fluctuation fig s1 and other potential factors e g metabolic activity growth rate and the shift of microbial community structure deserve further research 4 conclusions this study extensively investigated the anammox occurrence and the enhanced nitrogen removal in an upgraded municipal wwtp consisting of anoxic mbbr and aao system the main conclusions drawn from the long term operational tests of 600 days are as follows in situ enriched anammox bacteria were detected in the anoxic zone and the abundance was significantly higher than the reported values in conventional wwtps the 15n stable isotope tracing tests mass balance and microbial community analysis supported that enriched anammox bacteria in the anoxic carrier biofilms partially contributed to nitrogen removal metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that the abundance of narg indicated a higher potential for nitrate to nitrite conversion in anoxic carrier biofilms than flocculent sludge which could have promoted the growth of anammox bacteria in mainstream processes nitrite as the matrix for anammox growth might come from denitrification or dnra process while it is difficult to produce by nitrification in anoxic zone coupling denitrification with anammox through anoxic carrier biofilms might have great potential for enhanced nitrogen removal in continuous flow municipal wwtps

18732,in this study enhanced nitrogen removal through in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria was successfully obtained in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp the wwtp was an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process and upgraded by adding moving carriers into the anoxic zone enhanced nitrogen removal was obtained during almost two years of operation the significant nitrogen removal might be associated with the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria on the adding carriers as revealed by the comprehensive results of molecular analysis and 15n stable isotope tracing tests quantitative pcr results indicated that anammox bacteria in the anoxic carrier biofilms presented a higher abundance than flocculent sludge 16s rrna p 0 005 hzsb p 0 042 the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing showed significant differences in the phylum planctomycetes p 0 001 between anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge and metagenomic sequencing analysis further revealed the anammox relative abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly higher than the reported level in the flocculent sludge of conventional wwtps in addition 15n stable isotope tracing tests showed that anammox could be combined with nitrate reduction by the anoxic carrier biofilms thus enriched anammox bacteria might contribute to nitrogen loss and lead to improvements in the nitrogen removal which was also supported by the mass balance analysis of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of the wwtp overall this study suggests that anoxic carrier biofilms might be a candidate to enhance nitrogen removal through partial anammox in municipal wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological nitrogen removal anammox anoxic carrier biofilms low c n ratio metagenomic analysis municipal wastewater 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a promising nitrogen removal process van loosdrecht et al 2014 in this process ammonium is oxidized using nitrite as the electron acceptor to dinitrogen gas under an anoxic condition and no organic carbon source is required kuenen 2008 strous et al 1998 to date anammox technology has been successfully industrialized for treating high ammonia wastewater under moderate conditions lackner et al 2014 the recent focus of anammox technology has moved to applications in mainstream treatments kartal et al 2010 gilbert et al 2014 lotti et al 2014a winkler et al 2012 because anammox exhibits great energy saving potential for municipal wastewater treatment compared with the conventional nitrification denitrification process siegrist et al 2008 from the perspective of nitrogen transformation the sewage anammox process is primarily associated with two different pathways one is anammox combined with partial nitrification ammonia to nitrite gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 poot et al 2016 van dongen et al 2001 wang et al 2014 and the other is anammox combined with the reduction of nitrate nitrate to nitrite castrobarros et al 2017 du et al 2016 kartal et al 2008 ma et al 2017 xie et al 2018 the above pathways involve different processes and provide a variety of possible routes for mainstream applications of anammox agrawal et al 2018 ma et al 2016 moreover different research groups have conducted the important studies investigating the stability of sewage anammox technology including low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 influent composition laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b li et al 2017 and microbial community shifts reino et al 2018 wen et al 2017 these significant progresses strongly support the potential of applying anammox technology to treat low ammonia municipal wastewater although sewage anammox technology has been widely studied the application of anammox in the full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp remains to be fully studied one of the most concerning obstacles is the slow growth rate of anammox bacteria gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 previous studies have reported that anammox bacteria exist universally in traditional full scale municipal wwtps guo et al 2017 nejidat et al 2018 shu et al 2015 tsushima et al 2007 wang et al 2015 however the direct application of anammox technology to wwtps is difficult since anammox bacteria are low in abundance and sensitive to environmental conditions such as high dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon concentrations jetten et al 1998 recent pilot and full scale demonstrations of sewage anammox technology have usually been tested using the inoculation of anammox sludge from a side stream treatment lemaire 2014 lotti et al 2014a and the reduction of influent organic carbon through pretreatment laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b anammox bacteria enrichment under mainstream conditions in the strass wwtp was achieved by bioaugmentation from a side stream to mainstream wett et al 2013 but unstable nitrite oxidizing bacteria activity and nitrogen removal performance have been occasionally reported thus these processes still need more effort before being generalized for the inoculation of anammox in full scale wwtps recent studies have suggested that the anoxic zone might be the hotspot for the occurrence of the anammox reaction since it provides favorable conditions low do and low organic carbon concentrations cao et al 2016 ma et al 2017 shu et al 2015 moreover significant nitrogen loss through anammox has been recently observed in anoxic zone of the singapore changi water reclamation plant cao et al 2016 despite the favorable conditions for anammox in the anoxic zones of wwtps stable anammox has been rarely confirmed in a long term operation it is probably because the sludge retention time srt of a wwtp is generally not sufficient to retain low growth anammox bacteria strous et al 2006 to enhance biomass retention biofilms are regarded as an effective strategy to enrich low growth biomass owing to the long srt ali et al 2015 gu et al 2017 li et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 given these facts it is hypothesized that biofilms in the anoxic zone of a wwtp would enrich anammox bacteria in situ it has great significance for the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria since sewage anammox process would be not limited to biomass inoculation moreover the enrichment of anammox bacteria might contribute to overall nitrogen removal performance in wwtps especially for wastewater with the low influent carbon source the hypothesis of this study is that anoxic biofilms could enhance nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater and the anammox reaction could be involved a retrofitted full scale wwtp integrating an anoxic moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with an anaerobic anoxic oxic aao system was investigated the nitrogen removal performance was monitored for almost two years the abundance distribution and composition of anammox bacteria on anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge were systematically analyzed using quantitative real time pcr qpcr 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenomic gene sequencing then the relationship between anammox and denitrification was evaluated based on activity batch tests 15n stable isotope tracing tests and mass balance analysis lastly the underlying mechanism of nitrogen removal is elucidated and potential strategies for the optimization of municipal wwtps are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characteristics and operation of the am aao in this study the municipal wwtp located in xi an city northwest of china was investigated it has a current treatment capacity of 25 104 m3 d the classical aao was used as the main treatment process to remove organics and nutrients to improve the removal rate of nutrients an anoxic mbbr fig 1 was built in the anoxic zone rather than oxic zone and carriers gong et al 2012 were added to retain the microorganisms with an approximately 25 filling rate in this study the biosystem was named am aao integrating anoxic moving bed biofilm reactor with anaerobic anoxic oxic system submersible mixers and guide walls were equipped within the anoxic zone to ensure that the carriers and wastewater were in full contact furthermore intercept screens were installed in the outlet of each zone to avoid loss in the suspended carriers sludge recycling and nitrifying liquid reflux ratios were set at 100 and 180 respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt was approximately 10 h including anaerobic conditions for 2 h anoxic conditions for 2 6 h and oxic conditions for 6 4 h the srt was controlled at 14 18 days the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and do in the oxic zone were maintained at 3021 3585 mg l and 1 5 3 4 mg l respectively whereas the temperature was in the range of 10 7 25 2 c 2

chemical oxygen demand cod during 600 days of monitoring nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured using a lachat quikchem 8500 series 2 flow injection analyzer hach company usa moreover the do and temperature were monitored using wtw oxi 340i oxygen probes wtw company germany and the cod and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined using standard methods apha 1998 2 3 mass balance calculations to determine the proportional characteristics of the pollutants during the transformation the mass balances of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed table s1 based on the long term observation of am aao previous study has already reported specific mass balance analysis for activated sludge systems but did not include phosphorus removal barker and dold 1995 based on the above results the effects of phosphorus removal along with oxygen and nitrate denitrifying phosphorus removal were then considered into the mass balance calculation following by the activated sludge model asm henze et al 2000 2 4 microbial activity tests microbial activities denitrification anammox were monitored to the measure nitrogen conversion in oct 2016 a sealed equipment with a working volume of 500 ml equipped with an online monitoring system was placed in a shaking water bath gfl1092 germany at 135 rpm and 30 1 c to ensure the movement of carriers and substrate transfer the online monitoring system was equipped with temperature ph and do sensors wtw oxi 340i germany and a n2o microelectrode for each test the carriers were taken from the anoxic zone and carefully rinsed thrice with milli q water to remove the residual substrate before submerging into the medium 60 carriers l the biomass of anoxic carrier biofilms was 0 0704 0 0083 gvss carrier the minerals and trace element solutions were prepared according to van de graaf et al 1996 anammox activity of the anoxic carrier biofilms was measured using ammonia and nitrite to investigate the co existing denitrification and anammox activity batch tests were also conducted to simulate the anoxic zone fed with ammonia nitrate and sodium acetate dinitrogen injection was stopped until the do concentration reached below 0 03 mg l to establish an anoxic environment for anammox and denitrification the percentage of anammox and denitrification contribution to total nitrogen tn removal were calculated according to du et al 2016 the activity of anammox and denitrifying bacteria were also detected using the 15n isotopic tracing technique wang et al 2012 2015 zhu et al 2011 one anoxic carrier biofilm or 2 ml of flocculent sludge with known biomass was transferred into the 12 ml vials exetainer labco uk then the vials were mixed with high purity dinitrogen 99 999 purged in situ wastewater filtered influent and pre incubated at 25 c for 36 h to deplete the residual nitrate nitrite subsequently 100 μl of nitrogen purged stock solution of each isotopic mixture i 15nh4 99 15n ii 15nh4 14no3 and iii 14nh4 15no3 99 15n cambridge isotope laboratories inc usa was injected to reach a final concentration of 15 mgn l incubation of the samples at 25 c was interrupted at points 0 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h 12 h and 24 h by injecting 200 μl of 7 m zncl2 solution to stop the microbial activity the produced 29n2 and 30n2 were measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometers 253 plus thermo germany the rate and the contribution ratio of n2 with anammox and denitrification were calculated according to previous studies thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 wang et al 2015 2 5 qpcr anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge collected on oct 2016 and apr nov and dec 2017 and jan 2018 taken from the anoxic zone were freeze dried using a freeze dryer labconco free zone2 0 usa the biomass collection procedure was repeated three times the genetic material was then extracted using the fast dna spin kits for soil bio 101 vista ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol extracted triplicate dna samples were mixed to create one homogenized single dna sample the concentrations of dna samples were measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 instrument wilmington de usa to determine the variations in the abundance of

at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 45 s and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min sequencing of amplicons from all the samples was conducted on the illumina miseq pe300 platform by shanghai majorbio biopharm biotechnology co ltd shanghai china raw sequences were deposited to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi with accession no srp131584 the effective sequences with 41 995 anoxic carrier biofilms and 38 256 flocculent sludge were obtained after removing low quality sequences and chimeras the sequence number of each sample was normalized and the trimmed sequences

analyzed on the free online platform of majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com the richness and diversity of samples were calculated with alpha diversity including shannon simpson ace and chao table s3 based on the community abundance data the hypothesis tests of phylum between anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge were performed by the fisher s exact test for metagenomic sequencing the extracted dna samples apr 2017 were fragmented by sonication to 350 bp then the dna fragments were end polished a tailed and ligated with a full length adaptor for illumina sequencing with further pcr amplification after the construction of library a bioanalyzer system agilent 2100 usa was used to detect the inserted size of library sequencing was performed using an illumina pe150

functional annotations were performed through blasting the ncbi and the kyoto encyclopedi1a of genes and genomes kegg functional database as described by guo et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nutrient removal in the am aao system the aao integrated with auxiliary anoxic mbbr was used to enhance nutrient removal fig 1 the results of 600 day tests fig 2 and s1 showed that the influent cod tn ammonia and phosphorus were in the ranges of 1 2 7 9 20 3 40 8 mg l and 2 8 20 6 mg l respectively the average removal efficiencies of cod and phosphorus were 97 7 1 1 and 98 0 1 3 during the entire test period and the average tin total inorganic nitrogen concentration of effluent was 6 4 1 4 mg l from day 120 to day 424 fig 2 despite the increase in influent ammonia to 27 2 4 9 mg l since day 400 the effluent tin concentration remained at 8 0 1 5 mg l most biological nutrient removal bnr systems have a poor nitrogen removal efficiency when the wastewater has low c n ratio 5 2 and no carbon source is added for denitrification chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the nitrogen removal efficiency nre was only 61 39 10 71 in a continuous flow bioreactor containing carriers in the anaerobic and anoxic zones under an influent c n ratio of 2 2 leyva díaz et al 2016 the nre was maintained at approximately 65 in a modified aao process with an effluent tin of 13 9 1 27 mg l under an influent c n ratio of 5 1 zhang et al 2017 feng et al 2016 also reported that nre of the hybrid membrane bioreactors with different carriers was lower than 70 when treating sewage with low c n ratios 3 5 in this study the average effluent tin concentration before upgrading was 16 1 2 9 mg l with the nre of 52 6 9 5 fig s2 which was similar to previous reports in contrast the average effluent tin concentration after the upgrade substantially decreased to 7 6 2 0 mg l during the 600 days of experiment fig 2 the addition of carriers to anoxic zones successfully enhanced the nitrogen removal of sewage moreover assuming that the organic carbon source was sufficient the theoretical maximum nre of the aao process should have been 73 7 at the sludge recycle ratio of 100 and the nitrifying liquid reflux ratio of 180 however the tin removal efficiency was higher than the theoretical maximum level with an operational period of 111 days 18 5 of the total test period fig 2 which might be attributed to the enhancement of nitrogen transformation pathway by anoxic carrier biofilms 3 2 microbial community analysis anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge were separately collected and the microbial community structures were analyzed and compared fig 3 proteobacteria accounted for most of the total bacterial sequences in the flocculent sludge fig 3a which corresponds to previous findings that it was the most abundant phylum in all samples from 14 wwtps zhang et al 2012 the microbial community of anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly different containing more chloroflexi bacterioidetes and actinobacteria in the phylum level for the biological nitrogen conversions of wwtps typical key microorganisms including ammonia oxidizing bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrite oxidizing bacteria e g nitrospira and nitrobacter and some denitrifying bacteria e g thauera were observed in this study besides the deep metagenomic sequencing results show a consistent community composition and the corresponding coding genes fig 4 and s3 were further annotated to determine the key functional microorganisms overall functional genes narg nirk nirs norb and nosz in the denitrification reaction were enriched and a relatively low abundance of nitrifying functional genes amoa hao was found fig 4 similar patterns of functional genes were also observed by guo et al 2017 and ye et al 2012 the total denitrification genes in anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly higher than that in flocculent sludge which was probably due to the anoxic carrier biofilms being only in anoxic zone with low dissolved oxygen and organic carbon concentrations the gene nrfa for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium was also detected in anoxic carrier biofilms with higher hits than flocculent sludge moreover anammox bacteria were observed in anoxic carrier biofilms fig 3b as well as the corresponding functional genes hzs and hdh fig 4 anammox bacterial abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms 0 11 was higher than in flocculent sludge 0 04 by the metagenomic sequencing analysis significant differences fisher s exact test p 0 001 of anammox in the phylum level planctomycetes were also found between anoxic carrier biofilms and flocculent sludge fig 3a moreover qpcr results obtained from both the 16s rrna and hzsb genes showed that the anammox abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms was significantly higher than flocculent sludge 16s rrna p 0 005 hzsb p 0 042 fig 5a and s4 the differences in the anammox bacterial abundance by qpcr might be relevant to different primers wang et al 2012 2017 especially the composition of anammox bacteria in anoxic carrier biofilms was associated with ca brocadia ca scalindua ca jettenia and ca kuenenia fig 3b and s5 the dominance of ca brocadia in this study was consistent with the typical dominated genus detected in anammox based systems under mainstream conditions gilbert et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 especially for treating real municipal wastewater lotti et al 2014b laureni et al 2015 2016 reino et al 2018 in addition microorganisms were attached to the inner layer of biofilms fig s6 and exhibited typical anammox bacterial color and a cauliflower appearance fig s7 egli et al 2003 the metagenomic sequencing results show that the anammox bacteria relative abundance 0 11 in anoxic carrier biofilms within the am aao system is at least ten times higher than previous studies anammox bacteria relative abundance in the flocculent sludge was 0 003 using qpcr wang et al 2015 and 0 01 using metagenomic sequencing guo et al 2017 no anammox bacteria were found in the full scale oxic zone analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish kallistova et al 2014 in this study such a high abundance indicated that anammox bacteria were enriched in the anoxic carrier biofilms of the full scale wwtp 3 3 contribution of anammox to nitrogen transformation the activity of anammox bacteria was investigated through 15n stable isotope tracing tests as well as the specific anammox activity test results of the 15n stable isotope tracing tests showed that anoxic carrier biofilms contributed to nitrogen loss with anammox at a rate of 5 41 μmoln gvss 1 d 1 fig 5 additionally the anammox activity of anoxic carrier biofilms was also evaluated with nitrite and ammonia as the main substrates fig s8 a specific anammox activity of 18 8 mgn l 1 d 1 was observed considering the decrease in ammonium mass balance analysis of the full scale wwtp was conducted to reveal the nitrogen conversion pathway fig 6 generally apart from bacterial assimilation through cell growth n exp and heterotrophic denitrification n dn 1 f snd simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and n2o emission were considered to contribute to the high nitrogen removal in this upgraded wwtp based on the mass balance analysis the snd in oxic zone should have contributed to a nitrogen removal of 53 2 9 2 table s1 however only a small amount of nitrogen loss 8 7 6 0 was observed in the oxic zone fig 6 the significant disparity between the calculated value and the actual observation indicates that the improvement of nitrogen removal in the upgraded system was not caused by snd on the other hand n2o generation could have also led to nitrogen loss during the anoxic denitrification ni and yuan 2015 because of the higher abundance of the norb gene no to n2o in anoxic carrier biofilms 3416 hits than in flocculent sludge 1480 hits n2o emission was quantitively simulated in the anoxic zone fig s9 the results show that the proportion of n2o liquid and gas to nitrogen loss was less than 0 08 and further reduced to 0 02 with an extension in the reaction time meaning that this pathway was trivial for nitrogen removal therefore nitrogen loss in the anoxic zone can be attributed to other nitrogen removal pathways approximately 15 9 of nitrogen loss in mass balance could not be explained using conventional denitrification reactions fig 6 which is very likely due to the anammox reaction according to the experimental results first anammox bacteria were enriched in the anoxic carrier biofilms figs 3 and 5a and had high abundance and activity fig 5b based on the 15n stable isotope tracing tests the contribution of anammox to nitrogen loss accounted for 32 4 within the anoxic carrier biofilms the specific anammox activity measured in the batch tests also showed that the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal accounted for 21 4 5 5 of influent ammonium table s1 these results explain the gap 15 9 of nitrogen loss in the mass balance fig 6 second the results of the carbon balance analysis indicated that the stoichiometric transformation value of nitrate reduction in the anoxic zone was 2 10 0 03 gcod gno3 n table s1 which was lower than the theoretical cod consumption 2 86 gcod gno3 n this supports the hypothesis that anammox bacteria might be partially involved in the nitrogen conversion process based on their characteristic of not needing organic matter strous et al 1998 these results indicate that the anammox in anoxic carrier biofilms might contribute to nitrogen removal and fill the gap of nitrogen loss in the mass balance 3 4 mechanism of anammox reaction in the am aao in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria in the anoxic zone to treat low ammonia wastewater is difficult although the anoxic zone had a certain amount of ammonium 7 4 2 3 mg l in this study the nitrite concentration was below the detection limit 0 1 mg l after nitrification considering that a certain amount of nitrate is being generated from nitrification 7 6 2 0 mg l in this study and then fed to the anoxic zone one possible way for the occurrence of anammox was the nitrite production from nitrate reduction in anoxic zone and then being utilized by anammox bacteria the nitrate to nitrite process could be performed by heterotrophic organisms through denitrification previous studies have shown that stable nitrite production was accomplished through nitrate reduction cao et al 2016 in the conversion of nitrate into dinitrogen by heterotrophic bacteria there is bound to be intermediate product nitrite du et al 2016 revealed that some heterotrophic bacteria possibly played a key role in high nitrite accumulation through nitrate reduction on the other hand some anammox species could produce intermediate nitrite through dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra kartal et al 2008 from thermodynamic calculations low cod n influent ratios favor the dnra transformation over heterotrophic conversions to combine intermediate nitrite with ammonium to yield dinitrogen via anammox castrobarros et al 2017 in this study the key genes narg 6026 hits napa 1361 hits for nitrate to nitrite conversion were observed in the anoxic carrier biofilms showing the potential pathway of nitrate to nitrite conversion for anammox enrichment to investigate the metabolic pathway of nitrite batch tests were conducted to simulate the anoxic zone fed with ammonia nitrate and sodium acetate fig s8 the results showed that nitrite could be derived from nitrate reduction and then utilized by anammox bacteria and this contribution accounted for 43 1 the 15n stable isotope tracing tests further showed anammox could be combined with nitrate reduction within anoxic carrier biofilms leading to partial nitrogen loss fig 5b besides the metagenomic sequencing analysis shows that the abundance of narg in anoxic carrier biofilms was much higher than that in flocculent sludge fig 4 this indicated a higher potential for nitrate reduction in anoxic carrier biofilms than in flocculent sludge which could have promoted anammox widespread potential for nitrate reduction suggests a nitrite loop increases treatment efficiency in the anaerobic community speth et al 2016 also the ability of several heterotrophic organisms to recycle nitrate back to nitrite might be critical for anammox growth enhancing overall nitrogen removal performance in the bioreactor lawson et al 2017 in this study the obtained results corresponded with previous studies that nitrate to nitrite conversion might play a crucial role in the metabolism of anammox based above biofilms in the anoxic zone could indeed enrich anammox bacteria not only anoxic carrier biofilms with low do and long srt favor the growth of anammox bacteria but also nitrate reduction could provide matrix for the gradual enrichment of anammox 3 5 potential engineering implications and further studies for the treatment of municipal wastewater via mbbr most previous studies have focused on the oxic zone because of its high efficiency for organic matter removal and nitrification bassin et al 2012 onnis hayden et al 2011 regmi et al 2011 especially at low temperatures young et al 2017 compared with the oxic zone fewer studies have applied carrier biofilms into the anoxic zone to improve the nitrogen removal of the municipal wwtps with push flow processes heather m phillips et al 2008 kermani et al 2008 leyva díaz et al 2016 and the microbial community composition and function of anoxic carrier biofilms have not been fully understood this study evaluated the nitrogen metabolism in anoxic carrier biofilms during long term system operation and performed a comprehensive analysis of mass balance microbial activity and microbial community these results suggest that the anoxic carrier biofilms positively contributed to nitrogen removal in addition the anaerobic zone has similar environmental conditions e g matrix conditions dissolved oxygen temperature in the future the effect of biofilms in anaerobic zone on nitrogen loss should also not be neglected which this deserves to be illustrated in future studies the systematic study of anammox technology for treating low ammonia wastewater demands an integration of engineering microbiome and modeling insights agrawal et al 2018 although this study illustrates the existence and potential contribution of anammox more studies on possible microbial pathways should be considered including phototrophic nitrite oxidation complete ammonia oxidation comammox to nitrate and their contribution to nitrogen removal kuypers et al 2018 the relationship between the operating parameters and environmental factors in the biosystem on the autotrophic nitrogen removal needs to be further assessed using activated sludge dynamic models e g considering anammox hubaux et al 2015 in addition further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between nitrogen removal and anammox dominant strain under varying environmental parameters e g seasons temperature and influent fluctuation for instance the performance of nitrogen removal in this study was not significantly affected by the temperature fluctuation fig s1 and other potential factors e g metabolic activity growth rate and the shift of microbial community structure deserve further research 4 conclusions this study extensively investigated the anammox occurrence and the enhanced nitrogen removal in an upgraded municipal wwtp consisting of anoxic mbbr and aao system the main conclusions drawn from the long term operational tests of 600 days are as follows in situ enriched anammox bacteria were detected in the anoxic zone and the abundance was significantly higher than the reported values in conventional wwtps the 15n stable isotope tracing tests mass balance and microbial community analysis supported that enriched anammox bacteria in the anoxic carrier biofilms partially contributed to nitrogen removal metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that the abundance of narg indicated a higher potential for nitrate to nitrite conversion in anoxic carrier biofilms than flocculent sludge which could have promoted the growth of anammox bacteria in mainstream processes nitrite as the matrix for anammox growth might come from denitrification or dnra process while it is difficult to produce by nitrification in anoxic zone coupling denitrification with anammox through anoxic carrier biofilms might have great potential for enhanced nitrogen removal in continuous flow municipal wwtps

18733,pre chlorination and uv disinfection are two common processes in drinking water treatment plants sulfamethoxazole smx an antibiotic widely detected in source water was selected as a precursor to study the conversion of chlorine nitrogen species and dbp formation in pre chlorination post uv process the combined chlorine mainly organic chloramines produced in pre chlorination of smx can self degrade and release free chlorine back again as pre chlorination time goes on with free chlorine dose increasing the self degradation rate of combined chlorine increased obviously but the combined chlorine stopped self degrading and remained stable around 1 mg cl2 l after adding 0 30 mm chlorine for 30 min post uv treatment after pre chlorination can enhance the degradation and achieve a complete removal of combined chlorine including organic chloramines deamination occurred during pre chlorination post uv process and deamination amount nh2 per smx concentration was 0 19 m m radicals in this process had no obvious influence on chlorine nitrogen species conversion direct chlorination of smx had the lowest dbp formation potentials while the application of pre chlorination and uv enhanced them compared with uv treatment only dichloroacetonitrile formation potential of smx reduced by 1 58 10 3 mol mol smx 17 37 μg l after pre chlorination post uv treatment during pre chlorination post uv final chlorination treatment of smx br and natural organic matter can enhance dbp formation and toxicity weighted values acid conditions showed a very high dbp risk while alkaline conditions could cut this risk obviously especially for the toxicity weighted values of these dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfamethoxazole smx pre chlorination uv irradiation organic chloramines disinfection by products dbps 1 introduction dissolved organic nitrogen don widely exists in drinking water sources and its presence can lead to the formation of highly toxic nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and nitrosamines nams during the chlor am ination process in drinking water treatment shah and mitch 2012 krasner et al 2013 among these dons many compounds contain amino groups nh2 or nh such as amino acids amides amines etc the h on amino groups can be easily substituted by cl during chlor am ination producing a kind of chlorinated derivatives which is named as organic chloramines e g r nhcl r ncl2 etc how et al 2016 2017 as an intermediate product the formed organic chloramines may be subsequently transformed into hans or hnms through the dechlorination or oxidation process during the further chlor am ination as follows joo and mitch 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 shah and mitch 2012 zhang et

hnms are adverse products during drinking water treatment for organic chloramines some of them have been proved to have cytotoxicity and genotoxicity how et al 2016 2017 and some even remain quite stable during drinking water treatment and distribution processes zhang et al 2015a how et al 2017 yu and reckhow 2017 another adverse effect of organic chloramines on drinking water security is to interfere with the measurement of total effective chlorine after chlor am ination previous studies have proved that organic chloramines have no or very weak oxidizing ability and cannot be distinguished from inorganic chloramines nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 by the traditional dpd method lee et al 2007 black and veatch corporation 2010 how et al 2017 therefore the existence of organic chloramines will lead to the overestimation of total effective chlorine and a high risk of microorganism re growth during the drinking water distribution donnermair et al 2003 zhang et al 2015a while for the further products hans and hnms their high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity have always been the hot issue in the researching field of drinking water disinfection plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 bond et al 2015 considering the transformation relationship from organic chloramines to hans and hnms eq 2 and 3 it is very necessary to investigate their conversion rules during different drinking water treatment processes and explore some effective methods to control these two adverse products organic chloramines and n dbps together pre chlorination has become a common oxidation method in many drinking water treatment plants for controlling algae growth enhancing coagulation flocculation and degrading some pollutants etc ma et al 2012 qi et al 2016a b but considering the existence of don that contains amino groups combined chlorine especially organic chloramines can be easily produced in pre chlorination which will greatly weaken the efficiency of pre chlorination and bring many other negative effects that mentioned above besides in order to reduce the risk of microbial pathogens such as cryptosporidium and regulated dbps ultraviolet uv disinfection has been widely applied before the post chlorination process in drinking water treatment plants plewa et al 2012 dotson et al 2012 deng et al 2014 the combination of pre chlorination and uv disinfection to form uv chlorine advanced oxidation process which can accelerate pollutant removal has also become a hot issue in the current research field of drinking water disinfection zhang et al 2018a 2019 guo et al 2018 however the conversion of combined chlorine especially organic chloramines and further transformation to other highly toxic n dbps during the pre chlorination post uv treatment process is not very clear yet sulfamethoxazole smx is a kind of sulfonamide antibiotics often used to treat human diseases or added to feedstuff to promote livestock growth zhang et al 2015b cui et al 2016 based on previous reports this antibiotic smx has been widely detected in different surface water or even source water with concentrations ranging from dozens to hundreds of ng l luo et al 2011 jiang et al 2011 carvalho and santos 2016 cui et al 2018 from the chemical structure smx is a kind of amine organics and should be a typical precursor of organic chloramines during pre chlorination therefore smx is selected as a target precursor in this work to investigate the conversion of different chlorine and nitrogen species and the subsequent formation of final dbps especially n dbps during the pre chloriantion post uv treatment in addition the results can also provide some references for the removal of antibiotics and risk control of highly toxic dbps during drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all reagents in this study were analytical grade at least smx 98 0 bp grade and naclo solution 7 5 were obtained from sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china dpd sulfate 99 0 tert butyl alcohol tba 99 5 ki 99 99 and kio3 99 8 were purchased from aladdin co ltd shanghai china nh4cl 99 5 kh2po4 99 5 na2hpo4 99 0 kbr 99 0 naoh 98 0 h2so4 95 98 na2s2o3 99 0 and

acid fa were purchased from the international humic substances society ihss and used as typical natural organic matter nom in this study raw water rw sample was collected from taipu river in shanghai china after filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes anpel shanghai china the rw sample was stored at 4 c in dark before experiments its quality parameters were shown in table s1 the dbp standard solutions epa 551a and 551b were obtained from sigma aldrich usa free chlorine solution was prepared by directly diluting the naclo stock solution nh2cl solution was freshly prepared by adding naclo solution into nh4cl solution dropwise with a cl2 n molar ratio of 0 8 at ph 8 5 and then stirring rapidly for 0 5 1 h all solutions in experiments were prepared by ultra pure water produced from a milli q water filtration system usa 2 2 experimental procedures to investigate the conversion of different chlorine species during pre chlorination of smx 0 1 mm smx solution 200 ml was chlorinated with different free chlorine dose 0 05 0 1 and 0 3 mm at ph 7 0 10 mm phosphate buffer at pre determined intervals 20 ml of treated samples was extracted for total and free chlorine measurement according to previous studies when the molar ratio of free chlorine amine precursor 1 combined chlorine would be produced in which inorganic chloramines nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 were almost negligible while organic chloramines were dominant donnermair and blatchley iii 2003 weng et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b therefore in order to study the conversion of organic chloramines during uv irradiation 0 1 mm smx solution 200 ml was pre chlorinated with 0 05 mm free chlorine at ph 7 0 for 10 min to avoid inorganic chloramines as much as possible after that the prepared combined chlorine solution organic chloramines in dominant was exposed to 254 nm uv irradiation with different uv intensity 115 268 and 420 μw cm2 likewise at the pre determined intervals 20 ml of irradiated samples was extracted for total and free chlorine measurement here the calculated combined chlorine total chlorine free chlorine could reflect the trend of organic chloramines during uv treatment the uv system schematic equipped with a low pressure hg uv lamp 254 nm phillips is shown in fig s1 and the uv irradiation intensity was measured by a uv intensity radiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university beijing china before the uv exposure experiments the irradiation intensity could be adjusted via the elevator raised or lowered fig s1 considering the coexistence of free and combined chlorine during the post uv irradiation radicals such as oh cl nh2 etc might be produced chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 in order to explore the role of these potential radicals on organic chloramine conversion a radical quencher tba 0 1 mm was added during the post uv treatment of prepared organic chloramines by smx pre chlorination for comparing the difference of free and total chlorine with and without tba besides during the post uv treatment of prepared organic chloramine solution the treated samples with and without tba were also extracted and quenched by na2s2o3 for analyzing the variation of nitrogen species including total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonia nh3 n nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and don in dbp formation experiments five different treatment situations were considered in this work including dbp formation potential dbpfp study in direct final chlorination pre uv final chlorination pre chlorination post uv final chlorination with and without tba and direct dbp yield detection in pre chlorination post uv treatment in experiments of impact factors 5 μm of br and 3 00 mg c l doc value of ha fa and rw its initial doc was 3 32 mg c l and diluted to 3 00 mg c l were added to the prepared smx solutions and phs were buffered using 10 mm phosphate solution the initial smx concentration was 0 1 mm uv dose was 482 mj cm2 268 μw cm2 30 min chlorine doses in pre and final chlorination were 0 05 and 1 mm respectively pre and final chlorination time were 10 min and 72 h respectively tba addition after pre chlorination was 0 1 mm all the solutions were adjusted to ph 7 0 except for ph impact factor experiments with 10 mm phosphate buffer and samples were stored at 25 c in dark after the reaction 10 ml of treated samples was quenched by ascorbic acid ascorbic acid free chlorine 1 2 mol mol and then added with 2 ml of mtbe for liquid liquid extraction violently shaken for 4 min and then rest for 4 min finally 1 ml of organic phase was taken for dbp analysis dbpfps were expressed using molar dbp yields per molar smx mol mol smx in this study in order to better reflect the dbp formation ability of the precursor 2 3 analytical methods total and free chlorine concentrations were detected by dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 combined chlorine was calculated by total chlorine minus free chlorine tdn value was measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan nh3 n was detected by the salicylic acid hypochlorous acid salt colorimetric method hach co usa concentrations of no2 no3 and br were detected using an ion chromatography dionex ics 2000 usa considering the samples in this study are smx solution and dissolved inorganic nitrogen in tdn is much less than 0 6 mg n mg n the don value here can be calculated by subtracting nh3 n no2 and no3 from tdn lee and westerhoff 2005 molar absorptivity was analyzed using a 1 cm quartz cell with the wavelength ranging from 200 to 300 nm dbp concentrations were detected based on usepa 551 1 usepa 1995 using a gas chromatograph with an electronic capture detector gc 2010 shimadzu japan and an hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm j w usa the injector and detector temperature was set as 200 and 290 c respectively the flow rate of nitrogen carrier gas was 17 1 ml min the temperature program was as follows hold at 37 c for 10 min raised to 50 c with 5 c min and kept for 5 min then raised to 260 c with 30 c and kept for 10 min based on previous literatures the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of each dbp were calculated by dividing its measured concentration by the corresponding lc50 value and the 50 tail dna value or midpoint of the dna tail moment value respectively wagner and plewa 2017 furst et al 2018 the corresponding cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values of each detected dbp were shown in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 conversion of chlorine species in pre chlorination of smx smx is a potential precursor of organic chloramines in chlorination due to its special chemical structure containing nh2 group but the organic chloramine formation and conversion in chlorination of smx are not very clear yet in order to analyze the conversion mechanisms of chlorine and nitrogen species more clearly smx was chosen as a typical representative of broad amino nitrogen organics and a higher initial concentration 0 1 mm was used in this study wang et al 2019 fig 1 a c shows the variation of different chlorine species in chlorination of smx with different free chlorine doses although the organic chloramine concentration cannot be directly detected by dpd method it can be well represented by the combined chlorine concentration here because organic chloramines should be dominant in combined chlorine combined chlorine inorganic chloramines organic chloramines when the molar ratio of free chlorine amine precursor is less than 1 0 donnermair and blatchley iii 2003 weng et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b when 0 1 mm smx was chlorinated by 0 05 mm free chlorine fig 1 a 1 87 mg cl2 l combined chlorine was produced within the initial 10 min then as the chlorination time went on the formed combined chlorine showed a slight decrease while free chlorine increased after 20 min this indicated that smx could fast consume free chlorine to generate organic chloramines which could release some free chlorine again through self degradation with the free chlorine dose increasing to 0 1 mm fig 1 b the yield of combined chlorine within 10 min increased to 3 91 mg cl2 l and more free chlorine was released back to solution during the organic chloramines self degradation however with the free chlorine dose further increasing to 3 mm free chlorine smx 1 fig 1 c the changing trend of free and combined chlorine was quite different after produced within 10 min the combined chlorine degraded much faster than that in fig 1 a and b but remained stable around 1 mg cl2 l after 30 min this should be attributed to the change of chemical structure on smx by the excess free chlorine and organic chloramines with different precursor structures showed different stability how et al 2016 more free chlorine was released back during the combined chlorine decline but when then combined chlorine stopped degrading the release of free chlorine stopped subsequently and continued to be consumed by the rest organics 3 2 uv photodegradation efficiency of organic chloramines derived from smx pre chlorination at present uv treatment has been applied in some drinking water treatment plants but the uv photodegradation of organic chloramines produced during pre chlorination is not very clear some of organic chloramines have been proved to have high cytotoxicity or genotoxicity how et al 2017 besides their presence will weaken the pre chlorination efficiency as well as lead to the overestimation of real residual chlorine in finished water donnermair and blatchley iii 2003 how et al 2017 thus it should be helpful to reduce these risks if uv irradiation were able to photodegrade these organic chloramines based on the results in fig 2 a c the application of uv irradiation after 10 min pre chlorination obviously enhanced the degradation of combined chlorine when compared with self degradation in fig 1 a besides the photodegradation rate of combined chlorine increased with uv irradiation intensity increasing moreover the combined chlorine produced in pre chlorination can be completely degraded by uv irradiation fig 2 b and c which is quite different from the phenomenon in its self degradation fig 1 for example after 40 min uv irradiation with 420 μw cm2 combined chlorine was totally removed and no free chlorine was released back again this indicated that the uv photodegradation of organic chloramines is feasible if comparing the photodegradation efficiency of free chlorine nh2cl and organic chloramines derived from smx pre chlorination it was found that the degradation rate of organic chloramines was much faster than those of free chlorine and nh2cl under uv254 irradiation fig 3 a based on the previous study the molar absorptivity values of hocl ocl and nh2cl at 254 nm were only 62 60 and 371 m 1 cm 1 respectively chuang et al 2017 however the molar absorptivity of smx at 254 nm can reach 1 4 104 m 1 cm 1 fig 3 b which was two orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl ocl and nh2cl besides the molar absorptivity of smx did not change obviously even after converted to organic chloramines in pre chlorination because almost no changes occurred on the parent structure of smx postigo and richardson 2014 therefore the stronger uv absorption can make the organic chloramines produced from smx easier to be photodegraded besides another typical precursor with amino group glycine was investigated to verify the conversion of chlorine species in this work as shown in fig s2 without uv irradiation the combined chlorine produced from glycine hooc ch2 nhcl how et al 2017 degraded very slowly and small amount of free chlorine can be released fig s2 a but under uv irradiation the degradation of combined chlorine enhanced obviously fig s2 b which was quite similar to that in fig 2 but due to the simple chemical structure of glycine the consumption of free chlorine should be faster than the release of free chlorine under uv irradiation so free chlorine shows a decreasing trend in fig s2 b based on these results the enhanced degradation organic chloramines by uv and release of free chlorine from organic chloramines should exist in a broad range of amino nitrogen precursors 3 3 roles of radicals on the conversion of chlorine nitrogen species in pre chlorination post uv treatment of smx based on previous studies both free chlorine and nh2cl can be activated by uv irradiation to produce radicals of oh cl nh2 etc chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 considering that free and combined chlorine were both exposed to uv irradiation in this study fig 2 these free radicals should also be produced although the yields might be a little low so the roles of radicals on chlorine species conversion should be further investigated besides the combined chlorine decomposition maybe also lead to some changes of nitrogen forms which will affect the subsequent formation of n dbps fig 4 a shows results of chlorine nitrogen species during pre chlorination post uv treatment with and without radical scavenger tba it was found that radicals produced during this process had no obvious influence on both chlorine and nitrogen species conversion thus uv irradiation was the main cause of combined chlorine mainly organic chloramines degradation in addition the post uv treatment had no significant effects on tn no2 and no3 but could lead to the deamination on organic chloramines derived from smx and decrease of don concentration to some extent fig 4 b showed the amino group separation and nh3 n release more clearly when smx was exposed to uv irradiation directly 0 18 mg n l of nh3 n could be released from the smx chemical structure within 1 h besides during the 10 min pre chlorination process there was also 0 18 mg n l of nh3 n that could be released to the solution this indicated that deamination could occur during both direct uv and direct pre chlorination treatment of smx in fact while the combination of pre chlorination and post uv further enhanced this process fig 4 b and scheme 1 based on the result in figs 4 b 0 27 mg n l 0 019 mm of nh3 n can be released in 60 min post uv irradiation the deamination amount per smx molar concentration was 0 19 m m while most organic chloramines r nhcl still returned to the form of r nh2 scheme 1 besides the deamination in glycine 0 46 m m in maximum during pre chlorination post uv treatment was more obvious than that in smx fig s3 which indicated that the enhanced deamination of organic chloramines under uv irradiation should widely exist in many other amino nitrogen precursors in real water 3 4 dbp formation and toxicity assessment in different sequential uv chlorination treatments of smx since the forms of chlorine and nitrogen have changed during pre chlorination post uv treatment it should be explored whether it has any influence on dbp formation in the final chlorination disinfection fig 5 a and b showed the formation of regulated c dbps and emerging n dbps under five different situations including the dbpfps in direct final chlorination a pre uv final chlorination b pre chlorination post uv final chlorination c pre chlorination post uv final chlorination with tba d and the direct dbp yields in pre chlorination post uv process e as shown in fig 5 a and b two c dbps chloroform cf and trichloroacetone tca and two n dbps dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm were detected in the final chlorination of smx and cf and dcan were the dominant species the total dbpfp of smx in direct final chlorination was the lowest among the four situations a d but after pre uv treatment the dbpfps of smx in final chlorination increased obviously situation b this should be due to the decomposition of smx chemical structure under uv irradiation postigo and richardson 2014 and the smaller molecular structure would be more likely to form dbps scheme 1 this is quite similar to the result in our previous work in which pre uv treatment significantly enhanced the formation of n dbps during the subsequent chlorination of algae organic matter zhang et al 2016 however when pre chlorination was applied before the uv treatment situation c both tca and dcan formation potentials showed a decline trend compared with pre uv final chlorination situation b especially for dcan decreasing by 1 58 10 3 mol mol smx 17 37 μg l but cf showed an increasing trend from 3 10 10 2 mol mol smx 370 23 μg l in situation b to 3 33 10 2 mol mol smx 397 60 μg l in situation c this should be attributed to the release of certain amino groups nhcl by the combination of pre chlorination and post uv irradiation which destroyed the precursor structure of cn eq 2 shah and mitch 2012 but produced more cf precursors at the same time after tba was added in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination process situation d cf and tca had no obvious changes compared with situation c while dcan and tcnm showed a very slight decrease besides during the pre chlorination post uv treatment of smx no dbps were detected this indicated that the radicals produced in this system had no obvious influence on the conversion of organic chloramines and the formation of dbps considering the different toxicity intensity of each dbp the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps measured in situation a c were calculated in this study by dividing the mass concentration of each dbp by the corresponding lc50 and the 50 tail dna value or midpoint of the dna tail moment value respectively wagner and plewa 2017 furst et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 c tca and dcan contributed most of the cytotoxicity and dcan contributed more than tca because the genotoxicity values of cf and tca were not available in literature only dcan and tcnm were calculated to obtain the genotoxicity weighted concentration in which tcnm contributed more than dcan when comparing the three different treatment situations the cytotoxicity weighted value of dbps after pre uv final chlorination situation b of smx is the highest while that after direct final chlorination situation a is the lowest the combination of pre chlorination and post uv situation c decreased a certain amount of cytotoxicity weighted value compared with pre uv treatment only however for the calculated genotoxicity of dbps the weighted value treated by pre chlorination post uv final chlorination situation c is the highest and that by direct final chlorination situation a is still the lowest but if considering that the final chlorine dosage can be reduced after uv disinfection is used in drinking water treatment plants the dbp yields and weighted toxicity in situation b and c are likely to be further reduced more research about the risk control of dbps as well as organic chloramines should be conducted in future when pre chlorination and uv disinfection are applied together to drinking water treatment 3 5 different impact factors on dbp formation and toxicity assessment in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination treatment of smx given that pre chlorinaiton post uv final chlornation treatment of smx has some advantages in organic chloramine reduction and dbp control some important impact factors on dbp formation and toxicity assessment during this process were also considered in this study fig 6 a and b shows the effects of ph br and different nom ha fa and rw on dbpfps of smx overall the total dbp yield in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination decreased with ph increasing from 5 5 to 8 5 fig 6 a this can be explained by that the degradation rates of smx by uv irradiation and chlorination in acid condition are both higher than those in alkaline condition mouamfon et al 2011 zhang and li 2012 besides free chlorine hocl ocl mainly exists in the form of hocl with stronger oxidizing capacity at ph 5 5 pka 7 54 thus more dbps can be produced in acid condition especially tca and dcan in the presence of br 5 μm more brominated dbp species can be produced including three c dbps bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf and two n dbps bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban although most n dbp formation potentials decreased with ph increasing when br existed trichloroacetonitrile tcan formation potential increased significantly at ph 8 5 reaching 0 031 mol mol smx 452 49 μg l but due to the decline of highly genotoxic brominated hans the sharp increase of tcan at ph 8 5 did not result in the rise of toxicity fig 6 c in addition it was found that the cytotoxicity of generated dbps in absence of br was quite higher after treatment under acidic condition while in presence of br not only cytotoxicity but also genotoxicity of generated dbps showed a very high toxicity value under acidic condition the formation of dban was the main cause of high genotoxicity however with the increase of ph both of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps decreased significantly this indicates that when smx or other amino nitrogen precursors are treated by pre chlorination post uv final chlorination the risk of dbps can be controlled more easily under alkaline conditions as shown in fig 6 b the existence of nom can increase dbpfps in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination process obviously this is because more precursors were provided for dbp formation and the organic nitrogen in smx could also combine with nom fractions to enhance n dbp formation especially dcan zhang et al 2018b by comparing the three nom backgrounds of ha fa and rw it can be found that different nom has little impact on the total dbpfp in this treatment process however brominated dbps were detected under rw background and the maximum yields of n dbps also occurred in this condition this should be attributed to the presence of br and nitrogen source in this raw water table s1 although the n dbp yields are the highest in background of rw the corresponding genotoxicity is still similar to those in background of ha and fa fig 6 d due to the decrease of highly toxic tcnm 4 conclusions smx is a typical precursor containing nh2 group and can produce combined chlorine especially organic chloramines easily during pre chlorination in drinking water treatment the formed combined chlorine can self degrade and release free chlorine back again the application of uv irradiation enhanced the degradation of combined chlorine produced after pre chlorination and can remove it completely pre chlorination post uv treatment of smx can result into the deamination and radicals had no obvious influence on chlorine nitrogen species conversion in this process two c dbps cf and tca and two n dbps dcan and tcnm were detected in dbpfps of smx in which cf and dcan were two dominant species the order of cf

18733,pre chlorination and uv disinfection are two common processes in drinking water treatment plants sulfamethoxazole smx an antibiotic widely detected in source water was selected as a precursor to study the conversion of chlorine nitrogen species and dbp formation in pre chlorination post uv process the combined chlorine mainly organic chloramines produced in pre chlorination of smx can self degrade and release free chlorine back again as pre chlorination time goes on with free chlorine dose increasing the self degradation rate of combined chlorine increased obviously but the combined chlorine stopped self degrading and remained stable around 1 mg cl2 l after adding 0 30 mm chlorine for 30 min post uv treatment after pre chlorination can enhance the degradation and achieve a complete removal of combined chlorine including organic chloramines deamination occurred during pre chlorination post uv process and deamination amount nh2 per smx concentration was 0 19 m m radicals in this process had no obvious influence on chlorine nitrogen species conversion direct chlorination of smx had the lowest dbp formation potentials while the application of pre chlorination and uv enhanced them compared with uv treatment only dichloroacetonitrile formation potential of smx reduced by 1 58 10 3 mol mol smx 17 37 μg l after pre chlorination post uv treatment during pre chlorination post uv final chlorination treatment of smx br and natural organic matter can enhance dbp formation and toxicity weighted values acid conditions showed a very high dbp risk while alkaline conditions could cut this risk obviously especially for the toxicity weighted values of these dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfamethoxazole smx pre chlorination uv irradiation organic chloramines disinfection by products dbps 1 introduction dissolved organic nitrogen don widely exists in drinking water sources and its presence can lead to the formation of highly toxic nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and nitrosamines nams during the chlor am ination process in drinking water treatment shah and mitch 2012 krasner et al 2013 among these dons many compounds contain amino groups nh2 or nh such as amino acids amides amines etc the h on amino groups can be easily substituted by cl during chlor am ination producing a kind of chlorinated derivatives which is named as organic chloramines e g r nhcl r ncl2 etc how et al 2016 2017 as an intermediate product the formed organic chloramines may be subsequently transformed into hans or hnms through the dechlorination or oxidation process during the further chlor am ination as follows joo and mitch 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 shah and mitch 2012 zhang et

hnms are adverse products during drinking water treatment for organic chloramines some of them have been proved to have cytotoxicity and genotoxicity how et al 2016 2017 and some even remain quite stable during drinking water treatment and distribution processes zhang et al 2015a how et al 2017 yu and reckhow 2017 another adverse effect of organic chloramines on drinking water security is to interfere with the measurement of total effective chlorine after chlor am ination previous studies have proved that organic chloramines have no or very weak oxidizing ability and cannot be distinguished from inorganic chloramines nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 by the traditional dpd method lee et al 2007 black and veatch corporation 2010 how et al 2017 therefore the existence of organic chloramines will lead to the overestimation of total effective chlorine and a high risk of microorganism re growth during the drinking water distribution donnermair et al 2003 zhang et al 2015a while for the further products hans and hnms their high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity have always been the hot issue in the researching field of drinking water disinfection plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 bond et al 2015 considering the transformation relationship from organic chloramines to hans and hnms eq 2 and 3 it is very necessary to investigate their conversion rules during different drinking water treatment processes and explore some effective methods to control these two adverse products organic chloramines and n dbps together pre chlorination has become a common oxidation method in many drinking water treatment plants for controlling algae growth enhancing coagulation flocculation and degrading some pollutants etc ma et al 2012 qi et al 2016a b but considering the existence of don that contains amino groups combined chlorine especially organic chloramines can be easily produced in pre chlorination which will greatly weaken the efficiency of pre chlorination and bring many other negative effects that mentioned above besides in order to reduce the risk of microbial pathogens such as cryptosporidium and regulated dbps ultraviolet uv disinfection has been widely applied before the post chlorination process in drinking water treatment plants plewa et al 2012 dotson et al 2012 deng et al 2014 the combination of pre chlorination and uv disinfection to form uv chlorine advanced oxidation process which can accelerate pollutant removal has also become a hot issue in the current research field of drinking water disinfection zhang et al 2018a 2019 guo et al 2018 however the conversion of combined chlorine especially organic chloramines and further transformation to other highly toxic n dbps during the pre chlorination post uv treatment process is not very clear yet sulfamethoxazole smx is a kind of sulfonamide antibiotics often used to treat human diseases or added to feedstuff to promote livestock growth zhang et al 2015b cui et al 2016 based on previous reports this antibiotic smx has been widely detected in different surface water or even source water with concentrations ranging from dozens to hundreds of ng l luo et al 2011 jiang et al 2011 carvalho and santos 2016 cui et al 2018 from the chemical structure smx is a kind of amine organics and should be a typical precursor of organic chloramines during pre chlorination therefore smx is selected as a target precursor in this work to investigate the conversion of different chlorine and nitrogen species and the subsequent formation of final dbps especially n dbps during the pre chloriantion post uv treatment in addition the results can also provide some references for the removal of antibiotics and risk control of highly toxic dbps during drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all reagents in this study were analytical grade at least smx 98 0 bp grade and naclo solution 7 5 were obtained from sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china dpd sulfate 99 0 tert butyl alcohol tba 99 5 ki 99 99 and kio3 99 8 were purchased from aladdin co ltd shanghai china nh4cl 99 5 kh2po4 99 5 na2hpo4 99 0 kbr 99 0 naoh 98 0 h2so4 95 98 na2s2o3 99 0 and ascorbic acid 99 7 were all purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the extraction solvent methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was obtained from j t baker usa humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa were purchased from the international humic substances society ihss and used as typical natural organic matter nom in this study raw water rw sample was collected from taipu river in shanghai china after filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes anpel shanghai china the rw sample was stored at 4 c in dark before experiments its quality parameters were shown in table s1 the dbp standard solutions epa 551a and 551b were obtained from sigma aldrich usa free chlorine solution was prepared by directly diluting the naclo stock solution nh2cl solution was freshly prepared by adding naclo solution into nh4cl solution dropwise with a cl2 n molar ratio of 0 8 at ph 8 5 and then stirring rapidly for 0 5 1 h all solutions in experiments were prepared by ultra pure water produced from a milli q water filtration system usa 2 2 experimental procedures to investigate the conversion of different chlorine species during pre chlorination of smx 0 1 mm smx solution 200 ml was chlorinated with different free chlorine dose 0 05 0 1 and 0 3 mm at ph 7 0 10 mm phosphate buffer at pre determined intervals 20 ml of treated samples was extracted for total and free chlorine measurement according to previous studies when the molar ratio of free chlorine amine precursor 1 combined chlorine would be produced in which inorganic chloramines nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 were almost negligible while organic chloramines were dominant donnermair and blatchley iii 2003 weng et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b therefore in order to study the conversion of organic chloramines during uv irradiation 0 1 mm smx solution 200 ml was pre chlorinated with 0 05 mm free chlorine at ph 7 0 for 10 min to avoid inorganic chloramines as much as possible after that the prepared combined chlorine solution organic chloramines in dominant was exposed to 254 nm uv irradiation with different uv intensity 115 268 and 420 μw cm2 likewise at the pre determined intervals 20 ml of irradiated samples was extracted for total and free chlorine measurement here the calculated combined chlorine total chlorine free chlorine could reflect the trend of organic chloramines during uv treatment the uv system schematic equipped with a low pressure hg uv lamp 254 nm phillips is shown in fig s1 and the uv irradiation intensity was measured by a uv intensity radiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university beijing china before the uv exposure experiments the irradiation intensity could be adjusted via the elevator raised or lowered fig s1 considering the coexistence of free and combined chlorine during the post uv irradiation radicals such as oh cl nh2 etc might be produced chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 in order to explore the role of these potential radicals on organic chloramine conversion a radical quencher tba 0 1 mm was added during the post uv treatment of prepared organic chloramines by smx pre chlorination for comparing the difference of free and total chlorine with and without tba besides during the post uv treatment of prepared organic chloramine solution the treated samples with and without tba were also extracted and quenched by na2s2o3 for analyzing the variation of nitrogen species including total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonia nh3 n nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and don in dbp formation experiments five different treatment situations were considered in this work including dbp formation potential dbpfp study in direct final chlorination pre uv final chlorination pre chlorination post uv final chlorination with and without tba and direct dbp yield detection in pre chlorination post uv treatment in experiments of impact factors 5 μm of br and 3 00 mg c l doc value of ha fa and rw its initial doc was 3 32 mg c l and diluted to 3 00 mg c l were added to the prepared smx solutions and phs were buffered using 10 mm phosphate solution the initial smx concentration was 0 1 mm uv dose was 482 mj cm2 268 μw cm2 30 min chlorine doses in pre and final chlorination were 0 05 and 1 mm respectively pre and final chlorination time were 10 min and 72 h respectively tba addition after pre chlorination was 0 1 mm all the solutions were adjusted to ph 7 0 except for ph impact factor experiments with 10 mm phosphate buffer and samples were stored at 25 c in dark after the reaction 10 ml of treated samples was quenched by ascorbic acid ascorbic acid free chlorine 1 2 mol mol and then added with 2 ml of mtbe for liquid liquid extraction violently shaken for 4 min and then rest for 4 min finally 1 ml of organic phase was taken for dbp analysis dbpfps were expressed using molar dbp yields per molar smx mol mol smx in this study in order to better reflect the dbp formation ability of the precursor 2 3 analytical methods total and free chlorine concentrations were detected by dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 combined chlorine was calculated by total chlorine minus free chlorine tdn value was measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan nh3 n was detected by the salicylic acid hypochlorous acid salt colorimetric method hach co usa concentrations of no2 no3 and br were detected using an ion chromatography dionex ics 2000 usa considering the samples in this study are smx solution and dissolved inorganic nitrogen in tdn is much less than 0 6 mg n mg n the don value here can be calculated by subtracting nh3 n no2 and no3 from tdn lee and westerhoff 2005 molar absorptivity was analyzed using a 1 cm quartz cell with the wavelength ranging from 200 to 300 nm dbp concentrations were detected based on usepa 551 1 usepa 1995 using a gas chromatograph with an electronic capture detector gc 2010 shimadzu japan and an hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm j w usa the injector and detector temperature was set as 200 and 290 c respectively the flow rate of nitrogen carrier gas was 17 1 ml min the temperature program was as follows hold at 37 c for 10 min raised to 50 c with 5 c min and kept for 5 min then raised to 260 c with 30 c and kept for 10 min based on previous literatures the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of each dbp were calculated by dividing its measured concentration by the corresponding lc50 value and the 50 tail dna value or midpoint of the dna tail moment value respectively wagner and plewa 2017 furst et al 2018 the corresponding cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values of each detected dbp were shown in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 conversion of chlorine species in pre chlorination of smx smx is a potential precursor of organic chloramines in chlorination due to its special chemical structure containing nh2 group but the organic chloramine formation and conversion in chlorination of smx are not very clear yet in order to analyze the conversion mechanisms of chlorine and nitrogen species more clearly smx was chosen as a typical representative of broad amino nitrogen organics and a higher initial concentration 0 1 mm was used in this study wang et al 2019 fig 1 a c shows the variation of different chlorine species in chlorination of smx with different free chlorine doses although the organic chloramine concentration cannot be directly detected by dpd method it can be well represented by the combined chlorine concentration here because organic chloramines should be dominant in combined chlorine combined chlorine inorganic chloramines organic chloramines when the molar ratio of free chlorine amine precursor is less than 1 0 donnermair and blatchley iii 2003 weng et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b when 0 1 mm smx was chlorinated by 0 05 mm free chlorine fig 1 a 1 87 mg cl2 l combined chlorine was produced within the initial 10 min then as the chlorination time went on the formed combined chlorine showed a slight decrease while free chlorine increased after 20 min this indicated that smx could fast consume free chlorine to generate organic chloramines which could release some free chlorine again through self degradation with the free chlorine dose increasing to 0 1 mm fig 1 b the yield of combined chlorine within 10 min increased to 3 91 mg cl2 l and more free chlorine was released back to solution during the organic chloramines self degradation however with the free chlorine dose further increasing to 3 mm free chlorine smx 1 fig 1 c the changing trend of free and combined chlorine was quite different after produced within 10 min the combined chlorine degraded much faster than that in fig 1 a and b but remained stable around 1 mg cl2 l after 30 min this should be attributed to the change of chemical structure on smx by the excess free chlorine and organic chloramines with different precursor structures showed different stability how et al 2016 more free chlorine was released back during the combined chlorine decline but when then combined chlorine stopped degrading the release of free chlorine stopped subsequently and continued to be consumed by the rest organics 3 2 uv photodegradation efficiency of organic chloramines derived from smx pre chlorination at present uv treatment has been applied in some drinking water treatment plants but the uv photodegradation of organic chloramines produced during pre chlorination is not very clear some of organic chloramines have been proved to have high cytotoxicity or genotoxicity how et al 2017 besides their presence will weaken the pre chlorination efficiency as well as lead to the overestimation of real residual chlorine in finished water donnermair and blatchley iii 2003 how et al 2017 thus it should be helpful to reduce these risks if uv irradiation were able to photodegrade these organic chloramines based on the results in fig 2 a c the application of uv irradiation after 10 min pre chlorination obviously enhanced the degradation of combined chlorine when compared with self degradation in fig 1 a besides the photodegradation rate of combined chlorine increased with uv irradiation intensity increasing moreover the combined chlorine produced in pre chlorination can be completely degraded by uv irradiation fig 2 b and c which is quite different from the phenomenon in its self degradation fig 1 for example after 40 min uv irradiation with 420 μw cm2 combined chlorine was totally removed and no free chlorine was released back again this indicated that the uv photodegradation of organic chloramines is feasible if comparing the photodegradation efficiency of free chlorine nh2cl and organic chloramines derived from smx pre chlorination it was found that the degradation rate of organic chloramines was much faster than those of free chlorine and nh2cl under uv254 irradiation fig 3 a based on the previous study the molar absorptivity values of hocl ocl and nh2cl at 254 nm were only 62 60 and 371 m 1 cm 1 respectively chuang et al 2017 however the molar absorptivity of smx at 254 nm can reach 1 4 104 m 1 cm 1 fig 3 b which was two orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl ocl and nh2cl besides the molar absorptivity of smx did not change obviously even after converted to organic chloramines in pre chlorination because almost no changes occurred on the parent structure of smx postigo and richardson 2014 therefore the stronger uv absorption can make the organic chloramines produced from smx easier to be photodegraded besides another typical precursor with amino group glycine was investigated to verify the conversion of chlorine species in this work as shown in fig s2 without uv irradiation the combined chlorine produced from glycine hooc ch2 nhcl how et al 2017 degraded very slowly and small amount of free chlorine can be released fig s2 a but under uv irradiation the degradation of combined chlorine enhanced obviously fig s2 b which was quite similar to that in fig 2 but due to the simple chemical structure of glycine the consumption of free chlorine should be faster than the release of free chlorine under uv irradiation so free chlorine shows a decreasing trend in fig s2 b based on these results the enhanced degradation organic chloramines by uv and release of free chlorine from organic chloramines should exist in a broad range of amino nitrogen precursors 3 3 roles of radicals on the conversion of chlorine nitrogen species in pre chlorination post uv treatment of smx based on previous studies both free chlorine and nh2cl can be activated by uv irradiation to produce radicals of oh cl nh2 etc chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 considering that free and combined chlorine were both exposed to uv irradiation in this study fig 2 these free radicals should also be produced although the yields might be a little low so the roles of radicals on chlorine species conversion should be further investigated besides the combined chlorine decomposition maybe also lead to some changes of nitrogen forms which will affect the subsequent formation of n dbps fig 4 a shows results of chlorine nitrogen species during pre chlorination post uv treatment with and without radical scavenger tba it was found that radicals produced during this process had no obvious influence on both chlorine and nitrogen species conversion thus uv irradiation was the main cause of combined chlorine mainly organic chloramines degradation in addition the post uv treatment had no significant effects on tn no2 and no3 but could lead to the deamination on organic chloramines derived from smx and decrease of don concentration to some extent fig 4 b showed the amino group separation and nh3 n release more clearly when smx was exposed to uv irradiation directly 0 18 mg n l of nh3 n could be released from the smx chemical structure within 1 h besides during the 10 min pre chlorination process there was also 0 18 mg n l of nh3 n that could be released to the solution this indicated that deamination could occur during both direct uv and direct pre chlorination treatment of smx in fact while the combination of pre chlorination and post uv further enhanced this process fig 4 b and scheme 1 based on the result in figs 4 b 0 27 mg n l 0 019 mm of nh3 n can be released in 60 min post uv irradiation the deamination amount per smx molar concentration was 0 19 m m while most organic chloramines r nhcl still returned to the form of r nh2 scheme 1 besides the deamination in glycine 0 46 m m in maximum during pre chlorination post uv treatment was more obvious than that in smx fig s3 which indicated that the enhanced deamination of organic chloramines under uv irradiation should widely exist in many other amino nitrogen precursors in real water 3 4 dbp formation and toxicity assessment in different sequential uv chlorination treatments of smx since the forms of chlorine and nitrogen have changed during pre chlorination post uv treatment it should be explored whether it has any influence on dbp formation in the final chlorination disinfection fig 5 a and b showed the formation of regulated c dbps and emerging n dbps under five different situations including the dbpfps in direct final chlorination a pre uv final chlorination b pre chlorination post uv final chlorination c pre chlorination post uv final chlorination with tba d and the direct dbp yields in pre chlorination post uv process e as shown in fig 5 a and b two c dbps chloroform cf and trichloroacetone tca and two n dbps dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm were detected in the final chlorination of smx and cf and dcan were the dominant species the total dbpfp of smx in direct final chlorination was the lowest among the four situations a d but after pre uv treatment the dbpfps of smx in final chlorination increased obviously situation b this should be due to the decomposition of smx chemical structure under uv irradiation postigo and richardson 2014 and the smaller molecular structure would be more likely to form dbps scheme 1 this is quite similar to the result in our previous work in which pre uv treatment significantly enhanced the formation of n dbps during the subsequent chlorination of algae organic matter zhang et al 2016 however when pre chlorination was applied before the uv treatment situation c both tca and dcan formation potentials showed a decline trend compared with pre uv final chlorination situation b especially for dcan decreasing by 1 58 10 3 mol mol smx 17 37 μg l but cf showed an increasing trend from 3 10 10 2 mol mol smx 370 23 μg l in situation b to 3 33 10 2 mol mol smx 397 60 μg l in situation c this should be attributed to the release of certain amino groups nhcl by the combination of pre chlorination and post uv irradiation which destroyed the precursor structure of cn eq 2 shah and mitch 2012 but produced more cf precursors at the same time after tba was added in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination process situation d cf and tca had no obvious changes compared with situation c while dcan and tcnm showed a very slight decrease besides during the pre chlorination post uv treatment of smx no dbps were detected this indicated that the radicals produced in this system had no obvious influence on the conversion of organic chloramines and the formation of dbps considering the different toxicity intensity of each dbp the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps measured in situation a c were calculated in this study by dividing the mass concentration of each dbp by the corresponding lc50 and the 50 tail dna value or midpoint of the dna tail moment value respectively wagner and plewa 2017 furst et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 c tca and dcan contributed most of the cytotoxicity and dcan contributed more than tca because the genotoxicity values of cf and tca were not available in literature only dcan and tcnm were calculated to obtain the genotoxicity weighted concentration in which tcnm contributed more than dcan when comparing the three different treatment situations the cytotoxicity weighted value of dbps after pre uv final chlorination situation b of smx is the highest while that after direct final chlorination situation a is the lowest the combination of pre chlorination and post uv situation c decreased a certain amount of cytotoxicity weighted value compared with pre uv treatment only however for the calculated genotoxicity of dbps the weighted value treated by pre chlorination post uv final chlorination situation c is the highest and that by direct final chlorination situation a is still the lowest but if considering that the final chlorine dosage can be reduced after uv disinfection is used in drinking water treatment plants the dbp yields and weighted toxicity in situation b and c are likely to be further reduced more research about the risk control of dbps as well as organic chloramines should be conducted in future when pre chlorination and uv disinfection are applied together to drinking water treatment 3 5 different impact factors on dbp formation and toxicity assessment in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination treatment of smx given that pre chlorinaiton post uv final chlornation treatment of smx has some advantages in organic chloramine reduction and dbp control some important impact factors on dbp formation and toxicity assessment during this process were also considered in this study fig 6 a and b shows the effects of ph br and different nom ha fa and rw on dbpfps of smx overall the total dbp yield in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination decreased with ph increasing from 5 5 to 8 5 fig 6 a this can be explained by that the degradation rates of smx by uv irradiation and chlorination in acid condition are both higher than those in alkaline condition mouamfon et al 2011 zhang and li 2012 besides free chlorine hocl ocl mainly exists in the form of hocl with stronger oxidizing capacity at ph 5 5 pka 7 54 thus more dbps can be produced in acid condition especially tca and dcan in the presence of br 5 μm more brominated dbp species can be produced including three c dbps bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf and two n dbps bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban although most n dbp formation potentials decreased with ph increasing when br existed trichloroacetonitrile tcan formation potential increased significantly at ph 8 5 reaching 0 031 mol mol smx 452 49 μg l but due to the decline of highly genotoxic brominated hans the sharp increase of tcan at ph 8 5 did not result in the rise of toxicity fig 6 c in addition it was found that the cytotoxicity of generated dbps in absence of br was quite higher after treatment under acidic condition while in presence of br not only cytotoxicity but also genotoxicity of generated dbps showed a very high toxicity value under acidic condition the formation of dban was the main cause of high genotoxicity however with the increase of ph both of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps decreased significantly this indicates that when smx or other amino nitrogen precursors are treated by pre chlorination post uv final chlorination the risk of dbps can be controlled more easily under alkaline conditions as shown in fig 6 b the existence of nom can increase dbpfps in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination process obviously this is because more precursors were provided for dbp formation and the organic nitrogen in smx could also combine with nom fractions to enhance n dbp formation especially dcan zhang et al 2018b by comparing the three nom backgrounds of ha fa and rw it can be found that different nom has little impact on the total dbpfp in this treatment process however brominated dbps were detected under rw background and the maximum yields of n dbps also occurred in this condition this should be attributed to the presence of br and nitrogen source in this raw water table s1 although the n dbp yields are the highest in background of rw the corresponding genotoxicity is still similar to those in background of ha and fa fig 6 d due to the decrease of highly toxic tcnm 4 conclusions smx is a typical precursor containing nh2 group and can produce combined chlorine especially organic chloramines easily during pre chlorination in drinking water treatment the formed combined chlorine can self degrade and release free chlorine back again the application of uv irradiation enhanced the degradation of combined chlorine produced after pre chlorination and can remove it completely pre chlorination post uv treatment of smx can result into the deamination and radicals had no obvious influence on chlorine nitrogen species conversion in this process two c dbps cf and tca and two n dbps dcan and tcnm were detected in dbpfps of smx in which cf and dcan were two dominant species the order of cf and tcnm formation potentials in different treatment processes was direct final chlorination pre uv final chlorination pre chlorination post uv final chlorination while for tca and dcan the order was direct final chlorination pre chlorination post uv final chlorination pre uv final chlorination no dbps were detected in pre chlorination post uv treatment of smx and radicals produced in this process had no obvious influence on dbpfps in the final chlorination too the orders of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity weighted values of dbps were direct final chlorination pre chlorination post uv final chlorination pre uv final chlorination and direct final chlorination pre uv final chlorination pre chlorination post uv final chlorination respectively besides during pre chlorination post uv final chlorination treatment of smx the existence of br can enhance dbp formation and toxicity weighted values especially n dbps and their genotoxicity values acid conditions showed a quite high dbp risk while alkaline conditions were more conducive to dbp risk control the presence of nom can also promote dbp formation in pre chlorination post uv final chlorination treatment of smx but the differences of dbp formation and toxicity in different background are not obvious declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

18734,with the widespread use of oxytetracycline otc residual otcs have been detected in natural surface waters as well as in water and wastewater treatment systems semiconductor photocatalysis has been proven to be a green and high performing method for the removal of organic contaminants however most photocatalysts are only effective when irradiated by uv light this study explores the efficiency of a new semiconductor photocatalysis method for otc removal under solar and visible light to expand the spectral range from the uv to the visible region a facile prepared ball like tio2 at graphene oxide tio2 go composite a tio2 associated catalyst was synthesized chemical characterization indicated that the tio2 go has the features of both tio2 and go with the regular tio2 fiber balls cladded by go nanosheets the photocatalytic activity of tio2 go composites under solar and visible light was evaluated in terms of otc degradation values of 100 and 90 otc removal efficiencies were achieved with tio2 go at 6 mg l under solar and visible light irradiation respectively the band structure of tio2 go expanded the spectral range to full light wavelengths facilitating formation of a light induced electron hole h which was identified in this study as the major cause of otc degradation the ph and tss levels 100 mg l were found to have high and low impacts respectively on the removal efficiency of otc while natural organic matter nom was found to have an insignificant impact furthermore the degradation of otc with catalysis by tio2 go was verified using two real water samples and averages of 90 and 75 otc removal efficiencies were achieved under solar and visible light respectively the results indicate that the synthesized tio2 go composites can provide an

2 0 g graphite powder was dispersed into h2so4 98 100 ml at 0 c then 6 0 g kmno4 powder was gradually added to the mixture the reaction system was continually agitated at 35 c for 3 days thereafter distilled water 200 ml was added to the solution and the mixture was stored at 98 c for 2 h when the solution cooled to 60 c h2o2 30 10 ml was added to react with the excess kmno4 a bright yellow mixture containing suspended solids was obtained then the solution was repeatedly centrifuged and washed with hcl 30 and distilled water until the ph value was close to 7 the prepared go was stored in distilled water to obtain a go solution for further use triethanolamine teoa ethanol and isopropyl alcohol ipa were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis usa all reagents in the experiments were used

japan with an integrated sphere attachment within the range of 200 800 nm 2 4 otc photodegradation photocatalytic activities were evaluated for the degradation of otc solution under solar and visible light irradiation synthetic and natural water samples a and b were investigated sample a was collected from the haihe river estuary in tianjin and sample b was collected from the hongni river in the jinnan district of tianjin without detectable otc a 500 w xenon lamp with 290 nm cutoff filter was used as a light source for solar light generation and a 420 nm cutoff filter was applied for visible light production a total of 10 40 mg of the tio2 go photocatalyst was dispersed in 20 mg l otc solution 50 ml container to determine the optimal catalyst quantity the ph of the solution was 6 78 prior to irradiation the suspended medium was magnetically stirred in the dark for several hours to study the absorption desorption equilibrium the lamp was then turned on and photodegradation was initiated at a given time interval 3 ml solution was sampled and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane cellulose acetate for otc determination soeborg et al 2004 wen et al 2010 the concentration and uv visible spectra were measured by a uv visible spectrophotometer the degree of degradation was expressed as ct c0 where c0 is the initial concentration and ct is the concentration at reaction time t duplicated examination was performed for all irradiation experiments 2 5 radical trapping experiment radical trapping experiments were conducted to detect the main active species for understanding the photocatalytic reaction mechanisms during the degradation of otc under solar light three trapping agents namely teoa ethanol and ipa were added as scavengers of hole h electron e and hydroxyl radicals oh respectively during the experiments 10 mm trapping agents were mixed into the samples prior to irradiation then the samples were collected for further analysis as described earlier 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tio2 go catalysts the chemical compositions of the synthesized tio2 go catalysts were characterized by xrd ftir and raman two synthetic precursors go and tio2 were used for comparison to elucidate the characteristics of tio2 go integrally as shown in fig 1 a the xrd patterns of tio2 go are well assigned to the standard card jcpds 21 1276 of rutile tio2 which is similar to tio2 the go peak around 10 2 theta on the xrd spectra is undetected in the tio2 go composite which can be due to the high temperature pyrolysis fig s1 no distinguishable diffraction peaks of other phases or impurities were observed in the patterns thereby indicating the high purity of the prepared tio2 go samples the ftir spectra of tio2 go catalysts fig 1b show the absorption bands corresponding to c o stretching at 1050 cm 1 c o c stretching at 1250 cm 1 c oh stretching at 1400 cm 1 c c stretching at 1620 cm 1 and c o carbonyl stretching at 1720 cm 1 xu et al 2008 they appear similar to the ftir spectra of go except for the oxygenated functional groups which were considerably descreased after solvothermal treatment the characterization indicated that the oxygenated functional groups of go were minimized during the synesthetic procedure and the chemical structure of go was mostly changed to the reduced go rgo like substance raman spectroscopy was further used to confirm the chemical compositions of tio2 go composites as shown in fig 1c raman modes at 125 196 243 423 650 and 857 cm 1 are characteristics of pure phase tio2 which are also exhibited in the tio2 go sample two main features g 1590 cm 1 and d 1358 cm 1 are found in the go and tio2 go samples zhang et al 2015 however the intensity ratio of i d i g was considerably changed at 1 05 for tio2 go composites compared to 0 76 for go indicating a decrease in the oxygen functional groups on the tio2 go surface which is consistent with the ftir results the xrd ftir and raman spectra all demonstrated that the synthetic tio2 go catalysts possess the characteristics of tio2 and go which can be effective in the subsequent degradation experiments the morphology size and structure of the prepared tio2 go composites were examined via sem and tem fig 2 a c shows typical sem images for the tio2 go composites the tio2 fiber balls exhibited a uniform spherical morphology consisting of regular nanorods and cladded by the go nanosheets the detailed morphology and microstructure of tio2 go composites were further visualized via tem as shown in fig 2d f the high resolution tem image fig 2f demonstrated that the crystalline lattice distance is 1 36 å corresponding to the 301 planes of tio2 which is consistent with the xrd results the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution plot of tio2 go and tio2 are shown in fig s2 the specific surface areas of tio2 go composites and pure tio2 were determined to be 78 12 and 57 01 m2 g respectively the increased surface area may be due to the addition of rgo composites in tio2 go the comparison indicates that the adsorption ability of tio2 go is about 37 higher than that of pristine tio2 3 2 degradation of otc via tio2 go under solar and visible light the photocatalytic activity of tio2 go composites was evaluated via otc degradation in an aqueous solution under irradiation with solar and visible light the initial concentration of the otc was 20 mg l the relatively high concentration of otc for the experiments was chosen based on previous studies in order to magnify the possible photocatalytic reaction in the study chen et al 2016 chen and liu 2017 jo et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 the uv visible spectra showed that the absorbance wavelength of otc was approximately 350 nm which can be used to reflect the concentration of otc fig s3 harja and ciobanu 2018 fig 3 a shows the adsorption equilibrium of otc in the dark under various concentrations of tio2 go composites 0 2 0 8 mg l with the increase in tio2 go concentrations at an equilibrium time of approximately 30 min the ct c0 of otc decreased an adsorption equilibrium time of 30 min was chosen for subsequent experiments as shown in fig 3b after 4 h of irradiation with solar light the photocatalytic removal efficiencies of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mg l tio2 go composites are 94 12 98 65 99 43 and 99 1 respectively the concentration of 0 6 mg l of tio2 go was selected as the optimal concentration for catalysis due to the relatively high removal efficiency and low catalysis concentration as shown in fig 3c and d the otc removal efficiencies of the synthesized tio2 go under irradiation with solar and visible light were evaluated p25 tio2 which is one of the best tio2 catalysts and rgo which has a similar graphene composition to tio2 go were used for comparison in the control test without any catalyst the decomposition of otc suggested that the photolysis of otc was not sensitive to the solar or visible light fig 3c and d as shown in fig 3c the removal efficiency of otc via p25 tio2 reached 100 in 120 min whereas it reached 100 via tio2 go in 240 min with a relatively low removal rate after the first hour as shown in the same figure the removal efficiency of otc via rgo was only 18 2 under solar light demonstrating that the basis of tio2 go composites rgo would not contribute to the otc degradation fig 3d shows the photocatalytic degradation of otc via the same catalysts under visible light the removal efficiencies of otc via 0 6 mg l p25 tio2 tio2 go composites and rgo were approximately 41 9 89 5 and 11 9 respectively after 4 h the photocatalytic removal efficiency of the tio2 go composites was considerably higher than that of p25 tio2 under visible light 3 3 mechanism of tio2 go on degradation of otc the photodegradation of organic materials is mainly attributed to the generation of electrons e and holes h during photocatalysis delaying the photogenerated electron hole pair recombination allows for more h to initiate redox reactions with organic pollutants chen et al 2016 chen and liu 2017 adeleye et al 2018 furthermore some reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical anion o2 and hydroxyl radical oh can be generated during the electron hole pair formation xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 these o2 and oh radicals as well as h readily react with organic contaminates such as otc and cause their mineralization chen and liu 2017 reshak 2018 to investigate the photocatalytic ability of the synthetic tio2 go composites corresponding characterizations were conducted the optical absorption properties and band structure of the tio2 go were examined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs p25 tio2 and pure tio2 were also measured for comparison as shown in fig 4 a the band gap absorption edge of p25 tio2 and pure tio2 were approximately 420 and 440 nm respectively suggesting that p25 tio2 and pure tio2 can mostly adsorb uv light and initiate light induced h and e however tio2 go is active and produces oxidative h at all light wavelengths during irradiation the expansion of the absorption range for tio2 go to 400 800 nm can be attributed to the presence of a certain amount of go in the composites which act as low charge bulk carriers during light adsorption the band gap energy of tio2 go is illustrated in fig 4b generally the band gap energy of a catalyst is estimated by the following formula αhν a hν eg n 2 where α ν eg and a are the absorption coefficient light frequency band gap and constant respectively for tio2 and tio2 go composites samples the value of n is 4 because of its indirect transition tian et al 2017 the band gap energy of tio2 go composites was approximately 2 8 ev which is lower than that of tio2 3 2 ev also indicating that tio2 go composites efficiently absorb visible light and can exhibit photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation tian et al 2017 to further evaluate the effects of produced ros and electron hole pairs on the degradation of otc the most effective ros adeleye et al 2018 hydroxyl radicals oh and h and e were separately eliminated during the reactions as o2 was generated from oh and their oxidizability was equivalent adeleye et al 2018 the o2 was not removed in this study as shown in fig 5 we used abundant trapping agents to quench the corresponding substance as follows teoa was used to quench h ethanol was used to eliminate e and ipa was used to minimize oh the degradation of otc via tio2 go without any scavengers is also shown in fig 5 for comparison results indicate that the oh and e did not affect the degradation of otc and that most of the degradation effects were from h however our results also show that the degradation of otc still occurred even without h implying that other effects can also contribute towards otc removal these other effects will be explored in more detail in future studies based on the foregoing characterization and removal efficiencies of otc the tio2 go composites in this study exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity under both simulated sunlight and visible light irradiation combining with the tem and sem examinations as well as previously published reports sampaio et al 2015 sun et al 2018 we can speculate that the hybrid nanostructures between go and tio2 can provide synergetic effects to slow down the recombination of photo or electrochemically generated h and e pairs enhance the charge transfer rate and increase the surface adsorption of molecules and eventually resulting in a promising photocatalytic ability lei et al 2014 wang et al 2013 furthermore drs and band gap energy results clearly showed that the adsorption wavelength was successfully expanded to the visible range which can be explained by the effectiveness of the low charge bulk carrier of go composites different from other synthetic photocatalysis the effects of produced ros on the degradation of otc was insignificant in this work 3 4 impact factors on degradation of otc the degradation of otc via tio2 go under visible light was considerably more effective than that of other tio2 based catalysts e g p25 and pure tio2 however the effectiveness of the photo degradation of tio2 go to otc under visible light is potentially subject to environmental factors such as ph nom or tss in water which hinder light transmission as shown in fig 6 a the otc degradation in the ph range 4 5 9 was evaluated over 4 h with the decrease in ph from 9 to 4 5 common ph in nature the adsorption and degradation of otc increased after 30 min equilibrium only 30 of otc was adsorbed onto tio2 go at ph 9 compared to 50 3 of otc adsorbed onto tio2 go at ph 4 5 approximately 78 3 of otc was removed in 240 min under visible light irradiation at ph 9 which increased to 91 2 at ph 4 5 slightly acidic conditions favored the formation of tio2 go in the removal of otc during water or wastewater treatment fig 6b shows the impact of nom on the degradation of otc via tio2 go to simulate the typical concentrations of nom in natural waters five different nom concentrations of 0 5 8 mg l were used as shown in the figure the removal efficiencies of otc with different nom concentrations were stable and mostly were in the range of 84 3 87 1 after 240 min as reported previously the presence of nom can affect the photodegradation in two opposite ways it could inhibit photodegradation by absorbing light or by acting as a quencher for photo excited molecules selli et al 1999 garbin et al 2007 on the flip side it might also act as a photosensitizer which may produce reactive oxygen species and enhance photodegradation sakkas et al 2002 garbin et al 2007 in the present work very little effect of nom on the degradation of otc was observed with nom concentrations of 0 5 8 mg l which is inconsistent with the literature and requires further investigation another important factor affecting photocatalysis in aqueous solution is tss light transmission is highly affected by suspended solids thus tss concentrations used in the experiment varied from 15 mg l to 250 mg l covering the range of concentrations from typical surface water to wastewater treatment work effluent the removal efficiency of otc decreased gradually from 89 2 15 mg l to 76 5 250 mg l within 4 h fig 6c however the removal efficiency only decreased when the tss concentration was higher than 100 mg l generally the otc concentrations released from wastewater treatment are less than 337 8 ng l wu et al 2016 the tss concentration is lower than 20 mg l according to gb18918 2002 fu et al 2018 thus the influence of tss on the degradation of otc via tio2 go is not significant 3 5 degradation of otc via tio2 go under solar and visible light in real surface water to validate the feasibility of synthetic tio2 go to degrade otc in real surface water systems two surface water samples which were collected from the haihe river estuary and the hongni river in tianjin china were studied under simulated solar and visible light in natural waters solar and visible lights responded to the photoactive ability of tio2 go on the degradation of organic compounds such as otc as the uv fraction of solar light is significantly filtered by increasing water depths helbling et al 2003 li et al 2012 piazena et al 2002 tedetti and sempere 2006 and the remaining fractions of solar light are visible as shown in table 1 water sample a has higher salt nom and tss concentrations than sample b the removal efficiencies of otc via tio2 go under solar and visible light are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the ct c0 of otc decreases under solar and visible light without any catalyst tio2 go this finding indicates that otc can self degrade slightly in natural water and that the removal efficiency decreases in deeper water under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 7a the removal efficiencies of otc via tio2 go under solar light were 87 8 and 94 5 for samples a and b respectively the removal efficiency slightly decreased in the real water samples compared with the removal efficiency in di water 100 within 4 h the removal efficiencies of otc under visible light were 67 8 and 78 1 for samples a and b respectively fig 7b compared with the results in fig 3d the removal efficiency of otc under visible light in real water samples especially for sample a had decreased significantly this result indicates that water chemistry such as ph inorganic ions and tss can partially affect the degradation of otc in real water as shown in table 1 the tss concentrations are remarkably low in the two water samples based on the previous discussion the tss concentrations in the surface water samples have a marginal effect on the otc removal the ph of samples a and b were 8 45 and 7 61 respectively fig 6a shows that the otc removal efficiency decreased considerably when the ph increased from 7 5 to 9 which can explain the difference in the otc removal efficiencies between samples a and b besides salt and ammonia can have negative effects on otc degradation moreover the existing ions or ammonia can occupy the possible adsorption site on tio2 go and thus prohibit the reaction with otc accordingly the removal efficiency of otc can be affected by several water conditions but it can also be remarkably high in real water samples after pretreatment with coagulation sedimentation and ph adjustment in wastewater the removal efficiency of otc via the tio2 go composites can be further improved whether in solar or visible light 4 conclusions tio2 go composites can effectively degrade otc under solar and visible light the h and e pairs were produced during the photocatalysis reaction and the production of h was identified as the major cause of otc removal the characteristics of the synthesized tio2 go indicated that the heterojunction between go and tio2 can promote the injection of electrons into go which serves as an electron sink and thereby delays recombination eventually resulting in the promising photocatalytic ability of tio2 go composites compared with other tio2 catalysts tio2 go composites yielded a better photocatalytic performance when used to degrade otc under visible light irradiation this is because of the absorption range expansion from uv light to all wavelength which can be attributed to the presence of a certain amount of go in the composites however the removal efficiency of otc under visible light was highly affected by ph and only slightly affected by the tss levels the change in the photocatalytic efficiency of otc via tio2 go is insignificant at nom concentrations between 0 5 mg l and 8 mg l alternately the removal efficiency of otc via tio2 go in real water samples decreases under solar and visible lights the water chemistry in real water samples can therefore play a prfound role in the degradation declaration of interests the

18734,with the widespread use of oxytetracycline otc residual otcs have been detected in natural surface waters as well as in water and wastewater treatment systems semiconductor photocatalysis has been proven to be a green and high performing method for the removal of organic contaminants however most photocatalysts are only effective when irradiated by uv light this study explores the efficiency of a new semiconductor photocatalysis method for otc removal under solar and visible light to expand the spectral range from the uv to the visible region a facile prepared ball like tio2 at graphene oxide tio2 go composite a tio2 associated catalyst was synthesized chemical characterization indicated that the tio2 go has the features of both tio2 and go with the regular tio2 fiber balls cladded by go nanosheets the photocatalytic activity of tio2 go composites under solar and visible light was evaluated in terms of otc degradation values of 100 and 90 otc removal efficiencies were achieved with tio2 go at 6 mg l under solar and visible light irradiation respectively the band structure of tio2 go expanded the spectral range to full light wavelengths facilitating formation of a light induced electron hole h which was identified in this study as the major cause of otc degradation the ph and tss levels 100 mg l were found to have high and low impacts respectively on the removal efficiency of otc while natural organic matter nom was found to have an insignificant impact furthermore the degradation of otc with catalysis by tio2 go was verified using two real water samples and averages of 90 and 75 otc removal efficiencies were achieved under solar and visible light respectively the results indicate that the synthesized tio2 go composites can provide an effective way of removing toxic organic compounds including otc from the water system keywords photocatalysis tio2 go composites real water visible light 1 introduction oxytetracycline otc is a

accelerated surface area and porosimetry system micromeritics co usa the uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were studied on a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2401 shimadzu kyoto japan with an integrated sphere attachment within the range of 200 800 nm 2 4 otc photodegradation photocatalytic activities were evaluated for the degradation of otc solution under solar and visible light irradiation synthetic and natural water samples a and b were investigated sample a was collected from the haihe river estuary in tianjin and sample b was collected from the hongni river in the jinnan district of tianjin without detectable otc a 500 w xenon lamp with 290 nm cutoff filter was used as a light source for solar light generation and a 420 nm cutoff filter was applied for visible light production a total of 10 40 mg of the tio2 go photocatalyst was dispersed in 20 mg l otc solution 50 ml container to determine the optimal catalyst quantity the ph of the solution was 6 78 prior to irradiation the suspended medium was magnetically stirred in the dark for several hours to study the absorption desorption equilibrium the lamp was then turned on and photodegradation was initiated at a given time interval 3 ml solution was sampled and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane cellulose acetate for otc determination soeborg et al 2004 wen et al 2010 the concentration and uv visible spectra were measured by a uv visible spectrophotometer the degree of degradation was expressed as ct c0 where c0 is the initial concentration and ct is the concentration at reaction time t duplicated examination was performed for all irradiation experiments 2 5 radical trapping experiment radical trapping experiments were conducted to detect the main active species for understanding the photocatalytic reaction mechanisms during the degradation of otc under solar light three trapping agents namely teoa ethanol and ipa were added as scavengers of hole h electron e and hydroxyl radicals oh respectively during the experiments 10 mm trapping agents were mixed into the samples prior to irradiation then the samples were collected for further analysis as described earlier 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tio2 go catalysts the chemical compositions of the synthesized tio2 go catalysts were characterized by xrd ftir and raman two synthetic precursors go and tio2 were used for comparison to elucidate the characteristics of tio2 go integrally as shown in fig 1 a the xrd patterns of tio2 go are well assigned to the standard card jcpds 21 1276 of rutile tio2 which is similar to tio2 the go peak around 10 2 theta on the xrd spectra is undetected in the tio2 go composite which can be due to the high temperature pyrolysis fig s1 no distinguishable diffraction peaks of other phases or impurities were observed in the patterns thereby indicating the high purity of the prepared tio2 go samples the ftir spectra of tio2 go catalysts fig 1b show the absorption bands corresponding to c o stretching at 1050 cm 1 c o c stretching at 1250 cm 1 c oh stretching at 1400 cm 1 c c stretching at 1620 cm 1 and c o carbonyl stretching at 1720 cm 1 xu et al 2008 they appear similar to the ftir spectra of go except for the oxygenated functional groups which were considerably descreased after solvothermal treatment the characterization indicated that the oxygenated functional groups of go were minimized during the synesthetic procedure and the chemical structure of go was mostly changed to the reduced go rgo like substance raman spectroscopy was further used to confirm the chemical compositions of tio2 go composites as shown in fig 1c raman modes at 125 196 243 423 650 and 857 cm 1 are characteristics of pure phase tio2 which are also exhibited in the tio2 go sample two main features g 1590 cm 1 and d 1358 cm 1 are found in the go and tio2 go samples zhang et al 2015 however the intensity ratio of i d i g was considerably changed at 1 05 for tio2 go composites compared to 0 76 for go indicating a decrease in the oxygen functional groups on the tio2 go surface which is consistent with the ftir results the xrd ftir and raman spectra all demonstrated that the synthetic tio2 go catalysts possess the characteristics of tio2 and go which can be effective in the subsequent degradation experiments the morphology size and structure of the prepared tio2 go composites were examined via sem and tem fig 2 a c shows typical sem images for the tio2 go composites the tio2 fiber balls exhibited a uniform spherical morphology consisting of regular nanorods and cladded by the go nanosheets the detailed morphology and microstructure of tio2 go composites were further visualized via tem as shown in fig 2d f the high resolution tem image fig 2f demonstrated that the crystalline lattice distance is 1 36 å corresponding to the 301 planes of tio2 which is consistent with the xrd results the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution plot of tio2 go and tio2 are shown in fig s2 the specific surface areas of tio2 go composites and pure tio2 were determined to be 78 12 and 57 01 m2 g respectively the increased surface area may be due to the addition of rgo composites in tio2 go the comparison indicates that the adsorption ability of tio2 go is about 37 higher than that of pristine tio2 3 2 degradation of otc via tio2 go under solar and visible light the photocatalytic activity of tio2 go composites was evaluated via otc degradation in an aqueous solution under irradiation with solar and visible light the initial concentration of the otc was 20 mg l the relatively high concentration of otc for the experiments was chosen based on previous studies in order to magnify the possible photocatalytic reaction in the study chen et al 2016 chen and liu 2017 jo et al 2017 zhao et al 2010 the uv visible spectra showed that the absorbance wavelength of otc was approximately 350 nm which can be used to reflect the concentration of otc fig s3 harja and ciobanu 2018 fig 3 a shows the adsorption equilibrium of otc in the dark under various concentrations of tio2 go composites 0 2 0 8 mg l with the increase in tio2 go concentrations at an equilibrium time of approximately 30 min the ct c0 of otc decreased an adsorption equilibrium time of 30 min was chosen for subsequent experiments as shown in fig 3b after 4 h of irradiation with solar light the photocatalytic removal efficiencies of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mg l tio2 go composites are 94 12 98 65 99 43 and 99 1 respectively the concentration of 0 6 mg l of tio2 go was selected as the optimal concentration for catalysis due to the relatively high removal efficiency and low catalysis concentration as shown in fig 3c and d the otc removal efficiencies of the synthesized tio2 go under irradiation with solar and visible light were evaluated p25 tio2 which is one of the best tio2 catalysts and rgo which has a similar graphene composition to tio2 go were used for comparison in the control test without any catalyst the decomposition of otc suggested that the photolysis of otc was not sensitive to the solar or visible light fig 3c and d as shown in fig 3c the removal efficiency of otc via p25 tio2 reached 100 in 120 min whereas it reached 100 via tio2 go in 240 min with a relatively low removal rate after the first hour as shown in the same figure the removal efficiency of otc via rgo was only 18 2 under solar light demonstrating that the basis of tio2 go composites rgo would not contribute to the otc degradation fig 3d shows the photocatalytic degradation of otc via the same catalysts under visible light the removal efficiencies of otc via 0 6 mg l p25 tio2 tio2 go composites and rgo were approximately 41 9 89 5 and 11 9 respectively after 4 h the photocatalytic removal efficiency of the tio2 go composites was considerably higher than that of p25 tio2 under visible light 3 3 mechanism of tio2 go on degradation of otc the photodegradation of organic materials is mainly attributed to the generation of electrons e and holes h during photocatalysis delaying the photogenerated electron hole pair recombination allows for more h to initiate redox reactions with organic pollutants chen et al 2016 chen and liu 2017 adeleye et al 2018 furthermore some reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical anion o2 and hydroxyl radical oh can be generated during the electron hole pair formation xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 these o2 and oh radicals as well as h readily react with organic contaminates such as otc and cause their mineralization chen and liu 2017 reshak 2018 to investigate the photocatalytic ability of the synthetic tio2 go composites corresponding characterizations were conducted the optical absorption properties and band structure of the tio2 go were examined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs p25 tio2 and pure tio2 were also measured for comparison as shown in fig 4 a the band gap absorption edge of p25 tio2 and pure tio2 were approximately 420 and 440 nm respectively suggesting that p25 tio2 and pure tio2 can mostly adsorb uv light and initiate light induced h and e however tio2 go is active and produces oxidative h at all light wavelengths during irradiation the expansion of the absorption range for tio2 go to 400 800 nm can be attributed to the presence of a certain amount of go in the composites which act as low charge bulk carriers during light adsorption the band gap energy of tio2 go is illustrated in fig 4b generally the band gap energy of a catalyst is estimated by the following formula αhν a hν eg n 2 where α ν eg and a are the absorption coefficient light frequency band gap and constant respectively for tio2 and tio2 go composites samples the value of n is 4 because of its indirect transition tian et al 2017 the band gap energy of tio2 go composites was approximately 2 8 ev which is lower than that of tio2 3 2 ev also indicating that tio2 go composites efficiently absorb visible light and can exhibit photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation tian et al 2017 to further evaluate the effects of produced ros and electron hole pairs on the degradation of otc the most effective ros adeleye et al 2018 hydroxyl radicals oh and h and e were separately eliminated during the reactions as o2 was generated from oh and their oxidizability was equivalent adeleye et al 2018 the o2 was not removed in this study as shown in fig 5 we used abundant trapping agents to quench the corresponding substance as follows teoa was used to quench h ethanol was used to eliminate e and ipa was used to minimize oh the degradation of otc via tio2 go without any scavengers is also shown in fig 5 for comparison results indicate that the oh and e did not affect the degradation of otc and that most of the degradation effects were from h however our results also show that the degradation of otc still occurred even without h implying that other effects can also contribute towards otc removal these other effects will be explored in more detail in future studies based on the foregoing characterization and removal efficiencies of otc the tio2 go composites in this study exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity under both simulated sunlight and visible light irradiation combining with the tem and sem examinations as well as previously published reports sampaio et al 2015 sun et al 2018 we can speculate that the hybrid nanostructures between go and tio2 can provide synergetic effects to slow down the recombination of photo or electrochemically generated h and e pairs enhance the charge transfer rate and increase the surface adsorption of molecules and eventually resulting in a promising photocatalytic ability lei et al 2014 wang et al 2013 furthermore drs and band gap energy results clearly showed that the adsorption wavelength was successfully expanded to the visible range which can be explained by the effectiveness of the low charge bulk carrier of go composites different from other synthetic photocatalysis the effects of produced ros on the degradation of otc was insignificant in this work 3 4 impact factors on degradation of otc the degradation of otc via tio2 go under visible light was considerably more effective than that of other tio2 based catalysts e g p25 and pure tio2 however the effectiveness of the photo degradation of tio2 go to otc under visible light is potentially subject to environmental factors such as ph nom or tss in water which hinder light transmission as shown in fig 6 a the otc degradation in the ph range 4 5 9 was evaluated over 4 h with the decrease in ph from 9 to 4 5 common ph in nature the adsorption and degradation of otc increased after 30 min equilibrium only 30 of otc was adsorbed onto tio2 go at ph 9 compared to 50 3 of otc adsorbed onto tio2 go at ph 4 5 approximately 78 3 of otc was removed in 240 min under visible light irradiation at ph 9 which increased to 91 2 at ph 4 5 slightly acidic conditions favored the formation of tio2 go in the removal of otc during water or wastewater treatment fig 6b shows the impact of nom on the degradation of otc via tio2 go to simulate the typical concentrations of nom in natural waters five different nom concentrations of 0 5 8 mg l were used as shown in the figure the removal efficiencies of otc with different nom concentrations were stable and mostly were in the range of 84 3 87 1 after 240 min as reported previously the presence of nom can affect the photodegradation in two opposite ways it could inhibit photodegradation by absorbing light or by acting as a quencher for photo excited molecules selli et al 1999 garbin et al 2007 on the flip side it might also act as a photosensitizer which may produce reactive oxygen species and enhance photodegradation sakkas et al 2002 garbin et al 2007 in the present work very little effect of nom on the degradation of otc was observed with nom concentrations of 0 5 8 mg l which is inconsistent with the literature and requires further investigation another important factor affecting photocatalysis in aqueous solution is tss light transmission is highly affected by suspended solids thus tss concentrations used in the experiment varied from 15 mg l to 250 mg l covering the range of concentrations from typical surface water to wastewater treatment work effluent the removal efficiency of otc decreased gradually from 89 2 15 mg l to 76 5 250 mg l within 4 h fig 6c however the removal efficiency only decreased when the tss concentration was higher than 100 mg l generally the otc concentrations released from wastewater treatment are less than 337 8 ng l wu et al 2016 the tss concentration is lower than 20 mg l according to gb18918 2002 fu et al 2018 thus the influence of tss on the degradation of otc via tio2 go is not significant 3 5 degradation of otc via tio2 go under solar and visible light in real surface water to validate the feasibility of synthetic tio2 go to degrade otc in real surface water systems two surface water samples which were collected from the haihe river estuary and the hongni river in tianjin china were studied under simulated solar and visible light in natural waters solar and visible lights responded to the photoactive ability of tio2 go on the degradation of organic compounds such as otc as the uv fraction of solar light is significantly filtered by increasing water depths helbling et al 2003 li et al 2012 piazena et al 2002 tedetti and sempere 2006 and the remaining fractions of solar light are visible as shown in table 1 water sample a has higher salt nom and tss concentrations than sample b the removal efficiencies of otc via tio2 go under solar and visible light are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the ct c0 of otc decreases under solar and visible light without any catalyst tio2 go this finding indicates that otc can self degrade slightly in natural water and that the removal efficiency decreases in deeper water under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 7a the removal efficiencies of otc via tio2 go under solar light were 87 8 and 94 5 for samples a and b respectively the removal efficiency slightly decreased in the real water samples compared with the removal efficiency in di water 100 within 4 h the removal efficiencies of otc under visible light were 67 8 and 78 1 for samples a and b respectively fig 7b compared with the results in fig 3d the removal efficiency of otc under visible light in real water samples especially for sample a had decreased significantly this result indicates that water chemistry such as ph inorganic ions and tss can partially affect the degradation of otc in real water as shown in table 1 the tss concentrations are remarkably low in the two water samples based on the previous discussion the tss concentrations in the surface water samples have a marginal effect on the otc removal the ph of samples a and b were 8 45 and 7 61 respectively fig 6a shows that the otc removal efficiency decreased considerably when the ph increased from 7 5 to 9 which can explain the difference in the otc removal efficiencies between samples a and b besides salt and ammonia can have negative effects on otc degradation moreover the existing ions or ammonia can occupy the possible adsorption site on tio2 go and thus prohibit the reaction with otc accordingly the removal efficiency of otc can be affected by several water conditions but it can also be remarkably high in real water samples after pretreatment with coagulation sedimentation and ph adjustment in wastewater the removal efficiency of otc via the tio2 go composites can be further improved whether in solar or visible light 4 conclusions tio2 go composites can effectively degrade otc under solar and visible light the h and e pairs were produced during the photocatalysis reaction and the production of h was identified as the major cause of otc removal the characteristics of the synthesized tio2 go indicated that the heterojunction between go and tio2 can promote the injection of electrons into go which serves as an electron sink and thereby delays recombination eventually resulting in the promising photocatalytic ability of tio2 go composites compared with other tio2 catalysts tio2 go composites yielded a better photocatalytic performance when used to degrade otc under visible light irradiation this is because of the absorption range expansion from uv light to all wavelength which can be attributed to the presence of a certain amount of go in the composites however the removal efficiency of otc under visible light was highly affected by ph and only slightly affected by the tss levels the change in the photocatalytic efficiency of otc via tio2 go is insignificant at nom concentrations between 0 5 mg l and 8 mg l alternately the removal efficiency of otc via tio2 go in real water samples decreases under solar and visible lights the water chemistry in real water samples can therefore play a prfound role in the degradation declaration of interests the
