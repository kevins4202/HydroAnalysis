13345,the contamination of water with heavy metals is a global issue its water solubility and non degradability nature convert it into a potential threat to human health as well as flora and fauna several methods have been applied for heavy metal removal from water using a different mechanism which differs in specification and removal efficacy activated carbon has recently attracted the attention of wastewater treatment industries because of its significantly high adsorption capacity against heavy metals the large surface area suitable surface functional groups and appropriate pore diameter make activated carbon a potential adsorbent significant advances have been recently reported to modify the activated carbon using physical chemical organic and inorganic loading techniques to improve the adsorption performance of activated carbon this review presents the recent advances in activated carbon preparation and modification for heavy metal removal from water different fabrication techniques and the mechanisms of heavy metal adsorption are also discussed in detail graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon heavy metal removal adsorption modification techniques 1 introduction heavy metal content in different water bodies has recently become a prime concern 1 although certain heavy metals function as micronutrients or macronutrients for plants and animals but their high concentration is intensively toxic for living organisms 2 long time exposure to heavy metals has been linked with severe hazards in the human body due to their cumulative accumulation and non degradable tendency 3 4 many heavy metal based compounds are highly soluble in the aqueous medium therefore quickly transferring into human and animal food chains and accumulating in the environment 5 copper nickel zinc lead and cadmium are the most widely used heavy metals in various industries including electroplating chemical manufacturing metallurgy mining and tannery 6 the decontamination of wastewater streams in these industries before discharging them into the river or pond becomes necessary to avoid the health and environmental impact of direct or indirect consumption of these metals 7 numerous disorders in human beings have been reported due to heavy metals ingestion for example exposure to lead has been linked to hypertension impaired renal function and cell degeneration 8 long term exposure to chromium can damage the liver kidney circulatory and nerve tissues as well as causes skin irritation at the same time arsenic and cadmium are known carcinogen metals and can cause cancer of the skin lungs liver and bladder 9 10 exposure to high levels of mercury can permanently damage the brain kidneys and developing fetuses it can affect brain functioning resulting in irritability shyness tremors changes in vision or hearing and memory problems 11 the world health organization who has recommended certain guidelines for drinking water quality specific guidelines for drinking water standard limit concentration of each heavy metal based on its toxicity and health impact 12 many researchers have joined the race in developing effective materials to solve this issue a significant number of scientific publications publish every year regarding water treatment and removal of different heavy metals as presented in fig 1 several approaches have been applied for heavy metal removals such as electrochemical treatment 13 membrane technology 14 chemical precipitation 15 solvent extraction 16 ion exchange 17 photocatalytic 18 and biosorption 19 activated carbon is an advanced adsorption material that has been prepared from different organic substances for water treatment applications 20 the high adsorption capacity of activated carbon is due to the small particle sizes maximum internal surface area and active free valences 21 alhashimi et al 22 assessed the adsorption capacity of activated carbon in comparison to biochar under an equivalent functional unit they reported that the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was higher than biochar for the removal of chromium and zinc metal ions while for other heavy metals including lead and copper the adsorption capacities were comparable other researchers have used different technologies based on photocatalysis hyphenated with adsorption and internal hole scavenging capacity for the reduction of aqueous heavy metal complexes and reported excellent adsorption capacity 23 24 activated carbon has gained considerable attention among scientists for the removal of heavy metals different techniques have been used to fabricate activated carbons from carbon rich source materials still many of these techniques did not reach the desired adsorption capacity or have high production costs 25 thus looking for more effective and cheap precursor materials and regeneration methods can lead the activated carbon to reach large scale water treatment currently the global demand for activated carbon is increasing in several markets including drinking water conditioning energy storage equipment and other environmental technologies driven by new legislation 26 however it has been estimated that the annual net value of different activated carbon markets is at 3 0 billion usd among these values about 50 of the carbon market is dominated by powdered activated carbon 30 by granular activated carbon and 20 by impregnated activated carbons 26 many review papers have been published discussing biochar and activated carbons either restricted in a particular topic such as fabrication techniques 27 adsorption mechanisms 28 factors affecting the adsorption 29 particular precursor 30 or adsorption of selected heavy metals 31 32 in this review we comprehensively introduce the sources of heavy metals in the water bodies and the health impacts resulting from heavy metals consumption through water and food this review also presents the properties of activated carbons produced from different precursor materials and the effect of preparation techniques on different functionalities the recent advances in modification techniques that have been used are critically discussed such as using chemical or physical agents loading organic or inorganic matters and other modification techniques 2 the impact of heavy metal pollution heavy metal pollutants is a term that predominantly refers to any metal or metal compound with a greater atomic density than 4 1 g cm3 33 the most typical and most abundant heavy metals in water and soil systems include cadmium cd copper cu mercury hg arsenic as chromium cr lead pb zinc zn iron fe manganese mn silver ag cobalt co and nickel ni 34 35 the rapid rise in population global economic growth and accelerated industrialization increased water pollution exceeding the safety standards of heavy metal concentration in many rivers lakes and groundwater kumar et al 36 conducted a global assessment of surface water bodies for over 30 years from 1994 to 2019 they reported that some heavy metals including cd co ni as cr and mn exceeded the who and the united states environmental protection agency usepa permissible limits in many water bodies the authors added that the examined water bodies in many countries are highly polluted by heavy metals such as cr co as and ni which showed maximum toxicity on the surface of the examined water reservoirs heavy metals present in the environment in different forms either in water which can be consumed directly or indirectly in plants watered with heavy metal polluted water or the tissues of farm animals consuming polluted plants or water however different heavy metal ions and compounds have been reported with varying mechanisms of toxic infestations 37 2 1 sources of heavy metals in water the natural sources of most heavy metals in water bodies mainly include geological weathering airborne dust and soil erosion 38 however due to the significant advances in anthropogenic activities a dramatic increase in heavy metal pollution has resulted in the aquatic environment 39 these activities include industrial discharges mining operations agricultural cultivation vehicular exhaust and atmospheric precipitation summarized in fig 2 40 rapid industrialization and the remarkable progress in new technologies in different aspects come at the cost of polluting the environment with heavy metals 41 various heavy metals have been reported to drill through different biogeochemical cycles eventually they enter the human food chain 42 which bioaccumulates and magnifies within the living tissues and poses a significant threat to human health 43 the crops and vegetables grown on heavy metal contaminated soil or irrigated with contaminated water have been linked with many human diseases 44 li et al 45 evaluated the health risk and the contamination level of selected heavy metals such as cd hg pb zn and cu in ten types of vegetables grown nearby a large scale lead zinc smelter industry in china the authors reported that leafy vegetables were more contaminated with pb and cd than non leafy vegetables and these two heavy metals contributed to the most significant health risk over 75 of vegetable samples within 4 km of the smelter exceeded the national and international food standard for pb by 47 and 7 of cd and hg standards two main parts of the vegetable plant for heavy metal uptake including leaf adsorption from the atmosphere and root absorption from water or soil 46 airborne particulate matters including heavy metals originate from transportation and some industrial activities in urban areas 47 48 however the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter varies depending on the emission source type of heavy metal and the interaction between the pollutants which affect atmospheric chemistry 49 heavy metals such as cd as cr and ni are found in industrial areas associated with airborne particles the airborne contamination of heavy metals is considered highly toxic to humans and animals and poses advert health effects even at low concentrations 50 51 heavy metals used in cultivation and agricultural practices are in the form of fertilizers pesticides and insecticides 52 environmental contamination can also occur through metal corrosion atmospheric deposition soil erosion of metal ions and leaching of heavy metals sediment re suspension and metal evaporation from water resources to soil and groundwater 53 2 2 health impact of heavy metal consumption heavy metals toxicity and adverse impact can either be acute or chronic effects depending on the concentration and exposure period long term exposure to heavy metal can progressively lead to various muscular physical and or neurological degenerative processes in the human body table 1 continuous exposure to heavy metals leads to chronic diseases such as alzheimer s disease muscular dystrophy multiple sclerosis and parkinson s disease 54 chronic exposure to cd was reported to cause kidney dysfunction lung cancer pulmonary adenocarcinomas and bone fractures which resulted from its ability to bind to vital proteins in the human body 55 56 lead is another heavy metal that has adverse effects on human blood enzymes and the central nervous system 57 other investigations have reported the long term exposure to a high dose of zn can cause cancer fertility impact and disturbance in cholesterol balance 58 60 chronic arsenic and or mercury exposure have been linked with hyperkeratosis kidney dysfunction skin lesions damage to the human central nervous system and several types of cancers 61 jaishankar et al 8 investigated several heavy metals toxicity mechanism and health effects they reported that the adverse impact of these metals differs based on the type of heavy metals lead causes oxidative stress out of free radical imbalance while mercury arsenic and chromium are characterized by harmful thiol or methyl derivative formation aluminum and cadmium act as cofactors or metal ion replacement and thus their chronic exposure led to their accumulation in human tissues hexavalent chromium ions can penetrate cell membranes and cause chronic disturbance in ion channels dna and protein damage 8 62 wilson s disease is a chronic disorder mainly caused by chronic copper exposure characterized by mental alterations dysphagia motor abnormalities ataxia renal dysfunction hemolytic anemia kidney stones and hepatic failure 63 heavy metals need to be closely monitored in the environment and human food putting in place appropriate checks and balances for preserving communities health and ensuring human health 3 activated carbon in water treatment applications activated carbon is a highly promising adsorbent material characterized by a large specific surface area high porosity high pore volume and adjustable surface properties in morphology and functional groups 75 it has been widely used in different applications including water treatment 76 77 activated carbon is obtained by the thermochemical conversion of organic materials at high temperatures and the absence of oxygen the raw material fabrication technique and conditions all have played a significant role in the adsorption efficiency of activated carbon 78 a uniformly distributed functional group and pore diameter of activated carbon work more efficiently for specific type s of heavy metals 3 1 fabrication of activated carbon the selection of the precursor material for activated carbon preparation depends on several factors including availability nonhazardous nature and production cost many studies reported better structural and textural characteristics upon using materials containing a high amount of fixed carbon and minimum ash 78 79 plant based materials have been extensively utilized in activated carbon production due to their high carbon content 80 different parts of plants are an important aspect of activated carbon fabrication the core stems peels fruits leaves shells flowers husks seeds and stones all have been used in different parameters and fabrication techniques 81 82 activated carbon from the date bead has been prepared by pyrolysis process at 300 c for 3 h and tested for pb ii adsorption from aqueous solutions and achieved an adsorption capacity of 76 7 mg g 83 however better adsorption capacity has been achieved with different biomass as discussed in the following sections aquatic biomass has also been used as activated carbon precursors such as fibers starch grass and cakes in addition to other non conventional precursors 80 carbonization is normally used before activating selected precursor material where it undergoes a thermal treatment known as pyrolysis to enrich carbon content in the precursor material 84 during the pyrolysis process the release of moisture and low molecular weight volatiles light aromatics and then hydrogen gas occur leaving a fixed carbonaceous skeleton 78 85 the pyrolyzed carbonaceous materials are found with limited porosity as most of the pores are filled with tarry materials thus an activation process is required to develop the specific characteristics of the nanocarbon daud et al 86 stated that the selection of carbonization parameters including temperature followed by heating rate and the residence time has a significant influence on the porosity and adsorption performance of the final product 87 hydrothermal treatment has also been used to converts the saccharides in the precursor material into carbon spheres which exhibit relatively low specific surface areas the carbonaceous materials prepared by this approach do not require grinding of material before activation treatment and typically have low ash content 88 additional physical chemical or mixture of physico chemical treatments are needed to activate the carbonaceous material to increase porosity and the numbers of functional groups that contain oxygen present on the surfaces of the activated carbon 89 fig 3 presents a summary of the biomass conversion into activated carbon numerous physical and chemical activator species have been used including koh water vapor zncl2 co2 h3po4 etc 90 92 the koh based chemical activation was better than the physical steam activation in porosity development total pore volume and specific surface area 93 huang et al 94 used koh at 800 c for the chemical activation of different precursors for activated carbon production they reported significantly higher specific surface area and abundant oxygen containing functional groups resulting in negative surface charges song et al 93 compared physical and chemical activation methods steam and koh for activated carbon preparation and their adsorption performance the authors reported better results with the chemical activation than the physical steam activation regarding total pore volume the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and porosity development numerous studies have shown that compared to regular biomass adsorbents the activated carbon prepared from biomass raw materials possesses good adsorption capacity to various heavy metal ions 77 95 the biomass materials chemical or physical activation significantly enhances their adsorption capacity against heavy metals 96 refer to table 2 for the comparison of physical and chemical activation methods of varying biomass precursor materials 3 2 properties and mechanisms of heavy metal adsorption surface active functional groups surface area and cation exchange capacity are the three essential factors that affect the adsorption capacity of activated carbon to heavy metals 35 however the smaller particle size the greater surface area and suitable surface functional groups increased adsorption capacity 108 109 the overall mechanism of action for heavy metal adsorption is complex as it varies depending on the precursor materials and the type s of heavy metal 33 various adsorption mechanisms have been investigated including physical adsorption electrostatic adsorption ion exchange complexation precipitation and reduction lu et al 110 investigated the adsorption mechanism of pb2 by sludge activated carbon and reported three critical roles for adsorption including ion exchange surface functional groups and surface precipitation it s known that the mechanism of adsorption involves a combination of multiple mechanisms and not attributable to a single mechanism physical adsorption of heavy metals is caused by the van der waals forces that happened between activated carbon surface molecules and heavy metal ions 111 however this adsorption affinity is caused by intermolecular forces which tend to be weak and could be reversible 112 ion exchange is a non specific adsorption mechanism that possesses low adsorption capacity that involves the physical exchange of ions and coulombic force between the positively charged heavy metal ions in aqueous solution and negatively charged activated carbon surface groups 113 the ion exchange reaction between the ions has proceeded rapidly and it was found to be ph dependent 114 115 chen et al 116 investigated the adsorption mechanism of sludge based activated carbon on both cr3 and cr6 ions they revealed that the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon on cr3 was more significant due to the ion exchange between mg2 in activated carbon and cr3 and ca2 ions refer to fig 4 for the summary of different adsorption mechanisms of heavy metals electrostatic interactions between heavy metals surface charges and activated carbon are another mechanism of adsorption depending on charges of electrostatic attraction 117 dong et al 118 stated that the strength of electrostatic interactions is also a ph dependent interaction the valence state of the metal ions the ionic radius as well as the zero potential of activated carbon park et al 119 stated that the significant increase in adsorption capacity of cu2 by porphyra tenera derived activated carbon at alkaline ph values was due to the rise in charge differences compared with neutral and acidic conditions under the influence of electrostatic forces heavy metals carry more charges at a higher valence state resulting in stronger electrostatic interactions and better adsorption capacity redox affects the chemical behavior biological effectiveness of elements and the migration ability of the heavy metal by changing their existing forms especially those with variable valence yuan et al 120 stated the significant impact of redox on distributing morphological heavy metals the precipitation effect occurs with activated carbon that contains soluble carbonate and or phosphate which can co precipitate with many heavy metals such as cd2 pb2 and pb 121 the more mineral elements in the activated carbon the increased absorption capacity due to increased active sites wang et al 122 reported that the porous structure of activated carbon results in increased specific surface energy the smaller the particle size the better adsorption capacity as they provide additional effective sites for heavy metal adsorption the variety of functional groups on the surface of activated carbon such as the carboxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and amino groups carry different charges and exhibit good affinity towards heavy metal cations 123 qin et al 124 treated the coconut shell based granular activated carbon with nitric acid they reported that oxidation treatment of activated carbon distinctly decreased the surface area still it significantly increased the content of surface functional groups that contain oxygen and thus enhanced the adsorption capacity to heavy metals 125 it has been shown that the adsorption of different heavy metals by activated carbons greatly relies on three main factors including particular surface area particular surface functionality and surface acidity 126 increasing the surface area alone may not lead to an increase in the adsorption capacity however enhancing the electrostatic attraction of the activated carbon by increasing its negative charge led to good adsorption characteristics as most heavy metal ions are positively charged 127 many researchers have experimented on the adsorption efficiency of activated carbon with the alteration of preparation parameters table 3 the nature of raw materials and activation temperature influenced the activated carbon s physicochemical properties and thus adsorption efficiency various modification techniques have been used to increase the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for heavy metal ions burakov et al 140 modified the activated carbon with carbon nano tubes by chemical vapor deposition to effectively remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions and reported that the nano modification of activated carbon increased their equilibrium adsorption of heavy metals ni2 and co2 by 10 30 owing to the hollow and layered structures in addition to the tunable surface chemistry of carbon nano tubes the adsorption of heavy metals was found to occur predominantly on its outer surface zheng et al 141 used different activation and modification approaches using n doping of biomass activated carbon with dicyandiamide was performed via an ultrasonic method and a redox method the authors reported a significant increase in the divalent copper ion adsorption efficiency using the n doping modification method however previous researchers noted that the direct impregnation of activated carbon with nitrogen reagents had some problems such as long modification cycles and low doping amount led to adsorption performance of products that were not visibly improved 142 143 the use of strong oxidants to modify activated carbon at high temperatures posed high risks it excessively destroyed the original porous structure of activated carbon resulting in a reduced adsorption capacity 141 4 modifications of activated carbon for better adsorption of heavy metals in recent years a large number of investigations have shown the possibility of increasing the adsorption capacity of activated carbon by modification approaches 144 the precursor material after the pyrolysis process requires physical or chemical activation the type of raw material heating rate duration of activation or combination of these significantly influence the adsorption efficiency ogungbenro et al 145 found that preparation conditions and activation agents had markedly affected the adsorption performance the specific surface area of the activated carbon can be significantly increased by using modification agents and altering the number and distribution of the surface functional groups leading to improve the adsorption capacity towards heavy metals in polluted water 146 rice husk based nano activated carbon has shown good adsorption performance in water treatment applications in heavy metal ions and organic molecules it was significantly enhanced by varying physical and chemical activations 147 148 the modification techniques of activated carbon can be classified into three main categories physical modifications chemical modifications and organic or inorganic loading modification physical activation is usually conducted at high temperatures with variation in heating rates and activation duration in nitrogen oxygen or a water vapor atmosphere 149 in comparison chemical activation is performed directly or indirectly in the presence of inert gas by using different activating agents such as koh zncl2 k2co3 or h3po4 at high temperatures 150 151 generally the chemical activation can be performed in a shorter time and lower energy consumption than the physical activation particularly upon using the koh as an activator 152 the treatment of the activated carbon with koh resulted in the complete removal of carboxy and lactone groups it decreased the general content of the acidic groups more significant than that of basic groups 153 simultaneously the surface concentration of hydroxyl groups increased leading to enhancing the adsorption capacity to heavy metal ions by the mechanisms discussed earlier 4 1 physical modifications techniques a variety of physical activation methods have been used to modify activated carbon including microwave heating ultraviolet steam modification etc 127 154 high temperature activation before the activating agent s treatment was found to increase the porosity and surface area of the activated carbon which may lead to better adsorption capacity 155 contemporary researchers aim to enhance activated carbon performance by changing the pyrolysis temperature heating time heating rate and heating methods such as ultraviolet and microwave radiation 156 4 1 1 microwave heating microwave heating has attracted considerable attention in the preparation of activated carbon compared with the conventional heating process it has been used to prepare mesoporous activated carbon with increased specific surface area and a little low in oxygen containing acidic surface groups 157 hesas et al 158 prepared activated carbon using microwave heating instead of traditional heating and they reported significant differences in pore structure as well as chemical properties the cotton stalk treated with different concentrations of zncl2 solutions and the effects of microwave radiation power on the capacity of adsorption and yield of activated carbon were evaluated 159 the reported yield of activated carbon was increased gradually with the increase of microwave power liu et al 160 modified bamboo based activated carbon using a microwave oven under n2 atmosphere and observed a gradual decrease in the surface acidic groups and enhanced surface basicity the authors reported an increase in the pore diameter of micropores till they achieve a microporous size range the authors also reported enhanced adsorption properties in the modified activated carbon compared with the unmodified one due to the enlargement of the micropores in a different study co2 microwave was used to alter commercial coal based granular activated carbon resulting in a significant pore expanding 161 the mesopore volume significantly increased and a hierarchical pore structure was formed due to decreasing carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl surface groups which also enhanced the surface charge density jiang et al 162 used ultrasound and microwave fig 5 energy to synthesize modified copper activated carbon with significantly higher adsorption capacity than the control without cu doped activated carbon due to its larger surface area and enhanced pore structure during pyrolysis gas formation such as co h2 co2 and ch4 can promote pores formation however using microwave heating can significantly reduce reaction time thus resulting in enhanced pore uniformity 163 in a recent investigation li et al 164 prepared a series of activated carbon adsorbents from various biomasses by using microwave activation the study revealed that the removal capacity of the activated carbon after microwave activation against mercury was significantly higher than that prepared without microwave activation in another study abas et al 165 reported a larger specific surface area in microwave activated adsorbents compared to conventional heat activated preparations in a related study the biomass of porous activated carbons modified with microwave exhibited the best mercury adsorption performance at 130 c 166 the same authors changed the hydrogen peroxide within the microwave activated adsorbents and reported a significant increase in the specific surface area and improved pore structures after the impregnation of precursor with h2o2 the number of surface functional groups increased leading to enhanced hg0 removal performance 166 4 1 2 ultrasound irradiation ultrasound irradiation is another modification technique regarded as motivation force for chemical process which accelerates mass transfer to follow acoustic cavitation leading to the generation of final acoustic streaming the sonic waves are creating microscopic turbulence within the activated carbon 167 168 heidarinejad et al 169 used low frequency ultrasound to enhance the adsorption property of activated carbon they concluded that low frequency ultrasound was able to increase both the rate and amount of methylene blue adsorption onto the activated carbon dil et al 170 synthesized and loaded gold magnetic nanocomposite modified by ultrasound wave on activated carbon using simple fast and low cost process the results revealed that the ultrasound assisted adsorption method showed a remarkable adsorption ability compared to the control it was related to high pressure shock waves and high speed micro jets during the cavitation bubbles violent collapse 171 ultrasonic radiation in aqueous solutions was found to increase the production and destruction of gas bubbles resulting in temporary high pressure and temperature levels followed by the production of various free agents such as oh and ooh in the water su et al 172 found that the solvent enters the bubbles within the activated carbon and inflates them until the whole bubbles eventually collapse and release some energy the released energy significantly accelerates the feasibility of other activators such as chemical agents yu et al 173 used the nitric acid oxidation process together with microwave and sonication to enhance the adsorption capacity of activated carbon fiber the authors reported that the microwave assisted oxidation process significantly enhanced cu ii adsorption due to increased ultra micro pore volume and polar oxygen containing groups many studies reported the successful acceleration of chemical reactions by using ultrasonic waves 174 175 nasseh et al 176 prepared powdered activated carbon using the peganum harmala seeds as the precursor and ultrasonic waves as modification accelerator for the production adsorbent for scavenging cr vi from the wastewater the authors found that the modified powdered activated carbon possessed excellent and enhanced adsorptive properties in morphology surface area pore size and functional groups with an excellent adsorption capacity against cr vi ions furthermore the authors achieved efficient regenerations of the activated carbon by integrating the sonication assisted pickling regeneration process 4 1 3 non thermal plasma technology non thermal plasma technology has attracted significant attention for modifying activated carbon s surface to produce chemically active species with better adsorption performance 174 175 kodama et al 176 reported that the amount of surface acidic functional groups in the activated carbon was significantly increased by non thermal plasma modification and achieved effective adsorption of copper ions from an aqueous solution other studies used gliding arc discharge plasma to modify the surface of activated carbon for enhancing copper adsorption 177 178 non thermal plasma can introduce oxygen functional groups on the surface of the activated carbon which improves the removal efficiency against the hg ions 174 ji et al 179 used non thermal plasma as a cost effective and efficient approach to modify the activated carbon and accelerate its reaction with h2s and so2 for improving the removal of elemental mercury the authors found that non thermal plasma treatment accelerated the reaction between h2s and so2 at the surface of activated carbon resulted in a non significant change in surface morphology and surface area however more sulfur was observed on the surface of the activated carbon in a very short time which increased removal efficiency of hg by 70 approximately wu et al 180 used a novel modification technique based on dielectric barrier discharge non thermal plasma for the modification of phosphoric acid treated activated carbon to enrich its adsorption capacity for cu ii the authors indicated that their modified activated carbon had much higher adsorption capacity for cu ii irrespective of different adsorption conditions interestingly the adsorption capacity has a non monotonic variation with the plasma based modification time i e increasing at first and then decreasing at the optimum modification time the authors achieved an improved adsorption capacity of 150 compared to that of non modified activated carbon however the adsorption capacity was found to have an exponential relationship with carboxylic group and significant linear relation with both pyrophosphates and phosphates groups the results indicated the importance of these functional groups in the adsorption process fig 6 presents the illustration of the surface modification of phosphoric acid activated carbon using non thermal plasma 4 1 4 steam activation steam activation is a typical process used to modify the activated carbon by increasing its surface porosity to enhance the adsorption of heavy metals and eliminate impurities that may result from incomplete combustion 181 shim et al 182 found that miscanthus activated carbon modified with steam at 800 c showed a significant change in cu adsorption than the original one generated by the slow pyrolysis process at 500 c moreover the authors reported enhanced surface area porosity and aromaticity of the modified activated carbon but decrease in surface functional groups similarly lou et al 183 observed that steam modification of pine sawdust activated carbon enhanced the surface area but slightly reduced functional groups density at the surface steam treatment of activated carbon looks more efficient for heavy metals sorption especially when employed before the second pretreatment phase which results in the formation of surface functional groups necessary for heavy metals adsorption 4 2 chemical modification techniques numerous modification and functionalization techniques have been tried to improve the adsorption efficiencies of different activated carbon against heavy metals strong acids bases polymers and other chemical agents were investigated to modify the activated carbon surface functional groups and surface area 184 4 2 1 acidic treatment acids have been used for activated carbon modification which can interact with the mineral components in the activated carbon due to their oxidation capability and corrosiveness this process makes the void structure of the activated carbon more ideal with increased specific surface area and enhanced adsorption capacity 185 chen et al 186 modified granular activated carbon by using critic acid and reported a 140 enhancement in heavy metal absorptivity than unmodified granular activated carbon in another study lu et al 187 fabricated a modified activated carbon fibers with chemical grafting using amidoxime which improved uranium vi adsorption by 172 similarly 120 enhancement in cu ii adsorption was achieved using 15 sodium acetate treatment to activated carbon 188 phosphoric acid activation is another method widely used to produce and modify activated carbons introducing a significant amount of phosphorus atoms into the carbon network structure 189 many studies reported other specific acid surface groups in phosphorus containing activated carbons which play a crucial role in heavy metal adsorption 190 191 valentín reyes et al 192 used nitric acid and ammonia treatment for activated carbon surface modification the modified activated carbon was used for hexavalent chromium cr vi removal from aqueous solutions the authors proposed the mechanism of adsorption based on the changes in the surface chemistry of the modified activated carbon adsorption reduction and desorption experiments the edta modified carbon materials have been widely used for heavy metal removal lv et al 193 used edta to modify bamboo activated carbon bac in the presence of tetraethyl orthosilicate as a crosslinking agent to get bac sio2 edta and used it for removal of pb ii and cu ii the authors reported that the edta molecules on the surface of the activated carbon increased the pore size and significantly increased the adsorption capacities from 45 to 123 mg g and from 6 to 42 mg g for the pb ii and cu ii respectively the removal of these heavy metal ions promoted by edta presented on the surface of the activated carbon the increase in adsorption was due to the electrostatic attractions and the complexation between the edta and heavy metal ions the adsorption results demonstrated that edta modified activated carbon is a potential adsorbent for the heavy metal contaminated wastewater fig 7 presents the preparation and the adsorption mechanisms of edta modified activated carbon acid functional groups were vital in the hexavalent chromium removal the oxidized adsorbents were responsible for 50 of cr vi reduction to cr iii whereas 35 resulted from the heat treated adsorbents only 20 resulted from ammonia treated activated carbon 192 polymer hydrogels have recently played an important role in water treatment applications the absorption of heavy metal ions onto hydrogel was due to the ability of ions to swell in water and thus achieve high uptake 194 ge et al 195 synthesized polyacrylic acid modified activated carbon which was used in fabricating the ear like nano sheet material having thickness 40 nm and diameter 300 nm the introduction of the carboxylic acid functional groups in the modified activated carbon exhibited a marked increase in heavy metal adsorption only in 15 min of contact time the maximum adsorption capacity reached 473 2 mg g for cd ii this novel fabrication method of using polymeric acids modification is fast and gives excellent adsorption capacity for heavy metal removal edta is an amino polycarboxylic acid a chelating agent known to react with many heavy metals and form stable complexes 196 incorporating a stable complex in the bamboo activated carbon edta modification enhanced its adsorption performance against heavy metals 193 4 2 2 alkaline treatment the chemical activation through strong bases can be performed in a shorter time and lower energy consumption than the physical modification a specific example of a strong base koh has been reported to be the fastest chemical activator 152 arunachalam et al 197 developed a low cost activated carbon prepared from date seeds and modify the surface functional groups with koh and reported a significant enhancement in the adsorption capacity compared with the unmodified activated carbon at higher than 700 c koh vapor has been reported to erode the carbon material s lattices and thus produce a large number of micropores 156 in a recent investigation lv et al 198 prepared rice husk based activated carbon using different activation techniques the authors used simultaneous koh activation and edta 4na modification after the carbonization of rice husk at 500 c and reported the largest bet surface area 2087 m2 g among the prepared activated carbons the activated carbon can also be modified using other chemical approaches such as the virtue of redox reaction solvent impregnation acid base treatment metal loading electrochemical and plasma modification etc 199 additionally heteroatom doping and loading are effective approaches in adjusting the chemical properties of the nano activated carbon to be enhanced and selectively adsorb heavy metal ions 200 201 li et al 202 prepared a la oh 3 modified magnetic biochar using pineapple waste as a precursor material and reported that the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of la oh 3 content the activated carbon modified with naoh enhanced its cation exchange capacity and increased surface area high total pore and mesopore volumes 203 although not much has been done regarding alkaline modification of activated carbons such modification techniques can change the surface active groups which enhance the adsorption of heavy metal ions 204 4 2 3 other chemical agents a variety of chemical compounds and methods have been investigated in the recent past for activated carbon surface modification rivera utrilla et al 205 tried vulcanization and ammoniation treatment processes for the production of activated carbon with high polarity and alkalinity the polarity and alkalinity in the activated carbon improve the adsorption capacity zhang et al 206 stated that it is better to graft the activated carbon with some coordinate ligands to enhance the complexation adsorption of heavy metals polyethyleneimine is a typical polyamine used to modify activated carbon surface for high selective adsorption capacity for metal ions it has excellent reactivity and could alter the surface functional groups easily 207 ma et al 146 prepared acid alkali treated rice husk activated carbon and modified it with a solution of polyethyleneimine the authors observed that the excess amino group occurrence at the surface of modified activated carbon substantially increased cr vi adsorption in a recent investigation xie et al 208 modified the activated carbon using linear polyethyleneimine for cd ii adsorption they reported a significant enhancement in adsorption capacity compared to unmodified activated carbon the enhancement in adsorption capacity was justified with the successful load of polyethyleneimine on the surface of the activated carbon the adsorption capacity was ph dependent with a maximum value of 45 mg g at 6 7 ph values however the improved adsorption capacity of different chemical modifications encourages the researcher to investigate the safe and non toxic chemicals activators mercury ions were removed from contaminated wastewater samples using fir wood sawdust derived thiol incorporated activated carbon which showed high removal efficiency the removal capacity was increased with increasing adsorbent dosage 209 saleh et al 210 synthesized polyethyleneimine modified activated carbon using a facile hydrothermal method for the removal of hg ii ions the adsorption efficiency of the modified activated carbon was notable with high regeneration efficiency suggesting polyethylenimine modification of activated carbon was a low cost modification technique 4 3 organic and inorganic loading several organic and inorganic materials have recently been investigated to add oxygen containing functional groups in activated carbons the oxygen bearing functional groups in the activated carbon have to decrease the electrostatic repulsion of heavy metals ions in an aqueous solution 211 212 ferric ions are known to be readily adsorbed onto the activated carbon due to their high positive charges thus loading such ions onto the activated carbon will enhance its dispersion and adsorption capacity 213 deng et al 214 fabricated an activated carbon from the pristine source of feedstock and modified its surface with chitosan and pyromellitic dianhydride the modification was found to be effective in the adsorption of pb cu and cd ions the altered activated carbon possessed an increased number of surface functional groups such as cc n c o and n mainly responsible for heavy metals adsorption similarly zhou et al 215 also used chitosan solution to modify the activated carbon surface they observed that the chitosan modified activated carbon showed enhanced removal capacity against pb ion than the non modified activated carbon obtained from the same raw material in a recent investigation li et al 216 fabricated nano sized hematite modified activated carbon using α fe2o3 nanoparticles as a coating agent fig 8 a facile impregnation approach was used in this fabrication to enhance the removal of hexavalent chromium ions from wastewater the authors reported that modified activated carbon removed hexavalent chromium with a three times higher efficiency 94 than the non modified activated carbon the kinetic study revealed that the removal process well fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model and it was ph dependent the authors were able to regenerate the used activated carbon by 0 1 m hcl which showed good stability and a slight drop in removal efficiency until 80 after four adsorption desorption cycles the results suggested great potential in modifying the activated carbon for efficient heavy metal ions removal from aqueous solutions iron oxide nanoparticle has recently gained the attraction of many scientists to solve heavy metal pollution and another environment related issue 217 it has high potentials in removing various kinds of contaminants from the air water and soil through adsorption as well as photo degradation mechanism 218 furthermore the deteriorating quality of drinking water and heavy metal pollution concerns has led the researchers to use iron oxide nanoparticles with the activated carbon as a new generation adsorbents for water treatment 219 xu et al 220 tailored ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid di anhydride treated iron oxide baker s yeast biomass for heavy metal removal from aqueous solution and reported significant adsorption potentials similarly affam et al 221 modified the activated carbon using iron oxide and reported a significant enhancement in boron and organic pollutants removal from wastewater nanoparticles of iron oxide sunflower head waste activated carbon have been fabricated by jain et al 222 they used the co precipitation technique for removing cu ii cr vi and cd ii ions from aqueous solution the authors reported different optimum adsorption conditions for each heavy metal the adsorption of the nanoparticles was found to be endothermic and the authors were able to regenerate an effective nano activated carbon and reuse it after four adsorption desorption cycles fig 9 presents a schematic illustration of the adsorption mechanisms of the nano iron oxide sunflower head waste activated carbon composites and sem images some functional groups on the surface of activated carbon such as oxygenated and phosphate groups were found to promote metal particle chelation these metallic particles are directly responsible for heavy metal adsorption granular activated carbon was impregnated with ferrous chloride through a new multi step procedure and modified with naoh to stabilize the iron in granular activated carbon 223 the surface modified activated carbon showed a significant increase in arsenic adsorption capacity with the increased amount of impregnated iron decreasing with higher amounts of iron gallios et al 224 investigated the ability of iron modified activated carbons for arsenic ions removal they revealed that the iron modification causes a significant increase in as v ion removal efficiency from about 4 mg g non modified activated carbon to 11 05 mg g iron modified activated carbon however the mn incorporation in activated carbon showed even further increased the adsorption capacity to 19 35 mg g the mn incorporation was found to affect the textural properties of the activated carbon as reveled by the increase of crystallinity and decrease of the surface area 4 4 other modification techniques coating with carbon rich materials onto the activated carbon has been used to enhance their heavy metal adsorption capacity many researchers used graphene oxide as a precursor material for the preparation of graphene which possesses high sorption potential for many heavy metals 225 graphene oxide coated activated carbon has been fabricated to increase its adsorption capacity against heavy metals 226 227 these coated composites were produced by treating activated carbon feedstock in a suspension of graphene oxide before the pyrolysis process the process was resulting in higher surface area and additional surface oxygen rich groups the graphene molecules are capable of integrating within the composite structures after the pyrolysis process 226 227 table 4 presents the comparative summary of activated carbon surface modification techniques their advantages and disadvantages 35 5 potential and challenges for modified activated carbons in the commercial application production of cheap and efficient activated carbon has become crucial because of its increasing demand for various applications apart from adsorption such as catalysts gas storage fuel cell and drug carrier material 234 235 the use of agricultural and industrial waste materials including grass clippings bamboo fibers cocoa shells rice husk waste wood chips sawdust waste and horse manure has significantly lowered the production costs of activated carbon 236 however adsorbent s cost is seldom reported in the research papers especially no detailed information about the cost of production has been reported in the literature for different modification methods physical modifications of activated carbon through microwave ultrasound irradiation steam or non thermal plasma are economically viable processes león et al 237 developed a conceptual design of an industrial production plant for activated carbon it can process 31 25 tons day of industrial waste nutshells using physical techniques and reported a total cost of approximately usd 2 15 per kilogram final activated carbon product the authors estimated the net present value for a 15 year production project of usd 4 519 482 the internal return rate at 23 the return on investment 24 and the discounted payback period after the fifth year of production the costs of chemical modifications are slightly higher than physical modification however treatment of the leftover hazardous chemicals used during modification is another essential drawback 238 in a recent study lai et al 239 conducted a techno economic assessment of oil palm based activated carbon production at a pilot plant scale the cost evaluation was performed using different pre and post activation surface modification methods the results revealed that the physical activation process required lower fixed capital investment usd 2 120 000 and annual operating cost usd 1 530 000 compared to chemical and physico chemical activation processes cost the chemical and physico chemical process of activated carbon production required a total fixed capital investment of usd 6 320 000 and total annual operating cost of usd 2 570 000 future researchers should focus on safe and cost effective modification methods to produce highly efficient activated carbons for example plasma technique may provide a promising solution for activated carbon modification to selectively separate heavy metals from aqueous solution without the need for other chemical agents and thus avoid the potential chemical pollution and reduce the costs of extra materials 6 conclusion heavy metals and their compounds are known for their toxic hazardous and carcinogenic effects on humans and even animals who are

13345,the contamination of water with heavy metals is a global issue its water solubility and non degradability nature convert it into a potential threat to human health as well as flora and fauna several methods have been applied for heavy metal removal from water using a different mechanism which differs in specification and removal efficacy activated carbon has recently attracted the attention of wastewater treatment industries because of its significantly high adsorption capacity against heavy metals the large surface area suitable surface functional groups and appropriate pore diameter make activated carbon a potential adsorbent significant advances have been recently reported to modify the activated carbon using physical chemical organic and inorganic loading techniques to improve the adsorption performance of activated carbon this review presents the recent advances in activated carbon preparation and modification for heavy metal removal from water different fabrication techniques and the mechanisms of heavy metal adsorption are also discussed in detail graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon heavy metal removal adsorption modification techniques 1 introduction heavy metal content in different water bodies has recently become a prime concern 1 although certain heavy metals function as micronutrients or macronutrients for plants and animals but their high concentration is intensively toxic for living organisms 2 long time exposure to heavy metals has been linked with severe hazards in the human body due to their cumulative accumulation and non degradable tendency 3 4 many heavy metal based compounds are highly soluble in the aqueous medium therefore quickly transferring into human and animal food chains and accumulating in the environment 5 copper nickel zinc lead and cadmium are the most widely used heavy metals in various industries including electroplating chemical manufacturing metallurgy mining and tannery 6 the decontamination of wastewater streams in these industries before discharging them into the river or pond becomes necessary to avoid the health and environmental impact of direct or indirect consumption of these metals 7 numerous disorders in human beings have been reported due to heavy metals ingestion for example exposure to lead has been linked to hypertension impaired renal function and cell degeneration 8 long term exposure to chromium can damage the liver kidney circulatory and nerve tissues as well as causes skin irritation at the same time arsenic and cadmium are known carcinogen metals and can cause cancer of the skin lungs liver and bladder 9 10 exposure to high levels of mercury can permanently damage the brain kidneys and developing fetuses it can affect brain functioning resulting in irritability shyness tremors changes in vision or hearing and memory problems 11 the world health organization who has recommended certain guidelines for drinking water quality specific guidelines for drinking water standard limit concentration of each heavy metal based on its toxicity and health impact 12 many researchers have joined the race in developing effective materials to solve this issue a significant number of scientific publications publish every year regarding water treatment and removal of different heavy metals as presented in fig 1 several approaches have been applied for heavy metal removals such as electrochemical treatment 13 membrane technology 14 chemical precipitation 15 solvent extraction 16 ion exchange 17 photocatalytic 18 and biosorption 19 activated carbon is an advanced adsorption material that has been prepared from different organic substances for water treatment applications 20 the high adsorption capacity of activated carbon is due to the small particle sizes maximum internal surface area and active free valences 21 alhashimi et al 22 assessed the adsorption capacity of activated carbon in comparison to biochar under an equivalent functional unit they reported that the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was higher than biochar for the removal of chromium and zinc metal ions while for other heavy metals including lead and copper the adsorption capacities were comparable other researchers have used different technologies based on photocatalysis hyphenated with adsorption and internal hole scavenging capacity for the reduction of aqueous heavy metal complexes and reported excellent adsorption capacity 23 24 activated carbon has gained considerable attention among scientists for the removal of heavy metals different techniques have been used to fabricate activated carbons from carbon rich source materials still many of these techniques did not reach the desired adsorption capacity or have high production costs 25 thus looking for more effective and cheap precursor materials and regeneration methods can lead the activated carbon to reach large scale water treatment currently the global demand for activated carbon is increasing in several markets including drinking water conditioning energy storage equipment and other environmental technologies driven by new legislation 26 however it has been estimated that the annual net value of different activated carbon markets is at 3 0 billion usd among these values about 50 of the carbon market is dominated by powdered activated carbon 30 by granular activated carbon and 20 by impregnated activated carbons 26 many review papers have been published discussing biochar and activated carbons either restricted in a particular topic such as fabrication techniques 27 adsorption mechanisms 28 factors affecting the adsorption 29 particular precursor 30 or adsorption of selected heavy metals 31 32 in this review we comprehensively introduce the sources of heavy metals in the water bodies and the health impacts resulting from heavy metals consumption through water and food this review also presents the properties of activated carbons produced from different precursor materials and the effect of preparation techniques on different functionalities the recent advances in modification techniques that have been used are critically discussed such as using chemical or physical agents loading organic or inorganic matters and other modification techniques 2 the impact of heavy metal pollution heavy metal pollutants is a term that predominantly refers to any metal or metal compound with a greater atomic density than 4 1 g cm3 33 the most typical and most abundant heavy metals in water and soil systems include cadmium cd copper cu mercury hg arsenic as chromium cr lead pb zinc zn iron fe manganese mn silver ag cobalt co and nickel ni 34 35 the rapid rise in population global economic growth and accelerated industrialization increased water pollution exceeding the safety standards of heavy metal concentration in many rivers lakes and groundwater kumar et al 36 conducted a global assessment of surface water bodies for over 30 years from 1994 to 2019 they reported that some heavy metals including cd co ni as cr and mn exceeded the who and the united states environmental protection agency usepa permissible limits in many water bodies the authors added that the examined water bodies in many countries are highly polluted by heavy metals such as cr co as and ni which showed maximum toxicity on the surface of the examined water reservoirs heavy metals present in the environment in different forms either in water which can be consumed directly or indirectly in plants watered with heavy metal polluted water or the tissues of farm animals consuming polluted plants or water however different heavy metal ions and compounds have been reported with varying mechanisms of toxic infestations 37 2 1 sources of heavy metals in water the natural sources of most heavy metals in water bodies mainly include geological weathering airborne dust and soil erosion 38 however due to the significant advances in anthropogenic activities a dramatic increase in heavy metal pollution has resulted in the aquatic environment 39 these activities include industrial discharges mining operations agricultural cultivation vehicular exhaust and atmospheric precipitation summarized in fig 2 40 rapid industrialization and the remarkable progress in new technologies in different aspects come at the cost of polluting the environment with heavy metals 41 various heavy metals have been reported to drill through different biogeochemical cycles eventually they enter the human food chain 42 which bioaccumulates and magnifies within the living tissues and poses a significant threat to human health 43 the crops and vegetables grown on heavy metal contaminated soil or irrigated with contaminated water have been linked with many human diseases 44 li et al 45 evaluated the health risk and the contamination level of selected heavy metals such as cd hg pb zn and cu in ten types of vegetables grown nearby a large scale lead zinc smelter industry in china the authors reported that leafy vegetables were more contaminated with pb and cd than non leafy vegetables and these two heavy metals contributed to the most significant health risk over 75 of vegetable samples within 4 km of the smelter exceeded the national and international food standard for pb by 47 and 7 of cd and hg standards two main parts of the vegetable plant for heavy metal uptake including leaf adsorption from the atmosphere and root absorption from water or soil 46 airborne particulate matters including heavy metals originate from transportation and some industrial activities in urban areas 47 48 however the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter varies depending on the emission source type of heavy metal and the interaction between the pollutants which affect atmospheric chemistry 49 heavy metals such as cd as cr and ni are found in industrial areas associated with airborne particles the airborne contamination of heavy metals is considered highly toxic to humans and animals and poses advert health effects even at low concentrations 50 51 heavy metals used in cultivation and agricultural practices are in the form of fertilizers pesticides and insecticides 52 environmental contamination can also occur through metal corrosion atmospheric deposition soil erosion of metal ions and leaching of heavy metals sediment re suspension and metal evaporation from water resources to soil and groundwater 53 2 2 health impact of heavy metal consumption heavy metals toxicity and adverse impact can either be acute or chronic effects depending on the concentration and exposure period long term exposure to heavy metal can progressively lead to various muscular physical and or neurological degenerative processes in the human body table 1 continuous exposure to heavy metals leads to chronic diseases such as alzheimer s disease muscular dystrophy multiple sclerosis and parkinson s disease 54 chronic exposure to cd was reported to cause kidney dysfunction lung cancer pulmonary adenocarcinomas and bone fractures which resulted from its ability to bind to vital proteins in the human body 55 56 lead is another heavy metal that has adverse effects on human blood enzymes and the central nervous system 57 other investigations have reported the long term exposure to a high dose of zn can cause cancer fertility impact and disturbance in cholesterol balance 58 60 chronic arsenic and or mercury exposure have been linked with hyperkeratosis kidney dysfunction skin lesions damage to the human central nervous system and several types of cancers 61 jaishankar et al 8 investigated several heavy metals toxicity mechanism and health effects they reported that the adverse impact of these metals differs based on the type of heavy metals lead causes oxidative stress out of free radical imbalance while mercury arsenic and chromium are characterized by harmful thiol or methyl derivative formation aluminum and cadmium act as cofactors or metal ion replacement and thus their chronic exposure led to their accumulation in human tissues hexavalent chromium ions can penetrate cell membranes and cause chronic disturbance in ion channels dna and protein damage 8 62 wilson s disease is a chronic disorder mainly caused by chronic copper exposure characterized by mental alterations dysphagia motor abnormalities ataxia renal dysfunction hemolytic anemia kidney stones and hepatic failure 63 heavy metals need to be closely monitored in the environment and human food putting in place appropriate checks and balances for preserving communities health and ensuring human health 3 activated carbon in water treatment applications activated carbon is a highly promising adsorbent material characterized by a large specific surface area high porosity high pore volume and adjustable surface properties in morphology and functional groups 75 it has been widely used in different applications including water treatment 76 77 activated carbon is obtained by the thermochemical conversion of organic materials at high temperatures and the absence of oxygen the raw material fabrication technique and conditions all have played a significant role in the adsorption efficiency of activated carbon 78 a uniformly distributed functional group and pore diameter of activated carbon work more efficiently for specific type s of heavy metals 3 1 fabrication of activated carbon the selection of the precursor material for activated carbon preparation depends on several factors including availability nonhazardous nature and production cost many studies reported better structural and textural characteristics upon using materials containing a high amount of fixed carbon and minimum ash 78 79 plant based materials have been extensively utilized in activated carbon production due to their high carbon content 80 different parts of plants are an important aspect of activated carbon fabrication the core stems peels fruits leaves shells flowers husks seeds and stones all have been used in different parameters and fabrication techniques 81 82 activated carbon from the date bead has been prepared by pyrolysis process at 300 c for 3 h and tested for pb ii adsorption from aqueous solutions and achieved an adsorption capacity of 76 7 mg g 83 however better adsorption capacity has been achieved with different biomass as discussed in the following sections aquatic biomass has also been used as activated carbon precursors such as fibers starch grass and cakes in addition to other non conventional precursors 80 carbonization is normally used before activating selected precursor material where it undergoes a thermal treatment known as pyrolysis to enrich carbon content in the precursor material 84 during the pyrolysis process the release of moisture and low molecular weight volatiles light aromatics and then hydrogen gas occur leaving a fixed carbonaceous skeleton 78 85 the pyrolyzed carbonaceous materials are found with limited porosity as most of the pores are filled with tarry materials thus an activation process is required to develop the specific characteristics of the nanocarbon daud et al 86 stated that the selection of carbonization parameters including temperature followed by heating rate and the residence time has a significant influence on the porosity and adsorption performance of the final product 87 hydrothermal treatment has also been used to converts the saccharides in the precursor material into carbon spheres which exhibit relatively low specific surface areas the carbonaceous materials prepared by this approach do not require grinding of material before activation treatment and typically have low ash content 88 additional physical chemical or mixture of physico chemical treatments are needed to activate the carbonaceous material to increase porosity and the numbers of functional groups that contain oxygen present on the surfaces of the activated carbon 89 fig 3 presents a summary of the biomass conversion into activated carbon numerous physical and chemical activator species have been used including koh water vapor zncl2 co2 h3po4 etc 90 92 the koh based chemical activation was better than the physical steam activation in porosity development total pore volume and specific surface area 93 huang et al 94 used koh at 800 c for the chemical activation of different precursors for activated carbon production they reported significantly higher specific surface area and abundant oxygen containing functional groups resulting in negative surface charges song et al 93 compared physical and chemical activation methods steam and koh for activated carbon preparation and their adsorption performance the authors reported better results with the chemical activation than the physical steam activation regarding total pore volume the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and porosity development numerous studies have shown that compared to regular biomass adsorbents the activated carbon prepared from biomass raw materials possesses good adsorption capacity to various heavy metal ions 77 95 the biomass materials chemical or physical activation significantly enhances their adsorption capacity against heavy metals 96 refer to table 2 for the comparison of physical and chemical activation methods of varying biomass precursor materials 3 2 properties and mechanisms of heavy metal adsorption surface active functional groups surface area and cation exchange capacity are the three essential factors that affect the adsorption capacity of activated carbon to heavy metals 35 however the smaller particle size the greater surface area and suitable surface functional groups increased adsorption capacity 108 109 the overall mechanism of action for heavy metal adsorption is complex as it varies depending on the precursor materials and the type s of heavy metal 33 various adsorption mechanisms have been investigated including physical adsorption electrostatic adsorption ion exchange complexation precipitation and reduction lu et al 110 investigated the adsorption mechanism of pb2 by sludge activated carbon and reported three critical roles for adsorption including ion exchange surface functional groups and surface precipitation it s known that the mechanism of adsorption involves a combination of multiple mechanisms and not attributable to a single mechanism physical adsorption of heavy metals is caused by the van der waals forces that happened between activated carbon surface molecules and heavy metal ions 111 however this adsorption affinity is caused by intermolecular forces which tend to be weak and could be reversible 112 ion exchange is a non specific adsorption mechanism that possesses low adsorption capacity that involves the physical exchange of ions and coulombic force between the positively charged heavy metal ions in aqueous solution and negatively charged activated carbon surface groups 113 the ion exchange reaction between the ions has proceeded rapidly and it was found to be ph dependent 114 115 chen et al 116 investigated the adsorption mechanism of sludge based activated carbon on both cr3 and cr6 ions they revealed that the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon on cr3 was more significant due to the ion exchange between mg2 in activated carbon and cr3 and ca2 ions refer to fig 4 for the summary of different adsorption mechanisms of heavy metals electrostatic interactions between heavy metals surface charges and activated carbon are another mechanism of adsorption depending on charges of electrostatic attraction 117 dong et al 118 stated that the strength of electrostatic interactions is also a ph dependent interaction the valence state of the metal ions the ionic radius as well as the zero potential of activated carbon park et al 119 stated that the significant increase in adsorption capacity of cu2 by porphyra tenera derived activated carbon at alkaline ph values was due to the rise in charge differences compared with neutral and acidic conditions under the influence of electrostatic forces heavy metals carry more charges at a higher valence state resulting in stronger electrostatic interactions and better adsorption capacity redox affects the chemical behavior biological effectiveness of elements and the migration ability of the heavy metal by changing their existing forms especially those with variable valence yuan et al 120 stated the significant impact of redox on distributing morphological heavy metals the precipitation effect occurs with activated carbon that contains soluble carbonate and or phosphate which can co precipitate with many heavy metals such as cd2 pb2 and pb 121 the more mineral elements in the activated carbon the increased absorption capacity due to increased active sites wang et al 122 reported that the porous structure of activated carbon results in increased specific surface energy the smaller the particle size the better adsorption capacity as they provide additional effective sites for heavy metal adsorption the variety of functional groups on the surface of activated carbon such as the carboxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and amino groups carry different charges and exhibit good affinity towards heavy metal cations 123 qin et al 124 treated the coconut shell based granular activated carbon with nitric acid they reported that oxidation treatment of activated carbon distinctly decreased the surface area still it significantly increased the content of surface functional groups that contain oxygen and thus enhanced the adsorption capacity to heavy metals 125 it has been shown that the adsorption of different heavy metals by activated carbons greatly relies on three main factors including particular surface area particular surface functionality and surface acidity 126 increasing the surface area alone may not lead to an increase in the adsorption capacity however enhancing the electrostatic attraction of the activated carbon by increasing its negative charge led to good adsorption characteristics as most heavy metal ions are positively charged 127 many researchers have experimented on the adsorption efficiency of activated carbon with the alteration of preparation parameters table 3 the nature of raw materials and activation temperature influenced the activated carbon s physicochemical properties and thus adsorption efficiency various modification techniques have been used to increase the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for heavy metal ions burakov et al 140 modified the activated carbon with carbon nano tubes by chemical vapor deposition to effectively remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions and reported that the nano modification of activated carbon increased their equilibrium adsorption of heavy metals ni2 and co2 by 10 30 owing to the hollow and layered structures in addition to the tunable surface chemistry of carbon nano tubes the adsorption of heavy metals was found to occur predominantly on its outer surface zheng et al 141 used different activation and modification approaches using n doping of biomass activated carbon with dicyandiamide was performed via an ultrasonic method and a redox method the authors reported a significant increase in the divalent copper ion adsorption efficiency using the n doping modification method however previous researchers noted that the direct impregnation of activated carbon with nitrogen reagents had some problems such as long modification cycles and low doping amount led to adsorption performance of products that were not visibly improved 142 143 the use of strong oxidants to modify activated carbon at high temperatures posed high risks it excessively destroyed the original porous structure of activated carbon resulting in a reduced adsorption capacity 141 4 modifications of activated carbon for better adsorption of heavy metals in recent years a large number of investigations have shown the possibility of increasing the adsorption capacity of activated carbon by modification approaches 144 the precursor material after the pyrolysis process requires physical or chemical activation the type of raw material heating rate duration of activation or combination of these significantly influence the adsorption efficiency ogungbenro et al 145 found that preparation conditions and activation agents had markedly affected the adsorption performance the specific surface area of the activated carbon can be significantly increased by using modification agents and altering the number and distribution of the surface functional groups leading to improve the adsorption capacity towards heavy metals in polluted water 146 rice husk based nano activated carbon has shown good adsorption performance in water treatment applications in heavy metal ions and organic molecules it was significantly enhanced by varying physical and chemical activations 147 148 the modification techniques of activated carbon can be classified into three main categories physical modifications chemical modifications and organic or inorganic loading modification physical activation is usually conducted at high temperatures with variation in heating rates and activation duration in nitrogen oxygen or a water vapor atmosphere 149 in comparison chemical activation is performed directly or indirectly in the presence of inert gas by using different activating agents such as koh zncl2 k2co3 or h3po4 at high temperatures 150 151 generally the chemical activation can be performed in a shorter time and lower energy consumption than the physical activation particularly upon using the koh as an activator 152 the treatment of the activated carbon with koh resulted in the complete removal of carboxy and lactone groups it decreased the general content of the acidic groups more significant than that of basic groups 153 simultaneously the surface concentration of hydroxyl groups increased leading to enhancing the adsorption capacity to heavy metal ions by the mechanisms discussed earlier 4 1 physical modifications techniques a variety of physical activation methods have been used to modify activated carbon including microwave heating ultraviolet steam modification etc 127 154 high temperature activation before the activating agent s treatment was found to increase the porosity and surface area of the activated carbon which may lead to better adsorption capacity 155 contemporary researchers aim to enhance activated carbon performance by changing the pyrolysis temperature heating time heating rate and heating methods such as ultraviolet and microwave radiation 156 4 1 1 microwave heating microwave heating has attracted considerable attention in the preparation of activated carbon compared with the conventional heating process it has been used to prepare mesoporous activated carbon with increased specific surface area and a little low in oxygen containing acidic surface groups 157 hesas et al 158 prepared activated carbon using microwave heating instead of traditional heating and they reported significant differences in pore structure as well as chemical properties the cotton stalk treated with different concentrations of zncl2 solutions and the effects of microwave radiation power on the capacity of adsorption and yield of activated carbon were evaluated 159 the reported yield of activated carbon was increased gradually with the increase of microwave power liu et al 160 modified bamboo based activated carbon using a microwave oven under n2 atmosphere and observed a gradual decrease in the surface acidic groups and enhanced surface basicity the authors reported an increase in the pore diameter of micropores till they achieve a microporous size range the authors also reported enhanced adsorption properties in the modified activated carbon compared with the unmodified one due to the enlargement of the micropores in a different study co2 microwave was used to alter commercial coal based granular activated carbon resulting in a significant pore expanding 161 the mesopore volume significantly increased and a hierarchical pore structure was formed due to decreasing carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl surface groups which also enhanced the surface charge density jiang et al 162 used ultrasound and microwave fig 5 energy to synthesize modified copper activated carbon with significantly higher adsorption capacity than the control without cu doped activated carbon due to its larger surface area and enhanced pore structure during pyrolysis gas formation such as co h2 co2 and ch4 can promote pores formation however using microwave heating can significantly reduce reaction time thus resulting in enhanced pore uniformity 163 in a recent investigation li et al 164 prepared a series of activated carbon adsorbents from various biomasses by using microwave activation the study revealed that the removal capacity of the activated carbon after microwave activation against mercury was significantly higher than that prepared without microwave activation in another study abas et al 165 reported a larger specific surface area in microwave activated adsorbents compared to conventional heat activated preparations in a related study the biomass of porous activated carbons modified with microwave exhibited the best mercury adsorption performance at 130 c 166 the same authors changed the hydrogen peroxide within the microwave activated adsorbents and reported a significant increase in the specific surface area and improved pore structures after the impregnation of precursor with h2o2 the number of surface functional groups increased leading to enhanced hg0 removal performance 166 4 1 2 ultrasound irradiation ultrasound irradiation is another modification technique regarded as motivation force for chemical process which accelerates mass transfer to follow acoustic cavitation leading to the generation of final acoustic streaming the sonic waves are creating microscopic turbulence within the activated carbon 167 168 heidarinejad et al 169 used low frequency ultrasound to enhance the adsorption property of activated carbon they concluded that low frequency ultrasound was able to increase both the rate and amount of methylene blue adsorption onto the activated carbon dil et al 170 synthesized and loaded gold magnetic nanocomposite modified by ultrasound wave on activated carbon using simple fast and low cost process the results revealed that the ultrasound assisted adsorption method showed a remarkable adsorption ability compared to the control it was related to high pressure shock waves and high speed micro jets during the cavitation bubbles violent collapse 171 ultrasonic radiation in aqueous solutions was found to increase the production and destruction of gas bubbles resulting in temporary high pressure and temperature levels followed by the production of various free agents such as oh and ooh in the water su et al 172 found that the solvent enters the bubbles within the activated carbon and inflates them until the whole bubbles eventually collapse and release some energy the released energy significantly accelerates the feasibility of other activators such as chemical agents yu et al 173 used the nitric acid oxidation process together with microwave and sonication to enhance the adsorption capacity of activated carbon fiber the authors reported that the microwave assisted oxidation process significantly enhanced cu ii adsorption due to increased ultra micro pore volume and polar oxygen containing groups many studies reported the successful acceleration of chemical reactions by using ultrasonic waves 174 175 nasseh et al 176 prepared powdered activated carbon using the peganum harmala seeds as the precursor and ultrasonic waves as modification accelerator for the production adsorbent for scavenging cr vi from the wastewater the authors found that the modified powdered activated carbon possessed excellent and enhanced adsorptive properties in morphology surface area pore size and functional groups with an excellent adsorption capacity against cr vi ions furthermore the authors achieved efficient regenerations of the activated carbon by integrating the sonication assisted pickling regeneration process 4 1 3 non thermal plasma technology non thermal plasma technology has attracted significant attention for modifying activated carbon s surface to produce chemically active species with better adsorption performance 174 175 kodama et al 176 reported that the amount of surface acidic functional groups in the activated carbon was significantly increased by non thermal plasma modification and achieved effective adsorption of copper ions from an aqueous solution other studies used gliding arc discharge plasma to modify the surface of activated carbon for enhancing copper adsorption 177 178 non thermal plasma can introduce oxygen functional groups on the surface of the activated carbon which improves the removal efficiency against the hg ions 174 ji et al 179 used non thermal plasma as a cost effective and efficient approach to modify the activated carbon and accelerate its reaction with h2s and so2 for improving the removal of elemental mercury the authors found that non thermal plasma treatment accelerated the reaction between h2s and so2 at the surface of activated carbon resulted in a non significant change in surface morphology and surface area however more sulfur was observed on the surface of the activated carbon in a very short time which increased removal efficiency of hg by 70 approximately wu et al 180 used a novel modification technique based on dielectric barrier discharge non thermal plasma for the modification of phosphoric acid treated activated carbon to enrich its adsorption capacity for cu ii the authors indicated that their modified activated carbon had much higher adsorption capacity for cu ii irrespective of different adsorption conditions interestingly the adsorption capacity has a non monotonic variation with the plasma based modification time i e increasing at first and then decreasing at the optimum modification time the authors achieved an improved adsorption capacity of 150 compared to that of non modified activated carbon however the adsorption capacity was found to have an exponential relationship with carboxylic group and significant linear relation with both pyrophosphates and phosphates groups the results indicated the importance of these functional groups in the adsorption process fig 6 presents the illustration of the surface modification of phosphoric acid activated carbon using non thermal plasma 4 1 4 steam activation steam activation is a typical process used to modify the activated carbon by increasing its surface porosity to enhance the adsorption of heavy metals and eliminate impurities that may result from incomplete combustion 181 shim et al 182 found that miscanthus activated carbon modified with steam at 800 c showed a significant change in cu adsorption than the original one generated by the slow pyrolysis process at 500 c moreover the authors reported enhanced surface area porosity and aromaticity of the modified activated carbon but decrease in surface functional groups similarly lou et al 183 observed that steam modification of pine sawdust activated carbon enhanced the surface area but slightly reduced functional groups density at the surface steam treatment of activated carbon looks more efficient for heavy metals sorption especially when employed before the second pretreatment phase which results in the formation of surface functional groups necessary for heavy metals adsorption 4 2 chemical modification techniques numerous modification and functionalization techniques have been tried to improve the adsorption efficiencies of different activated carbon against heavy metals strong acids bases polymers and other chemical agents were investigated to modify the activated carbon surface functional groups and surface area 184 4 2 1 acidic treatment acids have been used for activated carbon modification which can interact with the mineral components in the activated carbon due to their oxidation capability and corrosiveness this process makes the void structure of the activated carbon more ideal with increased specific surface area and enhanced adsorption capacity 185 chen et al 186 modified granular activated carbon by using critic acid and reported a 140 enhancement in heavy metal absorptivity than unmodified granular activated carbon in another study lu et al 187 fabricated a modified activated carbon fibers with chemical grafting using amidoxime which improved uranium vi adsorption by 172 similarly 120 enhancement in cu ii adsorption was achieved using 15 sodium acetate treatment to activated carbon 188 phosphoric acid activation is another method widely used to produce and modify activated carbons introducing a significant amount of phosphorus atoms into the carbon network structure 189 many studies reported other specific acid surface groups in phosphorus containing activated carbons which play a crucial role in heavy metal adsorption 190 191 valentín reyes et al 192 used nitric acid and ammonia treatment for activated carbon surface modification the modified activated carbon was used for hexavalent chromium cr vi removal from aqueous solutions the authors proposed the mechanism of adsorption based on the changes in the surface chemistry of the modified activated carbon adsorption reduction and desorption experiments the edta modified carbon materials have been widely used for heavy metal removal lv et al 193 used edta to modify bamboo activated carbon bac in the presence of tetraethyl orthosilicate as a crosslinking agent to get bac sio2 edta and used it for removal of pb ii and cu ii the authors reported that the edta molecules on the surface of the activated carbon increased the pore size and significantly increased the adsorption capacities from 45 to 123 mg g and from 6 to 42 mg g for the pb ii and cu ii respectively the removal of these heavy metal ions promoted by edta presented on the surface of the activated carbon the increase in adsorption was due to the electrostatic attractions and the complexation between the edta and heavy metal ions the adsorption results demonstrated that edta modified activated carbon is a potential adsorbent for the heavy metal contaminated wastewater fig 7 presents the preparation and the adsorption mechanisms of edta modified activated carbon acid functional groups were vital in the hexavalent chromium removal the oxidized adsorbents were responsible for 50 of cr vi reduction to cr iii whereas 35 resulted from the heat treated adsorbents only 20 resulted from ammonia treated activated carbon 192 polymer hydrogels have recently played an important role in water treatment applications the absorption of heavy metal ions onto hydrogel was due to the ability of ions to swell in water and thus achieve high uptake 194 ge et al 195 synthesized polyacrylic acid modified activated carbon which was used in fabricating the ear like nano sheet material having thickness 40 nm and diameter 300 nm the introduction of the carboxylic acid functional groups in the modified activated carbon exhibited a marked increase in heavy metal adsorption only in 15 min of contact time the maximum adsorption capacity reached 473 2 mg g for cd ii this novel fabrication method of using polymeric acids modification is fast and gives excellent adsorption capacity for heavy metal removal edta is an amino polycarboxylic acid a chelating agent known to react with many heavy metals and form stable complexes 196 incorporating a stable complex in the bamboo activated carbon edta modification enhanced its adsorption performance against heavy metals 193 4 2 2 alkaline treatment the chemical activation through strong bases can be performed in a shorter time and lower energy consumption than the physical modification a specific example of a strong base koh has been reported to be the fastest chemical activator 152 arunachalam et al 197 developed a low cost activated carbon prepared from date seeds and modify the surface functional groups with koh and reported a significant enhancement in the adsorption capacity compared with the unmodified activated carbon at higher than 700 c koh vapor has been reported to erode the carbon material s lattices and thus produce a large number of micropores 156 in a recent investigation lv et al 198 prepared rice husk based activated carbon using different activation techniques the authors used simultaneous koh activation and edta 4na modification after the carbonization of rice husk at 500 c and reported the largest bet surface area 2087 m2 g among the prepared activated carbons the activated carbon can also be modified using other chemical approaches such as the virtue of redox reaction solvent impregnation acid base treatment metal loading electrochemical and plasma modification etc 199 additionally heteroatom doping and loading are effective approaches in adjusting the chemical properties of the nano activated carbon to be enhanced and selectively adsorb heavy metal ions 200 201 li et al 202 prepared a la oh 3 modified magnetic biochar using pineapple waste as a precursor material and reported that the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of la oh 3 content the activated carbon modified with naoh enhanced its cation exchange capacity and increased surface area high total pore and mesopore volumes 203 although not much has been done regarding alkaline modification of activated carbons such modification techniques can change the surface active groups which enhance the adsorption of heavy metal ions 204 4 2 3 other chemical agents a variety of chemical compounds and methods have been investigated in the recent past for activated carbon surface modification rivera utrilla et al 205 tried vulcanization and ammoniation treatment processes for the production of activated carbon with high polarity and alkalinity the polarity and alkalinity in the activated carbon improve the adsorption capacity zhang et al 206 stated that it is better to graft the activated carbon with some coordinate ligands to enhance the complexation adsorption of heavy metals polyethyleneimine is a typical polyamine used to modify activated carbon surface for high selective adsorption capacity for metal ions it has excellent reactivity and could alter the surface functional groups easily 207 ma et al 146 prepared acid alkali treated rice husk activated carbon and modified it with a solution of polyethyleneimine the authors observed that the excess amino group occurrence at the surface of modified activated carbon substantially increased cr vi adsorption in a recent investigation xie et al 208 modified the activated carbon using linear polyethyleneimine for cd ii adsorption they reported a significant enhancement in adsorption capacity compared to unmodified activated carbon the enhancement in adsorption capacity was justified with the successful load of polyethyleneimine on the surface of the activated carbon the adsorption capacity was ph dependent with a maximum value of 45 mg g at 6 7 ph values however the improved adsorption capacity of different chemical modifications encourages the researcher to investigate the safe and non toxic chemicals activators mercury ions were removed from contaminated wastewater samples using fir wood sawdust derived thiol incorporated activated carbon which showed high removal efficiency the removal capacity was increased with increasing adsorbent dosage 209 saleh et al 210 synthesized polyethyleneimine modified activated carbon using a facile hydrothermal method for the removal of hg ii ions the adsorption efficiency of the modified activated carbon was notable with high regeneration efficiency suggesting polyethylenimine modification of activated carbon was a low cost modification technique 4 3 organic and inorganic loading several organic and inorganic materials have recently been investigated to add oxygen containing functional groups in activated carbons the oxygen bearing functional groups in the activated carbon have to decrease the electrostatic repulsion of heavy metals ions in an aqueous solution 211 212 ferric ions are known to be readily adsorbed onto the activated carbon due to their high positive charges thus loading such ions onto the activated carbon will enhance its dispersion and adsorption capacity 213 deng et al 214 fabricated an activated carbon from the pristine source of feedstock and modified its surface with chitosan and pyromellitic dianhydride the modification was found to be effective in the adsorption of pb cu and cd ions the altered activated carbon possessed an increased number of surface functional groups such as cc n c o and n mainly responsible for heavy metals adsorption similarly zhou et al 215 also used chitosan solution to modify the activated carbon surface they observed that the chitosan modified activated carbon showed enhanced removal capacity against pb ion than the non modified activated carbon obtained from the same raw material in a recent investigation li et al 216 fabricated nano sized hematite modified activated carbon using α fe2o3 nanoparticles as a coating agent fig 8 a facile impregnation approach was used in this fabrication to enhance the removal of hexavalent chromium ions from wastewater the authors reported that modified activated carbon removed hexavalent chromium with a three times higher efficiency 94 than the non modified activated carbon the kinetic study revealed that the removal process well fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model and it was ph dependent the authors were able to regenerate the used activated carbon by 0 1 m hcl which showed good stability and a slight drop in removal efficiency until 80 after four adsorption desorption cycles the results suggested great potential in modifying the activated carbon for efficient heavy metal ions removal from aqueous solutions iron oxide nanoparticle has recently gained the attraction of many scientists to solve heavy metal pollution and another environment related issue 217 it has high potentials in removing various kinds of contaminants from the air water and soil through adsorption as well as photo degradation mechanism 218 furthermore the deteriorating quality of drinking water and heavy metal pollution concerns has led the researchers to use iron oxide nanoparticles with the activated carbon as a new generation adsorbents for water treatment 219 xu et al 220 tailored ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid di anhydride treated iron oxide baker s yeast biomass for heavy metal removal from aqueous solution and reported significant adsorption potentials similarly affam et al 221 modified the activated carbon using iron oxide and reported a significant enhancement in boron and organic pollutants removal from wastewater nanoparticles of iron oxide sunflower head waste activated carbon have been fabricated by jain et al 222 they used the co precipitation technique for removing cu ii cr vi and cd ii ions from aqueous solution the authors reported different optimum adsorption conditions for each heavy metal the adsorption of the nanoparticles was found to be endothermic and the authors were able to regenerate an effective nano activated carbon and reuse it after four adsorption desorption cycles fig 9 presents a schematic illustration of the adsorption mechanisms of the nano iron oxide sunflower head waste activated carbon composites and sem images some functional groups on the surface of activated carbon such as oxygenated and phosphate groups were found to promote metal particle chelation these metallic particles are directly responsible for heavy metal adsorption granular activated carbon was impregnated with ferrous chloride through a new multi step procedure and modified with naoh to stabilize the iron in granular activated carbon 223 the surface modified activated carbon showed a significant increase in arsenic adsorption capacity with the increased amount of impregnated iron decreasing with higher amounts of iron gallios et al 224 investigated the ability of iron modified activated carbons for arsenic ions removal they revealed that the iron modification causes a significant increase in as v ion removal efficiency from about 4 mg g non modified activated carbon to 11 05 mg g iron modified activated carbon however the mn incorporation in activated carbon showed even further increased the adsorption capacity to 19 35 mg g the mn incorporation was found to affect the textural properties of the activated carbon as reveled by the increase of crystallinity and decrease of the surface area 4 4 other modification techniques coating with carbon rich materials onto the activated carbon has been used to enhance their heavy metal adsorption capacity many researchers used graphene oxide as a precursor material for the preparation of graphene which possesses high sorption potential for many heavy metals 225 graphene oxide coated activated carbon has been fabricated to increase its adsorption capacity against heavy metals 226 227 these coated composites were produced by treating activated carbon feedstock in a suspension of graphene oxide before the pyrolysis process the process was resulting in higher surface area and additional surface oxygen rich groups the graphene molecules are capable of integrating within the composite structures after the pyrolysis process 226 227 table 4 presents the comparative summary of activated carbon surface modification techniques their advantages and disadvantages 35 5 potential and challenges for modified activated carbons in the commercial application production of cheap and efficient activated carbon has become crucial because of its increasing demand for various applications apart from adsorption such as catalysts gas storage fuel cell and drug carrier material 234 235 the use of agricultural and industrial waste materials including grass clippings bamboo fibers cocoa shells rice husk waste wood chips sawdust waste and horse manure has significantly lowered the production costs of activated carbon 236 however adsorbent s cost is seldom reported in the research papers especially no detailed information about the cost of production has been reported in the literature for different modification methods physical modifications of activated carbon through microwave ultrasound irradiation steam or non thermal plasma are economically viable processes león et al 237 developed a conceptual design of an industrial production plant for activated carbon it can process 31 25 tons day of industrial waste nutshells using physical techniques and reported a total cost of approximately usd 2 15 per kilogram final activated carbon product the authors estimated the net present value for a 15 year production project of usd 4 519 482 the internal return rate at 23 the return on investment 24 and the discounted payback period after the fifth year of production the costs of chemical modifications are slightly higher than physical modification however treatment of the leftover hazardous chemicals used during modification is another essential drawback 238 in a recent study lai et al 239 conducted a techno economic assessment of oil palm based activated carbon production at a pilot plant scale the cost evaluation was performed using different pre and post activation surface modification methods the results revealed that the physical activation process required lower fixed capital investment usd 2 120 000 and annual operating cost usd 1 530 000 compared to chemical and physico chemical activation processes cost the chemical and physico chemical process of activated carbon production required a total fixed capital investment of usd 6 320 000 and total annual operating cost of usd 2 570 000 future researchers should focus on safe and cost effective modification methods to produce highly efficient activated carbons for example plasma technique may provide a promising solution for activated carbon modification to selectively separate heavy metals from aqueous solution without the need for other chemical agents and thus avoid the potential chemical pollution and reduce the costs of extra materials 6 conclusion heavy metals and their compounds are known for their toxic hazardous and carcinogenic effects on humans and even animals who are chronically exposed to them directly or indirectly activated carbons are effective and economically viable materials that have shown promising potential in heavy metal removal from contaminated wastewater this review presented the adverse health effects of heavy metal contamination and how they reach the human food chain from different sources the study covered the activated carbon fabrication and its role in mitigating heavy metals from polluted water the recent advances in surface functional modification techniques for enhancing the adsorption capacity of activated carbon against heavy metals have also been discussed in detail the prominent role of activated carbon has been established over other materials due to its unique adsorption properties which have been even improved with physical chemical and hyphenated techniques a significant number of recent studies revealed the great increase in adsorption capacity of all the modified activated carbons compared with non modified demonstrating a promising potential for modified activated carbon in heavy metal removal in the water and wastewater treatment industry the evolution of activated carbon has turned from interesting alternative precursors into a powerful modification technique keeping in mind the cost effectiveness and the potential commercialization various physical modification techniques for activated carbons have great potential in commercial applications the modification techniques for activated carbon are still an emerging research field that requires continuous effort to exploit

13346,microplastic mp pollution steadily evolves into an alarming issue for global food security and the wellness of modern society the increasing number of reports reveal the micro and nanosized plastic fragments at almost every place on earth from the ocean bottom to the mountain top mps were also found in many living species including humans the omnipresence of mps had put on the agenda the necessity of joint efforts aimed at controlling the volumes of production limiting the single use goods encouraging responsible consumption and improving waste management mps are very stable and degrading too slowly to rely on the natural self cleansing capacity of the environment this review describes the growing efforts in the development of efficient methods for removal stimulated degradation and recycling of mps the practiced approaches to the extraction of mps from water probes techniques for identification of polymer types strategies for the stimulated natural and artificial degradation of the material are thoroughly discussed the inquiry concludes with an overview of trends in the recycling of mps and pollution control the review covers about two hundred recent sources and allows a reader to oversee the whole spectrum of activities and to select the most appropriate techniques for a given task keywords microplastics identification extraction removal degradation 1 introduction over the past 60 years the world s plastic production has multiplied 560 times 1 in the last decade the annual amount was persistently growing 280 million tonnes in 2012 2 359 million tonnes in 2018 and 368 million tonnes in 2019 3 about a half of the quantity goes to the manufacture of single use consumer goods which after being utilized for just a few moments become waste about 58 of the plastic waste enters the natural environment accumulates and preserves in a solid form for the long term whereas 18 of plastics are recycled and 24 are burnt 4 in 2020 the prevention measures against the spread of the covid 19 virus have been contributing to an incremental accumulation of plastic waste due to the single use character and frequent change of protective wear 5 at present less than half of produced plastic is recycled or safely deposited at managed landfill sites the rest is carelessly abandoned for degradation and littering the environment plastics have strong corrosion resistance and can persist for hundreds of years environmental stress cracking is likely to occur already at the initial stage of natural weathering 6 the larger pieces of plastic will break up into smaller pieces down to below 5 mm where the fragments will have their dimensions of about microns it is expected that from 2 5 107 to 1 3 108 tons of such pieces will be floating in the ocean by 2100 7 the plastic pollution problem rises concerns and urges an adequate response from the scientific community there is increasing attention to the plastic pollution problem as evidenced by the exponentially growing number of dedicated articles 8 authors of the bibliometric analysis noted that most of the keywords from mp studies have emerged in the last 5 years reflecting re born of the field which traces its roots back to the first observation of carpenter et al in 1972 9 these keywords were divided into 4 clusters where the first one focuses on the abundance accumulation and mps pollution the second concerns the transport the long term presence and degradation of mps the third is about the identification of mps and quantification methods and the fourth considers mps ingested by living organisms it comes out that mps in the marine environment are more actively studied than in other environments the chemistry studies constitute only a tiny percentage of the published literature 8 this is further reflected by the titles of the most cited reviews 10 14 which are essentially describing the mp pollution of the marine environment and its impact on marine organisms only recently some reviews dedicated to the issues of collecting and removing mps from the polluted environment have started to appear 15 17 this work provides a systematic overview of currently practicing methods and the progress reached so far in the development of efficient techniques for the processing of mps in water medium the techniques for the air filtering and soil cleaning from mps were addressed to less extent and can be found elsewhere 18 21 since we will focus on mps a couple of recent reviews on nanoplastic can be mentioned 22 23 a classical approach of search by keywords was practiced for the literature survey the pre selected keywords were microplastic s in conjunction with pollution identification removal extraction degradation and recycling common search engines as google scholar web of science as well as those of leading publishing houses acs elsevier hindawi mdpi rsc springer and wiley were used currently may 2021 google scholar returns 31 100 results for microplastic a manual selection was performed among the obtained references based on their abstracts to ensure that the studies were relevant to the scope of the review a pool of some 500 articles was selected from where more than 270 published items were cited as references the references are covering the time interval from 2007 to 2021 with only ca 5 of accounts dated earlier their annual distribution follows the booming trend of publications on mps evidencing a representative coverage 2 microplastics pollution the plastic debris in the marine environment is classified into four different size categories mps are particles in the size range from 1 μm to 5 mm 24 they can be either primary mps coming from manufacturing and packaging or secondary mps originating from fragmentation or degradation of larger pieces due to mechanical impact or chemical processes 25 three other groups are macroplastic larger than 20 mm mesoplastic 5 20 mm and nanoplastic smaller than 1 μm 26 the morphology of fragments is very diverse fibers microbeads films foams pellets etc classification based on size is practically useful for anyone looking for the right meshes to take the fragments of particular sizes from water probes unfortunately the selected fragments are not necessarily the plastic ones and the task is to distinguish plastic from other kinds of marine debris 24 the classification does not consider the variation in chemical composition and properties of plastic there is a great variety of polymers but the most abundant are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyurethane pu 27 28 pe is present in high density low density and linear low density derivatives mps were detected virtually everywhere on earth in oceans seas and rivers sea ice and sediments including polar regions 29 in air and soil in animals and the bioavailable deepest part of the world s ocean 30 in 1972 carpenter et al for the first time described floating mps in the ocean 9 peng et al 30 in 2018 reported about the high abundance of mps in mariana trench bottom water and sediments from 2 06 to 13 51 pieces per liter in hadal bottom waters and from 200 to 2200 pieces per liter in hadal sediments jamieson et al found in the hindguts of amphipods from six of the deepest parts of the earth s oceans japan izu bonin mariana kermadec new hebrides and the peru chile trenches mps of man made synthetic or semi synthetic fibers 84 and fragments 16 only in the new hebrides trench amphipods the mps were not detected 31 kanhai et al 32 revealed the pervasiveness of mps throughout the water column of the arctic central basin where the predominant form of mps were fibers 90 results obtained in the haushgrten observatory indicated the high numbers of small sized mps 80 of the mps were 25 μm in arctic deep sea sediments 33 the immersion and deposition of mps at the bottom of an aquatic system might be caused by the following factors i the strong winds and storms spreading mps over the surface of a water basin and facilitating their distribution across a water column by currents and turbulences ii microbes colonize the surface of mps increasing the weight of solid phase and provoking the immersion to dipper water layers and iii interaction of mps with microbes may lead to the development of a microbiota community 34 different aquatic systems in densely populated areas and their habitats and sediments are polluted with mps the thames river 35 37 the danube river 38 39 the great laurentian lakes 40 lake geneva 41 the baltic sea 42 44 onego lake 45 and the rhine river 46 the majority of plastic debris in water comes from the waste generated by large coastal cities worldwide 47 via wind currents animal ingestion 48 and drainage systems 40 shipping the presence of mps was found in bottled water of both pet and glass bottles 49 mps were found in human food 50 honey and unrefined cane sugar 51 beer 52 canned sardines and sprats 53 salt 54 55 wine 56 soft drinks 57 chicken meat 58 and packaged meat 59 pe pp polyester polyamide and acrylic from clothing diapers etc can form fibers which are defined by the width to length ratio bigger than 1 29 fibers from the washing of clothes can significantly affect the contamination of the sewage water because these textiles may contain 170 more synthetic than natural fibers like cotton wool and silk 60 domestic washing of synthetics textiles contributes up to 35 of the microfiber pollution in the atmosphere the air contamination with mps is rarely discussed however researchers detected that dust contains mostly plastic fibers which are taken by the wind 61 63 the levels of the critical mass concentration and type of mps which would possess danger for human health are yet to be established the recent research indicated the presence of polyester 56 acrylic 31 nylon 9 and pp 5 mps in the stream water and snow samples at mt everest 64 environmental problems and health risks remain on the agenda researchers note both direct harm from mps and harm from bacteria on its surface pathogenic and non pathogenic vibrios 65 persistent organic pollutants or hydrophobic organic chemicals in addition the combination of certain types of functional groups on the surface of mp particles and heavy metals can have a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity 66 it is also worth evaluating the possibility for mp and nanoplastic particles to participate in the formation of reactive oxygen species ros 67 it was shown that mp and nanoplastic fragments can decrease the productivity of the primary producers like cyanobacteria and reduce the growth of green algae and overall chlorophyll a chl a concentrations leading to a reduction of photosynthesis by microalgae 68 a possible explanation can be the following i absorption of nanoplastic by algae could lead to the shading and reduce co2 concentration which promotes the production of ros 69 and ii effect of nanoplastics on chl a levels 68 these phenomena lead to disorders in the sedimentary systems and affect biodiversity 70 today researchers have no unequivocal opinion regarding cytotoxicity of plastics it was noted that ps particles of 0 1 0 5 μm size are low toxic for cell viability oxidative stress membrane integrity but have a pronounced size effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential 71 they inhibited the activity of the atp binding cassette transporter of the plasma membrane the work of hwang et al 72 emphasizes the low toxicity of particles in the 10 100 μm size range while the 460 nm and 1 μm particles had a negative effect unfortunately available data on the possible toxic effect of mp and nanoplastic particles are scattered 73 prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight reduces the stability of polymers inducing changes in their chemical composition and leading to fragmentation of mps 74 the latter increases the surface available for the adsorption of contaminants from surrounding seawater 75 76 and release of hazardous substances from plastic to water 77 for instance mps may release bisphenol a which is a common component of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resin the concentration of bisphenol in food water oils etc varies from 0 05 to 1 6 mg l the contribution from mp to the concentration of bisphenol remains unclear while mps are known to transfer pollutants into living organisms 78 polychlorinated biphenyls can be considered as a pollutant 79 because they are widespread continuously enter the environment posing a threat to wildlife and were detected on the surface of mps from all over the world 80 heavy metal ions can be contaminants too the mps ability to adsorb heavy metal ions has been extensively studied 81 84 the equilibrium concentrations of cu2 and zn2 adsorbed on the surface of ps particles were reportedly reached 1262 6 and 68 3 μg g respectively while on the aged pvc they were adsorbed even in higher quantities 82 the concentration of cr6 adsorbed on granules sampled from a beach coast was 0 441 μg g 83 the increased reactivity of the surface of aged granules is explained both by changes in the polymer itself and by the presence of biofilms and chemical precipitates 85 ragusa et al 86 reported that inspection of human placenta samples from six pregnant patients found in four of them 12 fragments of pp ranging from 5 to 10 μm such alarming findings call for a deep inquiry into the interaction of plastic particles with tissues and cells in the human body facemasks and gloves used to prevent the spread of the covid 19 have posed a new environmental threat because of their mono use character and huge quantities disposed of worldwide daily medical face masks can be manufactured from different nanofiber and or microfiber polymeric materials pe pp ps pu polyacrylonitrile polycarbonate or polyester 87 89 pandemic requirements for additional safety rules concerning shopping in supermarkets with fresh food packaged in plastic containers and single use food plastic bags were introduced to avoid food contamination extend shelf life and for the use to customers carrying groceries 90 as result personal protective equipment and additional plastic containers and bags have driven increased plastic pollution there is a need for urgent and coordinated actions including recycling practices and strict policies against plastic pollution 5 researchers agree that control in different geographic regions is necessary 91 the systems aiming at control or removal of mps from environments are developing recently experts tried to improve monitoring of marine plastic debris by applying satellite remote sensing based on passive and active optical methods light detection and ranging lidar systems are active sensors employed for the investigation of inherent optical properties of water oil pollutants colored dissolved organic matter phytoplankton and zooplankton etc in contrast to the passive methods they can supply data regardless of daytime and at low solar angles penetrating through the water column 92 3 extraction of microplastics from water water samples probes for analysis are usually collected in calm waters although shruti et al reported on studies of mps in stormwater 93 the optimal depth for sampling remains an open question 94 95 at the first step marine debris is collected using trawls nets such as manta or bongo trawls 96 97 epibenthic sled 98 or filtering pumps 99 from the different parts of the water column some pre processing can be done already on spot but the full probe analysis is conducted in a laboratory 100 the well known manta net was described as early as 1981 101 and it was named after the manta fish nowadays automatic express collection and analysis systems are developing for mps a significant advantage of such systems is the ability to analyze probes in situ within a very constrained timeline for example a sampling device albatross was designed to reduce the specimen collection time to three minutes or less thus allowing to cover more locations 102 the mantaray device uses a flow through pump and combines an autonomous sensor for estimation of mps concentration with a storage system for mps entrapped in either of its 28 filters 103 the plex plastic explorer is an instrument for bulk water sampling from various depths and in line filtering thanks to a self priming pump located on a vessel s deck 104 however work with mps requires compliance with strict rules for sampling and the laboratory workplace organization in order to avoid eventual contamination with plastic particles during sample processing it is advised do not wear synthetic clothes and treat plastic utensils in an ultrasonic cleaner before use the authors of another study 105 stress the importance of such precautions suggesting the lab personnel worn cotton cloth nitrile gloves and masks for all glassware soaking in 10 nitric acid is recommended cleaning continues with washing with ultrapure water and ethanol 70 and concludes with natural air drying the most widespread technique for the removal of mps was developed under the framework of the us marine debris program noaa marine debris program 106 the technique does not demand specialized equipment according to the noaa method the selected water samples pass sequentially through the stages of sieving digesting of organic matter with no harm to mps density separation and filtration 106 sieving sometimes also called filtration is the most common method for the separation of solid debris including mps from water probes the choice of sieves mesh size or filter pore determines the size of mps detected the smaller size the quicker obstruction by organic and mineral matter may occur 107 the filtered samples require further purification to eliminate both organic and inorganic contaminants to clean the surface of mps from organic materials and to liberate mps blocked in the filter s pores such purification has to be delicate and inexpensive hence even enzymatic purification of mps has been suggested 108 inorganic contaminants like silicate grains or clay particles can be removed from the probe by density separation that method does not help with the separation of organic matter due to the proximity of densities which are between 1 0 and 1 4 g cm 3 with plastics like pet and nylon 109 the complete removal of organic matter requires treatment with an oxidizing agent by wet chemistry techniques the use of strongly acidic or alkaline substances is better to be avoided because of its negative impact on sensitive synthetic polymers other approaches like centrifugation and microwave digestion can lead to deformation breaking down or even decomposition of mps 110 the wet peroxide oxidation wpo method is among the most successful ones for digesting organic matter it involves the treatment with a mixture of h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 sometimes called the fenton s reagent 111 in the noaa method 30 h2o2 is used and the sample solution is heated up to 75 с the ferrous ions catalyse the decomposition of h2o2 and the generation of radicals which act as strong oxidation agents according to the following equations 112 h 2 o 2 fe 2 oh oh fe 3 oh c x h y h 2 o co 2 q fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h ooh fe 3 ooh fe 2 o o h fe 3 o o fe 2 o 2 where cxhy represents an organic compound and q is the residue of a degraded organic compound apart from those processes some additional reactions may occur 113 oh h 2 o 2 ooh h 2 o 2 oh h 2 o 2 ooh oh h 2 o o 2 o o ooh ooh o 2 plastics withstand the oxidation by peroxide while the organic matter degrades at 75 c 106 wpo is a more widespread method of oxidative treatment because it can successfully digest different types of organic matter such as grease cellulose chitin shell moreover it can be suitable for organisms with chitin exoskeleton and high fat content organs 114 apart from fenton s reagent other oxidizing agents such as h2o2 alone naocl koh naoh sodium dodecyl sulfate can be efficiently used 115 118 more aggressive oxidizing agents can remove organic matters more rapidly and efficiently but there is a serious risk of mps degradation and deformation removal of the organic components such as leaves grass or shells from the surface of mps debris may include the enzymatic purification stage for this purpose mani et al 46 exposed samples to multiple incubation steps with different agents 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate at 70 c overnight 2 0 5 of either biozym f lipase and se protease amylase for 3 days at 37 c 3 30 h2o2 at 37 c for 24h 4 10 chitinase in phosphate buffer ph 5 6 for 5 days at 37 c and 5 10 cellulase for 24h at 50 c the steps were alternated by washing and sieving 2 the density separation approach is based on the buoyancy of plastic particles in solutions of a higher density while the soil mineral debris moves to the bottom 119 the specific density of common plastics lies in the range from 0 8 to 1 7 g cm3 it lowers to 0 05 g cm3 for expanded ps and rises to 2 1 2 3 g cm3 for polytetrafluoroethylene teflon 120 instead the density of sand and other solid contaminants reaches 2 65 g cm3 121 fresh or tap water seawater a concentrated sodium chloride solution sodium polytungstate spt lithium metatungstate zinc chloride sodium iodide are used for density separation table 1 there is no universally optimal solution to carry out density separation for example a saturated nacl solution can be used for the separation of plastic with a density lower than 1 2 g cm3 it is unsuitable for common polymers like pvc and pet with densities of 1 14 1 56 and 1 32 1 41 g cm3 respectively 123 nai or spt are too expensive to treat large volumes floating plastic foams can be collected with fresh water 129 the nabr solutions are less toxic and weakly acidic 130 density separation leads to a significant reduction of the probe s volume the procedure can be improved by employing dedicated equipment like munich plastic sediment separator which is designed to perform separation of large volumes 131 4 identification of microplastics the detection and identification of mps pose experimental challenges and usually require a combined use of microscopy optical and electron and spectroscopy vibrational and mass accordingly identification of mps proceeds in two steps description of physical appearance under an optical microscope and determining the chemical composition from measured spectra either consulting databases or references the reference mps in desired size range can be prepared by cryogenic milling 132 the addition of sand as the second abrasive phase might cause contamination of mps with metal coming from the stainless steel jar and milling balls due to abrasion instead an oxidative treatment with ozone improves dispersion most common characterization techniques for analysis of mps are presented in table 2 one of the primary methods of analysis is visual observation utilizing optical microscopy it allows distinguishing the shape and size of particles as well as counting their number in this regard mps are divided into two size groups the large ones ranging down from 5 to 1 mm and the small ones from 1 mm to 20 μm the former mps are visually recognizable while for the latter a reliable quantitative assessment is still a challenge 133 a considerable disadvantage of optical analysis is the high degrees of measurement error visual observation alone does not allow for reliable identification of polymers therefore the physical characterization by microscopy of likely plastic particles at the first step is then confirmed by identification of their chemical composition by vibrational spectroscopy 134 in general particles smaller than 1 mm are hardly distinguishable by optical microscopy in order to identify particles larger than 1 mm as mp the following criteria were proposed 1 no cellular or organic structures are visible in mp particle fiber 2 uniform thickness for a fiber and a three dimensional bending completely straight fibers indicate a biological origin 3 transparency and uniform coloration blue red black and yellow for fragments and 4 transparent or whitish fragments should be carefully examined by the high resolution microscopy to exclude organic origin 135 fluorescence microscopy is also used for mps analysis a variety of compounds can act as highly fluorescent dyes 133 nile red can bind to mps surface and fluoresces in a range of colors from yellow to dark red depending on the degree of hydrophobicity of the plastic surface 136 it is noted that for nile red it would be preferable to choose green fluorescence excitation emission at 460 525 nm instead of red 565 630 nm for the following reasons 1 synthetic polymers fluoresce better in green 2 natural pollutants fluoresce in red but not green after pre treatment in hydrogen peroxide and 3 the background signal from the green filter membrane was lower 133 however the emitted colour of nile red can be affected by changes in the hydrophobicity of plastics due to surface contamination therefore in order to clearly distinguish between different types of plastics it is necessary to include dyes that produce non overlapping colors karakolis et al 136 tested a significant number of idye poly dyes and rit dyemore synthetic dyes in three modes green red and far red detecting that the pink dye fluoresces in the red area blue in the far red rit dyemore kentucky sky in the green and red a significant advantage of these dyes over nile red is a much lower cost scanning electron microscopy sem captures images of a sample with a high spatial resolution by scanning the sample s surface with an electron beam in raster mode potential mps can be differentiated from other organic or inorganic impurities by studying images of their morphology sem can also be used to analyze the erosion process of mps extracted from the natural environment by studying the features of surface textures such as cracks and pits the combined use of sem and energy dispersive analysis eds can provide detailed information about the elemental composition of mps and the inorganic additives they contain 137 the ftir spectroscopy allows distinguishing a greater number of plastic fragments than visual inspection using an optical microscope it helps to detect transparent or white fragments e g pe and pp which are poorly visible song et al 138 demonstrated that the number of fragments determined as plastic by ftir spectroscopy was 8 times higher than that by optical microscopy a significant amount of colored fragments was also observed in the surface layer of water according to ftir spectroscopy data they were attributed to synthetic resin paints and a thermoactive matrix in fiber reinforced plastics optical microscopy allows for the faster and easier analysis of probes it can easily detect mps except for fragments smaller than 50 μm raman spectroscopy provides a spectral fingerprint of mps which is needed to identify the chemical composition 139 since ftir and raman are complimentary techniques their combined use is beneficial for better identification of mps 140 equipped with a microscope the spectrometer may measure individual mp particles 10 μm for ftir 1 μm for raman 141 one may perform a spectral mapping of mps distributed on a support 142 unlike ftir the raman instrument probes a sample with the laser beam whose power must be tuned avoiding damaging the sample the permanent monitoring of the mps contamination in different locations requires a huge number of probes and their automated analysis 143 identification of mps by spectroscopic methods relies on the match between the measured spectra and that from a database sometimes spectra coincide partially because of degradation of a plastic fragment the presence of contaminations and physical scattering effects 144 a similar problem appears when mps were extracted from biological materials their pre treatment usually includes digesting of organic matter by aggressive compounds like mineral acids h2so4 hno3 hcl or strong bases e g naoh koh that can cause damage to polymers 145 the development of algorithms for automatic spectrum processing focuses on the identification of mps with higher precision without a significant increase in calculation time in contrast to vibrational spectroscopies thermoanalytical methods are destructive techniques where a sample is thermally decomposed under defined conditions thermogravimetric analysis tga measures the loss in mass of a sample when it is heated at a programmed rate in a controlled atmosphere combining tga with other techniques such as ftir spectroscopy differential scanning calorimetry gas chromatography and mass spectrometry provides one with sophisticated tools for studies of the thermal properties and composition of materials plastics usually have low melting points which are individual for each type of polymer therefore the analysis of thermograms allows to individualize polymers in composition and reveal the nature of mps 105 another combined technique for the identification and quantification of mps is pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry pyro gc ms 146 here the formed pyrolysis products are then analyzed via gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry as it was demonstrated experimentally by primpke et al 147 pyro gc ms gives a comparable with ftir results there is also thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms which provides reliable data too 148 dynamic light scattering dls is used to obtain information about the size distribution of small particles in solution 149 small particles are those much smaller the wavelength of the irradiating light usually λ 800 nm particle size is determined from fluctuations in scattered light intensity due to the brownian movement of the particles in solution the method has been applied to polymer and colloid science since the 60s of the past century 150 151 dls can be performed in situ providing valuable information about the formation of nps during photo degradation gigault et al 152 studying the impact of uv irradiation on mps in ultrapure water concluded that i during photo degradation tiny nps are being produced and ii the process causes defects in parent mps accelerating degradation and making them randomly shaped in another study a decrement in the hydrodynamic radius of polyester polyurethane particles in highly diluted suspensions at ambient temperature was taken as evidence of degradation caused by anchored peptides 153 nanoparticle tracking analysis nta combines laser light scattering microscopy with a charge coupled device ccd camera which enables the visualization and recording of nanoparticles in solution nta complements dls and is particularly valuable for analyzing polydisperse nanosized particles 154 lambert and wagner 155 applied nta to follow the formation of nanoplastics during the degradation of ps disposable coffee cup lid samples were immersed in demineralized water and exposed to uv vis light at 30 c in a weathering chamber the difference in quantity of nanoparticles was noted already after 14 days of experiment after 56 days number of ps nanoparticles exceeded that in a reference vial in 3 times the surface of mps can be covered by natural organic matter nom nom can be present as polysaccharides proteins sugars aminosugars aliphatic acids hydrocarbons tannins etc 156 nom functionalized mps are less inclined to the aggregation due to the electrosteric stabilization and steric hindrance 157 if the scope of a study is assessing the effect from nom one may measure zeta potential zeta potential measurements are routinely used for evaluation of the stability of colloidal solutions the effects of ph ionic strength colloid concentration and the presence of dissolved matters 158 the method allows determining the effective charge at the surface of mps and its evolution depending on the quantity of nom the amount of adsorbed nom exposure media properties and ability to form aggregates 159 remote sensing and monitoring are of paramount importance for studies of marine plastic pollution the passive receivers measure the reflected sunlight in spectral intervals from visible to near infrared nir and short wave infrared active systems are lidar or radar 92 lidar uses lasers nd yag to generate a flux of photons which eventually scattered back to the receiver 160 providing so called point cloud datasets 161 air molecules cloud droplets or aerosol particles in the atmosphere as well as water molecules and suspended particles at the surface layer of the oceans can be the origin of the backscattered signal 160 lidar detection can be done regardless of the time of day or night at low solar angles through aerosol loads and thin clouds 162 lidar technology has revolutionized different areas it allows archaeologists to study the large areas of terrain in details and hard to reach locations with 3d visualization of the landscape 163 evaluate the level of dissolved organic matter of anthropogenic and natural origin oil pollutions phytoplankton 164 165 in marine waters observe metallic neutral and ion layers in the atmosphere and study the chemistry and physics of the mesosphere lower thermosphere 166 portable equipment for mps detection in the field becomes more required asamoah et al 167 designed a prototype of a portable optical sensor based on the simultaneous recording of the specular light reflection and the forward interference pattern from the light microplastic interactions in water it is needed for the detection of transparent and translucent mps in water zhang et al 168 proposed a custom made portable pyrolyzing mass spectrometer for the fast identification and weight related quantification of mps such portable equipment can be used at the ship based marine surveys and allow avoiding time delay between sampling onboard and laboratory analysis bianco et al 169 proposed a holographic identification method for plastic which combines digital holography with artificial intelligence the machine learning procedure uses an optimal set of holographic features to improve the mps recognition up to over 99 accuracy the machine learning approach in analysis of μftir hyperspectral imaging has also demonstrated a high efficiency in identifying a mixed plastic sample regardless deteriorated spectral quality at the edges of a mp fragment 170 5 stimulated degradation of microplastics the development of efficient techniques for stimulated degradation of mps is the present day challenge it is extremely difficult to remove mp or nanoplastic fragments from the marine environment suggesting that in general the most effective mitigation strategies must prevent or reduce admission of mps into the system or develop methods for the natural degradation 171 additionally substituting plastics with alternative materials and delivery systems scaling up the chemical conversion capacity reducing plastic waste implementing better recycling avoiding leakage into the environment can decrease pollution with mps 172 in the natural environment under the action of such factors as moisture salinity light microbial effect dissolved gases heat or significant temperature fluctuations mps could break up into smaller particles and degrade by reducing the average molecular weight the resistance against external factors and the extent of degradation depends on the polymer type as well as on the intensity and duration of the impact 5 1 natural and artificial degradation the environmental degradation of mps can occur via the physical mechanism involving changes in the bulk and the chemical one inducing changes at the molecular level 4 the former proceeds via fragmentation and results in generation of nanoparticles the state of the art methods for the extraction separation identification and quantification of nanoplastic in the environment have been recently reviewed by li et al 173 the degradation pathways and products depend on the polymer type ultimately leading to low molecular weight polymer fragments 27 some types of mps can degrade completely at ambient conditions however it will need a long time hundreds of years predictive accelerated weathering testing is possible but existing standards often fall short 174 that is why it is important to find out how to accelerate the degradation rate the artificial or stimulated degradation is distinguished from the natural one by a range of characteristics the natural degradation includes i biodegradation ii photodegradation under uv vis light illumination iii thermo oxidative degradation and iv hydrolysis the first one proceeds under the action of living organisms 175 176 there are several types including enzymatic biodegradation 177 degradation due to interaction with earthworms 178 179 or microalgae 180 biofilm driven degradation 181 182 the thermo oxidative degradation is a long term process actuated by a synergetic action of oxidizing agents and moderate temperatures the degradation via hydrolysis occurs from the reaction with water 176 electrochemical degradation 183 photocatalysis 184 interaction with distracting agents for example carbon based materials 185 can be attributed to artificial degradation in response to external action mps can be resistive to degradation stable or easily degradable the most frequently used types of plastic like pe belong to the first category the second category includes poly lactic acid pla poly butylene succinate pbs polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat ecoflex and polyhydroxyalkonates phas 186 in the case of biodegradation a complex community of microorganisms and macrofoulants forming biofilms and altering the surface properties of mps is involved 187 at the first rapid step the organic molecules become attached to surface forming a thin layer at the next longer stage it is colonized by bacteria producing extra cellular polymeric substances then by micro algae and algal spores 188 the total biodegradation of a plastic fragment means a complete conversion of carbonaceous constituents into co2 water and biomass 176 according to the european committee for standardization the european standard en 17033 from 2018 plastic is ranked biodegradable when over 90 of the material will be transformed into co2 within 2 years at 20 28 c 189 under aerobic conditions biodegradation of polymers proceeds with the conversion of polymeric carbons c polymer into carbon dioxide c co2 microbial biomass c biomass and the carbon fraction that remains in the residual polymers and monomers c residual polymer 190 191 c polymer o 2 c c o 2 c biomass c residual polymer pe degrades slowly in the environment because of cc single bonds which are hard to break in photo oxidative degradation however pe may contain a small number of unsaturated cc bonds which are vulnerable to the action of such oxidizing agents as o3 and nox pe is a non absorbing polymer making it stable to the photochemical reactions chromophoric defects can favor the light absorption leading to the formation of radicals for example 4 192 c h 2 c h 2 c h 2 c h 2 c h 2 ch h ch ch h 2 the reactions as the intermolecular hydrogen abstraction crosslinking or addition to oxygen followed by disproportionation of the resulting alkyl radicals can be observed too 193 the first intermediate substance hydroperoxides decomposes with the appearance of macro alkoxy and hydroxyl radical oh with subsequent formation of the ketones ketones in turn can photochemically react by norrish type i resulting in the formation of carboxylic acids esters and lactones alternatively the reaction may proceed by norrish type ii ending with vinyl type unsaturations and acetone scheme 1a thermal degradation of pe does not follow either norrish mechanisms pe gets destroyed at 100 c with the formation of ketones as oxidative products without vinyl groups as by products 193 scheme 1b in the environment lacking both sunlight and oxygen anaerobic thermal degradation of pe cannot occur easily because it needs high temperatures 350 c 4 pet can slowly decompose in water because of thermal oxidative degradation and hydrolysis with the formation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol 4 the degradation rate increases with crystalline domains in pet are getting inferior to the amorphous phase 194 poly lactic acid pla refers to the biodegradable polymers which can be destroyed primarily by temperature catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester bonds 195 followed by the bacterial effect on the fragmented residues 196 however often researchers mark that pla biodegradation begins at high temperatures typically at about 55 58 c 196 197 pva degradation usually includes cleavage of the main polymer chain with subsequent aldolase and hydrolase reactions the final products acetic acid and hydroxyl fatty acids can be involved in the tca cycle scheme 2 198 and β oxidation 199 pva biodegradation by single bacterial strains fungi and yeasts under different environmental conditions was studied in detail 200 pvc biodegradation includes three major steps i depolymerization or breaking down polymer chains ii formation of oxidized intermediate products and iii total mineralization to co2 h2o and cl 201 secondary urethane rich mps could be formed during polyurethanes destruction through hydrolysis of the ester component followed by erosion and aggregation of oligomers 181 different insect larvae are able to ingest mps particles in particular ps and accelerate their degradation mealworms and superworms can ingest ps and destroy it wherein that ps biodegradation is gut microbiota dependence 202 in the case of mealworms ps degradation is possible by bacterial exiguobacterium sp strain yt2 however isolated bacterial strain yt2 outside demonstrated much poorer ps degradation efficiency comparing with the gut system 203 some worms can soften thin film pe and metabolize them to ethylene glycol 204 earthworms like e fetida e andrei or lumbricus rubellus can convert organic matter into vermicompost besides gut associated processes vermicomposting can takes place in the earthworm cast associated processes whereby earthworm casts participate in the further decomposition of more recalcitrant organic wastes gut associated processes biodegradation predominantly occurs during the gastrointestinal transit in earthworms whereas cast associated processes prolong the biodegradation of the recalcitrant molecules of feedstock combined with the earthworm gastrointestinal secretions of organic molecules outside the earthworms 179 song et al 205 demonstrated that that land snails achatina fulica can accelerate biodegradation of ps hydrolysis degradation of the polymers can flow either via a bulk or surface erosion mechanism if the rate of hydrolysis exceeds the rate of diffusion of water into the bulk the surface erosion dominates if the rate of diffusion of water exceeds the rate of the hydrolysis reaction bulk erosion takes place the mechanism of the polymer hydrolysis can be changed from surface to bulk when the particle thickness decreases below a critical value 186 electro fenton like ef like technology with the assistance of efficient heterogeneous catalysts tio2 c cathode can be utilized for the step by step pvc degradation o2 is reduced to h2o2ad h2o2ad directly transforms into the hydroxyl radical oh without desorption the rupture of pvc chain occurs with further exposure of chloride 183 miao et al deduce the orr mechanism at the tio2 c cathode 206 ti iv e ti iii 2 ti iii o 2 2 h 2 ti iv oh 2 ti iv oh e 2 ti iv o h oh up to 10 short chain organics like alkenes alcohols monocarboxylic acids dicarboxylic acids and esters can be formed as intermediate products during the pvc mps degradation 183 kiendrebeogo et al 207 proposed an electrooxidation method based on in situ generation of oxidizing radicals like hydroxyls oh whose standard reduction potential e0 oh h2o 2 80 v she allows to break the polymeric chain the proposed mechanism starts with breaking the carbon hydrogen bonds and the formation of carbon oxygen bonds proceeds via breaking the cc or cph bonds and their oxidation and concludes with the release of water and carbon dioxide molecules the electrolytes influence on the reaction pathway was emphasized by using nano3 as a supporting electrolyte for mps decomposition in direct anodic oxidation with oh radicals in the case of na2so4 and nacl the decomposition of mps could be carried out by both direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation via reactive mediators hypochlorous ions and persulfate ions which are formed according to the following reactions 207 208 2 cl cl 2 2 e cl 2 h 2 o hclo cl h hclo clo h cl oh clo h e clo oh clo 2 h e clo 2 oh clo 3 h e clo 3 oh clo 4 h e 2 hso 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 e so 4 2 oh so 4 oh so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 the concentration of oh radicals depends on the nature of anode material high oxygen evaluation overpotential electrodes like boron doped diamond allow forming high quantity of weakly adsorbed radicals whereas dimensionally stable anodes favor the formation of less reactive and covalently bonded chemisorbed oxygen 208 full oxidation of organic particles can be described as m oh r m m co 2 n h 2 o h e where m is an active site at the anode surface r is the fraction of an organic compound 209 heterogeneous photocatalysis is an efficient oxidation process for the removal of pollutants which could be accomplished at ambient conditions herewith photocatalyst usually tio2 is inexpensively procurable non toxic and stable 184 210 211 when the semiconductor is bombarded with photons with e eg bandgap electrons e from the valance band are transferred into the conduction band leaving behind positive holes h 212 semiconductor hν h e electrons in the conduction band can reduce o2 forming superoxide radicals o2 which react with holes in the valence band producing singlet oxygen 1o2 212 213 e o 2 o 2 free electrons holes and reactive oxidizing species react with the surface adsorbed impurities mineralizing organic pollutants into h2o and co2 pollutant ros co 2 h 2 o one of the ways to mps degradation can be implemented by using heteroatom based carbon nanotubes cnts kang et al 185 are shown that mn ncnts under the hydrothermal conditions can increase mps degradation up to 50 wt of mps removed via hydrolysis moreover the intermediates from mps degradation are not hazardous to microorganisms and may serve as the nutrient for algae magnetic spring like cnts were prepared via pyrolysis of melamine with mncl2 and subsequent acid treatment to remove the superficial mn containing species and tip mn particles from the surface of cnts 185 melamine is the source of c and n atoms mncl2 is the source of mn pyrolysis of their mixture may form mn nps or carbide phases depending on the temperature of synthesis preparation of the m n doped cnts via tip growth mechanism is a convenient technique allowing preparing cnts bamboo like cnts or a mixture of bamboo like cnts with amorphous carbons without use of extra high temperatures for example using metal organic frameworks zif 8 zif 67 zif 68 zif 69 or hybrids the one as sacrificial carbon sources can help to control the composition and morphology of the heteroatoms doped carbon and as results the nature of active centers 214 217 either for the preparation of carbons biomasses can be used 218 multicity of frameworks and biomass types can vary properties of resulting carbons in a wide range 5 2 microplastics removal from water metal organic frameworks mofs constitute a new generation of two or three dimensional crystalline porous materials assembled through the coordination reactions between polydentate organic ligands and metal cations salts or clusters 219 220 mofs have attracted great attention due to their tunable porosity pore functionality various pore compositions and open metal sites 221 making them ideal media for several applications such as catalysis separations storage biomedical applications etc 222 chen et al 223 tested zr mof based foam materials for various types and concentrations of mps suspension the authors suggested that the ideal materials for the mps removal are expected to possess quite definite properties i well developed pore structure and porosity to provide high permeability of solvent during multistep filtration ii proper force to ensure mps isolation of and recycling iii high durability and iv easy of processing 223 for application in the filtration systems a mof powder has to be attached to a flexible robust and stable substrate composites containing zr mof and melamine foam mf satisfy these requests uio 66 zr6o4 oh 4 co2 12 is the zirconium and terephthalic acid based mof consisting of an inner zr6o4 oh 4 core in which the triangular faces of the zr6 octahedron are alternatively capped by μ3 o and μ3 oh groups which was prepared by lillerud et al 224 225 among different composites uio 66 x mf n where x h nh2 oh br and no2 n 1 4 n stands for the mass loading of mofs ranging from 4 4 to 25 8 wt uio 66 oh mf 3 shown high removal efficiency reaching 95 5 1 2 and high water stability the mechanism of removal can be considered from several prospectives i due to the strong electrostatic interaction with mps ii possible interactions like hydrogen bonds or van der waals interaction with mps and iii the pore structure of the foam substrate is favorable for the rapid flow of the solvent as well as facilitates contact between mps and mof particles 223 the limiting factor for the mps removal by filtration through mofs based membranes can be connected with possible fouling 226 however often membranes are recyclable 227 that may reduce the importance of fouling mof based composites can be stable and easily regenerated after the adsorption process 228 perren et al 49 applied another electrochemical technique electrocoagulation for the removal of the pe microbeads in different concentrations during this two step process metal electrodes were used to produce coagulant formed by reaction of the metal ions usually fe2 or al3 with oh ions electrically as result coagulants affect the surface charge of the solids phase in colloidal solution threatening their stability these processes lead to the coagulations by van der waals forces forming the seeds which can float up to the water surface due to the interaction with hydrogen formed in the electrolysis it was shown that such a method for microbead removal is highly efficient with pollutant removal rate of 99 and a low cost one 49 it should be noted that in aquatic environments mps can undergo homoaggregation as two or more plastic particles or heteroaggregation when different types of particles like natural minerals and seaweeds are gathered such phenomena have a significant influence on the mps distribution in natural waters the heteroaggregation of mps is more common because the surface of mp particle may bear hydrophobic functional groups that promote adsorption of dissolved organic matter and organisms 229 moreover different sediments and minerals may anchor on the surface of mps for example the electrostatic interaction can promote the coating of the positively charged ps with negatively charged alginate or fe2o3 resulting in the tightening of aggregates 230 the likelihood of attachment between colliding particles is controlled by both van der waals and electrical double layer forces described in the framework of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory and non dlvo interactions 231 232 magnetic seeded filtration msf or magnetic extraction are other approaches for the separation of mps 233 234 it is a perfect alternative to classical filtration because it can be used for a large volume of water with minimal steps 235 at the first stage of msf processes magnetic seed particles are dispersed into the suspension and interact with the mps particles forming agglomerates that can be removed using a magnet 233 this technique cannot be considered new because it has been used in the recycling industry for many years it applies to the removal of magnetic solid particles as well as to nonmagnetic water pollutants such as viruses algae various other suspended solids or dissolved pollutants 236 the first detailed investigation in the field of magnetic separation in water pollution control was made by christopher de latour in 1973 236 237 he described water treatment with 1000 ppm of the magnetite seeding material aiming to remove coliform bacteria and orthophosphate ions when we speak about magnetic seeded materials magnetite particles are primarily meant magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 have the spinel type crystal structure and the correlation between their diffraction profiles is more than 99 that form the necessity for additional inquiry by x ray absorption spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mössbauer spectroscopy 238 239 or in depth studies conventional x ray diffraction method to ensure the phase identification 240 241 one of the benefits of iron oxides based particles is the ease of control particles shape size and surface composition due to the choice of synthetic procedure including the following solvothermal 239 microwave assisted 242 243 co precipitation 244 modified co precipitation 245 thermal salts decomposition 246 electrochemical 247 sonochemical 248 or their combination 249 etc one of the prospective low cost and scalable industry methods for the iron oxides preparation is polyol synthesis 250 251 the magnetic properties of the iron oxide particles are tunable too for example the substitution of fe3 in magnetite with rare earth ions like sm3 gd3 or eu3 could improve their magnetic behavior 239 246 252 maghemite is also prospective material for magnetic separation and may be even favored because it can be prepared by a simple procedure of co precipitation without protective inert atmosphere hence reducing the final product cost control of synthesis parameters such as type of solution ph temperature etc can allow preparing maghemite particles with satisfying magnetic properties and surface charge misra et al 235 used polyoxometalate ionic liquid adsorbed onto spherical fe2o3 sio2 core shell nps it was concluded that this composite is an effective agent removing organic inorganic microbial and microplastic pollutants recovery of mps was tested on the commercial colloidal solutions of spherical ps beads even an increase of the colloidal solution volume did not prevent a high extent of microbeads recovery more than 90 based on quantitative dynamic light scattering analysis coated hydrophobic fe nps can be also used for the magnetic separation of mps grbic et al 234 noted that the less extent of medium size mps recovery is due to the relatively lower surface area to volume ratio in some cases recovery of mps was exceeding 100 which was attributed to the fragmentation of brittle mps besides pure iron oxides composites containing both iron oxides and carbons could be used for the mps separation it was shown that the agglomerates of mps m cnts prepared via co precipitation synthesis of iron oxide presumably fe3o4 in the presence of cnts were removed under magnetic forces within 300 min herewith the mechanism of the mps adsorption will differ depending on the mps nature π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the composite and pa amide groups non hydrophobic interactions hydrophobic interaction and π π electron conjugation between the composite and pet and pe after mps separation composite could be recycled by thermal treatment at 600 c and used for further application with high efficiency 253 carbon based materials can be used for filtration in combination with oxidation for example in 254 ozonation integrated with granular activated carbon filtration looks promising because ozone can destroy small mps and large particles can remove due to the physical adsorption however it is unclear what mechanism is mainly responsible for the mps removal wang et al 255 demonstrated that biochar exhibits high removal efficiency towards the polystyrene microsphere three possible mechanisms can be highlighted stuck trapped and entangled i mps can be fixed in the gaps between the filter particles which are smaller than the particle size ii mps can be trapped in the pore system due to the specific for the concrete type of carbon porosity connecting with moving mps particles inside the larger pores and future loss of the mobility in the case of slow water flow in the pores smaller than 30 μm and iii biochar can produce small flaky shaped particles which can possess colloidal particle properties and entangle mps particles increasing their size and as result decreasing mobility the effect of the photocatalytic tio2 based micromotor on mps is tremendously promising it was shown that au mag tio2 mag ni fe micromotors can move efficiently in both water and peroxide under uv illumination 256 the authors proposed two mechanisms of the mps removal using au ni tio2 micromotors in water or hydrogen peroxide containing solutions as individual micromotor au mag tio2 can remove mps due to the phoretic interaction when au ni tio2 micromotors are assembled in chain form through the interaction between magnetic ni layers under an external magnetic field they can remove mps because of shoveling or pushing interactions despite core shell micromotors the janus type particles can be considered as prospective agents for mps extraction rius ayra et al 257 underlined two main innovative trends in mps removal based on changes in wettability i modification of the mps surface to confer hydrophilicity and increase their permeability to water using particles like compounds like fe3o4 oh or coo and ii use of superhydrophobic materials for example superhydrophobic iron powder in two immiscible phases system water oil both approaches promote selectivity of mps removal and can be occasionally used thereby mofs iron oxides and their composites coated iron particles and micromotors are convenient substitutives for the traditional methods of the mps filtration and treatment one of the benefits of such agents is the ability to tune their properties pore size and structure porosity nanoparticle size and surface charge etc which are optimal for a specific system furthermore it allows recovery of the bacteria ultra small particles and pollutants in the soluble form like heavy metals ions whereas traditional filtration based technique is applicable for solid particles not less than the filter mesh size ideally magnetic separation could be used directly in the environment without sampling however some open questions remain i is it possible to calculate the optimal concentration of such particles needed for the full recovery of pollutants ii how the stability of mofs or nps will be changed during multiple repeating of the recovery procedure depending on the real water system salinity ph viscosity etc iii is it possible to block active sites at the surface of the mofs or nps due to the adsorption of the pollutants iv what are the criteria for choosing the mechanism of effect for example phoretic or shoveling in the case of micromotors v what is the atisfactory quality of the mofs or nps vi what is the mechanism for recovery of degraded agents distraction oxidizing changes in the structure due kirkendall effect etc and vii how to evaluate the error in calculating the degree of mps recovery in the case when mofs or nps breaking the mps particles during the interaction 6 prospects of recycling landfilling of plastic solid waste psw is one of the traditionally practiced methods of management of municipal solid waste 258 progressive accumulation of psw in landfills imposes a risk of wider environmental pollution such as groundwater contamination the release of landfill gases like methane in this regard thermochemical post treatment processes such as pyrolysis have been promoted as a better alternative than combustion and gasification because of smaller emissions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide 259 such processes lead to the production of hydrocarbon oil of high calorific value i e bio oil in the case of pyrolysis this benefit has made the method classified as the most appropriate according to life cycle assessment in sustainable management 260 a circular economy concept which is becoming more and more popular nowadays seeks to promote a sustainable way of living where resources are retained in the economy for as long as possible accordingly to the concept the psw is formed since plastics escape the loops that feed resources back into the production system because of being mismanaged at the consumption and management stage 261 hence recycling is considered the only way to reduce the psw 262 recycling plastic bottles and containers has long existed in the industry 263 the pre requisition for the successful functioning of recycling schemes is the separation of the principal polymers with a high degree of precision which is usually counting on a responsible consumer apart from plastics from commodities construction material may contain a significant portion of plastic for recycling 264 the recycled plastic may again return into construction material like concrete 265 and bitumen 266 despite obvious importance recycling polymers still is a major challenge because of technological and economic issues that restrain the progress in this field 267 there are four routes of psw treatment constituting primary re extrusion secondary mechanical tertiary chemical and quaternary energy recovery schemes and technologies 268 the re introduction of clean scrap of polymer to the extrusion cycle is normally applied in the processing line itself although the properties of most plastics are significantly compromised after a number of processing cycles fortunately there are technologies available for sorting and recycling plastic solid waste into feedstocks 269 mechanical recycling commonly includes collection sorting washing and grinding of the material main packaging plastics as pet pe pp ps and pvc is often economically feasible to recycle by the secondary schemes due to high turnover rates 270 another example in favor of circular economy is a concept of distributed recycling via additive manufacturing promoting the use of recycled materials by means of the mechanical recycling process in the 3d printing process chain 271 the tertiary approach to processing psw is chemical recycling 272 it gathers techniques such as chemolysis pyrolysis fluid catalytic cracking hydrogen techniques and gasification 273 effective separation of mixed psw is necessary to produce the highest quality recycled plastic products by the secondary or tertiary process among separation technologies such as automatic sorting gravity separation and electrostatic separation froth flotation is a major and efficient separation method 274 furthermore the properties of recycled psw can be improved by adding different reinforcements like sand fibers metal powder etc 275 future studies to develop hybrid chemical physical and biological processes for recovering and upcycling mps into add value products are expected 276 apart from better waste management development of landfill psw processing techniques we suppose that advancements in space exploration where limited resources stimulate their reuse will sharpen existing practices of recycling and promote them to the next level it is known that 3d printing from recycled plastic waste is a well known way to give a second life 277 the first steps in this direction have been already taken at the end of 2019 nasa sent to the international space station iss the plastics recycler developed by made in space inc combination with an integrated 3d printer allows printing different items like wrenches antennas holders adapters connectors and spare parts it is quite conceivable that the abundance of plastic things in a confined space requires to filtrate air and clean filters from collected mps recycling those mps might be reasonable during the long range exploration missions to mars 7 conclusions environmental pollution with plastic fragments has a global character and the situation is continuously worsening the amount of plastic waste entering the environment will not diminish significantly in years to come because of the growing population it means that rate of mps accumulation in nature including such valuable resource as drinking water will remain considerably exceeding that of its natural degradation under the action of environmental factors as heat and illumination furthermore the external impact including global warming will favor fragmentation of mps down to nps the latter would be much more difficult to detect and remove the surface of mps may accumulate metal ions and microorganisms posing a toxic danger for living organisms commercial systems for automatic express collection and analysis of mps are making their way to the market since confident identification of mps in probes is already unthinkable without the employment of vibrational spectroscopy remote sensing systems for preliminary screening of mps in the environment are foreseen to show up soon as for now some sophisticated laboratory devices combining optical microscopy with ftir or raman as well as ftir tga couples are promoted by leading producers of scientific instruments as specifically designed for analysis of mps these facts suggest that monitoring and identification of mps will soon become a routine procedure although common standards on probes pre treatment are still a matter of debate advances in the identification of mps and global pollution mapping highlighted the need for the removal strategy up to date the most practiced approach is filtering separating mps by different means sieves filters membranes etc which is naturally applicable in water treatment plants and potable water installations although some improvements as pre treatment stages with photocatalytic and biological degradation can be introduced too the most challenging question of what to do with fragments of plastic in the environment remains open as has been shown in the review

13346,microplastic mp pollution steadily evolves into an alarming issue for global food security and the wellness of modern society the increasing number of reports reveal the micro and nanosized plastic fragments at almost every place on earth from the ocean bottom to the mountain top mps were also found in many living species including humans the omnipresence of mps had put on the agenda the necessity of joint efforts aimed at controlling the volumes of production limiting the single use goods encouraging responsible consumption and improving waste management mps are very stable and degrading too slowly to rely on the natural self cleansing capacity of the environment this review describes the growing efforts in the development of efficient methods for removal stimulated degradation and recycling of mps the practiced approaches to the extraction of mps from water probes techniques for identification of polymer types strategies for the stimulated natural and artificial degradation of the material are thoroughly discussed the inquiry concludes with an overview of trends in the recycling of mps and pollution control the review covers about two hundred recent sources and allows a reader to oversee the whole spectrum of activities and to select the most appropriate techniques for a given task keywords microplastics identification extraction removal degradation 1 introduction over the past 60 years the world s plastic production has multiplied 560 times 1 in the last decade the annual amount was persistently growing 280 million tonnes in 2012 2 359 million tonnes in 2018 and 368 million tonnes in 2019 3 about a half of the quantity goes to the manufacture of single use consumer goods which after being utilized for just a few moments become waste about 58 of the plastic waste enters the natural environment accumulates and preserves in a solid form for the long term whereas 18 of plastics are recycled and 24 are burnt 4 in 2020 the prevention measures against the spread of the covid 19 virus have been contributing to an incremental accumulation of plastic waste due to the single use character and frequent change of protective wear 5 at present less than half of produced plastic is recycled or safely deposited at managed landfill sites the rest is carelessly abandoned for degradation and littering the environment plastics have strong corrosion resistance and can persist for hundreds of years environmental stress cracking is likely to occur already at the initial stage of natural weathering 6 the larger pieces of plastic will break up into smaller pieces down to below 5 mm where the fragments will have their dimensions of about microns it is expected that from 2 5 107 to 1 3 108 tons of such pieces will be floating in the ocean by 2100 7 the plastic pollution problem rises concerns and urges an adequate response from the scientific community there is increasing attention to the plastic pollution problem as evidenced by the exponentially growing number of dedicated articles 8 authors of the bibliometric analysis noted that most of the keywords from mp studies have emerged in the last 5 years reflecting re born of the field which traces its roots back to the first observation of carpenter et al in 1972 9 these keywords were divided into 4 clusters where the first one focuses on the abundance accumulation and mps pollution the second concerns the transport the long term presence and degradation of mps the third is about the identification of mps and quantification methods and the fourth considers mps ingested by living organisms it comes out that mps in the marine environment are more actively studied than in other environments the chemistry studies constitute only a tiny percentage of the published literature 8 this is further reflected by the titles of the most cited reviews 10 14 which are essentially describing the mp pollution of the marine environment and its impact on marine organisms only recently some reviews dedicated to the issues of collecting and removing mps from the polluted environment have started to appear 15 17 this work provides a systematic overview of currently practicing methods and the progress reached so far in the development of efficient techniques for the processing of mps in water medium the techniques for the air filtering and soil cleaning from mps were addressed to less extent and can be found elsewhere 18 21 since we will focus on mps a couple of recent reviews on nanoplastic can be mentioned 22 23 a classical approach of search by keywords was practiced for the literature survey the pre selected keywords were microplastic s in conjunction with pollution identification removal extraction degradation and recycling common search engines as google scholar web of science as well as those of leading publishing houses acs elsevier hindawi mdpi rsc springer and wiley were used currently may 2021 google scholar returns 31 100 results for microplastic a manual selection was performed among the obtained references based on their abstracts to ensure that the studies were relevant to the scope of the review a pool of some 500 articles was selected from where more than 270 published items were cited as references the references are covering the time interval from 2007 to 2021 with only ca 5 of accounts dated earlier their annual distribution follows the booming trend of publications on mps evidencing a representative coverage 2 microplastics pollution the plastic debris in the marine environment is classified into four different size categories mps are particles in the size range from 1 μm to 5 mm 24 they can be either primary mps coming from manufacturing and packaging or secondary mps originating from fragmentation or degradation of larger pieces due to mechanical impact or chemical processes 25 three other groups are macroplastic larger than 20 mm mesoplastic 5 20 mm and nanoplastic smaller than 1 μm 26 the morphology of fragments is very diverse fibers microbeads films foams pellets etc classification based on size is practically useful for anyone looking for the right meshes to take the fragments of particular sizes from water probes unfortunately the selected fragments are not necessarily the plastic ones and the task is to distinguish plastic from other kinds of marine debris 24 the classification does not consider the variation in chemical composition and properties of plastic there is a great variety of polymers but the most abundant are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyurethane pu 27 28 pe is present in high density low density and linear low density derivatives mps were detected virtually everywhere on earth in oceans seas and rivers sea ice and sediments including polar regions 29 in air and soil in animals and the bioavailable deepest part of the world s ocean 30 in 1972 carpenter et al for the first time described floating mps in the ocean 9 peng et al 30 in 2018 reported about the high abundance of mps in mariana trench bottom water and sediments from 2 06 to 13 51 pieces per liter in hadal bottom waters and from 200 to 2200 pieces per liter in hadal sediments jamieson et al found in the hindguts of amphipods from six of the deepest parts of the earth s oceans japan izu bonin mariana kermadec new hebrides and the peru chile trenches mps of man made synthetic or semi synthetic fibers 84 and fragments 16 only in the new hebrides trench amphipods the mps were not detected 31 kanhai et al 32 revealed the pervasiveness of mps throughout the water column of the arctic central basin where the predominant form of mps were fibers 90 results obtained in the haushgrten observatory indicated the high numbers of small sized mps 80 of the mps were 25 μm in arctic deep sea sediments 33 the immersion and deposition of mps at the bottom of an aquatic system might be caused by the following factors i the strong winds and storms spreading mps over the surface of a water basin and facilitating their distribution across a water column by currents and turbulences ii microbes colonize the surface of mps increasing the weight of solid phase and provoking the immersion to dipper water layers and iii interaction of mps with microbes may lead to the development of a microbiota community 34 different aquatic systems in densely populated areas and their habitats and sediments are polluted with mps the thames river 35 37 the danube river 38 39 the great laurentian lakes 40 lake geneva 41 the baltic sea 42 44 onego lake 45 and the rhine river 46 the majority of plastic debris in water comes from the waste generated by large coastal cities worldwide 47 via wind currents animal ingestion 48 and drainage systems 40 shipping the presence of mps was found in bottled water of both pet and glass bottles 49 mps were found in human food 50 honey and unrefined cane sugar 51 beer 52 canned sardines and sprats 53 salt 54 55 wine 56 soft drinks 57 chicken meat 58 and packaged meat 59 pe pp polyester polyamide and acrylic from clothing diapers etc can form fibers which are defined by the width to length ratio bigger than 1 29 fibers from the washing of clothes can significantly affect the contamination of the sewage water because these textiles may contain 170 more synthetic than natural fibers like cotton wool and silk 60 domestic washing of synthetics textiles contributes up to 35 of the microfiber pollution in the atmosphere the air contamination with mps is rarely discussed however researchers detected that dust contains mostly plastic fibers which are taken by the wind 61 63 the levels of the critical mass concentration and type of mps which would possess danger for human health are yet to be established the recent research indicated the presence of polyester 56 acrylic 31 nylon 9 and pp 5 mps in the stream water and snow samples at mt everest 64 environmental problems and health risks remain on the agenda researchers note both direct harm from mps and harm from bacteria on its surface pathogenic and non pathogenic vibrios 65 persistent organic pollutants or hydrophobic organic chemicals in addition the combination of certain types of functional groups on the surface of mp particles and heavy metals can have a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity 66 it is also worth evaluating the possibility for mp and nanoplastic particles to participate in the formation of reactive oxygen species ros 67 it was shown that mp and nanoplastic fragments can decrease the productivity of the primary producers like cyanobacteria and reduce the growth of green algae and overall chlorophyll a chl a concentrations leading to a reduction of photosynthesis by microalgae 68 a possible explanation can be the following i absorption of nanoplastic by algae could lead to the shading and reduce co2 concentration which promotes the production of ros 69 and ii effect of nanoplastics on chl a levels 68 these phenomena lead to disorders in the sedimentary systems and affect biodiversity 70 today researchers have no unequivocal opinion regarding cytotoxicity of plastics it was noted that ps particles of 0 1 0 5 μm size are low toxic for cell viability oxidative stress membrane integrity but have a pronounced size effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential 71 they inhibited the activity of the atp binding cassette transporter of the plasma membrane the work of hwang et al 72 emphasizes the low toxicity of particles in the 10 100 μm size range while the 460 nm and 1 μm particles had a negative effect unfortunately available data on the possible toxic effect of mp and nanoplastic particles are scattered 73 prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight reduces the stability of polymers inducing changes in their chemical composition and leading to fragmentation of mps 74 the latter increases the surface available for the adsorption of contaminants from surrounding seawater 75 76 and release of hazardous substances from plastic to water 77 for instance mps may release bisphenol a which is a common component of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resin the concentration of bisphenol in food water oils etc varies from 0 05 to 1 6 mg l the contribution from mp to the concentration of bisphenol remains unclear while mps are known to transfer pollutants into living organisms 78 polychlorinated biphenyls can be considered as a pollutant 79 because they are widespread continuously enter the environment posing a threat to wildlife and were detected on the surface of mps from all over the world 80 heavy metal ions can be contaminants too the mps ability to adsorb heavy metal ions has been extensively studied 81 84 the equilibrium concentrations of cu2 and zn2 adsorbed on the surface of ps particles were reportedly reached 1262 6 and 68 3 μg g respectively while on the aged pvc they were adsorbed even in higher quantities 82 the concentration of cr6 adsorbed on granules sampled from a beach coast was 0 441 μg g 83 the increased reactivity of the surface of aged granules is explained both by changes in the polymer itself and by the presence of biofilms and chemical precipitates 85 ragusa et al 86 reported that inspection of human placenta samples from six pregnant patients found in four of them 12 fragments of pp ranging from 5 to 10 μm such alarming findings call for a deep inquiry into the interaction of plastic particles with tissues and cells in the human body facemasks and gloves used to prevent the spread of the covid 19 have posed a new environmental threat because of their mono use character and huge quantities disposed of worldwide daily medical face masks can be manufactured from different nanofiber and or microfiber polymeric materials pe pp ps pu polyacrylonitrile polycarbonate or polyester 87 89 pandemic requirements for additional safety rules concerning shopping in supermarkets with fresh food packaged in plastic containers and single use food plastic bags were introduced to avoid food contamination extend shelf life and for the use to customers carrying groceries 90 as result personal protective equipment and additional plastic containers and bags have driven increased plastic pollution there is a need for urgent and coordinated actions including recycling practices and strict policies against plastic pollution 5 researchers agree that control in different geographic regions is necessary 91 the systems aiming at control or removal of mps from environments are developing recently experts tried to improve monitoring of marine plastic debris by applying satellite remote sensing based on passive and active optical methods light detection and ranging lidar systems are active sensors employed for the investigation of inherent optical properties of water oil pollutants colored dissolved organic matter phytoplankton and zooplankton etc in contrast to the passive methods they can supply data regardless of daytime and at low solar angles penetrating through the water column 92 3 extraction of microplastics from water water samples probes for analysis are usually collected in calm waters although shruti et al reported on studies of mps in stormwater 93 the optimal depth for sampling remains an open question 94 95 at the first step marine debris is collected using trawls nets such as manta or bongo trawls 96 97 epibenthic sled 98 or filtering pumps 99 from the different parts of the water column some pre processing can be done already on spot but the full probe analysis is conducted in a laboratory 100 the well known manta net was described as early as 1981 101 and it was named after the manta fish nowadays automatic express collection and analysis systems are developing for mps a significant advantage of such systems is the ability to analyze probes in situ within a very constrained timeline for example a sampling device albatross was designed to reduce the specimen collection time to three minutes or less thus allowing to cover more locations 102 the mantaray device uses a flow through pump and combines an autonomous sensor for estimation of mps concentration with a storage system for mps entrapped in either of its 28 filters 103 the plex plastic explorer is an instrument for bulk water sampling from various depths and in line filtering thanks to a self priming pump located on a vessel s deck 104 however work with mps requires compliance with strict rules for sampling and the laboratory workplace organization in order to avoid eventual contamination with plastic particles during sample processing it is advised do not wear synthetic clothes and treat plastic utensils in an ultrasonic cleaner before use the authors of another study 105 stress the importance of such precautions suggesting the lab personnel worn cotton cloth nitrile gloves and masks for all glassware soaking in 10 nitric acid is recommended cleaning continues with washing with ultrapure water and ethanol 70 and concludes with natural air drying the most widespread technique for the removal of mps was developed under the framework of the us marine debris program noaa marine debris program 106 the technique does not demand specialized equipment according to the noaa method the selected water samples pass sequentially through the stages of sieving digesting of organic matter with no harm to mps density separation and filtration 106 sieving sometimes also called filtration is the most common method for the separation of solid debris including mps from water probes the choice of sieves mesh size or filter pore determines the size of mps detected the smaller size the quicker obstruction by organic and mineral matter may occur 107 the filtered samples require further purification to eliminate both organic and inorganic contaminants to clean the surface of mps from organic materials and to liberate mps blocked in the filter s pores such purification has to be delicate and inexpensive hence even enzymatic purification of mps has been suggested 108 inorganic contaminants like silicate grains or clay particles can be removed from the probe by density separation that method does not help with the separation of organic matter due to the proximity of densities which are between 1 0 and 1 4 g cm 3 with plastics like pet and nylon 109 the complete removal of organic matter requires treatment with an oxidizing agent by wet chemistry techniques the use of strongly acidic or alkaline substances is better to be avoided because of its negative impact on sensitive synthetic polymers other approaches like centrifugation and microwave digestion can lead to deformation breaking down or even decomposition of mps 110 the wet peroxide oxidation wpo method is among the most successful ones for digesting organic matter it involves the treatment with a mixture of h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 sometimes called the fenton s reagent 111 in the noaa method 30 h2o2 is used and the sample solution is heated up to 75 с the ferrous ions catalyse the decomposition of h2o2 and the generation of radicals which act as strong oxidation agents according to the following equations 112 h 2 o 2 fe 2 oh oh fe 3 oh c x h y h 2 o co 2 q fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h ooh fe 3 ooh fe 2 o o h fe 3 o o fe 2 o 2 where cxhy represents an organic compound and q is the residue of a degraded organic compound apart from those processes some additional reactions may occur 113 oh h 2 o 2 ooh h 2 o 2 oh h 2 o 2 ooh oh h 2 o o 2 o o ooh ooh o 2 plastics withstand the oxidation by peroxide while the organic matter degrades at 75 c 106 wpo is a more widespread method of oxidative treatment because it can successfully digest different types of organic matter such as grease cellulose chitin shell moreover it can be suitable for organisms with chitin exoskeleton and high fat content organs 114 apart from fenton s reagent other oxidizing agents such as h2o2 alone naocl koh naoh sodium dodecyl sulfate can be efficiently used 115 118 more aggressive oxidizing agents can remove organic matters more rapidly and efficiently but there is a serious risk of mps degradation and deformation removal of the organic components such as leaves grass or shells from the surface of mps debris may include the enzymatic purification stage for this purpose mani et al 46 exposed samples to multiple incubation steps with different agents 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate at 70 c overnight 2 0 5 of either biozym f lipase and se protease amylase for 3 days at 37 c 3 30 h2o2 at 37 c for 24h 4 10 chitinase in phosphate buffer ph 5 6 for 5 days at 37 c and 5 10 cellulase for 24h at 50 c the steps were alternated by washing and sieving 2 the density separation approach is based on the buoyancy of plastic particles in solutions of a higher density while the soil mineral debris moves to the bottom 119 the specific density of common plastics lies in the range from 0 8 to 1 7 g cm3 it lowers to 0 05 g cm3 for expanded ps and rises to 2 1 2 3 g cm3 for polytetrafluoroethylene teflon 120 instead the density of sand and other solid contaminants reaches 2 65 g cm3 121 fresh or tap water seawater a concentrated sodium chloride solution sodium polytungstate spt lithium metatungstate zinc chloride sodium iodide are used for density separation table 1 there is no universally optimal solution to carry out density separation for example a saturated nacl solution can be used for the separation of plastic with a density lower than 1 2 g cm3 it is unsuitable for common polymers like pvc and pet with densities of 1 14 1 56 and 1 32 1 41 g cm3 respectively 123 nai or spt are too expensive to treat large volumes floating plastic foams can be collected with fresh water 129 the nabr solutions are less toxic and weakly acidic 130 density separation leads to a significant reduction of the probe s volume the procedure can be improved by employing dedicated equipment like munich plastic sediment separator which is designed to perform separation of large volumes 131 4 identification of microplastics the detection and identification of mps pose experimental challenges and usually require a combined use of microscopy optical and electron and spectroscopy vibrational and mass accordingly identification of mps proceeds in two steps description of physical appearance under an optical microscope and determining the chemical composition from measured spectra either consulting databases or references the reference mps in desired size range can be prepared by cryogenic milling 132 the addition of sand as the second abrasive phase might cause contamination of mps with metal coming from the stainless steel jar and milling balls due to abrasion instead an oxidative treatment with ozone improves dispersion most common characterization techniques for analysis of mps are presented in table 2 one of the primary methods of analysis is visual observation utilizing optical microscopy it allows distinguishing the shape and size of particles as well as counting their number in this regard mps are divided into two size groups the large ones ranging down from 5 to 1 mm and the small ones from 1 mm to 20 μm the former mps are visually recognizable while for the latter a reliable quantitative assessment is still a challenge 133 a considerable disadvantage of optical analysis is the high degrees of measurement error visual observation alone does not allow for reliable identification of polymers therefore the physical characterization by microscopy of likely plastic particles at the first step is then confirmed by identification of their chemical composition by vibrational spectroscopy 134 in general particles smaller than 1 mm are hardly distinguishable by optical microscopy in order to identify particles larger than 1 mm as mp the following criteria were proposed 1 no cellular or organic structures are visible in mp particle fiber 2 uniform thickness for a fiber and a three dimensional bending completely straight fibers indicate a biological origin 3 transparency and uniform coloration blue red black and yellow for fragments and 4 transparent or whitish fragments should be carefully examined by the high resolution microscopy to exclude organic origin 135 fluorescence microscopy is also used for mps analysis a variety of compounds can act as highly fluorescent dyes 133 nile red can bind to mps surface and fluoresces in a range of colors from yellow to dark red depending on the degree of hydrophobicity of the plastic surface 136 it is noted that for nile red it would be preferable to choose green fluorescence excitation emission at 460 525 nm instead of red 565 630 nm for the following reasons 1 synthetic polymers fluoresce better in green 2 natural pollutants fluoresce in red but not green after pre treatment in hydrogen peroxide and 3 the background signal from the green filter membrane was lower 133 however the emitted colour of nile red can be affected by changes in the hydrophobicity of plastics due to surface contamination therefore in order to clearly distinguish between different types of plastics it is necessary to include dyes that produce non overlapping colors karakolis et al 136 tested a significant number of idye poly dyes and rit dyemore synthetic dyes in three modes green red and far red detecting that the pink dye fluoresces in the red area blue in the far red rit dyemore kentucky sky in the green and red a significant advantage of these dyes over nile red is a much lower cost scanning electron microscopy sem captures images of a sample with a high spatial resolution by scanning the sample s surface with an electron beam in raster mode potential mps can be differentiated from other organic or inorganic impurities by studying images of their morphology sem can also be used to analyze the erosion process of mps extracted from the natural environment by studying the features of surface textures such as cracks and pits the combined use of sem and energy dispersive analysis eds can provide detailed information about the elemental composition of mps and the inorganic additives they contain 137 the ftir spectroscopy allows distinguishing a greater number of plastic fragments than visual inspection using an optical microscope it helps to detect transparent or white fragments e g pe and pp which are poorly visible song et al 138 demonstrated that the number of fragments determined as plastic by ftir spectroscopy was 8 times higher than that by optical microscopy a significant amount of colored fragments was also observed in the surface layer of water according to ftir spectroscopy data they were attributed to synthetic resin paints and a thermoactive matrix in fiber reinforced plastics optical microscopy allows for the faster and easier analysis of probes it can easily detect mps except for fragments smaller than 50 μm raman spectroscopy provides a spectral fingerprint of mps which is needed to identify the chemical composition 139 since ftir and raman are complimentary techniques their combined use is beneficial for better identification of mps 140 equipped with a microscope the spectrometer may measure individual mp particles 10 μm for ftir 1 μm for raman 141 one may perform a spectral mapping of mps distributed on a support 142 unlike ftir the raman instrument probes a sample with the laser beam whose power must be tuned avoiding damaging the sample the permanent monitoring of the mps contamination in different locations requires a huge number of probes and their automated analysis 143 identification of mps by spectroscopic methods relies on the match between the measured spectra and that from a database sometimes spectra coincide partially because of degradation of a plastic fragment the presence of contaminations and physical scattering effects 144 a similar problem appears when mps were extracted from biological materials their pre treatment usually includes digesting of organic matter by aggressive compounds like mineral acids h2so4 hno3 hcl or strong bases e g naoh koh that can cause damage to polymers 145 the development of algorithms for automatic spectrum processing focuses on the identification of mps with higher precision without a significant increase in calculation time in contrast to vibrational spectroscopies thermoanalytical methods are destructive techniques where a sample is thermally decomposed under defined conditions thermogravimetric analysis tga measures the loss in mass of a sample when it is heated at a programmed rate in a controlled atmosphere combining tga with other techniques such as ftir spectroscopy differential scanning calorimetry gas chromatography and mass spectrometry provides one with sophisticated tools for studies of the thermal properties and composition of materials plastics usually have low melting points which are individual for each type of polymer therefore the analysis of thermograms allows to individualize polymers in composition and reveal the nature of mps 105 another combined technique for the identification and quantification of mps is pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry pyro gc ms 146 here the formed pyrolysis products are then analyzed via gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry as it was demonstrated experimentally by primpke et al 147 pyro gc ms gives a comparable with ftir results there is also thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms which provides reliable data too 148 dynamic light scattering dls is used to obtain information about the size distribution of small particles in solution 149 small particles are those much smaller the wavelength of the irradiating light usually λ 800 nm particle size is determined from fluctuations in scattered light intensity due to the brownian movement of the particles in solution the method has been applied to polymer and colloid science since the 60s of the past century 150 151 dls can be performed in situ providing valuable information about the formation of nps during photo degradation gigault et al 152 studying the impact of uv irradiation on mps in ultrapure water concluded that i during photo degradation tiny nps are being produced and ii the process causes defects in parent mps accelerating degradation and making them randomly shaped in another study a decrement in the hydrodynamic radius of polyester polyurethane particles in highly diluted suspensions at ambient temperature was taken as evidence of degradation caused by anchored peptides 153 nanoparticle tracking analysis nta combines laser light scattering microscopy with a charge coupled device ccd camera which enables the visualization and recording of nanoparticles in solution nta complements dls and is particularly valuable for analyzing polydisperse nanosized particles 154 lambert and wagner 155 applied nta to follow the formation of nanoplastics during the degradation of ps disposable coffee cup lid samples were immersed in demineralized water and exposed to uv vis light at 30 c in a weathering chamber the difference in quantity of nanoparticles was noted already after 14 days of experiment after 56 days number of ps nanoparticles exceeded that in a reference vial in 3 times the surface of mps can be covered by natural organic matter nom nom can be present as polysaccharides proteins sugars aminosugars aliphatic acids hydrocarbons tannins etc 156 nom functionalized mps are less inclined to the aggregation due to the electrosteric stabilization and steric hindrance 157 if the scope of a study is assessing the effect from nom one may measure zeta potential zeta potential measurements are routinely used for evaluation of the stability of colloidal solutions the effects of ph ionic strength colloid concentration and the presence of dissolved matters 158 the method allows determining the effective charge at the surface of mps and its evolution depending on the quantity of nom the amount of adsorbed nom exposure media properties and ability to form aggregates 159 remote sensing and monitoring are of paramount importance for studies of marine plastic pollution the passive receivers measure the reflected sunlight in spectral intervals from visible to near infrared nir and short wave infrared active systems are lidar or radar 92 lidar uses lasers nd yag to generate a flux of photons which eventually scattered back to the receiver 160 providing so called point cloud datasets 161 air molecules cloud droplets or aerosol particles in the atmosphere as well as water molecules and suspended particles at the surface layer of the oceans can be the origin of the backscattered signal 160 lidar detection can be done regardless of the time of day or night at low solar angles through aerosol loads and thin clouds 162 lidar technology has revolutionized different areas it allows archaeologists to study the large areas of terrain in details and hard to reach locations with 3d visualization of the landscape 163 evaluate the level of dissolved organic matter of anthropogenic and natural origin oil pollutions phytoplankton 164 165 in marine waters observe metallic neutral and ion layers in the atmosphere and study the chemistry and physics of the mesosphere lower thermosphere 166 portable equipment for mps detection in the field becomes more required asamoah et al 167 designed a prototype of a portable optical sensor based on the simultaneous recording of the specular light reflection and the forward interference pattern from the light microplastic interactions in water it is needed for the detection of transparent and translucent mps in water zhang et al 168 proposed a custom made portable pyrolyzing mass spectrometer for the fast identification and weight related quantification of mps such portable equipment can be used at the ship based marine surveys and allow avoiding time delay between sampling onboard and laboratory analysis bianco et al 169 proposed a holographic identification method for plastic which combines digital holography with artificial intelligence the machine learning procedure uses an optimal set of holographic features to improve the mps recognition up to over 99 accuracy the machine learning approach in analysis of μftir hyperspectral imaging has also demonstrated a high efficiency in identifying a mixed plastic sample regardless deteriorated spectral quality at the edges of a mp fragment 170 5 stimulated degradation of microplastics the development of efficient techniques for stimulated degradation of mps is the present day challenge it is extremely difficult to remove mp or nanoplastic fragments from the marine environment suggesting that in general the most effective mitigation strategies must prevent or reduce admission of mps into the system or develop methods for the natural degradation 171 additionally substituting plastics with alternative materials and delivery systems scaling up the chemical conversion capacity reducing plastic waste implementing better recycling avoiding leakage into the environment can decrease pollution with mps 172 in the natural environment under the action of such factors as moisture salinity light microbial effect dissolved gases heat or significant temperature fluctuations mps could break up into smaller particles and degrade by reducing the average molecular weight the resistance against external factors and the extent of degradation depends on the polymer type as well as on the intensity and duration of the impact 5 1 natural and artificial degradation the environmental degradation of mps can occur via the physical mechanism involving changes in the bulk and the chemical one inducing changes at the molecular level 4 the former proceeds via fragmentation and results in generation of nanoparticles the state of the art methods for the extraction separation identification and quantification of nanoplastic in the environment have been recently reviewed by li et al 173 the degradation pathways and products depend on the polymer type ultimately leading to low molecular weight polymer fragments 27 some types of mps can degrade completely at ambient conditions however it will need a long time hundreds of years predictive accelerated weathering testing is possible but existing standards often fall short 174 that is why it is important to find out how to accelerate the degradation rate the artificial or stimulated degradation is distinguished from the natural one by a range of characteristics the natural degradation includes i biodegradation ii photodegradation under uv vis light illumination iii thermo oxidative degradation and iv hydrolysis the first one proceeds under the action of living organisms 175 176 there are several types including enzymatic biodegradation 177 degradation due to interaction with earthworms 178 179 or microalgae 180 biofilm driven degradation 181 182 the thermo oxidative degradation is a long term process actuated by a synergetic action of oxidizing agents and moderate temperatures the degradation via hydrolysis occurs from the reaction with water 176 electrochemical degradation 183 photocatalysis 184 interaction with distracting agents for example carbon based materials 185 can be attributed to artificial degradation in response to external action mps can be resistive to degradation stable or easily degradable the most frequently used types of plastic like pe belong to the first category the second category includes poly lactic acid pla poly butylene succinate pbs polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat ecoflex and polyhydroxyalkonates phas 186 in the case of biodegradation a complex community of microorganisms and macrofoulants forming biofilms and altering the surface properties of mps is involved 187 at the first rapid step the organic molecules become attached to surface forming a thin layer at the next longer stage it is colonized by bacteria producing extra cellular polymeric substances then by micro algae and algal spores 188 the total biodegradation of a plastic fragment means a complete conversion of carbonaceous constituents into co2 water and biomass 176 according to the european committee for standardization the european standard en 17033 from 2018 plastic is ranked biodegradable when over 90 of the material will be transformed into co2 within 2 years at 20 28 c 189 under aerobic conditions biodegradation of polymers proceeds with the conversion of polymeric carbons c polymer into carbon dioxide c co2 microbial biomass c biomass and the carbon fraction that remains in the residual polymers and monomers c residual polymer 190 191 c polymer o 2 c c o 2 c biomass c residual polymer pe degrades slowly in the environment because of cc single bonds which are hard to break in photo oxidative degradation however pe may contain a small number of unsaturated cc bonds which are vulnerable to the action of such oxidizing agents as o3 and nox pe is a non absorbing polymer making it stable to the photochemical reactions chromophoric defects can favor the light absorption leading to the formation of radicals for example 4 192 c h 2 c h 2 c h 2 c h 2 c h 2 ch h ch ch h 2 the reactions as the intermolecular hydrogen abstraction crosslinking or addition to oxygen followed by disproportionation of the resulting alkyl radicals can be observed too 193 the first intermediate substance hydroperoxides decomposes with the appearance of macro alkoxy and hydroxyl radical oh with subsequent formation of the ketones ketones in turn can photochemically react by norrish type i resulting in the formation of carboxylic acids esters and lactones alternatively the reaction may proceed by norrish type ii ending with vinyl type unsaturations and acetone scheme 1a thermal degradation of pe does not follow either norrish mechanisms pe gets destroyed at 100 c with the formation of ketones as oxidative products without vinyl groups as by products 193 scheme 1b in the environment lacking both sunlight and oxygen anaerobic thermal degradation of pe cannot occur easily because it needs high temperatures 350 c 4 pet can slowly decompose in water because of thermal oxidative degradation and hydrolysis with the formation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol 4 the degradation rate increases with crystalline domains in pet are getting inferior to the amorphous phase 194 poly lactic acid pla refers to the biodegradable polymers which can be destroyed primarily by temperature catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester bonds 195 followed by the bacterial effect on the fragmented residues 196 however often researchers mark that pla biodegradation begins at high temperatures typically at about 55 58 c 196 197 pva degradation usually includes cleavage of the main polymer chain with subsequent aldolase and hydrolase reactions the final products acetic acid and hydroxyl fatty acids can be involved in the tca cycle scheme 2 198 and β oxidation 199 pva biodegradation by single bacterial strains fungi and yeasts under different environmental conditions was studied in detail 200 pvc biodegradation includes three major steps i depolymerization or breaking down polymer chains ii formation of oxidized intermediate products and iii total mineralization to co2 h2o and cl 201 secondary urethane rich mps could be formed during polyurethanes destruction through hydrolysis of the ester component followed by erosion and aggregation of oligomers 181 different insect larvae are able to ingest mps particles in particular ps and accelerate their degradation mealworms and superworms can ingest ps and destroy it wherein that ps biodegradation is gut microbiota dependence 202 in the case of mealworms ps degradation is possible by bacterial exiguobacterium sp strain yt2 however isolated bacterial strain yt2 outside demonstrated much poorer ps degradation efficiency comparing with the gut system 203 some worms can soften thin film pe and metabolize them to ethylene glycol 204 earthworms like e fetida e andrei or lumbricus rubellus can convert organic matter into vermicompost besides gut associated processes vermicomposting can takes place in the earthworm cast associated processes whereby earthworm casts participate in the further decomposition of more recalcitrant organic wastes gut associated processes biodegradation predominantly occurs during the gastrointestinal transit in earthworms whereas cast associated processes prolong the biodegradation of the recalcitrant molecules of feedstock combined with the earthworm gastrointestinal secretions of organic molecules outside the earthworms 179 song et al 205 demonstrated that that land snails achatina fulica can accelerate biodegradation of ps hydrolysis degradation of the polymers can flow either via a bulk or surface erosion mechanism if the rate of hydrolysis exceeds the rate of diffusion of water into the bulk the surface erosion dominates if the rate of diffusion of water exceeds the rate of the hydrolysis reaction bulk erosion takes place the mechanism of the polymer hydrolysis can be changed from surface to bulk when the particle thickness decreases below a critical value 186 electro fenton like ef like technology with the assistance of efficient heterogeneous catalysts tio2 c cathode can be utilized for the step by step pvc degradation o2 is reduced to h2o2ad h2o2ad directly transforms into the hydroxyl radical oh without desorption the rupture of pvc chain occurs with further exposure of chloride 183 miao et al deduce the orr mechanism at the tio2 c cathode 206 ti iv e ti iii 2 ti iii o 2 2 h 2 ti iv oh 2 ti iv oh e 2 ti iv o h oh up to 10 short chain organics like alkenes alcohols monocarboxylic acids dicarboxylic acids and esters can be formed as intermediate products during the pvc mps degradation 183 kiendrebeogo et al 207 proposed an electrooxidation method based on in situ generation of oxidizing radicals like hydroxyls oh whose standard reduction potential e0 oh h2o 2 80 v she allows to break the polymeric chain the proposed mechanism starts with breaking the carbon hydrogen bonds and the formation of carbon oxygen bonds proceeds via breaking the cc or cph bonds and their oxidation and concludes with the release of water and carbon dioxide molecules the electrolytes influence on the reaction pathway was emphasized by using nano3 as a supporting electrolyte for mps decomposition in direct anodic oxidation with oh radicals in the case of na2so4 and nacl the decomposition of mps could be carried out by both direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation via reactive mediators hypochlorous ions and persulfate ions which are formed according to the following reactions 207 208 2 cl cl 2 2 e cl 2 h 2 o hclo cl h hclo clo h cl oh clo h e clo oh clo 2 h e clo 2 oh clo 3 h e clo 3 oh clo 4 h e 2 hso 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 e so 4 2 oh so 4 oh so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 the concentration of oh radicals depends on the nature of anode material high oxygen evaluation overpotential electrodes like boron doped diamond allow forming high quantity of weakly adsorbed radicals whereas dimensionally stable anodes favor the formation of less reactive and covalently bonded chemisorbed oxygen 208 full oxidation of organic particles can be described as m oh r m m co 2 n h 2 o h e where m is an active site at the anode surface r is the fraction of an organic compound 209 heterogeneous photocatalysis is an efficient oxidation process for the removal of pollutants which could be accomplished at ambient conditions herewith photocatalyst usually tio2 is inexpensively procurable non toxic and stable 184 210 211 when the semiconductor is bombarded with photons with e eg bandgap electrons e from the valance band are transferred into the conduction band leaving behind positive holes h 212 semiconductor hν h e electrons in the conduction band can reduce o2 forming superoxide radicals o2 which react with holes in the valence band producing singlet oxygen 1o2 212 213 e o 2 o 2 free electrons holes and reactive oxidizing species react with the surface adsorbed impurities mineralizing organic pollutants into h2o and co2 pollutant ros co 2 h 2 o one of the ways to mps degradation can be implemented by using heteroatom based carbon nanotubes cnts kang et al 185 are shown that mn ncnts under the hydrothermal conditions can increase mps degradation up to 50 wt of mps removed via hydrolysis moreover the intermediates from mps degradation are not hazardous to microorganisms and may serve as the nutrient for algae magnetic spring like cnts were prepared via pyrolysis of melamine with mncl2 and subsequent acid treatment to remove the superficial mn containing species and tip mn particles from the surface of cnts 185 melamine is the source of c and n atoms mncl2 is the source of mn pyrolysis of their mixture may form mn nps or carbide phases depending on the temperature of synthesis preparation of the m n doped cnts via tip growth mechanism is a convenient technique allowing preparing cnts bamboo like cnts or a mixture of bamboo like cnts with amorphous carbons without use of extra high temperatures for example using metal organic frameworks zif 8 zif 67 zif 68 zif 69 or hybrids the one as sacrificial carbon sources can help to control the composition and morphology of the heteroatoms doped carbon and as results the nature of active centers 214 217 either for the preparation of carbons biomasses can be used 218 multicity of frameworks and biomass types can vary properties of resulting carbons in a wide range 5 2 microplastics removal from water metal organic frameworks mofs constitute a new generation of two or three dimensional crystalline porous materials assembled through the coordination reactions between polydentate organic ligands and metal cations salts or clusters 219 220 mofs have attracted great attention due to their tunable porosity pore functionality various pore compositions and open metal sites 221 making them ideal media for several applications such as catalysis separations storage biomedical applications etc 222 chen et al 223 tested zr mof based foam materials for various types and concentrations of mps suspension the authors suggested that the ideal materials for the mps removal are expected to possess quite definite properties i well developed pore structure and porosity to provide high permeability of solvent during multistep filtration ii proper force to ensure mps isolation of and recycling iii high durability and iv easy of processing 223 for application in the filtration systems a mof powder has to be attached to a flexible robust and stable substrate composites containing zr mof and melamine foam mf satisfy these requests uio 66 zr6o4 oh 4 co2 12 is the zirconium and terephthalic acid based mof consisting of an inner zr6o4 oh 4 core in which the triangular faces of the zr6 octahedron are alternatively capped by μ3 o and μ3 oh groups which was prepared by lillerud et al 224 225 among different composites uio 66 x mf n where x h nh2 oh br and no2 n 1 4 n stands for the mass loading of mofs ranging from 4 4 to 25 8 wt uio 66 oh mf 3 shown high removal efficiency reaching 95 5 1 2 and high water stability the mechanism of removal can be considered from several prospectives i due to the strong electrostatic interaction with mps ii possible interactions like hydrogen bonds or van der waals interaction with mps and iii the pore structure of the foam substrate is favorable for the rapid flow of the solvent as well as facilitates contact between mps and mof particles 223 the limiting factor for the mps removal by filtration through mofs based membranes can be connected with possible fouling 226 however often membranes are recyclable 227 that may reduce the importance of fouling mof based composites can be stable and easily regenerated after the adsorption process 228 perren et al 49 applied another electrochemical technique electrocoagulation for the removal of the pe microbeads in different concentrations during this two step process metal electrodes were used to produce coagulant formed by reaction of the metal ions usually fe2 or al3 with oh ions electrically as result coagulants affect the surface charge of the solids phase in colloidal solution threatening their stability these processes lead to the coagulations by van der waals forces forming the seeds which can float up to the water surface due to the interaction with hydrogen formed in the electrolysis it was shown that such a method for microbead removal is highly efficient with pollutant removal rate of 99 and a low cost one 49 it should be noted that in aquatic environments mps can undergo homoaggregation as two or more plastic particles or heteroaggregation when different types of particles like natural minerals and seaweeds are gathered such phenomena have a significant influence on the mps distribution in natural waters the heteroaggregation of mps is more common because the surface of mp particle may bear hydrophobic functional groups that promote adsorption of dissolved organic matter and organisms 229 moreover different sediments and minerals may anchor on the surface of mps for example the electrostatic interaction can promote the coating of the positively charged ps with negatively charged alginate or fe2o3 resulting in the tightening of aggregates 230 the likelihood of attachment between colliding particles is controlled by both van der waals and electrical double layer forces described in the framework of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory and non dlvo interactions 231 232 magnetic seeded filtration msf or magnetic extraction are other approaches for the separation of mps 233 234 it is a perfect alternative to classical filtration because it can be used for a large volume of water with minimal steps 235 at the first stage of msf processes magnetic seed particles are dispersed into the suspension and interact with the mps particles forming agglomerates that can be removed using a magnet 233 this technique cannot be considered new because it has been used in the recycling industry for many years it applies to the removal of magnetic solid particles as well as to nonmagnetic water pollutants such as viruses algae various other suspended solids or dissolved pollutants 236 the first detailed investigation in the field of magnetic separation in water pollution control was made by christopher de latour in 1973 236 237 he described water treatment with 1000 ppm of the magnetite seeding material aiming to remove coliform bacteria and orthophosphate ions when we speak about magnetic seeded materials magnetite particles are primarily meant magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 have the spinel type crystal structure and the correlation between their diffraction profiles is more than 99 that form the necessity for additional inquiry by x ray absorption spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mössbauer spectroscopy 238 239 or in depth studies conventional x ray diffraction method to ensure the phase identification 240 241 one of the benefits of iron oxides based particles is the ease of control particles shape size and surface composition due to the choice of synthetic procedure including the following solvothermal 239 microwave assisted 242 243 co precipitation 244 modified co precipitation 245 thermal salts decomposition 246 electrochemical 247 sonochemical 248 or their combination 249 etc one of the prospective low cost and scalable industry methods for the iron oxides preparation is polyol synthesis 250 251 the magnetic properties of the iron oxide particles are tunable too for example the substitution of fe3 in magnetite with rare earth ions like sm3 gd3 or eu3 could improve their magnetic behavior 239 246 252 maghemite is also prospective material for magnetic separation and may be even favored because it can be prepared by a simple procedure of co precipitation without protective inert atmosphere hence reducing the final product cost control of synthesis parameters such as type of solution ph temperature etc can allow preparing maghemite particles with satisfying magnetic properties and surface charge misra et al 235 used polyoxometalate ionic liquid adsorbed onto spherical fe2o3 sio2 core shell nps it was concluded that this composite is an effective agent removing organic inorganic microbial and microplastic pollutants recovery of mps was tested on the commercial colloidal solutions of spherical ps beads even an increase of the colloidal solution volume did not prevent a high extent of microbeads recovery more than 90 based on quantitative dynamic light scattering analysis coated hydrophobic fe nps can be also used for the magnetic separation of mps grbic et al 234 noted that the less extent of medium size mps recovery is due to the relatively lower surface area to volume ratio in some cases recovery of mps was exceeding 100 which was attributed to the fragmentation of brittle mps besides pure iron oxides composites containing both iron oxides and carbons could be used for the mps separation it was shown that the agglomerates of mps m cnts prepared via co precipitation synthesis of iron oxide presumably fe3o4 in the presence of cnts were removed under magnetic forces within 300 min herewith the mechanism of the mps adsorption will differ depending on the mps nature π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the composite and pa amide groups non hydrophobic interactions hydrophobic interaction and π π electron conjugation between the composite and pet and pe after mps separation composite could be recycled by thermal treatment at 600 c and used for further application with high efficiency 253 carbon based materials can be used for filtration in combination with oxidation for example in 254 ozonation integrated with granular activated carbon filtration looks promising because ozone can destroy small mps and large particles can remove due to the physical adsorption however it is unclear what mechanism is mainly responsible for the mps removal wang et al 255 demonstrated that biochar exhibits high removal efficiency towards the polystyrene microsphere three possible mechanisms can be highlighted stuck trapped and entangled i mps can be fixed in the gaps between the filter particles which are smaller than the particle size ii mps can be trapped in the pore system due to the specific for the concrete type of carbon porosity connecting with moving mps particles inside the larger pores and future loss of the mobility in the case of slow water flow in the pores smaller than 30 μm and iii biochar can produce small flaky shaped particles which can possess colloidal particle properties and entangle mps particles increasing their size and as result decreasing mobility the effect of the photocatalytic tio2 based micromotor on mps is tremendously promising it was shown that au mag tio2 mag ni fe micromotors can move efficiently in both water and peroxide under uv illumination 256 the authors proposed two mechanisms of the mps removal using au ni tio2 micromotors in water or hydrogen peroxide containing solutions as individual micromotor au mag tio2 can remove mps due to the phoretic interaction when au ni tio2 micromotors are assembled in chain form through the interaction between magnetic ni layers under an external magnetic field they can remove mps because of shoveling or pushing interactions despite core shell micromotors the janus type particles can be considered as prospective agents for mps extraction rius ayra et al 257 underlined two main innovative trends in mps removal based on changes in wettability i modification of the mps surface to confer hydrophilicity and increase their permeability to water using particles like compounds like fe3o4 oh or coo and ii use of superhydrophobic materials for example superhydrophobic iron powder in two immiscible phases system water oil both approaches promote selectivity of mps removal and can be occasionally used thereby mofs iron oxides and their composites coated iron particles and micromotors are convenient substitutives for the traditional methods of the mps filtration and treatment one of the benefits of such agents is the ability to tune their properties pore size and structure porosity nanoparticle size and surface charge etc which are optimal for a specific system furthermore it allows recovery of the bacteria ultra small particles and pollutants in the soluble form like heavy metals ions whereas traditional filtration based technique is applicable for solid particles not less than the filter mesh size ideally magnetic separation could be used directly in the environment without sampling however some open questions remain i is it possible to calculate the optimal concentration of such particles needed for the full recovery of pollutants ii how the stability of mofs or nps will be changed during multiple repeating of the recovery procedure depending on the real water system salinity ph viscosity etc iii is it possible to block active sites at the surface of the mofs or nps due to the adsorption of the pollutants iv what are the criteria for choosing the mechanism of effect for example phoretic or shoveling in the case of micromotors v what is the atisfactory quality of the mofs or nps vi what is the mechanism for recovery of degraded agents distraction oxidizing changes in the structure due kirkendall effect etc and vii how to evaluate the error in calculating the degree of mps recovery in the case when mofs or nps breaking the mps particles during the interaction 6 prospects of recycling landfilling of plastic solid waste psw is one of the traditionally practiced methods of management of municipal solid waste 258 progressive accumulation of psw in landfills imposes a risk of wider environmental pollution such as groundwater contamination the release of landfill gases like methane in this regard thermochemical post treatment processes such as pyrolysis have been promoted as a better alternative than combustion and gasification because of smaller emissions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide 259 such processes lead to the production of hydrocarbon oil of high calorific value i e bio oil in the case of pyrolysis this benefit has made the method classified as the most appropriate according to life cycle assessment in sustainable management 260 a circular economy concept which is becoming more and more popular nowadays seeks to promote a sustainable way of living where resources are retained in the economy for as long as possible accordingly to the concept the psw is formed since plastics escape the loops that feed resources back into the production system because of being mismanaged at the consumption and management stage 261 hence recycling is considered the only way to reduce the psw 262 recycling plastic bottles and containers has long existed in the industry 263 the pre requisition for the successful functioning of recycling schemes is the separation of the principal polymers with a high degree of precision which is usually counting on a responsible consumer apart from plastics from commodities construction material may contain a significant portion of plastic for recycling 264 the recycled plastic may again return into construction material like concrete 265 and bitumen 266 despite obvious importance recycling polymers still is a major challenge because of technological and economic issues that restrain the progress in this field 267 there are four routes of psw treatment constituting primary re extrusion secondary mechanical tertiary chemical and quaternary energy recovery schemes and technologies 268 the re introduction of clean scrap of polymer to the extrusion cycle is normally applied in the processing line itself although the properties of most plastics are significantly compromised after a number of processing cycles fortunately there are technologies available for sorting and recycling plastic solid waste into feedstocks 269 mechanical recycling commonly includes collection sorting washing and grinding of the material main packaging plastics as pet pe pp ps and pvc is often economically feasible to recycle by the secondary schemes due to high turnover rates 270 another example in favor of circular economy is a concept of distributed recycling via additive manufacturing promoting the use of recycled materials by means of the mechanical recycling process in the 3d printing process chain 271 the tertiary approach to processing psw is chemical recycling 272 it gathers techniques such as chemolysis pyrolysis fluid catalytic cracking hydrogen techniques and gasification 273 effective separation of mixed psw is necessary to produce the highest quality recycled plastic products by the secondary or tertiary process among separation technologies such as automatic sorting gravity separation and electrostatic separation froth flotation is a major and efficient separation method 274 furthermore the properties of recycled psw can be improved by adding different reinforcements like sand fibers metal powder etc 275 future studies to develop hybrid chemical physical and biological processes for recovering and upcycling mps into add value products are expected 276 apart from better waste management development of landfill psw processing techniques we suppose that advancements in space exploration where limited resources stimulate their reuse will sharpen existing practices of recycling and promote them to the next level it is known that 3d printing from recycled plastic waste is a well known way to give a second life 277 the first steps in this direction have been already taken at the end of 2019 nasa sent to the international space station iss the plastics recycler developed by made in space inc combination with an integrated 3d printer allows printing different items like wrenches antennas holders adapters connectors and spare parts it is quite conceivable that the abundance of plastic things in a confined space requires to filtrate air and clean filters from collected mps recycling those mps might be reasonable during the long range exploration missions to mars 7 conclusions environmental pollution with plastic fragments has a global character and the situation is continuously worsening the amount of plastic waste entering the environment will not diminish significantly in years to come because of the growing population it means that rate of mps accumulation in nature including such valuable resource as drinking water will remain considerably exceeding that of its natural degradation under the action of environmental factors as heat and illumination furthermore the external impact including global warming will favor fragmentation of mps down to nps the latter would be much more difficult to detect and remove the surface of mps may accumulate metal ions and microorganisms posing a toxic danger for living organisms commercial systems for automatic express collection and analysis of mps are making their way to the market since confident identification of mps in probes is already unthinkable without the employment of vibrational spectroscopy remote sensing systems for preliminary screening of mps in the environment are foreseen to show up soon as for now some sophisticated laboratory devices combining optical microscopy with ftir or raman as well as ftir tga couples are promoted by leading producers of scientific instruments as specifically designed for analysis of mps these facts suggest that monitoring and identification of mps will soon become a routine procedure although common standards on probes pre treatment are still a matter of debate advances in the identification of mps and global pollution mapping highlighted the need for the removal strategy up to date the most practiced approach is filtering separating mps by different means sieves filters membranes etc which is naturally applicable in water treatment plants and potable water installations although some improvements as pre treatment stages with photocatalytic and biological degradation can be introduced too the most challenging question of what to do with fragments of plastic in the environment remains open as has been shown in the review the ongoing research examines the applicability of different methods of stimulated degradation of mps which otherwise naturally will last unacceptably long declaration of competing interest the

13347,the adsorption of the veterinary medicinal products vmp tetracycline tet ciprofloxacin cip sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethoxazole smx onto a dried scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium was studied at several equilibrium concentrations 20 to 1000 μg l scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis were performed to investigate the surface morphology of the microalgae and to identify the effect of the antibiotics functional groups on the surface of the consortium of s almeriensis and bacteria ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms was used to determine the feasibility of this consortium for the removal of antibiotics via biosorption freundlich and langmuir adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the adsorption equilibrium pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to fit the biosorption experimental data relative antibiotic removal was higher at low equilibrium concentrations in the range of the initial vmp concentration studied ciprofloxacin and tetracycline exhibited the highest removal efficiency of 43 100 and 75 82 respectively likewise ciprofloxacin and tetraciclyne presented the highest adsorption rates of 0 11 26 66 and 1 78 27 09 mg μg 1 h 1 respectively this study revealed that the s almeriensis bacteria consortium has a high biosorption power and proved that biosorption is an important mechanism in the removal of ciprofloxacin and tetraciclyne using a microalgae based water treatment process however sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole removals did not exceed 32 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tetracycline ciprofloxacin sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole adsorption isotherms kinetic of adsorption 1 introduction demand for veterinary antibiotics has increased significantly in the last decades the global total consumption in 2017 was estimated to be 93 309 tons and it is expected to increase by 11 5 by 2030 1 fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and tetracycline were the most abundant vmp found in water in the united states in 2017 2 and were the most sold vmp in european countries in 2018 3 moreover the most frequently found vmp in manure worldwide were fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and tetracyclines 4 a determination which was reinforced by a critical review of cheng et al 5 who stated that these antibiotic families were the most common vmp used in swine production about 70 to 90 of antibiotics administered are excreted via urine or feces either in unchanged forms or as metabolites via sludge storage or by using manure as fertilizer veterinary antibiotics are released into the environment which affects soil and water quality antibiotics have been detected in different water samples such as surface water groundwater and municipal wastewater 4 6 various techniques such as adsorption coagulation electrolysis membrane separation photocatalysis coagulation advanced oxidation and biological degradation have been used for antibiotic removal these methodologies have various limitations such as high energy consumption high materials costs and secondary pollution through the use of additional chemicals however among these adsorption is the most versatile and widely used due to its high efficiency high removal capacity simplicity of design and ease of operation 7 9 in this respect biosorption has emerged as an eco friendly effective and economically feasible process for the removal of antibiotics and is based on the properties of different kinds of live and inactive dead biomasses heat dried chemically treated to bind and concentrate pollutants from aqueous solutions 9 10 moreover regarding biological processes the fate of the antibiotics has been widely investigated and results demonstrated that biosorption plays a critical role in antibiotic removal routes 11 microalgae based wastewater treatment technologies have attracted researcher s attention as these technologies have proved their ability to remove almost all types of emerging contaminants to some extent microalgae have demonstrated a biosorption capacity for antibiotics such as 7 amino cephalosporanic acid 12 cephalexin 13 tilmicosin 14 and ceftazidime 15 among others specifically green algae have cellulosic on its cell wall which provide binding sites such as hydroxyl carboxyl amino and sulfhydryl which play an essential role in the biosorption process 7 16 17 residual algal biomass have been proposed for certain uses such as biofertilizers and animal feed however its use might be discouraged without first knowing the concentration of some adsorbed vmp compounds few studies have been published on antibiotic removal using microalgae at low concentrations similar to those found in real samples in addition limited adsorption data is available for antibiotics in order to broadly use microalgae in wastewater treatment applications it is compulsory to determine the mechanisms involved in antibiotics removal by biomass biosorption is expected to be one of the predominant removal mechanisms hence to determine the biosorption capacity of a microalgae bacteria consortium inactive dead biomass was used for the first time as far as we know to disengage biosorption from biodegradation bioassimilation additionally it is easy to store and use for longer periods of time it is not subject to toxicity limitations and it does not need nutrient supplies the aim of this study was to determine the biosorption power of a scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium for a mixture of four antibiotics at different concentrations tetracycline tet ciprofloxacin cip sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethoxazole smx these antibiotics were selected as representative compounds of three antibiotics families fluoroquinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides which have diverse physicochemical properties and are the vmp most frequently found in piggery wastewater samples 3 6 adsorption isotherms were obtained for the four antibiotics studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae culture lyophilized biomass mainly composed of a consortium of the microalgae

which easily adapts to stressful conditions 18 the biomass was recovered from a high rate algae pond hrap used for piggery wastewater treatment with an operating volume of 11 800 l and a land surface of 80 m2 the hrap operational conditions were solar radiation within 1500 1600 μe m2 and temperature between 30 and 35 c lyophilization was used as the inactivation method of the microalgae bacteria consortium in order not to damage the cell structure instead of using regular methods as the thermal or chemical inactivation sodium azide in this respect by using dead biomass it is possible to focus solely on the study of biosorption as mechanism of vmp removal from water by avoiding biodegradation as no biological activity will be observed 2 2 chemicals and reagents tetracycline tet ciprofloxacin cip sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethoxazole smx were selected as target analytes the standards for the drugs were of high purity grade n95 and purchased from sigma aldrich tres cantos madrid spain all of them were acquired as neutral non solvated molecules except for tetracycline hydrochloride individual stock solutions of 1 g l for all the standards were prepared on a weight basis in methanol meoh except for ciprofloxacin which was dissolved in h2o meoh 1 1 containing 0 2 v v hydrochloric acid hcl due to its low solubility in pure meoh mixture stock solutions were subsequently prepared from individual stocks and stored at 80 c in darkness to avoid uncontrolled degradation ultrapure water was generated in house by a milli q mq advantage ultrapure water purification system and filtered through a 0 22 μm millipak express membrane and an lc pak polishing unit by merck millipore billercia ma usa meoh of high analytical grade was acquired from sigma aldrich stockholm sweden and hcl 37 was supplied by sigma aldrich tres cantos madrid spain 2 3 experimental set up for physical processes tests were performed in 1 l amber glass beakers containing 1 l milli q water spiked with a mixture of the aforementioned 4 antibiotics to a final concentration of 1000 500 100 or 20 μg l per antibiotic after taking a first sample to determine the initial antibiotic concentration in each reactor the lyophilized microalgae bacteria consortium was added under continuous mixing to obtain a concentration of 1 g l the microalgae bacteria concentration was chosen as a means of comparison with common microalgae concentration in hraps used for wastewater treatment all reactors were mixed continuously at 200 rpm samples were taken at different time intervals until 4 days of operation to simulate the common residence time of biomass in a hrap ph was monitored during the whole operation process remaining constant around 8 6 0 2 samples were filtered immediately through 0 22 mm pore size nylon syringe filters fisherbrand and stored at 4 c before analysis of the aqueous phase antibiotics concentration experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 analytical method microalgae surface groups were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy using a bruker tensor 27 spectrometer in the attenuated total reflectance atr method morphological characterization was carried out using a hitachi flexsem 1000 scanning electron microscope sem ftir and sem analysis were done at the industrial testing laboratory of castilla y león leical uva located in valladolid university spain the quantitative determination of selected antibiotics was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms with triple quadrupole waters acquity h class uplc equipped with a binary pump system interfaced to a triple quadrupole xevo tq stm mass spectrometer with esi source waters corp the procedure was based on those previously developed by botero coy et al 19 employing direct injection of the diluted samples without any pre concentration step in this work a dilution 100 samples fortified at 1000 and 500 ng ml or dilution 10 samples fortified at 100 and 20 ng ml with milli q water was made in order to reduce matrix complexity and to adjust the sample concentrations to the linear dynamic range of the calibration curve isotope labelled internal standards ilis were added to the four analytes under study ciprofloxacin d8 sulfamethoxazole d6 sulfadiazine 13c6 tetracycline d6 and were used for potential matrix effects correction three ms ms transitions were acquired for each compound one for quantification and the remaining ones for confirmation of the identity of the compound table 2 the analytical procedure was as follows a 100 μl aliquot of the sample was mixed with 800 μl milli q water and a 100 μl mixture of four isotope labelled internal standards ilis at 2 μg l the samples fortified at 1000 and 500 ng ml were previously diluted 10 before applying the procedure by adding 900 μl milli q water to the 100 μl sample finally 50 μl of the mixture were injected into the lc ms ms 2 5 zero point charge zpc 50 ml of milli q water were taken in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks adjusting the ph of each solution between 3 and 11 adding the appropriate amounts of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh 0 5 g of lyophilized biomass to each erlenmeyer and the final ph value was measured after 48 h under stirring at room temperature to calculate phzpc the values of the final ph are plotted versus the initial ph the phzpc corresponds to the point where the curve of final ph versus initial ph cuts the graph diagonal 20 2 6 adsorption kinetics pseudo first order eq 1 and pseudo second order eq 2 equations were used for the description of the adsorption kinetics the linear form of the equations are expressed as 10 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe μg mg and qt μg mg are the amounts of adsorbed antibiotics at equilibrium and at time t respectively k1 h 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order adsorption and k2 mg μg 1 h 1 is the rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption the qt values are calculated as follows eq 3 10 3 q t c 0 c t w v where co μg l is the antibiotic concentration in the initial solution and ct μg l is the antibiotic concentration in the solution at time t w mg is the amount of biosorbent used in the experiment and v l corresponds to the volume of the solution therefore for the pseudo first order equation a plot of ln qe qt versus t gives a straight line of slope k1 and intercepts ln qe while for the pseudo second order equation a plot of t qt versus t gives a linear relationship from which qe and k2 can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot 21 2 7 adsorption isotherms the freundlich and langmuir adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the adsorption equilibrium the linear form of langmuir isotherm eq 4 and the linear form of freundlich isotherm eq 5 are represented as follows 8 22 4 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe μg mg is the amount of adsorbed antibiotic per unit weight of biomass ce μg l is the antibiotic concentration in the solution at equilibrium kl l μg is the langmuir equilibrium constant qm μg mg is the theoretical monolayer saturation capacity kf l μg is the freundlich constant and n μg l is the adsorption intensity therefore for langmuir isotherm a plot of 1 qe versus 1 ce gives a straight line of slope 1 qm kl and intercepts 1 qm while for freundlich isotherm a plot of log qe versus log ce enables the constant kf and exponent n to be determined 21 3 results and discussions 3 1 surface morphology and functional groups of scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium biosorption may be accomplished by the functional groups and polymer assemblages present in microalgae and bacteria cell walls the effectiveness of the adsorption process will depend significantly on the hydrophilicity functionality and structures of the biomass fig 1a and the antibiotics fig 1b a scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium can be an effective biosorbent for antibiotic removal as it presents an especially tough cell wall with cellulose algaenan and glycoproteins 18 23 scanning electron microscopy sem was used to investigate the surface morphology of the scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium fig 1a it can be observed that the surface of the lyophilized biomass possessed pore structures which makes them a good biosorbent sem provides a qualitative evaluation of the cell wall structure after antibiotic adsorption to the algae fig 1c a clear alteration in the cell wall was observed morphological changes of biomass surface after adsorption which was confirmed with ftir spectroscopy 24 ftir analyses were conducted to identify the effect of the antibiotics on the functional groups on the surface of the scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium the ftir spectrums of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium showed broad bands over a wavenumber range of 3600 800 cm 1 oh band 3200 3400 cm 1 ch2 and ch3 stretching 2930 cm 1 aromatic conjugated co and cc bonds 1640 cm 1 nh bending and cn stretching 1520 cm 1 ch bending 1430 cm 1 co carboxylate ion stretching 1375 cm 1 coh phenolics 1270 cm 1 co single bonds 1150 cm 1 co stretching 1049 cm 1 and co3 2 875 cm 1 fig 2 these results showed a similar pattern as others previously reported for s almeriensis 25 showing stretching vibrations of the characteristic bands of polysaccharides and proteins the ftir spectrums in fig 2 of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium before antibiotic adsorption are represented by a blue color while after adsorption by a red one the strong spectrum of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium decreased after the incorporation of antibiotics into the system for tet fig 2a peak modifications were observed at co and nh stretching which are related to proteins suggesting that tet was bounded on the surface of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium via interactions with these functional groups cip fig 2b showed sharp peak modifications at co and nh stretching as well as to the band in the range of 3500 3000 cm 1 corresponding to the hydrogen bonds of carbohydrates and proteins these results indicate that lower peaks were associated with cip adsorption to biomass surface via these functional groups while sdz fig 2c and smx fig 2d showed important peak modifications at co and nh stretching hydrogen bonds and coc stretching 1200 1100 cm 1 of polysaccharides suggest that these functional groups were involved in sdz and smx adsorption ftir results showed changes in chemical groups related to polysaccharides and proteins proteins are highly hydrophobic and can contribute to organic pollutant adsorption 11 3 2 zero point charge zpc to determine the interactions between the antibiotics and the microalgae the zero point charge for the s almeriensis bacteria consortium was determined fig 3 the zero point charge zpc is the ph for which the biomass surface is globally neutral consequently the electrostatic attraction between the biomass particles and antibiotics is minimal below zpc value the microalgae bacteria consortium surface is positively charged and exerts an electrostatic force towards the negatively charged antibiotics in contrast beyond this value the surface is negatively charged and repels the anionic antibiotics 10 26 phzpc for the s almeriensis bacteria consortium was found at ph 6 5 the preset study was performed at ph 8 and therefore the biomass was negatively charged the ph of the solution is a major and sensitive factor that will control the biosorption of the antibiotics into the biomass aggregation hydrophobicity electrostatic attraction or repulsion of the antibiotics will be influenced by the ph in addition the physicochemical characteristics of the antibiotics like the octanol water partition coefficient log kow and the acid base dissociation constant pka of the antibiotics table 3 are important parameters which will directly affect biosorption the microalgae bacteria consortium could remove the antibiotics based on the lipophilic property of the antibiotics the higher the log kow the higher the lipophilicity meanwhile pka influences lipophilicity solubility protein binding and permeability the lower the pka the greater the lipophilicity 27 29 the four antibiotics used in the present study have low log kow showing that these antibiotics are hydrophilic and will tend to be dissolved in the solution however all of the antibiotics studied have more than one pka values this causes difficulty in determining the adsorption mechanism of a compound because it has different dissociated species cationic neutral or anionic different chemical species may present different properties in regards to water solubility volatility uv absorption and reactivity with chemical oxidants 29 30 the following are predictions of the different interaction mechanisms based on the ph of the solution the antibiotics pka and the phzpc of the microalgae bacteria consortium i at ph 8 tet pka1 ph pka2 will be in its neutral form and present hydrophobic interactions with the biomass that will be negatively charged 29 ii cip pka are in the ranges of 3 0 6 3 for the carboxylic acid group and 8 7 10 6 for the nitrogen on the piperazinyl ring showing that the acid will be dissociated at ph values higher than 6 3 and the nitrogen will be protonated at ph values lower than 8 7 thus at ph 8 cip will be mostly dissociated both positively and negatively charged and its cations might enhance its sorption capacity on the negatively charged microalgae bacteria consortium through electrostatic attraction 31 32 iii sulfonamides pka values are in the ranges of 1 8 2 1 and 5 6 6 6 therefore in the ph range of 2 1 5 6 the compound will be in its neutral form while at higher ph the compound will be predominantly anionic at ph 8 sdz and smx ph pka will be negatively charged which will cause an electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged microalgae 29 3 3 biosorption batch experiments containing the dead biomass lyophilized algae bacteria consortium under dark conditions help to understand to what extent the investigated vmp are eliminated from the solution solely by biosorption which would mean that they are not being destroyed during the microalgae wastewater treatment process but are transferred to the biomass having important implications for its possible subsequent use as biofertilizer or animal feed after 96 h of operation the antibiotic removal by biosorption at an initial vmp concentration of 1000 μg l was 75 tet 43 cip and 12 sdz smx did not indicate removal by biosorption fig 4a at an initial vmp concentration of 500 μg l removals of 62 46 36 and 21 were presented by tet cip sdz and smx fig 4b respectively at initial 100 μg l tet cip sdz and smx showed 80 64 26 and 17 of biosorption respectively fig 4c finally at an initial concentration of 20 μg l the removal percentages were 80 tet 30 sdz and 30 smx cip was completely removed by biosorption after 24 h fig 4d biosorption acts as an important mechanism for antibiotic removal especially at low concentrations among the three spiked levels higher removal was observed for 20 μg l one of the reasons why this happened was because there was a limited amount of biomass 1000 mg l typical value at which raceways operate which could not adsorb large amounts of vmp this quantity will be determined in the adsorption isotherm tests in which we will find the adsorption capacity of each vmp per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium tet and cip presented a rapid decrease in their concentration in the first 24 h while sdz and smx decrease gradually during the whole operation time in general tet and cip showed a better affinity to the microalgae bacteria consortium which may explain why at high antibiotic concentrations tet and cip use the available sorption sites in microalgae and bacteria walls first leaving few spaces for sdz and smx furthermore sdz and smx showed low removal percentages by bioadsorption as they are highly water soluble and under the current ph condition they presented electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged microalgae which could explain the limited binding of sulfonamides to the algal cells 33 the results obtained in the present study are comparable with previous studies on antibiotic removal by microalgae for tet at a 2 mg l initial concentration de godos et al 34 using c vulgaris 44 355 mg l tss after 43 h observed 50 71 removal likewise the present study with a mixture of antibiotics obtained around 72 for the half of the concentration used by de godos et al at 43 h the lower removal obtained by de godos et al might be due to the concentration of microalgae present in the solution similarly for the 2 mg l tet initial concentration norvill et al 35 achieved 97 tet removal after 14 h using algae bacteria consortia 0 95 0 02 g l tss from a hrap however the present study obtained around 70 of tet removal for 1 mg l at 14 h the higher removal obtained by norvill et al could be because they used just tet and not a mixture of different antibiotics hence the biomass surface will have more free available sites for sorption hom diaz et al 36 using an algae bacteria consortia from an hrap with an initial concentration of 2 mg l cip obtained 52 9 removal due to sorption after 111 h comparably the present study using a mixture of antibiotics with 1 mg l of cip obtained around 43 removal after 96 h operation this showed that biosorption is an important mechanism in cip removal which goes along with the conclusions of hom diaz et al on the other hand xie et al 11 investigated the use of 80 mg l chlamydomonas sp to remove cip and sdz with an initial concentration of 10 mg l after 9 days of operation only 5 5 cip and 0 5 sdz removal was observed this initial concentration of antibiotics was extremely high in relation to those that can be found habitually in addition the concentration of chlamydomonas sp was small which would cause active sites of the microalgae to be rapidly exhausted the present study did not use a concentration as high as xie et al 11 but the analysis of cip and sdz at different initial concentrations shows that sulfonamides have a lesser tendency to be adsorbed than other antibiotic families such as fluoroquinolones and that at higher antibiotic concentrations sorption decreases which corroborates xie et al findings bai and acharya 31 using 2 0 105 cells ml of a green algae nannochloris sp and an initial concentration of 10 μg l smx obtained 11 of removal due to sorption after 14 days operation in contrast the present study obtained a higher smx removal of 31 with a higher initial concentration of 20 μg l in just 4 days of operation this could be due the use of s almeriensis which showed the best affinity for smx sorption likewise kiki et al 37 investigated the biosorption of smx using h pluvialis s capricornutum s quadricauda and c vulgaris after 40 days of operation 0 1 31 and 0 37 3 35 removal were obtained for initial concentrations of 20 and 100 μg l respectively comparisons with these results confirm that s almeriensis has a better removal efficiency by biosorption when treating water polluted with smx thus by employing a literature review in which the amounts of microalgae used in each study and their removal efficiencies of vmp were compared it has been demonstrated the importance of determining the corresponding adsorption isotherms of each vmp additionally scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium capacity to adsorb vmp can be compared with other organic materials zeng et al 38 achieved 50 to 80 biosorption from 20 mg l cip by using various concentrations of rice straw biochar from 0 2 to 1 6 g l huang et al 39 studied the biosorption of 10 mg l cip by using rabbit manure biochar and they achieved removals of 76 to 97 varying the amount of biochar used from 0 2 to 3 g l wu et al 40 observed 21 to 35 biosorption of 25 mg l cip by using enteromorpha prolifera in concentrations from 0 5 to 2 g l guoting li et al 41 obtained 73 8 biosorption of 20 mg l tet by layered carbon particles from seaweed sargassum sp ahsan et al 42 prepared saw dust derived functionalized graphitic carbon and obtained removals around 90 for100 mg l tet and smx pi et al 43 achieved 47 to 70 of 0 4 to 1 8 mg l sdz biosorption by the utilization of extracelular polymeric substances extracted from klebsiella sp j1 3 4 kinetic analysis the biosorption kinetic of the four aforementioned antibiotics was investigated with pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 5 the values of the specific reaction rates k1 and k2 were obtained by linear regression of the experimental data table 4 from the studied kinetic equations r2 values of the pseudo second order equation were closer to unity and the calculated adsorbed antibiotics at equilibrium were closer to the experimental values when compared with the pseudo first order equation the pseudo second order rate constant k2 for the removal of antibiotics by the scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium are 1 78 27 09 mg μg 1 h 1 for tet 0 11 26 66 mg μg 1 h 1 for cip 0 86 8 49 mg μg 1 h 1 for sdz and 1 93 11 98 mg μg 1 h 1 for smx the k2 rate constant increased with the decrease in the initial antibiotic concentration due to the limited amount of biomass present in the solution the reaction slows down as the available sorption sites get occupied the k2 rate const was higher for cip the higher rate constant for cip is likely due to the log kow of cip 1 32 which is higher than that of tet 1 37 sdz 0 09 and smx 0 89 indicating that cip was more easily adsorbed cip was dissociated thus its cations enhanced its sorption capacity on the negatively charged microalgae and bacteria through electrostatic attraction 32 these results denoted that sorption of cip to s almeriensis was easier and faster than that of tet sdz and smx as far as we know there are few publications about biosorption kinetics on the s almeriensis bacteria consortium for the four antibiotics considered in the present study from the bibliography available choi et al 7 used spirulina sp for biochar production and determined a constant reaction kinetic of tet adsorption of 0 014 h 1 likewise for smx kiki et al 37 determined constant reaction kinetics of 2 08 10 3 to 5 83 10 3 h 1 using h pluvialis s capricornutum s quadricauda and c vulgaris similarly xie et al 11 using chlamydomonas sp obtained constant reaction rates of 1 82 10 4 h 1 for cip and 1 01 10 5 h 1 for sdz likewise hom diaz et al 36 got a 7 3 10 3 h 1 cip removal rate constant by using an algae bacteria consortia from an hrap xiong et al 44 for the biosorption of cip by chlamydomonas mexicana obtained rate constants ranging from 5 04 10 4 to 3 29 10 3 h 1 the increase in removal rate was due to the addition of sodium acetate to enhance cip removal by co metabolism in this case biosorption onto active biomass can mask other removal processes that pure adsorption these studies showed first or pseudo first rate constants thus quantitative comparisons cannot be done with the values obtained in the preset study qualitatively we can say that the present study obtained higher constant rates without the need of any additional substance the comparisons of these results indicate that adsorption of antibiotics is faster when s almeriensis is used confirming that it has a better performance for antibiotic removal by biosorption 3 5 adsorption isotherms to compare the adsorptive capacity of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium to tet cip sdz and smx freundlich and langmuir adsorption models were used fig 6 the freundlich isotherms assume a multilayer adsorption and are based on interactions between adsorbed molecules and non ideal adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces nevertheless the langmuir isotherms are based upon an assumption of a finite number of binding sites constant energies of adsorption and no interaction between adsorbed species 8 10 22 in this work the langmuir model presented a higher correlation coefficient for all the antibiotics studied the values of saturation capacity qm from langmuir isotherm table 5 were 0 83 0 52 0 26 and 0 01 μg mg for tet cip sdz and smx respectively these results indicated assuming a monolayer saturation that the s almeriensis bacteria consortium had a better affinity for tet the values of saturation capacity obtained from the langmuir isotherm are comparable with the amounts of adsorbed antibiotic at equilibrium calculated by the pseudo second order kinetic model for the initial concentration of 1000 μg l the qm values for tet and cip are close to the qe calculated of 0 72 and 0 50 μg mg respectively however the qm value for sdz is closer to the qe calculated at the initial concentration of 500 μg l which was 0 14 μg mg finally for smx the qm value was the same as the qe calculated at the initial concentration of 20 μg l the results are consistent with previous findings 7 which determined that the langmuir model presented a higher correlation coefficient than the freundlich for tet removal by spirulina sp derived biochar the isotherm constant values obtained for kl and qm were 1 81 10 4 l μg and 147 9 μg mg respectively 8 the current study obtained a higher kl of 5 43 10 3 l μg but a lower qm of 0 83 μg mg probably due to high temperatures at which pyrolysis takes place to produce biochar which enhanced hydrophobicity and the specific surface area of the microalgae to the best of our knowledge no other authors have published isotherm constants for cip sdz and smx using microalgae bacteria consortium so further comparisons with literature could not be done 4 conclusions biosorption has been proven to be an important mechanism in the removal of tet and cip by microalgae based water treatment processes for the first time the biosorption capacity of the scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium was analyzed and proven to be highly efficient in the removal of a mixture of four widely used vmp fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines turned out to have a better affinity to the s almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium showing high adsorption removal rates sulfonamides presented limited biosorption in the range of 20 to 1000 μg l the langmuir isotherm better described the adsorption process of tetracycline ciprofloxacin sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole defining a monolayer adsorption with no interaction between adsorbed species further research must focus on the other removal mechanisms of vmp during the microalgae wastewater treatment process to find the best conditions to enhance mechanisms which completely eliminate vmp in order to find a further use for the harvested microalgae declaration of competing

13347,the adsorption of the veterinary medicinal products vmp tetracycline tet ciprofloxacin cip sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethoxazole smx onto a dried scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium was studied at several equilibrium concentrations 20 to 1000 μg l scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis were performed to investigate the surface morphology of the microalgae and to identify the effect of the antibiotics functional groups on the surface of the consortium of s almeriensis and bacteria ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms was used to determine the feasibility of this consortium for the removal of antibiotics via biosorption freundlich and langmuir adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the adsorption equilibrium pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to fit the biosorption experimental data relative antibiotic removal was higher at low equilibrium concentrations in the range of the initial vmp concentration studied ciprofloxacin and tetracycline exhibited the highest removal efficiency of 43 100 and 75 82 respectively likewise ciprofloxacin and tetraciclyne presented the highest adsorption rates of 0 11 26 66 and 1 78 27 09 mg μg 1 h 1 respectively this study revealed that the s almeriensis bacteria consortium has a high biosorption power and proved that biosorption is an important mechanism in the removal of ciprofloxacin and tetraciclyne using a microalgae based water treatment process however sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole removals did not exceed 32 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tetracycline ciprofloxacin sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole adsorption isotherms kinetic of adsorption 1 introduction demand for veterinary antibiotics has increased significantly in the last decades the global total consumption in 2017 was estimated to be 93 309 tons and it is expected to increase by 11 5 by 2030 1 fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and tetracycline were the most abundant vmp found in water in the united states in 2017 2 and were the most sold vmp in european countries in 2018 3 moreover the most frequently found vmp in manure worldwide were fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and tetracyclines 4 a determination which was reinforced by a critical review of cheng et al 5 who stated that these antibiotic families were the most common vmp used in swine production about 70 to 90 of antibiotics administered are excreted via urine or feces either in unchanged forms or as metabolites via sludge storage or by using manure as fertilizer veterinary antibiotics are released into the environment which affects soil and water quality antibiotics have been detected in different water samples such as surface water groundwater and municipal wastewater 4 6 various techniques such as adsorption coagulation electrolysis membrane separation photocatalysis coagulation advanced oxidation and biological degradation have been used for antibiotic removal these methodologies have various limitations such as high energy consumption high materials costs and secondary pollution through the use of additional chemicals however among these adsorption is the most versatile and widely used due to its high efficiency high removal capacity simplicity of design and ease of operation 7 9 in this respect biosorption has emerged as an eco friendly effective and economically feasible process for the removal of antibiotics and is based on the properties of different kinds of live and inactive dead biomasses heat dried chemically treated to bind and concentrate pollutants from aqueous solutions 9 10 moreover regarding biological processes the fate of the antibiotics has been widely investigated and results demonstrated that biosorption plays a critical role in antibiotic removal routes 11 microalgae based wastewater treatment technologies have attracted researcher s attention as these technologies have proved their ability to remove almost all types of emerging contaminants to some extent microalgae have demonstrated a biosorption capacity for antibiotics such as 7 amino cephalosporanic acid 12 cephalexin 13 tilmicosin 14 and ceftazidime 15 among others specifically green algae have cellulosic on its cell wall which provide binding sites such as hydroxyl carboxyl amino and sulfhydryl which play an essential role in the biosorption process 7 16 17 residual algal biomass have been proposed for certain uses such as biofertilizers and animal feed however its use might be discouraged without first knowing the concentration of some adsorbed vmp compounds few studies have been published on antibiotic removal using microalgae at low concentrations similar to those found in real samples in addition limited adsorption data is available for antibiotics in order to broadly use microalgae in wastewater treatment applications it is compulsory to determine the mechanisms involved in antibiotics removal by biomass biosorption is expected to be one of the predominant removal mechanisms hence to determine the biosorption capacity of a microalgae bacteria consortium inactive dead biomass was used for the first time as far as we know to disengage biosorption from biodegradation bioassimilation additionally it is easy to store and use for longer periods of time it is not subject to toxicity limitations and it does not need nutrient supplies the aim of this study was to determine the biosorption power of a scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium for a mixture of four antibiotics at different concentrations tetracycline tet ciprofloxacin cip sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethoxazole smx these antibiotics were selected as representative compounds of three antibiotics families fluoroquinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides which have diverse physicochemical properties and are the vmp most frequently found in piggery wastewater samples 3 6 adsorption isotherms were obtained for the four antibiotics studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae culture lyophilized biomass mainly composed of a consortium of the microalgae scenedesmus almeriensis and bacteria was provided by the department of chemical engineering of the university of almería spain s almeriensis table 1 is a fast growing and highly productive strain which easily adapts to stressful conditions 18 the biomass was recovered from a high rate algae pond hrap used for piggery wastewater treatment with an operating volume of 11 800 l and a land surface of 80 m2 the hrap operational conditions were solar radiation within 1500 1600 μe m2 and temperature between 30 and 35 c lyophilization was used as the inactivation method of the microalgae bacteria consortium in order not to damage the cell structure instead of using regular methods as the thermal or chemical inactivation sodium azide in this respect by using dead biomass it is possible to focus solely on the study of biosorption as mechanism of vmp removal from water by avoiding biodegradation as no biological activity will be observed 2 2 chemicals and reagents tetracycline tet ciprofloxacin cip sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethoxazole smx were selected as target analytes the standards for the drugs were of high purity grade n95 and purchased from sigma aldrich tres cantos madrid spain all of them were acquired as neutral non solvated molecules except for tetracycline hydrochloride individual stock solutions of 1 g l for all the standards were prepared on a weight basis in methanol meoh except for ciprofloxacin which was dissolved in h2o meoh 1 1 containing 0 2 v v hydrochloric acid hcl due to its low solubility in pure meoh mixture stock solutions were subsequently prepared from individual stocks and stored at 80 c in darkness to avoid uncontrolled degradation ultrapure water was generated in house by a milli q mq advantage ultrapure water purification system and filtered through a 0 22 μm millipak express membrane and an lc pak polishing unit by merck millipore billercia ma usa meoh of high analytical grade was acquired from sigma aldrich stockholm sweden and hcl 37 was supplied by sigma aldrich tres cantos madrid spain 2 3 experimental set up for physical processes tests were performed in 1 l amber glass beakers containing 1 l milli q water spiked with a mixture of the aforementioned 4 antibiotics to a final concentration of 1000 500 100 or 20 μg l per antibiotic after taking a first sample to determine the initial antibiotic concentration in each reactor the lyophilized microalgae bacteria consortium was added under continuous mixing to obtain a concentration of 1 g l the microalgae bacteria concentration was chosen as a means of comparison with common microalgae concentration in hraps used for wastewater treatment all reactors were mixed continuously at 200 rpm samples were taken at different time intervals until 4 days of operation to simulate the common residence time of biomass in a hrap ph was monitored during the whole operation process remaining constant around 8 6 0 2 samples were filtered immediately through 0 22 mm pore size nylon syringe filters fisherbrand and stored at 4 c before analysis of the aqueous phase antibiotics concentration experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 analytical method microalgae surface groups were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy using a bruker tensor 27 spectrometer in the attenuated total reflectance atr method morphological characterization was carried out using a hitachi flexsem 1000 scanning electron microscope sem ftir and sem analysis were done at the industrial testing laboratory of castilla y león leical uva located in valladolid university spain the quantitative determination of selected antibiotics was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms with triple quadrupole waters acquity h class uplc equipped with a binary pump system interfaced to a triple quadrupole xevo tq stm mass spectrometer with esi source waters corp the procedure was based on those previously developed by botero coy et al 19 employing direct injection of the diluted samples without any pre concentration step in this work a dilution 100 samples fortified at 1000 and 500 ng ml or dilution 10 samples fortified at 100 and 20 ng ml with milli q water was made in order to reduce matrix complexity and to adjust the sample concentrations to the linear dynamic range of the calibration curve isotope labelled internal standards ilis were added to the four analytes under study ciprofloxacin d8 sulfamethoxazole d6 sulfadiazine 13c6 tetracycline d6 and were used for potential matrix effects correction three ms ms transitions were acquired for each compound one for quantification and the remaining ones for confirmation of the identity of the compound table 2 the analytical procedure was as follows a 100 μl aliquot of the sample was mixed with 800 μl milli q water and a 100 μl mixture of four isotope labelled internal standards ilis at 2 μg l the samples fortified at 1000 and 500 ng ml were previously diluted 10 before applying the procedure by adding 900 μl milli q water to the 100 μl sample finally 50 μl of the mixture were injected into the lc ms ms 2 5 zero point charge zpc 50 ml of milli q water were taken in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks adjusting the ph of each solution between 3 and 11 adding the appropriate amounts of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh 0 5 g of lyophilized biomass to each erlenmeyer and the final ph value was measured after 48 h under stirring at room temperature to calculate phzpc the values of the final ph are plotted versus the initial ph the phzpc corresponds to the point where the curve of final ph versus initial ph cuts the graph diagonal 20 2 6 adsorption kinetics pseudo first order eq 1 and pseudo second order eq 2 equations were used for the description of the adsorption kinetics the linear form of the equations are expressed as 10 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe μg mg and qt μg mg are the amounts of adsorbed antibiotics at equilibrium and at time t respectively k1 h 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order adsorption and k2 mg μg 1 h 1 is the rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption the qt values are calculated as follows eq 3 10 3 q t c 0 c t w v where co μg l is the antibiotic concentration in the initial solution and ct μg l is the antibiotic concentration in the solution at time t w mg is the amount of biosorbent used in the experiment and v l corresponds to the volume of the solution therefore for the pseudo first order equation a plot of ln qe qt versus t gives a straight line of slope k1 and intercepts ln qe while for the pseudo second order equation a plot of t qt versus t gives a linear relationship from which qe and k2 can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot 21 2 7 adsorption isotherms the freundlich and langmuir adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the adsorption equilibrium the linear form of langmuir isotherm eq 4 and the linear form of freundlich isotherm eq 5 are represented as follows 8 22 4 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe μg mg is the amount of adsorbed antibiotic per unit weight of biomass ce μg l is the antibiotic concentration in the solution at equilibrium kl l μg is the langmuir equilibrium constant qm μg mg is the theoretical monolayer saturation capacity kf l μg is the freundlich constant and n μg l is the adsorption intensity therefore for langmuir isotherm a plot of 1 qe versus 1 ce gives a straight line of slope 1 qm kl and intercepts 1 qm while for freundlich isotherm a plot of log qe versus log ce enables the constant kf and exponent n to be determined 21 3 results and discussions 3 1 surface morphology and functional groups of scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium biosorption may be accomplished by the functional groups and polymer assemblages present in microalgae and bacteria cell walls the effectiveness of the adsorption process will depend significantly on the hydrophilicity functionality and structures of the biomass fig 1a and the antibiotics fig 1b a scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium can be an effective biosorbent for antibiotic removal as it presents an especially tough cell wall with cellulose algaenan and glycoproteins 18 23 scanning electron microscopy sem was used to investigate the surface morphology of the scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium fig 1a it can be observed that the surface of the lyophilized biomass possessed pore structures which makes them a good biosorbent sem provides a qualitative evaluation of the cell wall structure after antibiotic adsorption to the algae fig 1c a clear alteration in the cell wall was observed morphological changes of biomass surface after adsorption which was confirmed with ftir spectroscopy 24 ftir analyses were conducted to identify the effect of the antibiotics on the functional groups on the surface of the scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium the ftir spectrums of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium showed broad bands over a wavenumber range of 3600 800 cm 1 oh band 3200 3400 cm 1 ch2 and ch3 stretching 2930 cm 1 aromatic conjugated co and cc bonds 1640 cm 1 nh bending and cn stretching 1520 cm 1 ch bending 1430 cm 1 co carboxylate ion stretching 1375 cm 1 coh phenolics 1270 cm 1 co single bonds 1150 cm 1 co stretching 1049 cm 1 and co3 2 875 cm 1 fig 2 these results showed a similar pattern as others previously reported for s almeriensis 25 showing stretching vibrations of the characteristic bands of polysaccharides and proteins the ftir spectrums in fig 2 of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium before antibiotic adsorption are represented by a blue color while after adsorption by a red one the strong spectrum of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium decreased after the incorporation of antibiotics into the system for tet fig 2a peak modifications were observed at co and nh stretching which are related to proteins suggesting that tet was bounded on the surface of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium via interactions with these functional groups cip fig 2b showed sharp peak modifications at co and nh stretching as well as to the band in the range of 3500 3000 cm 1 corresponding to the hydrogen bonds of carbohydrates and proteins these results indicate that lower peaks were associated with cip adsorption to biomass surface via these functional groups while sdz fig 2c and smx fig 2d showed important peak modifications at co and nh stretching hydrogen bonds and coc stretching 1200 1100 cm 1 of polysaccharides suggest that these functional groups were involved in sdz and smx adsorption ftir results showed changes in chemical groups related to polysaccharides and proteins proteins are highly hydrophobic and can contribute to organic pollutant adsorption 11 3 2 zero point charge zpc to determine the interactions between the antibiotics and the microalgae the zero point charge for the s almeriensis bacteria consortium was determined fig 3 the zero point charge zpc is the ph for which the biomass surface is globally neutral consequently the electrostatic attraction between the biomass particles and antibiotics is minimal below zpc value the microalgae bacteria consortium surface is positively charged and exerts an electrostatic force towards the negatively charged antibiotics in contrast beyond this value the surface is negatively charged and repels the anionic antibiotics 10 26 phzpc for the s almeriensis bacteria consortium was found at ph 6 5 the preset study was performed at ph 8 and therefore the biomass was negatively charged the ph of the solution is a major and sensitive factor that will control the biosorption of the antibiotics into the biomass aggregation hydrophobicity electrostatic attraction or repulsion of the antibiotics will be influenced by the ph in addition the physicochemical characteristics of the antibiotics like the octanol water partition coefficient log kow and the acid base dissociation constant pka of the antibiotics table 3 are important parameters which will directly affect biosorption the microalgae bacteria consortium could remove the antibiotics based on the lipophilic property of the antibiotics the higher the log kow the higher the lipophilicity meanwhile pka influences lipophilicity solubility protein binding and permeability the lower the pka the greater the lipophilicity 27 29 the four antibiotics used in the present study have low log kow showing that these antibiotics are hydrophilic and will tend to be dissolved in the solution however all of the antibiotics studied have more than one pka values this causes difficulty in determining the adsorption mechanism of a compound because it has different dissociated species cationic neutral or anionic different chemical species may present different properties in regards to water solubility volatility uv absorption and reactivity with chemical oxidants 29 30 the following are predictions of the different interaction mechanisms based on the ph of the solution the antibiotics pka and the phzpc of the microalgae bacteria consortium i at ph 8 tet pka1 ph pka2 will be in its neutral form and present hydrophobic interactions with the biomass that will be negatively charged 29 ii cip pka are in the ranges of 3 0 6 3 for the carboxylic acid group and 8 7 10 6 for the nitrogen on the piperazinyl ring showing that the acid will be dissociated at ph values higher than 6 3 and the nitrogen will be protonated at ph values lower than 8 7 thus at ph 8 cip will be mostly dissociated both positively and negatively charged and its cations might enhance its sorption capacity on the negatively charged microalgae bacteria consortium through electrostatic attraction 31 32 iii sulfonamides pka values are in the ranges of 1 8 2 1 and 5 6 6 6 therefore in the ph range of 2 1 5 6 the compound will be in its neutral form while at higher ph the compound will be predominantly anionic at ph 8 sdz and smx ph pka will be negatively charged which will cause an electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged microalgae 29 3 3 biosorption batch experiments containing the dead biomass lyophilized algae bacteria consortium under dark conditions help to understand to what extent the investigated vmp are eliminated from the solution solely by biosorption which would mean that they are not being destroyed during the microalgae wastewater treatment process but are transferred to the biomass having important implications for its possible subsequent use as biofertilizer or animal feed after 96 h of operation the antibiotic removal by biosorption at an initial vmp concentration of 1000 μg l was 75 tet 43 cip and 12 sdz smx did not indicate removal by biosorption fig 4a at an initial vmp concentration of 500 μg l removals of 62 46 36 and 21 were presented by tet cip sdz and smx fig 4b respectively at initial 100 μg l tet cip sdz and smx showed 80 64 26 and 17 of biosorption respectively fig 4c finally at an initial concentration of 20 μg l the removal percentages were 80 tet 30 sdz and 30 smx cip was completely removed by biosorption after 24 h fig 4d biosorption acts as an important mechanism for antibiotic removal especially at low concentrations among the three spiked levels higher removal was observed for 20 μg l one of the reasons why this happened was because there was a limited amount of biomass 1000 mg l typical value at which raceways operate which could not adsorb large amounts of vmp this quantity will be determined in the adsorption isotherm tests in which we will find the adsorption capacity of each vmp per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium tet and cip presented a rapid decrease in their concentration in the first 24 h while sdz and smx decrease gradually during the whole operation time in general tet and cip showed a better affinity to the microalgae bacteria consortium which may explain why at high antibiotic concentrations tet and cip use the available sorption sites in microalgae and bacteria walls first leaving few spaces for sdz and smx furthermore sdz and smx showed low removal percentages by bioadsorption as they are highly water soluble and under the current ph condition they presented electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged microalgae which could explain the limited binding of sulfonamides to the algal cells 33 the results obtained in the present study are comparable with previous studies on antibiotic removal by microalgae for tet at a 2 mg l initial concentration de godos et al 34 using c vulgaris 44 355 mg l tss after 43 h observed 50 71 removal likewise the present study with a mixture of antibiotics obtained around 72 for the half of the concentration used by de godos et al at 43 h the lower removal obtained by de godos et al might be due to the concentration of microalgae present in the solution similarly for the 2 mg l tet initial concentration norvill et al 35 achieved 97 tet removal after 14 h using algae bacteria consortia 0 95 0 02 g l tss from a hrap however the present study obtained around 70 of tet removal for 1 mg l at 14 h the higher removal obtained by norvill et al could be because they used just tet and not a mixture of different antibiotics hence the biomass surface will have more free available sites for sorption hom diaz et al 36 using an algae bacteria consortia from an hrap with an initial concentration of 2 mg l cip obtained 52 9 removal due to sorption after 111 h comparably the present study using a mixture of antibiotics with 1 mg l of cip obtained around 43 removal after 96 h operation this showed that biosorption is an important mechanism in cip removal which goes along with the conclusions of hom diaz et al on the other hand xie et al 11 investigated the use of 80 mg l chlamydomonas sp to remove cip and sdz with an initial concentration of 10 mg l after 9 days of operation only 5 5 cip and 0 5 sdz removal was observed this initial concentration of antibiotics was extremely high in relation to those that can be found habitually in addition the concentration of chlamydomonas sp was small which would cause active sites of the microalgae to be rapidly exhausted the present study did not use a concentration as high as xie et al 11 but the analysis of cip and sdz at different initial concentrations shows that sulfonamides have a lesser tendency to be adsorbed than other antibiotic families such as fluoroquinolones and that at higher antibiotic concentrations sorption decreases which corroborates xie et al findings bai and acharya 31 using 2 0 105 cells ml of a green algae nannochloris sp and an initial concentration of 10 μg l smx obtained 11 of removal due to sorption after 14 days operation in contrast the present study obtained a higher smx removal of 31 with a higher initial concentration of 20 μg l in just 4 days of operation this could be due the use of s almeriensis which showed the best affinity for smx sorption likewise kiki et al 37 investigated the biosorption of smx using h pluvialis s capricornutum s quadricauda and c vulgaris after 40 days of operation 0 1 31 and 0 37 3 35 removal were obtained for initial concentrations of 20 and 100 μg l respectively comparisons with these results confirm that s almeriensis has a better removal efficiency by biosorption when treating water polluted with smx thus by employing a literature review in which the amounts of microalgae used in each study and their removal efficiencies of vmp were compared it has been demonstrated the importance of determining the corresponding adsorption isotherms of each vmp additionally scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium capacity to adsorb vmp can be compared with other organic materials zeng et al 38 achieved 50 to 80 biosorption from 20 mg l cip by using various concentrations of rice straw biochar from 0 2 to 1 6 g l huang et al 39 studied the biosorption of 10 mg l cip by using rabbit manure biochar and they achieved removals of 76 to 97 varying the amount of biochar used from 0 2 to 3 g l wu et al 40 observed 21 to 35 biosorption of 25 mg l cip by using enteromorpha prolifera in concentrations from 0 5 to 2 g l guoting li et al 41 obtained 73 8 biosorption of 20 mg l tet by layered carbon particles from seaweed sargassum sp ahsan et al 42 prepared saw dust derived functionalized graphitic carbon and obtained removals around 90 for100 mg l tet and smx pi et al 43 achieved 47 to 70 of 0 4 to 1 8 mg l sdz biosorption by the utilization of extracelular polymeric substances extracted from klebsiella sp j1 3 4 kinetic analysis the biosorption kinetic of the four aforementioned antibiotics was investigated with pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 5 the values of the specific reaction rates k1 and k2 were obtained by linear regression of the experimental data table 4 from the studied kinetic equations r2 values of the pseudo second order equation were closer to unity and the calculated adsorbed antibiotics at equilibrium were closer to the experimental values when compared with the pseudo first order equation the pseudo second order rate constant k2 for the removal of antibiotics by the scenedesmus almeriensis bacteria consortium are 1 78 27 09 mg μg 1 h 1 for tet 0 11 26 66 mg μg 1 h 1 for cip 0 86 8 49 mg μg 1 h 1 for sdz and 1 93 11 98 mg μg 1 h 1 for smx the k2 rate constant increased with the decrease in the initial antibiotic concentration due to the limited amount of biomass present in the solution the reaction slows down as the available sorption sites get occupied the k2 rate const was higher for cip the higher rate constant for cip is likely due to the log kow of cip 1 32 which is higher than that of tet 1 37 sdz 0 09 and smx 0 89 indicating that cip was more easily adsorbed cip was dissociated thus its cations enhanced its sorption capacity on the negatively charged microalgae and bacteria through electrostatic attraction 32 these results denoted that sorption of cip to s almeriensis was easier and faster than that of tet sdz and smx as far as we know there are few publications about biosorption kinetics on the s almeriensis bacteria consortium for the four antibiotics considered in the present study from the bibliography available choi et al 7 used spirulina sp for biochar production and determined a constant reaction kinetic of tet adsorption of 0 014 h 1 likewise for smx kiki et al 37 determined constant reaction kinetics of 2 08 10 3 to 5 83 10 3 h 1 using h pluvialis s capricornutum s quadricauda and c vulgaris similarly xie et al 11 using chlamydomonas sp obtained constant reaction rates of 1 82 10 4 h 1 for cip and 1 01 10 5 h 1 for sdz likewise hom diaz et al 36 got a 7 3 10 3 h 1 cip removal rate constant by using an algae bacteria consortia from an hrap xiong et al 44 for the biosorption of cip by chlamydomonas mexicana obtained rate constants ranging from 5 04 10 4 to 3 29 10 3 h 1 the increase in removal rate was due to the addition of sodium acetate to enhance cip removal by co metabolism in this case biosorption onto active biomass can mask other removal processes that pure adsorption these studies showed first or pseudo first rate constants thus quantitative comparisons cannot be done with the values obtained in the preset study qualitatively we can say that the present study obtained higher constant rates without the need of any additional substance the comparisons of these results indicate that adsorption of antibiotics is faster when s almeriensis is used confirming that it has a better performance for antibiotic removal by biosorption 3 5 adsorption isotherms to compare the adsorptive capacity of the s almeriensis bacteria consortium to tet cip sdz and smx freundlich and langmuir adsorption models were used fig 6 the freundlich isotherms assume a multilayer adsorption and are based on interactions between adsorbed molecules and non ideal adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces nevertheless the langmuir isotherms are based upon an assumption of a finite number of binding sites constant energies of adsorption and no interaction between adsorbed species 8 10 22 in this work the langmuir model presented a higher correlation coefficient for all the antibiotics studied the values of saturation capacity qm from langmuir isotherm table 5 were 0 83 0 52 0 26 and 0 01 μg mg for tet cip sdz and smx respectively these results indicated assuming a monolayer saturation that the s almeriensis bacteria consortium had a better affinity for tet the values of saturation capacity obtained from the langmuir isotherm are comparable with the amounts of adsorbed antibiotic at equilibrium calculated by the pseudo second order kinetic model for the initial concentration of 1000 μg l the qm values for tet and cip are close to the qe calculated of 0 72 and 0 50 μg mg respectively however the qm value for sdz is closer to the qe calculated at the initial concentration of 500 μg l which was 0 14 μg mg finally for smx the qm value was the same as the qe calculated at the initial concentration of 20 μg l the results are consistent with previous findings 7 which determined that the langmuir model presented a higher correlation coefficient than the freundlich for tet removal by spirulina sp derived biochar the isotherm constant values obtained for kl and qm were 1 81 10 4 l μg and 147 9 μg mg respectively 8 the current study obtained a higher kl of 5 43 10 3 l μg but a lower qm of 0 83 μg mg probably due to high temperatures at which pyrolysis takes place to produce biochar which enhanced hydrophobicity and the specific surface area of the microalgae to the best of our knowledge no other authors have published isotherm constants for cip sdz and smx using microalgae bacteria consortium so further comparisons with literature could not be done 4 conclusions biosorption has been proven to be an important mechanism in the removal of tet and cip by microalgae based water treatment processes for the first time the biosorption capacity of the scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium was analyzed and proven to be highly efficient in the removal of a mixture of four widely used vmp fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines turned out to have a better affinity to the s almeriensis microalgae bacteria consortium showing high adsorption removal rates sulfonamides presented limited biosorption in the range of 20 to 1000 μg l the langmuir isotherm better described the adsorption process of tetracycline ciprofloxacin sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole defining a monolayer adsorption with no interaction between adsorbed species further research must focus on the other removal mechanisms of vmp during the microalgae wastewater treatment process to find the best conditions to enhance mechanisms which completely eliminate vmp in order to find a further use for the harvested microalgae declaration of competing

13348,ammonium pollution caused by human activities threated to eco environment and the groundwater was polluted by rain and other leaching processes this study investigated the mechanism and dynamic adsorptive characteristic of ammonium nh4 n which removed by a novel modified biochar mbc pyrolyzed from peanut shell the maximum capacity of unmodified biochar bc and modified biochar mbc to ammonium absorption could reach 3 83 mg g and 6 92 mg g respectively indicating that modification would enhance the performance of the adsorbent analyzing a batch of experimental data it can be found that the isothermal absorption was suitable for sips model and the kinetic adsorption model suitable for quasi second order kinetic model indicating that the adsorptive rate was related to the amount of the adsorption site and dominated by monolayers chemisorption the characteristics of mbc before and after the process of adsorption showed that ion exchange electrostatic adsorption and surface complexation were the main factors controlling adsorptive capacity the dynamic removal performance of ammonium by mbc under different conditions was investigated by column experiments the experimental data of breakthrough curve fitted the thomas model well the maximum adsorptive capacity kth 5 28 10 3 l mg h and qe 9 02 mg g was obtained when the influent concentration reached 30 mg l the bed depth 2 1 cm and the inflow rate 1 ml min it can be concluded that the mbc was a promising adsorbent which can effectively remove ammonium from groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ammonium modified biochar water treatment fixed bed mechanism breakthrough curve 1 introduction at present ammonium pollution is mainly caused by contaminated land 1 agricultural nitrogen fertilizer 2 animal manure from animal husbandry 3 4 industrial waste residue such as electrolytic manganese residue 5 6 and other social activities in china ammonium in groundwater resources can make a threat to municipal water supplies when the ammonium content exceeds 0 5 mg l the efficiency of chlorinated drinking water was reduced 7 in addition ammonium is a precursor to reproductive toxicity and carcinogenic disinfected by products dpbs 8 therefore it is significant to stem the growing of ammonium pollution traditional methods for treating ammonium pollution in groundwater included membrane separation ion exchange 9 chemical precipitation 10 and microbiological methods 11 12 however these methods have a series of disadvantages such as high cost complex operation or low survival rate of microorganisms in practical applications adsorptive method is considered to be quick simple and effective 13 in the previous literature zeolite activated carbon clay mineral and other adsorbents have been extensively studied 14 17 however the application of these adsorbents was usually limited by the difficulties of the disposal process and the unavailability therefore the development of a low cost non secondary pollution and efficient adsorption material to remove ammonium from contaminated groundwater has become a research focus biochar a novel and green environmental adsorbent prepared from biological organisms by high temperature slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization 18 19 has attracted much attention in recent years due to its easy availability high adsorptive efficiency and low price 20 21 however unmodified biochar derived from maple wood 22 23 cacao shell 24 and coconut shell 25 have a relatively low adsorptive capacity respectively approximately 5 44 mg g nh4 n 2 26 mg g nh4 n and 0 87 mg g nh4 n therefore it is necessary to further study the modification technology of biochar to obtain more oxygen containing functional group structure and pore structure 26 27 and improve the adsorptive capacity b wang et al 22 and z wang et al 23 found that the maximum adsorption capacity of lacl3 modified biochar to nh4 was 10 1 mg g which was 1 9 times higher than that of unmodified biochar it might be related to the acid functional groups on biochar shang et al 28 modified the biochar derived from spruce wood chips by hno3 and na2co3 studying its adsorptive capacity and plant experiments were used to show that the biochar could be directly used as nitrogen fertilizer in soil after adsorption with several reports on the adsorptive performance of ammonium by modified biochar there are few studies on the mechanism of adsorption in addition the dynamic adsorptive performance used to be neglected kizito et al 29 believed that the investigation on the adsorption performance of fixed bed biochar filler could provide a feasible method for the effective utilization of the adsorbent and provide working condition parameters that are easy to be amplified for practical application therefore the study of dynamic adsorption behavior is of great significance for the practical application of adsorbed materials therefore this study was conducted to 1 illustrate the effect of modification on peanut shell biochar adsorption by a batch of experiments and the adsorption kinetics and isotherm 2 the adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the main mechanism of ammonium adsorption by mbc was discussed 3 the effects of influent concentration bed height and flow rate on ammonium removal in groundwater were studied by fixed bed column experiment moreover the prediction parameters were obtained through model simulation and the advantages of mbc dynamic adsorption properties were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of modified biochar adsorbent peanut shells were obtained from the local market in chongqing and the preparation method was according to predecessors of the research group 30 briefly peanut shell biochar bc was prepared by pyrolysis for 2 h under the conditions of inert nitrogen atmosphere heating rate of 10 c min and pyrolysis temperature of 500 c 5 0 g peanut shell biochar was mixed with 10 ml 0 76 kmno4 solution soaked fully for 4 h and dried in oven for 4 h then mixed with koh solid mass ratio of potassium hydroxide to biochar is 2 5 and heated for 1 h heating temperature is 300 c the carbonized product was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water until the rinsing liquid is ph neutral and dried finally the modified peanut shell biochar mbc was ground and sifted through 60 mesh sieve 2 2 batch adsorption experiment the effect of modification on the adsorption performance of peanut shell biochar was evaluated by isothermal adsorption the experiment was performed by treating 50 ml nh4 n solutions 10 30 45 60 80 and 100 mg l at mbc application amount was 0 1 g and bc application amount was 0 6 g respectively the initial ph of the series solution was controlled with 0 1 mol l of hcl and naoh to be 7 0 0 1 then the vials containing the solution and biochar were agitated for 24 h in a thermostatic oscillator of 30 c at 120 rpm after sampling the suspension was filtered with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and the equilibrium nh4 n concentration in solution was determined by salicylic acid spectrophotometry the kinetic studies of nh4 n on biochar were studied by adding 0 1 g mbc to 50 ml nh4 n solutions with an initial concentration of 30 mg l the following treatment and analysis were consistent with the isothermal adsorption experiment except that the sampling method was intermittent sampling within 24 h details of the adsorption kinetics and isotherm models were provided in the support information 2 3 dynamic adsorption experiment of fixed bed column the dynamic adsorption was carried out in a glass column fig 1 with 1 2 cm inner diameter and 10 cm height different bed heights were obtained by wet filling 0 6 g 0 8 g and 1 0 g mbc into the fixed bed column the corresponding heights were 2 1 cm 2 7 cm and 3 4 cm respectively after filling the column deionized water was soaked it in for 1 h to stabilize the column then ammonium solutions with initial concentrations of 30 mg l 45 mg l and 60 mg l were pumped into the fixed bed column at flow rates of 1 ml min 1 5 ml min and 2 ml min during the continuous experiment the effluent samples were collected and analyzed at regular intervals the breakthrough time defined as the effluent concentration reached 10 of the initial concentration the experiment continued until the effluent concentration reached 90 of the initial concentration which defined as exhaust time details of the fixed bed experimental apparatus structure and the dynamic adsorption kinetic model were provided in the supporting information 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate average values and standard deviations were calculated the origin pro 8 0 origin lab northampton ma usa was used to solve the model equation through linear regression analysis and to predict the breakthrough curve flow rate constant and relevant adsorption parameters under different operation conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of mbc 3 1 1 sem eds analysis the sem micrographs and corresponding eds spectrum of the mbc that treated and untreated with nh4 n solution were shown in fig 2 it could be seen that the surface of mbc was smooth with multiple voids and microporous fig 2a these well developed pores of miscellaneous shapes and sizes in mbc were attributed to the kmno4 and koh used in the modification process to improve the pore characteristics of biochar 31 a similar phenomenon had been reported in an s research 30 through modification small pores were combined to form large pores which would be resulted in the decrease of the average pore size the increase of pore volume and specific surface area 28 32 therefore the adsorption capacity of biochar could be improved by improving the porosity through chemical modification in addition it could be seen from fig 2c that material clusters appeared on the mbc surface after adsorption which indicated that adsorption might be related to complexation in fact subsequent analysis of the decrease in the content of oxygen containing functional groups on the mbc surface after adsorption also confirmed this statement it could be seen from the eds spectrum of mbc that the surface was dominated by c o and n elements and a large number of k and mn elements appear on the surface corresponding to the modification of kmno4 and koh in comparison with the eds spectrum of the mbc before fig 2b and after fig 2d ammonium adsorption a significant increase in n element occurred whereas mg al k and other elements decreased significantly this phenomenon could be explained by the exchange of cation on the surface of mbc with nh4 n in solution and then the cation was released into the aqueous solution and nh4 n was adsorbed on the mbc surface 3 1 2 ftir spectra characteristics analysis the complex reaction co precipitation reaction and ion exchange reaction in the adsorption mechanism are all related to the functional groups on the surface of the adsorption material 33 34 by measuring the infrared spectra before and after the adsorption of ammonium by biochar the changes of functional groups could be analyzed and the types and mechanisms of the interfacial reactions of biochar could be inferred as shown in fig 3 a the broad bands at approximately 3424 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl oh groups in the carboxyl and phenolic groups 28 the peaks at 2919 cm 1 and 2847 cm 1 could be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetrical ch stretching vibrations of the aliphatic methyl and methylene groups which typically occurred in hemicellulose and lignin 31 the peak at 1400 cm 1 was caused by the bending vibrations of the hydroxyl oh groups 35 and the stretching vibration peak of co at 1105 cm 1 decreased obviously after adsorption 36 the peak observed around 1600 cm 1 was due to the stretching vibration of the cc double bond in the aromatic ring 36 on the other hand it could be observed from fig s2 that the modification of koh and kmno4 solutions successfully introduced the active oxygen containing functional groups of c h 2919 cm 1 and 2847 cm 1 and c o 1105 cm 1 into biochar the peak at 3424 cm 1 1579 cm 1 and 1400 cm 1 had been enhanced concluded with the above analysis the results were consistent with previous findings that the modification of alkaline solutions could increase the content of oxygen containing functional groups in biochar 31 it also could be seen from the infrared spectrum that the characteristic peaks at co cooh and oh had obvious displacement after adsorption which was due to the complexation of oxygen containing functional groups with ammonium the substituents were changed and thus the electron cloud density was changed 3 1 3 xps analysis in order to further determine the surface composition changes after mbc adsorption of ammonium the xps spectra of mbc before and after adsorption were evaluated the results showed that the characteristic binding energy peak of n after mbc adsorption was significantly enhanced compared with that of before adsorption fig 3b indicating that ammonium was successfully adsorbed on the surface of modified peanut shell biochar the characteristic binding energy peak of mn appeared in the full spectrum scanning indicating that mn was bound to the surface of peanut shell biochar modified by kmno4 solution which was also consistent with the results of energy spectrum analysis in sem in addition it could be seen from the n1s narrow region diagram of mbc that the high precision spectrum was divided into two peaks corresponding to nh3 and nh4 fig 3d and 3f respectively 37 the relative area of the peak representing nh4 increased sharply from 10 31 to 65 08 after adsorption which well proved that ammonium could be adsorbed by mbc the o1s narrow xps scan spectrum fig 3c could be divided into three characteristic peaks c o 531 0 ev cooh 532 0 ev and oh 533 1 ev 38 after ammonium adsorption the characteristic peak of oh 533 1 ev was shifted to 532 9 ev fig 3c and e while the characteristic peak of cooh 532 0 ev was shifted to 531 8 ev and the relative strength was weakened in addition the relative strength of the characteristic peak 531 0 ev representing c o was significantly reduced the results showed that the oxygen containing functional groups c o oh and cooh were involved in adsorption process which was consistent with the above ftir analysis results 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherm study 3 2 1 adsorption isotherm the simulation parameters and fitting figures of the three models were shown in table 1 and fig s1 the maximum adsorption capacity of bc and mbc to nh4 n was 3 83 mg g and 6 92 mg g respectively the adsorption effect of peanut shell biochar on nh4 n was significantly improved after modification according to the correlation coefficients r2 the isotherm data of bc and mbc were best fitted in sips model and fitted the langmuir model well it indicated that the adsorption of ammonium by bc and mbc was controlled by mainly chemical adsorption in monolayer which was also consistent with other research results 39 40 on the other hand although the r2 value of freundlich model was 0 943 it also indicated that there was a certain degree of physical adsorption and from 1 n 1 it also could be inferred that chemical adsorption was more favorable 41 the adsorption performance of other low cost adsorbent materials for nh4 n removal was reviewed in table 3 it could be seen from table 3 that the adsorption effect of bamboo charcoal coconut cacao shell and oak sawdust was low even after modified treatment the modified peanut shell biochar in this study had a better adsorption performance 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics as could be seen from the fitting figure in fig s1 and the corresponding model parameters in table 2 the adsorption of ammonium by mbc was more in line with the quasi second order kinetic model and the value of r2 was 0 998 this indicated that the adsorption rate of ammonium by mbc depended on the availability of the adsorption site 42 and the whole adsorption process was controlled by chemical adsorption 40 41 43 3 3 the adsorption mechanism of mbc in the previous study 30 compared with unmodified biochar the specific surface area and average pore volume of modified biochar increased greatly while the average pore size decreased significantly this indicated that the modification optimized the pore structure of biochar and provided more adsorption sites which was consistent with the observation of a large number of micropores in sem in addition in the study of isothermal adsorption although it was found that the adsorption of ammonium by mbc was mainly monolayer chemical adsorption physical adsorption had also been proved to exist to a certain extent electrostatic adsorption was also included in the adsorption mechanism of mbc when ph was higher than the phpzc value the surface functional groups were deprotonated and the surface of the adsorbent material had net negative charges which was conducive to the adsorption of cation from the an s study 30 phpzc of mbc was about 0 75 which was favorable for the mutual attraction between the negatively charged functional groups on the surface of mbc and ammonium 44 the relevant chemical reaction was given in eq 1 1 mbc r nh 4 mbc r nh 4 where r represents the negatively charged functional group on the surface of mbc it could be seen from the xps full spectrum scanning fig 3b compared with mbc before adsorption the characteristic peak strength of k ca mg on the surface of mbc after adsorption was weakened compared with eds spectrum fig 2b and d of mbc before and after adsorption n elements significantly increased while other elements such as ca mg and k were decreased significantly this was because the cation on the surface of mbc had an ion exchange with nh4 in the solution some studies have also confirmed that the adsorption of ammonium by biochar was through ion exchange 28 39 the relevant chemical reaction was given in eq 2 2 m mbc coom om nh 4 nh 4 mbc coo nh 4 o nh 4 m where m represents cations such as ca2 mg2 through the above ftir and xps analysis it could also be found that the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of mbc such as oh cooh complexed with ammonium in the adsorption process the adsorption mechanism between modified biochar and ammonium were summarized as shown in fig 4 it could be obtained that the adsorption process of ammonium by mbc involved various mechanisms such as electrostatic adsorption complexation and ion exchange 3 4 column adsorption experiment 3 4 1 effect of influent ammonium concentration the breakthrough curves fig 5 a of influent concentration were obtained by varying the influent concentration c0 at bed height of 3 4 cm and flow rate of 1 ml min it could be found that the breakthrough time and exhaust time decreased with the increase of the initial concentration through the analysis of collected samples the ammonium absorption ration of the biochar after complete exhaustion was found to be 8 17 8 91 and 9 02 mg g for initial concentration of 30 45 and 60 mg l respectively the phenomenon could be explained as follows with the increase of initial ammonium concentration the concentration gradient as the main driving force would accelerate the adsorption and mass transfer 45 the high concentration gradient leaded to an increase in the diffusion of ammonium ions into the pores of biochar which in turn leaded to an increase in the amount of ammonium adsorbed by biochar however with the increasing of mass transfer impetus the adsorption area would be decreased rapidly 46 the sharp decrease of adsorption site efficiency would lead to the advance of the breakthrough time and exhaust time of adsorption and the whole adsorption process reached the equilibrium in advance 45 46 therefore the breakthrough time point of ammonium adsorbed in biochar fixed bed was closely related to the influent initial ammonium concentration once the running time of the fixed bed exceeded the breakthrough time point the concentration of ammonium in the effluent would increase rapidly 3 4 2 effect of flow rate flow rate q is an important parameter in mbc dynamic adsorption evaluation the effect of flow rate was studied by changing flow rate at initial concentration of 30 mg l and bed depth of 3 4 cm it could be seen from fig 5b that the experimental breakthrough time of flow rate 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 ml min was 190 110 and 91 min and the exhaust time was 420 220 and 196 min respectively in addition table s1 showed that with the increase of the flow rate the removal rate of ammonium decreased correspondingly which were 77 3 72 9 and 72 8 respectively it could be concluded that when the flow rate was relatively small the adsorption time of ammonium by mbc became longer which increased the amount of ammonium that could be dispersed to the effective active sites in the pores of mbc and enhanced the adsorption efficiency of biochar to ammonium conversely the higher the flow rate the shorter the contact time between the ammonium in the solution and the active site of mbc therefore the ammonium was taken away before it could be adsorbed and the adsorption was in equilibrium ahead of time 45 47 hence in practical application the balance between adsorption effect and adsorption time could be controlled by adjusting the flow rate to achieve the best treatment efficiency 3 4 3 effect of bed height effect of bed height z on breakthrough curve was studied under the condition of initial concentration of 30 mg l and flow rate of 1 ml min by changing the amount of biochar applied to change the height of fixed bed the results could be seen from fig 5c that the experimental breakthrough time of bed height 2 1 2 7 and 3 4 cm was 100 140 and 190 min and the exhaust time was 240 280 and 340 min respectively from table s1 with the increase of mbc the corresponding total ammonium adsorption amount increased from 5 14 mg to 7 89 mg the above results could be explained that with the increase of filling height the residence time of ammonium solution in the fixed bed also become longer and the contact degree with mbc was more sufficient so the removal efficiency would increase correspondingly 47 the increase of filling height also meant that more active adsorption sites could be provided for adsorbates in addition the breakthrough time and exhaust time increased with the increase of bed height which was attributed to the increase of mass transfer area although the exhaust time increased with the increase of bed height the time between breakthrough time and exhaust time of different bed heights was approximately the same which indicated that the range of unsaturated zone was basically unchanged 48 3 5 breakthrough curves modeling mathematical models are often used to describe the analysis of laboratory scale dynamic column adsorption studies the basic law of dynamic adsorption of adsorption materials could be obtained through the column experiment and then appropriate dynamic adsorption model could be established and simulated according to the specific experimental results the calculated model parameters could provide guidance for the large scale application of adsorption engineering and the practical application design of fixed bed therefore adam bohart and thomas model were used in this study to fit the dynamic adsorption data so as to identify the best model that could describe the dynamic column adsorption behavior and obtain the corresponding fitting parameters the adam bohart model fitting parameters for the breakthrough curve under different experimental conditions were shown in table 4 it could be seen that the adam bohart model had a good fitting degree r2 0 94 to the experimental results indicating that the adam bohart model could predict the adsorption breakthrough of ammonium on mbc to a certain extent moreover we found that the values of the adsorption rate constant kab of the adam bohart model were very small and basically maintained the same order of magnitude the parameter kab decreased with the increase of the flow rate and increased with the increase of the height of the packing layer these results indicated that the dynamic adsorption kinetics of fixed bed system was controlled by external mass transfer 29 the fitting parameters of the thomas model for the breakthrough curve of ammonium adsorption by mbc under different experimental conditions were shown in table 4 it was obvious that the thomas model had a good fitting degree r2 0 97 to experimental results which meant that the model could describe the adsorption breakthrough of mbc to ammonium and predict the adsorption capacity of mbc to ammonium in addition it could be seen from table 4 when the influent initial concentration was constant the adsorption rate constant k th increased with the increase of flow rate and decreased with the increase of bed height this was mainly due to the height of the mass transfer zone and the difference in solid liquid contact time by comparing the r2 values thomas model was more suitable than adam bohart model to describe the overall adsorption behavior of mbc to ammonium in fixed bed in addition through analysis and comparison of breakthrough curves and fitting curves adam bohart model was more suitable for the adsorption behavior at the initial stage of adsorption 3 6 comparison of dynamic adsorption capacity of nh4 n onto different adsorbents to assess the dynamic adsorption performance of the mbc for nh4 n the adsorption performance of other low cost adsorbent materials for dynamic nh4 n removal was reviewed it could be seen from table 5 that the adsorption effect of sand as an adsorbent was low even after modified treatment while zeolite as a low cost adsorbent had the potential to remove nh4 n to a certain extent but compared with biochar the adsorption effect was still not ideal the modified peanut shell biochar in this study had a better adsorption performance and its mechanism had also been analyzed 4 conclusions the mbc obtained by modified peanut shell with koh and kmno4 had excellent pore structure large specific surface area and abundant oxygenic functional groups and the adsorptive performance was also significantly improved the chemical adsorptive mechanism of mbc to ammonium would work mainly including ion exchange surface complexation and electrostatic attraction while physical adsorption mechanism had little influence in the column experiment the bed height concentration of influent ammonium and flow rate affected the dynamic adsorption performance therefore the adsorption effect of fixed bed on ammonium could be improved by increasing the bed height and decreasing the flow rate in addition this study proved that the thomas model fitted well to the dynamic adsorption experimental data so the model could be used to predict the maximum adsorption capacity of the biochar fixed bed under similar conditions as this study therefore through the study on the mechanism of adsorption of ammonium by mbc and the experiment of fixed bed it had been proved that mbc was an effective adsorbent which had a promising prospect for the practical application of

13348,ammonium pollution caused by human activities threated to eco environment and the groundwater was polluted by rain and other leaching processes this study investigated the mechanism and dynamic adsorptive characteristic of ammonium nh4 n which removed by a novel modified biochar mbc pyrolyzed from peanut shell the maximum capacity of unmodified biochar bc and modified biochar mbc to ammonium absorption could reach 3 83 mg g and 6 92 mg g respectively indicating that modification would enhance the performance of the adsorbent analyzing a batch of experimental data it can be found that the isothermal absorption was suitable for sips model and the kinetic adsorption model suitable for quasi second order kinetic model indicating that the adsorptive rate was related to the amount of the adsorption site and dominated by monolayers chemisorption the characteristics of mbc before and after the process of adsorption showed that ion exchange electrostatic adsorption and surface complexation were the main factors controlling adsorptive capacity the dynamic removal performance of ammonium by mbc under different conditions was investigated by column experiments the experimental data of breakthrough curve fitted the thomas model well the maximum adsorptive capacity kth 5 28 10 3 l mg h and qe 9 02 mg g was obtained when the influent concentration reached 30 mg l the bed depth 2 1 cm and the inflow rate 1 ml min it can be concluded that the mbc was a promising adsorbent which can effectively remove ammonium from groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ammonium modified biochar water treatment fixed bed mechanism breakthrough curve 1 introduction at present ammonium pollution is mainly caused by contaminated land 1 agricultural nitrogen fertilizer 2 animal manure from animal husbandry 3 4 industrial waste residue such as electrolytic manganese residue 5 6 and other social activities in china ammonium in groundwater resources can make a threat to municipal water supplies when the ammonium content exceeds 0 5 mg l the efficiency of chlorinated drinking water was reduced 7 in addition ammonium is a precursor to reproductive toxicity and carcinogenic disinfected by products dpbs 8 therefore it is significant to stem the growing of ammonium pollution traditional methods for treating ammonium pollution in groundwater included membrane separation ion exchange 9 chemical precipitation 10 and microbiological methods 11 12 however these methods have a series of disadvantages such as high cost complex operation or low survival rate of microorganisms in practical applications adsorptive method is considered to be quick simple and effective 13 in the previous literature zeolite activated carbon clay mineral and other adsorbents have been extensively studied 14 17 however the application of these adsorbents was usually limited by the difficulties of the disposal process and the unavailability therefore the development of a low cost non secondary pollution and efficient adsorption material to remove ammonium from contaminated groundwater has become a research focus biochar a novel and green environmental adsorbent prepared from biological organisms by high temperature slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization 18 19 has attracted much attention in recent years due to its easy availability high adsorptive efficiency and low price 20 21 however unmodified biochar derived from maple wood 22 23 cacao shell 24 and coconut shell 25 have a relatively low adsorptive capacity respectively approximately 5 44 mg g nh4 n 2 26 mg g nh4 n and 0 87 mg g nh4 n therefore it is necessary to further study the modification technology of biochar to obtain more oxygen containing functional group structure and pore structure 26 27 and improve the adsorptive capacity b wang et al 22 and z wang et al 23 found that the maximum adsorption capacity of lacl3 modified biochar to nh4 was 10 1 mg g which was 1 9 times higher than that of unmodified biochar it might be related to the acid functional groups on biochar shang et al 28 modified the biochar derived from spruce wood chips by hno3 and na2co3 studying its adsorptive capacity and plant experiments were used to show that the biochar could be directly used as nitrogen fertilizer in soil after adsorption with several reports on the adsorptive performance of ammonium by modified biochar there are few studies on the mechanism of adsorption in addition the dynamic adsorptive performance used to be neglected kizito et al 29 believed that the investigation on the adsorption performance of fixed bed biochar filler could provide a feasible method for the effective utilization of the adsorbent and provide working condition parameters that are easy to be amplified for practical application therefore the study of dynamic adsorption behavior is of great significance for the practical application of adsorbed materials therefore this study was conducted to 1 illustrate the effect of modification on peanut shell biochar adsorption by a batch of experiments and the adsorption kinetics and isotherm 2 the adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the main mechanism of ammonium adsorption by mbc was discussed 3 the effects of influent concentration bed height and flow rate on ammonium removal in groundwater were studied by fixed bed column experiment moreover the prediction parameters were obtained through model simulation and the advantages of mbc dynamic adsorption properties were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of modified biochar adsorbent peanut shells were obtained from the local market in chongqing and the preparation method was according to predecessors of the research group 30 briefly peanut shell biochar bc was prepared by pyrolysis for 2 h under the conditions of inert nitrogen atmosphere heating rate of 10 c min and pyrolysis temperature of 500 c 5 0 g peanut shell biochar was mixed with 10 ml 0 76 kmno4 solution soaked fully for 4 h and dried in oven for 4 h then mixed with koh solid mass ratio of potassium hydroxide to biochar is 2 5 and heated for 1 h heating temperature is 300 c the carbonized product was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water until the rinsing liquid is ph neutral and dried finally the modified peanut shell biochar mbc was ground and sifted through 60 mesh sieve 2 2 batch adsorption experiment the effect of modification on the adsorption performance of peanut shell biochar was evaluated by isothermal adsorption the experiment was performed by treating 50 ml nh4 n solutions 10 30 45 60 80 and 100 mg l at mbc application amount was 0 1 g and bc application amount was 0 6 g respectively the initial ph of the series solution was controlled with 0 1 mol l of hcl and naoh to be 7 0 0 1 then the vials containing the solution and biochar were agitated for 24 h in a thermostatic oscillator of 30 c at 120 rpm after sampling the suspension was filtered with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and the equilibrium nh4 n concentration in solution was determined by salicylic acid spectrophotometry the kinetic studies of nh4 n on biochar were studied by adding 0 1 g mbc to 50 ml nh4 n solutions with an initial concentration of 30 mg l the following treatment and analysis were consistent with the isothermal adsorption experiment except that the sampling method was intermittent sampling within 24 h details of the adsorption kinetics and isotherm models were provided in the support information 2 3 dynamic adsorption experiment of fixed bed column the dynamic adsorption was carried out in a glass column fig 1 with 1 2 cm inner diameter and 10 cm height different bed heights were obtained by wet filling 0 6 g 0 8 g and 1 0 g mbc into the fixed bed column the corresponding heights were 2 1 cm 2 7 cm and 3 4 cm respectively after filling the column deionized water was soaked it in for 1 h to stabilize the column then ammonium solutions with initial concentrations of 30 mg l 45 mg l and 60 mg l were pumped into the fixed bed column at flow rates of 1 ml min 1 5 ml min and 2 ml min during the continuous experiment the effluent samples were collected and analyzed at regular intervals the breakthrough time defined as the effluent concentration reached 10 of the initial concentration the experiment continued until the effluent concentration reached 90 of the initial concentration which defined as exhaust time details of the fixed bed experimental apparatus structure and the dynamic adsorption kinetic model were provided in the supporting information 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate average values and standard deviations were calculated the origin pro 8 0 origin lab northampton ma usa was used to solve the model equation through linear regression analysis and to predict the breakthrough curve flow rate constant and relevant adsorption parameters under different operation conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of mbc 3 1 1 sem eds analysis the sem micrographs and corresponding eds spectrum of the mbc that treated and untreated with nh4 n solution were shown in fig 2 it could be seen that the surface of mbc was smooth with multiple voids and microporous fig 2a these well developed pores of miscellaneous shapes and sizes in mbc were attributed to the kmno4 and koh used in the modification process to improve the pore characteristics of biochar 31 a similar phenomenon had been reported in an s research 30 through modification small pores were combined to form large pores which would be resulted in the decrease of the average pore size the increase of pore volume and specific surface area 28 32 therefore the adsorption capacity of biochar could be improved by improving the porosity through chemical modification in addition it could be seen from fig 2c that material clusters appeared on the mbc surface after adsorption which indicated that adsorption might be related to complexation in fact subsequent analysis of the decrease in the content of oxygen containing functional groups on the mbc surface after adsorption also confirmed this statement it could be seen from the eds spectrum of mbc that the surface was dominated by c o and n elements and a large number of k and mn elements appear on the surface corresponding to the modification of kmno4 and koh in comparison with the eds spectrum of the mbc before fig 2b and after fig 2d ammonium adsorption a significant increase in n element occurred whereas mg al k and other elements decreased significantly this phenomenon could be explained by the exchange of cation on the surface of mbc with nh4 n in solution and then the cation was released into the aqueous solution and nh4 n was adsorbed on the mbc surface 3 1 2 ftir spectra characteristics analysis the complex reaction co precipitation reaction and ion exchange reaction in the adsorption mechanism are all related to the functional groups on the surface of the adsorption material 33 34 by measuring the infrared spectra before and after the adsorption of ammonium by biochar the changes of functional groups could be analyzed and the types and mechanisms of the interfacial reactions of biochar could be inferred as shown in fig 3 a the broad bands at approximately 3424 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl oh groups in the carboxyl

occurred in hemicellulose and lignin 31 the peak at 1400 cm 1 was caused by the bending vibrations of the hydroxyl oh groups 35 and the stretching vibration peak of co at 1105 cm 1 decreased obviously after adsorption 36 the peak observed around 1600 cm 1 was due to the stretching vibration of the cc double bond in the aromatic ring 36 on the other hand it could be observed from fig s2 that the modification of koh and kmno4 solutions successfully introduced the active oxygen containing functional groups of c h 2919 cm 1 and 2847 cm 1 and c o 1105 cm 1 into biochar the peak at 3424 cm 1 1579 cm 1 and 1400 cm 1 had been enhanced concluded with the above analysis the results were consistent with previous findings that the modification of alkaline solutions could increase the content of oxygen containing functional groups in biochar 31 it also could be seen from the infrared spectrum that the characteristic peaks at co cooh and oh had obvious displacement after adsorption which was

be adsorbed by mbc the o1s narrow xps scan spectrum fig 3c could be divided into three characteristic peaks c o 531 0 ev cooh 532 0 ev and oh 533 1 ev 38 after ammonium adsorption the characteristic peak of oh 533 1 ev was shifted to 532 9 ev fig 3c and e while the characteristic peak of cooh 532 0 ev was shifted to 531 8 ev and the relative strength was weakened in addition the relative strength of the characteristic peak 531 0 ev representing c o was significantly reduced the results showed that the oxygen containing functional groups c o oh and cooh were involved in adsorption process which was consistent with the above ftir analysis results 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherm study 3 2 1 adsorption isotherm the simulation parameters and fitting figures of the three models were shown in

would increase rapidly 3 4 2 effect of flow rate flow rate q is an important parameter in mbc dynamic adsorption evaluation the effect of flow rate was studied by changing flow rate at initial concentration of 30 mg l and bed depth of 3 4 cm it could be seen from fig 5b that the experimental breakthrough time of flow rate 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 ml min was 190 110 and 91 min and the exhaust time was 420 220 and 196 min respectively in addition table s1 showed that with the increase of the flow rate the removal rate of ammonium decreased correspondingly which were 77 3 72 9 and 72 8 respectively it could be concluded that when the flow rate was relatively small the adsorption time of ammonium by mbc became longer which increased the amount of ammonium that could be dispersed to the effective active sites in the pores of mbc and enhanced the adsorption efficiency of biochar to ammonium conversely the higher the flow rate the shorter the contact time between the ammonium in the solution and the active site of mbc therefore the ammonium was taken away before it could be adsorbed and the adsorption was in equilibrium ahead of time 45 47 hence in practical application the balance between adsorption effect and adsorption time could be controlled by adjusting the flow rate to achieve the best treatment efficiency 3 4 3 effect of bed height effect of bed height z on breakthrough curve was studied under the condition of initial concentration of 30 mg l and flow rate of 1 ml min by changing the amount of biochar applied to change the height of fixed bed the results could be seen from fig 5c that the experimental breakthrough time of bed height 2 1 2 7 and 3 4 cm was 100 140 and 190 min and the exhaust time was 240 280 and 340 min respectively from table s1 with the increase of mbc the corresponding total ammonium adsorption amount increased from 5 14 mg to 7 89 mg the above results could be explained that with the increase of filling height the residence time of ammonium solution in the fixed bed also become longer and the contact degree with mbc was more sufficient so the removal efficiency would increase correspondingly 47 the increase of filling height also meant that more active adsorption sites could be provided for adsorbates in addition the breakthrough time and exhaust time increased with the increase of bed height which was attributed to the increase of mass transfer area although the exhaust time increased with the increase of bed height the time between breakthrough time and exhaust time of different bed heights was approximately the same which indicated that the range of unsaturated zone was basically unchanged 48 3 5 breakthrough curves modeling mathematical models are often used to describe the analysis of laboratory scale dynamic column adsorption studies the basic law of dynamic adsorption of adsorption materials could be obtained through the column experiment and then appropriate dynamic adsorption model could be established and simulated according to the specific experimental results the calculated model parameters could provide guidance for the large scale application of adsorption engineering and the practical application design of fixed bed therefore adam bohart and thomas model were used in this study to fit the dynamic adsorption data so as to identify the best model that could describe the dynamic column adsorption behavior and obtain the corresponding fitting parameters the adam bohart model fitting parameters for the breakthrough curve under different experimental conditions were shown in table 4 it could be seen that the adam bohart model had a good fitting degree r2 0 94 to the experimental results indicating that the adam bohart model could predict the adsorption breakthrough of ammonium on mbc to a certain extent moreover we found that the values of the adsorption rate constant kab of the adam bohart model were very small and basically maintained the same order of magnitude the parameter kab decreased with the increase of the flow rate and increased with the increase of the height of the packing layer these results indicated that the dynamic adsorption kinetics of fixed bed system was controlled by external mass transfer 29 the fitting parameters of the thomas model for the breakthrough curve of ammonium adsorption by mbc under different experimental conditions were shown in table 4 it was obvious that the thomas model had a good fitting degree r2 0 97 to experimental results which meant that the model could describe the adsorption breakthrough of mbc to ammonium and predict the adsorption capacity of mbc to ammonium in addition it could be seen from table 4 when the influent initial concentration was constant the adsorption rate constant k th increased with the increase of flow rate and decreased with the increase of bed height this was mainly due to the height of the mass transfer zone and the difference in solid liquid contact time by comparing the r2 values thomas model was more suitable than adam bohart model to describe the overall adsorption behavior of mbc to ammonium in fixed bed in addition through analysis and comparison of breakthrough curves and fitting curves adam bohart model was more suitable for the adsorption behavior at the initial stage of adsorption 3 6 comparison of dynamic adsorption capacity of nh4 n onto different adsorbents to assess the dynamic adsorption performance of the mbc for nh4 n the adsorption performance of other low cost adsorbent materials for dynamic nh4 n removal was reviewed it could be seen from table 5 that the adsorption effect of sand as an adsorbent was low even after modified treatment while zeolite as a low cost adsorbent had the potential to remove nh4 n to a certain extent but compared with biochar the adsorption effect was still not ideal the modified peanut shell biochar in this study had a better adsorption performance and its mechanism had also been analyzed 4 conclusions the mbc obtained by modified peanut shell with koh and kmno4 had excellent pore structure large specific surface area and abundant oxygenic functional groups and the adsorptive performance was also significantly improved the chemical adsorptive mechanism of mbc to ammonium would work mainly including ion exchange surface complexation and electrostatic attraction while physical adsorption mechanism had little influence in the column experiment the bed height concentration of influent ammonium and flow rate affected the dynamic adsorption performance therefore the adsorption effect of fixed bed on ammonium could be improved by increasing the bed height and decreasing the flow rate in addition this study proved that the thomas model fitted well to the dynamic adsorption experimental data so the model could be used to predict the maximum adsorption capacity of the biochar fixed bed under similar conditions as this study therefore through the study on the mechanism of adsorption of ammonium by mbc and the experiment of fixed bed it had been proved that mbc was an effective adsorbent which had a promising prospect for the practical application of

13349,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria anaob are beneficial for the treatment of nh4 n and no2 n simultaneously in sewage waste these bacteria form particles by secreting or capturing substances such as extracellular polymeric substances eps which adsorb harmful ions with the help of charge adsorption and complexation to protect the growth of anaob however the substrate also has an electric charge and the effect of eps on the adsorption and mass transfer of nh4 n and no2 n remains to be elucidated in this study we investigated the adsorption effect of eps from anaob on different substrates by using a mathematical model and determined the possible role of eps in bacterial growth eps proteins which were extracted using the ultrasound method and detected by proteomics were consistent with the proteins involved in the anammox reaction in cells the detection models to calculate the adsorption capacity were established in accordance with the dialysis principle both the freundlich model and langmuir model were used to explain the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps proteins compared with the adsorption of nh4 n by eps that of no2 n by eps was well fitted in the

in the wastewater denitrification treatment extracellular polymeric substances eps are either secreted by anaob or formed outside the bacteria s extracellular environment 1 these substances are composed of proteins polysaccharides lipids and nucleic acids and form a biopolymeric mesh or matrix in which anaob are embedded these mesh like structures are conducive to the growth of these bacteria as they provide structural and functional support 2 3 the content of protein is higher than that of polysaccharides in the mature granular sludge 4 7 eps have been considered a by product and a nutrient source however a few studies have proposed the hypothesis that anaob secrete eps for their growth 8 9 therefore regardless of the bacterial growth stage and presence of granular sludge nh4 n and no2 n must pass through eps before denitrification eps can adsorb various ions such as zn2 cu2 and cd2 in a solution based on the surface charge of different groups such as oh cooh and amino groups according to the amount of proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids 10 11 these groups bind to metallic ions and non metallic ions through van der waals interactions hydrogen bonds covalent bonds complexation and polymerisation 12 21 a few hydrophilic groups particularly carboxyl groups have also been found on eps and are also the adsorption sites 11 22 with an increase in the levels of metal ions these bacteria can also increase their eps content which can function as a physical barrier and confer protection to the bacteria 23 some studies have shown that eps proteins contain extracellular enzymes which have a strong correlation and homology with intracellular proteins 22 24 these intracellular proteins can bind and store nh4 n and no2 n to a certain extent although the amount of adsorption has not been determined 25 26 the formation of these adsorption bonds and the mechanism underlying eps function are still unclear which has led to differences in the findings of studies reporting the role of eps 5 6 27 some studies have attempted to analyse nh4 n adsorption by eps from different sludge samples bassin 28 discussed the adsorption of nh4 n in aerobic granular sludge activated sludge and anaerobic ammonia oxidation granules and found that anammox granules have the lowest adsorption capacity of 0 2 mg nh4 n gvss which is much lower than that of aerobic granular sludge 1 7 mg nh4 n gvss in nature environment nh4 n is relatively easy to obtain while no2 n is the intermediate product of nitrification which is not easy to accumulate the characteristics of anammox determine that nh4 n and no2 n must pass through eps to enter anaob for further denitrification on the other hand the adsorption of no2 n is still questionable whether a significant difference exists between the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by proteins and polysaccharides of eps remains unclear proteins and polysaccharides in the eps samples used in these studies were not separated therefore the effective components of eps responsible for the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n remain to be explored generally the components of eps can be extracted through different methods such as chemical treatment heating centrifugation ultrasonic treatment and ion exchange chromatography 7 29 32 chemical reagents that are commonly used include h2so4 naoh and edta 2 33 34 although proteins and polysaccharides can be extracted together by using these methods some of these methods destroy the bacterial cells and proteins in the process of dna and cytoplasm extraction 35 38 hence investigating the role of a single component of the eps in terms of its adsorption and mass transfer of substrates is difficult when these extraction methods are employed 39 moreover different extraction processes yield different eps components in different concentrations and because of the lack of sufficient analytical methods for determining the diverse polysaccharides that constitute eps the corresponding colorimetric results are not accurate 32 40 to the best of our knowledge a standard method for extracting only a single eps component from anaob has not been recognised therefore in this study we developed an ultrasonic extraction method to extract eps proteins by using a dialysis based purification method which does not require the addition of any chemical we further explored the adsorption effect of the purified eps protein on nh4 n and no2 n and calculated the adsorbed amount by using the dialysis membrane method by constructing and verifying the calculus mathematical models combined with a dialysis model we calculated the adsorbed amount and analysed the optimal adsorption conditions and possible adsorption principles the objectives of this study are i to extract the eps components by using the ultrasonic method ii to establish a method to calculate the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps through a dialysis model and iii to investigate the isothermal adsorption model the main purpose of ultrasonic extraction was to extract eps proteins to provide methodological guidance for follow up studies 2 methods and materials 2 1 dialysis membrane pre treatment regenerated cellulose membranes md44 3500 viskase usa purchased online were used as dialysis membranes and the core experimental material in this research the membrane manufacturer specified that the amount of protein adsorbed by per gram of the membrane was 1 ng and the total weight of a 5 m dialysis membrane was 17 5 g thus the maximum amount of absorbable protein for a 20 cm dialysis membrane was 0 7 ng the dialysis membranes were boiled for 10 min in 2 w v sodium bicarbonate and 1 mmol l edta at ph 8 then they were thoroughly washed with anaerobic ammonia free deionised water which was boiled sealed naturally cooled and aerated with nitrogen for 15 20 min thereafter the membranes were boiled for another 10 min in edta solution the dialysis membranes were not touched manually once cooled the membranes were immersed in anaerobic ammonia free deionised water and stored at 4 c in a sealed container 2 2 extraction of eps components the eps components were extracted through ultrasonic centrifugation the sludge was taken from the uasb anammox reactor which had been running steadily for more than 12 months and the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the reactor were 350 mgn l and 420 mgn l respectively the obtained sludge was centrifuged at 3000 rpm min for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded phosphate buffer solution ph 8 was then added to soak the sludge for 2 h at 30 c 35 c then the mixture was centrifuged again at 3000 rpm min for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded afterwards the substrate was assumed to have been totally removed then 15 ml of sludge was taken and was mixed with the same volume of anaerobic ammonia free deionised water the sludge mixture was then sealed in an ultrasonic generator and sonicated for 30 min at 40 khz and 30 c and then the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm min the supernatant was extracted using needle tubes and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to obtain the eps after determining the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides any sample containing dna was discarded then the eps were subsequently pre treated for protein dialysis the eps retained in the filter membrane were placed in the dialysis membrane two pre treated glass beads were added and the membrane was then sealed and placed in anaerobic ammonia free deionised water for dialysis the anaerobic ammonia free deionised water was replaced 3 h later and this process was performed twice the eps solution was then stored at 20 c 41 prior to measuring the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides the sample was placed in a cold water 0 c bath 2 3 proteomic analysis and high throughput detection the extracted eps were subjected to dialysis to remove polysaccharides and impurities and frozen at 80 c then it was sent to sangon biotech shanghai co ltd hereinafter referred to as the company covered with dry ice for proteomic analysis after removing the substrates the granular sludge was sent to the company for high throughput detection to analyse the bacterial genus composition the company performed all the relevant experiments used their own reagents and instruments and provided test reports 2 4 establishment of the adsorption model and verification of calculation adsorption through dialysis has been proposed as an indirect method for detecting the adsorption effect of eps on the test substrates previous experiments have demonstrated that when nh4 n and no2 n the concentrations of which were determined through spectrophotometry are directly mixed with eps the concentration is the same as that of the substrate solution therefore the directly analysis of whether eps adsorbed the substrate was impossible according to the law of conservation of substances the substrates were adsorbed by eps and were then dialysed into the external environment dialysis curves were used to fit the dialysis values and the method of indirect calculation of adsorption capacity was used in this study the calculations for dialysis curves assume that the initial content of a substrate in the dialysis membrane is n0 and the solute passes through the dialysis membrane in the presence of water according to the law of conservation of substances if the external conditions do not change the sum of the amount of substrate inside and outside the dialysis membrane at any time point is n0 the dialysis equation assumes the following 1 at a temperature of 20 c 35 c the dialysis rate is only related to the concentration difference between the dialysate inside and outside the dialysis membrane and the dialysis constant remains constant and is only related to the type of the substrate 2 water molecules can freely permeate dialysis membranes at a temperature of 20 c 35 c the rate of water molecules permeating the dialysis membranes is only related to the nature of the membrane at any time point the water molecules from inside to outside is equal to the water molecules from outside to inside of this system 3 substrates permeate dialysis membranes under the action of water molecules and when the substance enters the external solution it will mix evenly with the external solution the formula can be described in differential forms as eqs 1 and 2 1 d n d t k n inside n outside 2 d n d t k n 0 n v n nv 3 no nt 1 n n 0 n 1 n dn 0 t 1 k nv dt 4 ln n n 0 n 1 n t n n 0 n 1 n 0 n 1 k t 1 nv after calculation eq 5 is obtained 5 n t n 0 n 1 e n 1 k t 1 nv n according to hypothesis 1 the dialysis rate can be expressed as the amount of substrates inside and outside the membrane hence the dialysis eq 2 can be simplified into eq 6 when the volume inside and outside of the dialysis membrane is equal after calculation eqs 7 and 8 are obtained 6 d n d t k n 0 n n 7 n t n 0 2 e 2 k t 2 1 8 n ad n con 2 e 2 k con t 2 1 n eps 2 e 2 k eps t 2 1 where ninside and noutside are the substrate contents inside and outside of the dialysis membrane dn dt is the rate of substance passing through the membrane k is the dialysis constant of the substance v and nv are the volumes of the solution inside and outside the dialysis membrane with a ratio of n nt is the amount of external dialysis membrane substrates at time t1 n0 is the amount of substrate in the dialysis membrane nad is the adsorption capacity ncon equals neps both of which represent the substrate subjected to experimentation kcon and keps are k values for dialysis curves of the fitted pure substrate and fitted eps adsorption substrate and t1 and t2 are the adsorption time in theory when the external conditions remain unchanged the concentration of the substrate in the dialysate on both sides is n0 2 the volume of the solution inside and outside is vin vout 2 indicating that both sides of the dialysis membrane are in equilibrium therefore for a single dialysis system and to facilitate calculation application of the same volumes for both sides of the dialysis membrane is easy as long as the concentration of the solution inside the dialysis membrane is known and the volumes on both sides of the membrane are equal the substrate content can be calculated at any time point by using formulae 7 and 8 to prove that the eps adsorption model and the dialysis membrane method are suitable for the dialysis experiment we prepared 25 mgn l 50 mgn l and 100 mgn l nh4 and no2 solutions the dialysis experiment was then performed using 40 ml samples of each substrate solution the external dialysate was anaerobic ammonia free deionised water 40 ml at 25 c the k value obtained was the constant of self dialysis of nh4 n and no2 n which was related to only the temperature and substrate 2 5 adsorption experiment a reserve solution of approximately 100 mgn l nh4 n and no2 n was prepared the bottom of the pre treatment dialysis membrane was clamped with a plastic clamp and then eps was added the solution inside the dialysis membrane was diluted with the reserve solution and anaerobic ammonia free deionised water to make up the volume to 40 ml and the substrate concentrations were 2 5 mgn l 5 mgn l 12 5 mgn l 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l the ph of the solution was adjusted with 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh the volume of the external solution was the same as that of the dialysis membrane 40 ml two treated glass beads were added inside the dialysis membrane and the seal was clamped with the same plastic clamp at the top to immerse the dialysis membrane in the external dialysate the dialysis system was placed at 25 c for dialysis and the concentration of the substrates in the external dialysate was determined 5 times every 1 h then the adsorption amount of the substrates at a certain eps content was calculated using formula 8 kcon and keps were the same for this formula the experimental conditions were determined according to the orthogonal experiment results as shown in supplementary materials 2 6 isothermal adsorption models the isothermal adsorption model is a simple model for quantifying the adsorption process it is used to describe the relationship between the adsorption amount and liquid substrate concentration when the adsorption process of eps molecules reaches equilibrium at a certain temperature the most commonly used model consists of the langmuir and freundlich equations 13 14 given as follows q i k if c i n i q i γ max k il c i 1 k il c i where qi is the adsorption amount of substance i mg g gvss ci is the concentration of the substance mgn l kif is the freundlich constant g gvss l ni is the freundlich index kil is the langmuir constant g gvss l which denotes that the attraction of all surface sites to the adsorbent is constant and γmax denotes the total number of surface sites per unit mass of adsorbent which is ideally equal for all the adsorbents in reality different compounds have different γmax therefore this parameter usually denotes the maximum surface concentration of a given compound i where γmax equals ci max the freundlich equation can better describe the adsorption of extracellular proteins whereas the langmuir equation can better describe the adsorption of polysaccharides 42 43 moreover the amount of eps added in the first experiment was 4 359 mg and the same amount was used in all orthogonal experiments the eps content of adsorption and desorption experiments was different multiples of 4 359 mg 1 1 5 and 2 times respectively parallel experiments were performed with different amounts of substrates for each eps solution in each case the total volume of substrates in the dialysis membrane was 40 ml which was achieved by adding anaerobic ammonia free deionised water as required the experimental conditions were set to simulate the natural environment and a suitable environment for the growth of anaob in sewage treatment plants 3 results 3 1 species composition and eps proteomics analysis the reactor had been under stable operation for more than 12 months the bacterial composition of granular sludge was analysed through high throughput detection the sludge was extracted from the bottom of the reactor by using a peristaltic pump according to the sludge growth cycle granular sludge was collected for high throughput detection at approximately every 2 months combined with our previous study as shown in the fig 1 the average content of anaob candidatus kuenenia was between 59 89 44 and 67 56 and the proportion of the largest anaob content increased by nearly 7 the anaob in the reactor were mainly candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis a total of 28 proteins with wide homology were detected through eps proteomics table 1 presents the proteins related to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis strains however other unknown proteins are not listed the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides and dna in the extracted eps were detected after mixing each time the protein content was 66 67 8 22 mg gvss 496 91 61 26 mg l in solution and the polysaccharide content was 0 32 0 06 mg gvss 2 40 0 48 mg l in solution the concentrations of protein extracted in this study were not compared with those reported in other studies 22 43 45 when different sludge pre treatments that is naoh or cation exchange resin are used to extract eps the total amount of resulting eps varies and a considerable amount of dna is obtained 46 dna represents the extent of cell damage to a certain extent therefore the samples containing dna were discarded in this study and less than one tenth samples were found to contain dna therefore the ultrasound extraction method for extracting eps did not destroy the anaob cells and the proteins were detected in the eps layer the proteomics included a protein isoelectric point pi the pi of hzs α was 6 02 and that of hzs γ was 6 08 however the pi of other proteins was greater than 7 5 between 7 77 and 9 47 the pi of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase was 9 37 and that of another unknown anaerobic protein was 9 47 eps proteins in the solution were mostly in a positive state that tend to adsorb no2 n and reject nh4 n because the ph 7 5 of the mixed solution for substrate adsorption was less than the pi of the protein moreover a previous study showed that eps can undergo protonation under acidic conditions which causes a decrease in negative charges and thus eps tend to be positively charged 38 another study showed that proteins and polysaccharides adsorb different ions 15 in this study the main substance extracted using the ultrasonic method was protein and the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps was found to be equivalent to the adsorption of proteins by eps 3 2 verification of the substrates adsorption model results of the dialysis experiment for nh4 n and no2 n were analysed through analysis of variance assuming α 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 f values obtained for each substrate concentration were greater than the critical values at all levels of significance thus the dialysis constants of nh4 n and no2 n could be calculated using the adsorption substrate model with high confidence by comparing the values of each parameter and experimental errors the substrate concentration and k values for subsequent experiments were selected and are shown in fig 2 for nh4 n at a concentration of 55 00 mgn l the endpoints measured were slightly more than 50 of the initial substrate concentration as shown in fig 2 a as shown in fig 2 c when the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were 27 667 1 24 mgn l and 114 67 1 37 mgn l some detection values at 12 h and 24 h were lower than the theoretical values combined with the final experimental results the dialysis experiment with a substrate concentration of 55 00 0 65 mgn l was more stable and the amount of substrate measured at 9 h was close to the theoretical value thus the amount of residual substrate at 9 h was used to fit the dialysis curve table 2 for no2 n even though the measured endpoint of 52 91 mgn l was different from that of the fitting curve this value was much closer to 50 of the substrate concentration fig 2 b as shown in fig 2 d when the concentration of no2 n was 26 45 0 62 mgn l a large deviation was seen after 24 h on the other hand when the concentration of no2 n was 108 45 0 85 mgn l the concentration gap between inside and outside of the dialysis membrane was large which expedited the dialysis process furthermore the f value was much smaller than 52 91 0 72 mgn l therefore the amount of residual substrate at 12 h was used to fit the dialysis curve 3 3 isothermal adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps proteins 3 3 1 isothermal adsorption the adsorption conditions were determined through orthogonal experiments and the details are given in supplementary materials by fixing the dialysis temperature at 25 c and varying the eps content and substrate concentrations adsorption detection tests were performed the highest concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n used were 51 64 1 34 mgn l and 54 62 1 73 mgn l respectively the adsorption capacity of eps with respect to nh4 n 51 64 mgn l was the highest at ph 7 the adsorption capacity calculated with 4 359 mg of eps was 5 29 0 15 mgn g gvss under similar conditions the increase in the adsorption capacity was small when high eps dosages 6 538 mg and 8 717 mg were used as shown in fig 3 the adsorption capacity of eps with respect to no2 n 54 17 1 32 mgn l was the highest at ph 6 5 and with 4 359 mg of eps the unit adsorption amount of no2 n for eps was 46 51 1 27 mgn g gvss which was much larger than that of nh4 n under various conditions the average amount of no2 n adsorbed by eps was 6 57 0 41 of the initial amount which was 6 6 times the adsorbed amount of nh4 n compared with the same eps amount and substrate concentration the adsorption capacity of no2 n per unit of eps was 3 1 5 6 times the adsorption capacity of nh4 n even when the concentration of no2 n was low 3 3 2 freundlich isothermal adsorption model fitted results of the freundlich model for nh4 n and no2 n were analysed using the regression analysis under the conditions of α 0 01 α 0 05 and α 0 1 as shown in table 3 the freundlich model data for adsorption of nh4 n by eps showed that the f value was greater than the f critical value in each case and the p value was 0 01 with eps addition amounts of 4 359 mg and 6 538 mg with an eps addition amount of 8 717 mg the p value was 0 05 generally adsorption is the result of the simultaneous action of various adsorption mechanisms the results fitting with a certain adsorption model were the results of this model fig 4 and mainly determined by the adsorption mechanism of this model under specified conditions 38 as shown in table 3 the r2 value of the freundlich model for the adsorption of nh4 n by eps was 0 892 0 964 and ni was 1 on the one hand with an increase in the concentration of nh4 n in the eps solution the eps free energy of nh4 n adsorption was decreased and the adsorption effect was weakened on the other hand with an increase in the eps content the ni value decreased the faster the rate at which the ni value decreased the quicker was the rate at which the free energy of eps was weakened and consequently the adsorption effect of eps on nh4 n decreased the calculated amount of nh4 n adsorbed per unit of eps decreased not only because the additional eps had no adsorbing effect but also because the amount of nh4 n adsorbed per unit decreased significantly with an increase in the amount of eps added considering the actual amount of nh4 n adsorbed by eps there were a few sites that could have participated in the adsorption process because eps had more positive charges and had mostly adsorbed nh4 n through van der waals forces because of charge exclusion only a small amount of nh4 n could be adsorbed the high content of eps weakened the adsorption of nh4 n thereby contradicting the multiple adsorption site hypothesis of the freundlich model although the f value of the regression analysis was larger than the critical value the model was not suitable for elucidating the adsorption mechanism of eps proteins with respect to nh4 n the r2 values of the freundlich model for adsorption of no2 n by eps were all greater than 0 99 and the f value expression equation was highly significant although ni was 1 it was closer to 1 in comparison to the corresponding values for nh4 n after eps adsorbed no2 n the free energy was reduced and the degree of reduction was much slower than that for adsorption of nh4 n with an increase in the eps content ni for no2 n increased indicating that the total adsorbed amount could be increased by adding additional eps as was confirmed by the experimental data according to the multiple adsorption site hypothesis of the freundlich isothermal adsorption equation each potential site plays a role in the adsorption of no2 n adsorption by 6 538 mg and 8 717 mg of eps was slightly higher than that by 4 359 mg of eps indicating that the adsorption of no2 n increases to some extent with addition of more eps an increase in the availability of eps would have facilitated the acquisition of no2 n by the bacteria this finding may explain why anaob continue to secrete eps after aggregating into granules from a possible perspective in our study eps not only kept the bacterial granules stable and increased the surface area for bacterial growth but also helped the bacterial cells in obtaining and even storing no2 n 3 3 3 langmuir isothermal adsorption model unlike the freundlich isothermal adsorption equation kil assumes that all surface sites have the same attraction to the adsorbent some groups of eps exhibit charges opposite to those of nh4 n and no2 n and according to this hypothesis these groups have the same attraction towards nh4 n and no2 n in addition the greater the value of kil the stronger is the adsorption capacity of the substrates as mentioned previously γmax equals to ci max which represents the maximum surface concentration of compound i and the maximum adsorption concentration for kil the larger the equilibrium constant of the adsorption reaction the more is the number of sites at which the substance can adsorb when the adsorption capacity of many substances are the same the fitting results are shown in fig 5 and table 4 the fitting results of the langmuir model for nh4 n and no2 n were analysed through regression analysis assuming α 0 01 α 0 05 and α 0 1 respectively based on the langmuir model results for adsorption of nh4 n by eps f values were always higher than the corresponding critical values and the p value was 0 01 with 4 359 mg and 8 717 mg of eps the p value was 0 05 for no2 n the f value for the addition of eps far exceeded the corresponding f critical value and the p value was 0 01 thus the langmuir model was suitable for explaining the amount of nh4 n and no2 n adsorbed by eps the langmuir model fitting results for nh4 n showed that r2 varied between 0 762 and 0 966 and the maximum adsorption concentration was only 4 05 mgn l which is notably different compared with the experimental values thus combined with the hypothesis of the langmuir model when the nh4 n content was higher than 4 05 mgn l additional nh4 n was not adsorbed by the eps however for no2 n all r2 values were greater than 0 995 which indicated a significant correlation ci max values for no2 n were far greater than those for nh4 n however the reaction equilibrium constants were smaller the results showed that an increase in the eps content facilitates the adsorption of no2 n indicating that the maximum surface area for adsorption and amount of adsorbed substrate increase with the addition of more eps 4 discussion strous genomic studies on k stuttgartiensis showed that none of the enzymes can catalyse the reduction of no2 to nh2oh however the genomic sequence of cd1 nitrite reductase nirs was found to catalyse the reduction of no2 to no 47 in this study nitrite reductase hydrazine hydrolase or hydrazine dehydrogenase were not detected in eps because anammox occurs in the anammoxsome it can be considered that nitrite reductase hydrazine hydrolase and hydrazine dehydrogenase exist only in the anammoxsome in addition bacterial ferritin hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and hydrazine synthase were found to exist not only in the anammoxsome but also in the external environment of cells as eps proteins they have also been shown to participate in the transmission of substrates through adsorption by the eps layer and they may also participate in the electron transfer with cytochromes 48 49 moreover because only a small amount of dna was extracted eps proteins can be considered to be produced by anaob secreted into the external environment and then connected to cells through polysaccharides or lipids hence they could be treated as a type of bio adsorbent to auxiliary obtained substrates for anammox a previous study showed that proteins are associated with multivalent cation binding in an anammox biofilm 31 this research extended the effect of eps proteins on the substrate at low substrate concentrations the langmuir and freundlich models dominated the overall isothermal adsorption type when kil ci max is 1 substances are generally adsorbed in this study kil ci max values were 1 these results indicated that for the range of substrate concentrations tested eps generally function as an adsorbent however some differences were observed between the fitting results of langmuir model and the experimental results firstly with a fixed amount of eps the maximum adsorption capacity with respect to nh4 n and no2 n increased with an increase in the substrate concentration the maximum adsorption concentration for nh4 n was greater than the fitted values of ci max nh4 for no2 n the maximum adsorption concentration did not reach the values of ci max no2 the adsorbed amount of nh4 n increased slightly even when more eps or high concentrations of eps were added in contrast for no2 n the adsorption continued to increase secondly the langmuir and freundlich models both fitted the adsorption of no2 n by eps well under the experimental conditions used in this study in the regression analysis of the adsorption of nh4 n by eps p values ranged between 0 01 and 0 05 which was not observed in case of no2 n considering the mechanism the attraction of eps multiple adsorption sites was equal based on the freundlich model and all surface sites to the adsorbate were constant based on the langmuir model for nh4 n and no2 n yet the langmuir model was not suitable for explaining the adsorption of nh4 n by eps the surface charge of a protein can be determined on the basis of proteomics data the multiple adsorption sites include charged groups and structural adsorption sites because proteins are mostly positively charged nh4 n is repulsed and the amount of nh4 n that can be adsorbed by negatively charged proteins is reduced groups with positive charges that can directly bind with no2 n and the sites with positive charges within the structure of eps proteins display different attraction properties with respect to no2 n these groups more easily adsorb no2 n in the natural environment nh4 n is obtained through a wide range of sources and no2 n can be oxidised by nh4 n however as an intermediate unstable product of nitration reaction no2 n is easy to be nitrated into no3 which makes the acquisition of nh4 n easier and that of no2 n relatively difficult from the environment for anaob from the perspective of no2 n adsorption by eps proteins anaob can obtain no2 n by secreting positively charged eps proteins to ensure their growth which may be an important role of eps in this study we explored the extraction of eps by using the ultrasonic method and investigated the adsorption of substrates by eps we suggest that the microscopic effects of eps on anaob should be further studied in combination with the adsorption effect from the following perspective whether proteins enter the cell body as carriers after adsorbing substrates how do these adsorbent proteins generate directional movement outside cells and whether a certain amount of no2 n can be reduced outside the cell first we are currently analysing the species and distribution of eps proteins 5 conclusion in this study we extracted specifically the eps proteins by employing the ultrasonic method proteomics detection proved that eps proteins extracted using this method can effectively maintain the integrity of anaob and prevent the degradation of eps proteins by chemicals the dialysis membrane method can also be used to effectively calculate the amount of substrates adsorbed by eps with a dialysis model freundlich and langmuir isothermal adsorption models were used to fit the adsorption capacity of eps on nh4 n and no2 n and the adsorption results showed that eps proteins exert obvious adsorption and preservation effects on no2 n credit authorship contribution statement liang qiao

13349,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria anaob are beneficial for the treatment of nh4 n and no2 n simultaneously in sewage waste these bacteria form particles by secreting or capturing substances such as extracellular polymeric substances eps which adsorb harmful ions with the help of charge adsorption and complexation to protect the growth of anaob however the substrate also has an electric charge and the effect of eps on the adsorption and mass transfer of nh4 n and no2 n remains to be elucidated in this study we investigated the adsorption effect of eps from anaob on different substrates by using a mathematical model and determined the possible role of eps in bacterial growth eps proteins which were extracted using the ultrasound method and detected by proteomics were consistent with the proteins involved in the anammox reaction in cells the detection models to calculate the adsorption capacity were established in accordance with the dialysis principle both the freundlich model and langmuir model were used to explain the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps proteins compared with the adsorption of nh4 n by eps that of no2 n by eps was well fitted in the

in the wastewater denitrification treatment extracellular polymeric substances eps are either secreted by anaob or formed outside the bacteria s extracellular environment 1 these substances are composed of proteins polysaccharides lipids and nucleic acids and form a biopolymeric mesh or matrix in which anaob are embedded these mesh like structures are conducive to the growth of these bacteria as they provide structural and functional support 2 3 the content of protein is higher than that of polysaccharides in the mature granular sludge 4 7 eps have been considered a by product and a nutrient source however a few studies have proposed the hypothesis that anaob secrete eps for their growth 8 9 therefore regardless of the bacterial growth stage and presence of granular sludge nh4 n and no2 n must pass through eps before denitrification eps can adsorb various ions such as zn2 cu2 and cd2 in a solution based on the surface charge of different groups such as oh cooh and amino groups according to the amount of proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids 10 11 these groups bind to metallic ions and non metallic ions through van der waals interactions hydrogen bonds covalent bonds complexation and polymerisation 12 21 a few hydrophilic groups particularly carboxyl groups have also been found on eps and are also the adsorption sites 11 22 with an increase in the levels of metal ions these bacteria can also increase their eps content which can function as a physical barrier and confer protection to the bacteria 23 some studies have shown that eps proteins contain extracellular enzymes which have a strong correlation and homology with intracellular proteins 22 24 these intracellular proteins can bind and store nh4 n and no2 n to a certain extent although the amount of adsorption has not been determined 25 26 the formation of these adsorption bonds and the mechanism underlying eps function are still unclear which has led to differences in the findings of studies reporting the role of eps 5 6 27 some studies have attempted to analyse nh4 n adsorption by eps from different sludge samples bassin 28 discussed the adsorption of nh4 n in aerobic granular sludge activated sludge and anaerobic ammonia oxidation granules and found that anammox granules have the lowest adsorption capacity of 0 2 mg nh4 n gvss which is much lower than that of aerobic granular sludge 1 7 mg nh4 n gvss in nature environment nh4 n is relatively easy to obtain while no2 n is the intermediate product of nitrification which is not easy to accumulate the characteristics of anammox determine that nh4 n and no2 n must pass through eps to enter anaob for further denitrification on the other hand the adsorption of no2 n is still questionable whether a significant difference exists between the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by proteins and polysaccharides of eps remains unclear proteins and polysaccharides in the eps samples used in these studies were not separated therefore the effective components of eps responsible for the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n remain to be explored generally the components of eps can be extracted through different methods such as chemical treatment heating centrifugation ultrasonic treatment and ion exchange chromatography 7 29 32 chemical reagents that are commonly used include h2so4 naoh and edta 2 33 34 although proteins and polysaccharides can be extracted together by using these methods some of these methods destroy the bacterial cells and proteins in the process of dna and cytoplasm extraction 35 38 hence investigating the role of a single component of the eps in terms of its adsorption and mass transfer of substrates is difficult when these extraction methods are employed 39 moreover different extraction processes yield different eps components in different concentrations and because of the lack of sufficient analytical methods for determining the diverse polysaccharides that constitute eps the corresponding colorimetric results are not accurate 32 40 to the best of our knowledge a standard method for extracting only a single eps component from anaob has not been recognised therefore in this study we developed an ultrasonic extraction method to extract eps proteins by using a dialysis based purification method which does not require the addition of any chemical we further explored the adsorption effect of the purified eps protein on nh4 n and no2 n and calculated the adsorbed amount by using the dialysis membrane method by constructing and verifying the calculus mathematical models combined with a dialysis model we calculated the adsorbed amount and analysed the optimal adsorption conditions and possible adsorption principles the objectives of this study are i to extract the eps components by using the ultrasonic method ii to establish a method to calculate the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps through a dialysis model and iii to investigate the isothermal adsorption model the main purpose of ultrasonic extraction was to extract eps proteins to provide methodological guidance for follow up studies 2 methods and materials 2 1 dialysis membrane pre treatment regenerated cellulose membranes md44 3500 viskase usa purchased online were used as dialysis membranes and the core experimental material in this research the membrane manufacturer specified that the amount of protein adsorbed by per gram of the membrane was 1 ng and the total weight of a 5 m dialysis membrane was 17 5 g thus the maximum amount of absorbable protein for a 20 cm dialysis membrane was 0 7 ng the dialysis membranes were boiled for 10 min in 2 w v sodium bicarbonate and 1 mmol l edta at ph 8 then they were thoroughly washed with anaerobic ammonia free deionised water which was boiled sealed naturally cooled and aerated with nitrogen for 15 20 min thereafter the membranes were boiled for another 10 min in edta solution the dialysis membranes were not touched manually once cooled the membranes were immersed in anaerobic ammonia free deionised water and stored at 4 c in a sealed container 2 2 extraction of eps components the eps components were extracted through ultrasonic centrifugation the sludge was taken from the uasb anammox reactor which had been running steadily for more than 12 months and the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the reactor were 350 mgn l and 420 mgn l respectively the obtained sludge was centrifuged at 3000 rpm min for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded phosphate buffer solution ph 8 was then added to soak the sludge for 2 h at 30 c 35 c then the mixture was centrifuged again at 3000 rpm min for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded afterwards the substrate was assumed to have been totally removed then 15 ml of sludge was taken and was mixed with the same volume of anaerobic ammonia free deionised water the sludge mixture was then sealed in an ultrasonic generator and sonicated for 30 min at 40 khz and 30 c and then the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm min the supernatant was extracted using needle tubes and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to obtain the eps after determining the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides any sample containing dna was discarded then the eps were subsequently pre treated for protein dialysis the eps retained in the filter membrane were placed in the dialysis membrane two pre treated glass beads were added and the membrane was then sealed and placed in anaerobic ammonia free deionised water for dialysis the anaerobic ammonia free deionised water was replaced 3 h later and this process was performed twice the eps solution was then stored at 20 c 41 prior to measuring the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides the sample was placed in a cold water 0 c bath 2 3 proteomic analysis and high throughput detection the extracted eps were subjected to dialysis to remove polysaccharides and impurities and frozen at 80 c then it was sent to sangon biotech shanghai co ltd hereinafter referred to as the company covered with dry ice for proteomic analysis after removing the substrates the granular sludge was sent to the company for high throughput detection to analyse the bacterial genus composition the company performed all the relevant experiments used their own reagents and instruments and provided test reports 2 4 establishment of the adsorption model and verification of calculation adsorption through dialysis has been proposed as an indirect method for detecting the adsorption effect of eps on the test substrates previous experiments have demonstrated that when nh4 n and no2 n the concentrations of which were determined through spectrophotometry are directly mixed with eps the concentration is the same as that of the substrate solution therefore the directly analysis of whether eps adsorbed the substrate was impossible according to the law of conservation of substances the substrates were adsorbed by eps and were then dialysed into the external environment dialysis curves were used to fit the dialysis values and the method of indirect calculation of adsorption capacity was used in this study the calculations for dialysis curves assume that the initial content of a substrate in the dialysis membrane is n0 and the solute passes through the dialysis membrane in the presence of water according to the law of conservation of substances if the external conditions do not change the sum of the amount of substrate inside and outside the dialysis membrane at any time point is n0 the dialysis equation assumes the following 1 at a temperature of 20 c 35 c the dialysis rate is only related to the concentration difference between the dialysate inside and outside the dialysis membrane and the dialysis constant remains constant and is only related to the type of the substrate 2 water molecules can freely permeate dialysis membranes at a temperature of 20 c 35 c the rate of water molecules permeating the dialysis membranes is only related to the nature of the membrane at any time point the water molecules from inside to outside is equal to the water molecules from outside to inside of this system 3 substrates permeate dialysis membranes under the action of water molecules and when the substance enters the external solution it will mix evenly with the external solution the formula can be described in differential forms as eqs 1 and 2 1 d n d t k n inside n outside 2 d n d t k n 0 n v n nv 3 no nt 1 n n 0 n 1 n dn 0 t 1 k nv dt 4 ln n n 0 n 1 n t n n 0 n 1 n 0 n 1 k t 1 nv after calculation eq 5 is obtained 5 n t n 0 n 1 e n 1 k t 1 nv n according to hypothesis 1 the dialysis rate can be expressed as the amount of substrates inside and outside the membrane hence the dialysis eq 2 can be simplified into eq 6 when the volume inside and outside of the dialysis membrane is equal after calculation eqs 7 and 8 are obtained 6 d n d t k n 0 n n 7 n t n 0 2 e 2 k t 2 1 8 n ad n con 2 e 2 k con t 2 1 n eps 2 e 2 k eps t 2 1 where ninside and noutside are the substrate contents inside and outside of the dialysis membrane dn dt is the rate of substance passing through the membrane k is the dialysis constant of the substance v and nv are the volumes of the solution inside and outside the dialysis membrane with a ratio of n nt is the amount of external dialysis membrane substrates at time t1 n0 is the amount of substrate in the dialysis membrane nad is the adsorption capacity ncon equals neps both of which represent the substrate subjected to experimentation kcon and keps are k values for dialysis curves of the fitted pure substrate and fitted eps adsorption substrate and t1 and t2 are the adsorption time in theory when the external conditions remain unchanged the concentration of the substrate in the dialysate on both sides is n0 2 the volume of the solution inside and outside is vin vout 2 indicating that both sides of the dialysis membrane are in equilibrium therefore for a single dialysis system and to facilitate calculation application of the same volumes for both sides of the dialysis membrane is easy as long as the concentration of the solution inside the dialysis membrane is known and the volumes on both sides of the membrane are equal the substrate content can be calculated at any time point by using formulae 7 and 8 to prove that the eps adsorption model and the dialysis membrane method are suitable for the dialysis experiment we prepared 25 mgn l 50 mgn l and 100 mgn l nh4 and no2 solutions the dialysis experiment was then performed using 40 ml samples of each substrate solution the external dialysate was anaerobic ammonia free deionised water 40 ml at 25 c the k value obtained was the constant of self dialysis of nh4 n and no2 n which was related to only the temperature and substrate 2 5 adsorption experiment a reserve solution of approximately 100 mgn l nh4 n and no2 n was prepared the bottom of the pre treatment dialysis membrane was clamped with a plastic clamp and then eps was added the solution inside the dialysis membrane was diluted with the reserve solution and anaerobic ammonia free deionised water to make up the volume to 40 ml and the substrate concentrations were 2 5 mgn l 5 mgn l 12 5 mgn l 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l the ph of the solution was adjusted with 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh the volume of the external solution was the same as that of the dialysis membrane 40 ml two treated glass beads were added inside the dialysis membrane and the seal was clamped with the same plastic clamp at the top to immerse the dialysis membrane in the external dialysate the dialysis system was placed at 25 c for dialysis and the concentration of the substrates in the external dialysate was determined 5 times every 1 h then the adsorption amount of the substrates at a certain eps content was calculated using formula 8 kcon and keps were the same for this formula the experimental conditions were determined according to the orthogonal experiment results as shown in supplementary materials 2 6 isothermal adsorption models the isothermal adsorption model is a simple model for quantifying the adsorption process it is used to describe the relationship between the adsorption amount and liquid substrate concentration when the adsorption process of eps molecules reaches equilibrium at a certain temperature the most commonly used model consists of the langmuir and freundlich equations 13 14 given as follows q i k if c i n i q i γ max k il c i 1 k il c i where qi is the adsorption amount of substance i mg g gvss ci is the concentration of the substance mgn l kif is the freundlich constant g gvss l ni is the freundlich index kil is the langmuir constant g gvss l which denotes that the attraction of all surface sites to the adsorbent is constant and γmax denotes the total number of surface sites per unit mass of adsorbent which is ideally equal for all the adsorbents in reality different compounds have different γmax therefore this parameter usually denotes the maximum surface concentration of a given compound i where γmax equals ci max the freundlich equation can better describe the adsorption of extracellular proteins whereas the langmuir equation can better describe the adsorption of polysaccharides 42 43 moreover the amount of eps added in the first experiment was 4 359 mg and the same amount was used in all orthogonal experiments the eps content of adsorption and desorption experiments was different multiples of 4 359 mg 1 1 5 and 2 times respectively parallel experiments were performed with different amounts of substrates for each eps solution in each case the total volume of substrates in the dialysis membrane was 40 ml which was achieved by adding anaerobic ammonia free deionised water as required the experimental conditions were set to simulate the natural environment and a suitable environment for the growth of anaob in sewage treatment plants 3 results 3 1 species composition and eps proteomics analysis the reactor had been under stable operation for more than 12 months the bacterial composition of granular sludge was analysed through high throughput detection the sludge was extracted from the bottom of the reactor by using a peristaltic pump according to the sludge growth cycle granular sludge was collected for high throughput detection at approximately every 2 months combined with our previous study as shown in the fig 1 the average content of anaob candidatus kuenenia was between 59 89 44 and 67 56 and the proportion of the largest anaob content increased by nearly 7 the anaob in the reactor were mainly candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis a total of 28 proteins with wide homology were detected through eps proteomics table 1 presents the proteins related to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis strains however other unknown proteins are not listed the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides and dna in the extracted eps were detected after mixing each time the protein content was 66 67 8 22 mg gvss 496 91 61 26 mg l in solution and the polysaccharide content was 0 32 0 06 mg gvss 2 40 0 48 mg l in solution the concentrations of protein extracted in this study were not compared with those reported in other studies 22 43 45 when different sludge pre treatments that is naoh or cation exchange resin are used to extract eps the total amount of resulting eps varies and a considerable amount of dna is obtained 46 dna represents the extent of cell damage to a certain extent therefore the samples containing dna were discarded in this study and less than one tenth samples were found to contain dna therefore the ultrasound extraction method for extracting eps did not destroy the anaob cells and the proteins were detected in the eps layer the proteomics included a protein isoelectric point pi the pi of hzs α was 6 02 and that of hzs γ was 6 08 however the pi of other proteins was greater than 7 5 between 7 77 and 9 47 the pi of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase was 9 37 and that of another unknown anaerobic protein was 9 47 eps proteins in the solution were mostly in a positive state that tend to adsorb no2 n and reject nh4 n because the ph 7 5 of the mixed solution for substrate adsorption was less than the pi of the protein moreover a previous study showed that eps can undergo protonation under acidic conditions which causes a decrease in negative charges and thus eps tend to be positively charged 38 another study showed that proteins and polysaccharides adsorb different ions 15 in this study the main substance extracted using the ultrasonic method was protein and the adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps was found to be equivalent to the adsorption of proteins by eps 3 2 verification of the substrates adsorption model results of the dialysis experiment for nh4 n and no2 n were analysed through analysis of variance assuming α 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 f values obtained for each substrate concentration were greater than the critical values at all levels of significance thus the dialysis constants of nh4 n and no2 n could be calculated using the adsorption substrate model with high confidence by comparing the values of each parameter and experimental errors the substrate concentration and k values for subsequent experiments were selected and are shown in fig 2 for nh4 n at a concentration of 55 00 mgn l the endpoints measured were slightly more than 50 of the initial substrate concentration as shown in fig 2 a as shown in fig 2 c when the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were 27 667 1 24 mgn l and 114 67 1 37 mgn l some detection values at 12 h and 24 h were lower than the theoretical values combined with the final experimental results the dialysis experiment with a substrate concentration of 55 00 0 65 mgn l was more stable and the amount of substrate measured at 9 h was close to the theoretical value thus the amount of residual substrate at 9 h was used to fit the dialysis curve table 2 for no2 n even though the measured endpoint of 52 91 mgn l was different from that of the fitting curve this value was much closer to 50 of the substrate concentration fig 2 b as shown in fig 2 d when the concentration of no2 n was 26 45 0 62 mgn l a large deviation was seen after 24 h on the other hand when the concentration of no2 n was 108 45 0 85 mgn l the concentration gap between inside and outside of the dialysis membrane was large which expedited the dialysis process furthermore the f value was much smaller than 52 91 0 72 mgn l therefore the amount of residual substrate at 12 h was used to fit the dialysis curve 3 3 isothermal adsorption of nh4 n and no2 n by eps proteins 3 3 1 isothermal adsorption the adsorption conditions were determined through orthogonal experiments and the details are given in supplementary materials by fixing the dialysis temperature at 25 c and varying the eps content and substrate concentrations adsorption detection tests were performed the highest concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n used were 51 64 1 34 mgn l and 54 62 1 73 mgn l respectively the adsorption capacity of eps with respect to nh4 n 51 64 mgn l was the highest at ph 7 the adsorption capacity calculated with 4 359 mg of eps was 5 29 0 15 mgn g gvss under similar conditions the increase in the adsorption capacity was small when high eps dosages 6 538 mg and 8 717 mg were used as shown in fig 3 the adsorption capacity of eps with respect to no2 n 54 17 1 32 mgn l was the highest at ph 6 5 and with 4 359 mg of eps the unit adsorption amount of no2 n for eps was 46 51 1 27 mgn g gvss which was much larger than that of nh4 n under various conditions the average amount of no2 n adsorbed by eps was 6 57 0 41 of the initial amount which was 6 6 times the adsorbed amount of nh4 n compared with the same eps amount and substrate concentration the adsorption capacity of no2 n per unit of eps was 3 1 5 6 times the adsorption capacity of nh4 n even when the concentration of no2 n was low 3 3 2 freundlich isothermal adsorption model fitted results of the freundlich model for nh4 n and no2 n were analysed using the regression analysis under the conditions of α 0 01 α 0 05 and α 0 1 as shown in table 3 the freundlich model data for adsorption of nh4 n by eps showed that the f value was greater than the f critical value in each case and the p value was 0 01 with eps addition amounts of 4 359 mg and 6 538 mg with an eps addition amount of 8 717 mg the p value was 0 05 generally adsorption is the result of the simultaneous action of various adsorption mechanisms the results fitting with a certain adsorption model were the results of this model fig 4 and mainly determined by the adsorption mechanism of this model under specified conditions 38 as shown in table 3 the r2 value of the freundlich model for the adsorption of nh4 n by eps was 0 892 0 964 and ni was 1 on the one hand with an increase in the concentration of nh4 n in the eps solution the eps free energy of nh4 n adsorption was decreased and the adsorption effect was weakened on the other hand with an increase in the eps content the ni value decreased the faster the rate at which the ni value decreased the quicker was the rate at which the free energy of eps was weakened and consequently the adsorption effect of eps on nh4 n decreased the calculated amount of nh4 n adsorbed per unit of eps decreased not only because the additional eps had no adsorbing effect but also because the amount of nh4 n adsorbed per unit decreased significantly with an increase in the amount of eps added considering the actual amount of nh4 n adsorbed by eps there were a few sites that could have participated in the adsorption process because eps had more positive charges and had mostly adsorbed nh4 n through van der waals forces because of charge exclusion only a small amount of nh4 n could be adsorbed the high content of eps weakened the adsorption of nh4 n thereby contradicting the multiple adsorption site hypothesis of the freundlich model although the f value of the regression analysis was larger than the critical value the model was not suitable for elucidating the adsorption mechanism of eps proteins with respect to nh4 n the r2 values of the freundlich model for adsorption of no2 n by eps were all greater than 0 99 and the f value expression equation was highly significant although ni was 1 it was closer to 1 in comparison to the corresponding values for nh4 n after eps adsorbed no2 n the free energy was reduced and the degree of reduction was much slower than that for adsorption of nh4 n with an increase in the eps content ni for no2 n increased indicating that the total adsorbed amount could be increased by adding additional eps as was confirmed by the experimental data according to the multiple adsorption site hypothesis of the freundlich isothermal adsorption equation each potential site plays a role in the adsorption of no2 n adsorption by 6 538 mg and 8 717 mg of eps was slightly higher than that by 4 359 mg of eps indicating that the adsorption of no2 n increases to some extent with addition of more eps an increase in the availability of eps would have facilitated the acquisition of no2 n by the bacteria this finding may explain why anaob continue to secrete eps after aggregating into granules from a possible perspective in our study eps not only kept the bacterial granules stable and increased the surface area for bacterial growth but also helped the bacterial cells in obtaining and even storing no2 n 3 3 3 langmuir isothermal adsorption model unlike the freundlich isothermal adsorption equation kil assumes that all surface sites have the same attraction to the adsorbent some groups of eps exhibit charges opposite to those of nh4 n and no2 n and according to this hypothesis these groups have the same attraction towards nh4 n and no2 n in addition the greater the value of kil the stronger is the adsorption capacity of the substrates as mentioned previously γmax equals to ci max which represents the maximum surface concentration of compound i and the maximum adsorption concentration for kil the larger the equilibrium constant of the adsorption reaction the more is the number of sites at which the substance can adsorb when the adsorption capacity of many substances are the same the fitting results are shown in fig 5 and table 4 the fitting results of the langmuir model for nh4 n and no2 n were analysed through regression analysis assuming α 0 01 α 0 05 and α 0 1 respectively based on the langmuir model results for adsorption of nh4 n by eps f values were always higher than the corresponding critical values and the p value was 0 01 with 4 359 mg and 8 717 mg of eps the p value was 0 05 for no2 n the f value for the addition of eps far exceeded the corresponding f critical value and the p value was 0 01 thus the langmuir model was suitable for explaining the amount of nh4 n and no2 n adsorbed by eps the langmuir model fitting results for nh4 n showed that r2 varied between 0 762 and 0 966 and the maximum adsorption concentration was only 4 05 mgn l which is notably different compared with the experimental values thus combined with the hypothesis of the langmuir model when the nh4 n content was higher than 4 05 mgn l additional nh4 n was not adsorbed by the eps however for no2 n all r2 values were greater than 0 995 which indicated a significant correlation ci max values for no2 n were far greater than those for nh4 n however the reaction equilibrium constants were smaller the results showed that an increase in the eps content facilitates the adsorption of no2 n indicating that the maximum surface area for adsorption and amount of adsorbed substrate increase with the addition of more eps 4 discussion strous genomic studies on k stuttgartiensis showed that none of the enzymes can catalyse the reduction of no2 to nh2oh however the genomic sequence of cd1 nitrite reductase nirs was found to catalyse the reduction of no2 to no 47 in this study nitrite reductase hydrazine hydrolase or hydrazine dehydrogenase were not detected in eps because anammox occurs in the anammoxsome it can be considered that nitrite reductase hydrazine hydrolase and hydrazine dehydrogenase exist only in the anammoxsome in addition bacterial ferritin hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and hydrazine synthase were found to exist not only in the anammoxsome but also in the external environment of cells as eps proteins they have also been shown to participate in the transmission of substrates through adsorption by the eps layer and they may also participate in the electron transfer with cytochromes 48 49 moreover because only a small amount of dna was extracted eps proteins can be considered to be produced by anaob secreted into the external environment and then connected to cells through polysaccharides or lipids hence they could be treated as a type of bio adsorbent to auxiliary obtained substrates for anammox a previous study showed that proteins are associated with multivalent cation binding in an anammox biofilm 31 this research extended the effect of eps proteins on the substrate at low substrate concentrations the langmuir and freundlich models dominated the overall isothermal adsorption type when kil ci max is 1 substances are generally adsorbed in this study kil ci max values were 1 these results indicated that for the range of substrate concentrations tested eps generally function as an adsorbent however some differences were observed between the fitting results of langmuir model and the experimental results firstly with a fixed amount of eps the maximum adsorption capacity with respect to nh4 n and no2 n increased with an increase in the substrate concentration the maximum adsorption concentration for nh4 n was greater than the fitted values of ci max nh4 for no2 n the maximum adsorption concentration did not reach the values of ci max no2 the adsorbed amount of nh4 n increased slightly even when more eps or high concentrations of eps were added in contrast for no2 n the adsorption continued to increase secondly the langmuir and freundlich models both fitted the adsorption of no2 n by eps well under the experimental conditions used in this study in the regression analysis of the adsorption of nh4 n by eps p values ranged between 0 01 and 0 05 which was not observed in case of no2 n considering the mechanism the attraction of eps multiple adsorption sites was equal based on the freundlich model and all surface sites to the adsorbate were constant based on the langmuir model for nh4 n and no2 n yet the langmuir model was not suitable for explaining the adsorption of nh4 n by eps the surface charge of a protein can be determined on the basis of proteomics data the multiple adsorption sites include charged groups and structural adsorption sites because proteins are mostly positively charged nh4 n is repulsed and the amount of nh4 n that can be adsorbed by negatively charged proteins is reduced groups with positive charges that can directly bind with no2 n and the sites with positive charges within the structure of eps proteins display different attraction properties with respect to no2 n these groups more easily adsorb no2 n in the natural environment nh4 n is obtained through a wide range of sources and no2 n can be oxidised by nh4 n however as an intermediate unstable product of nitration reaction no2 n is easy to be nitrated into no3 which makes the acquisition of nh4 n easier and that of no2 n relatively difficult from the environment for anaob from the perspective of no2 n adsorption by eps proteins anaob can obtain no2 n by secreting positively charged eps proteins to ensure their growth which may be an important role of eps in this study we explored the extraction of eps by using the ultrasonic method and investigated the adsorption of substrates by eps we suggest that the microscopic effects of eps on anaob should be further studied in combination with the adsorption effect from the following perspective whether proteins enter the cell body as carriers after adsorbing substrates how do these adsorbent proteins generate directional movement outside cells and whether a certain amount of no2 n can be reduced outside the cell first we are currently analysing the species and distribution of eps proteins 5 conclusion in this study we extracted specifically the eps proteins by employing the ultrasonic method proteomics detection proved that eps proteins extracted using this method can effectively maintain the integrity of anaob and prevent the degradation of eps proteins by chemicals the dialysis membrane method can also be used to effectively calculate the amount of substrates adsorbed by eps with a dialysis model freundlich and langmuir isothermal adsorption models were used to fit the adsorption capacity of eps on nh4 n and no2 n and the adsorption results showed that eps proteins exert obvious adsorption and preservation effects on no2 n credit authorship contribution statement liang qiao
