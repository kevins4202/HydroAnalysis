21485,this paper presents drag forces from uniform water current on two flexible net cage designs commonly used in norwegian fish farming obtained through model scale testing and numerical simulations the primary focus is on the comparison between model tests and numerical simulations and performance of the numerical model for the different net cage designs the two designs were a cage with a cylindrical main section with straight walls and conical bottom with a sinker tube weight system and a cage where both the main section and bottom has a conical shape the latter cage has a central weight instead of a sinker tube the effect of the governing parameters was explored by varying the design and loads of the weighting system both physical tests and numerical simulations revealed increased drag forces and reduced ability for deformation when increasing the load from the weighting system lower weight system load or weight system designs that allow for more deformation decrease the loads on the net cage although it was not a focus in the present work fish welfare is dependent on sufficient available volume in the net cage meaning that large reductions in volume to reduce drag forces at high current velocities may be undesirable comparisons between model scale tests and numerical simulations reveal good agreements for the highest weight system loads tested decreasing the weight system loads decrease the accuracy of the numerical simulations this may be caused by larger deformations of the net cage when the bottom loads are reduced resulting in a larger number of net panels with small angles of attack relative to the incident current predictions of forces for low angles of attack may be less accurate than for larger angles of attack while there is a possibility of increased flow velocity reduction wake effect and flow deflection the cages were tested and simulated for flow velocities up to 1 25 m s full scale value measurements of the flow velocity in the middle of the net cages revealed a higher velocity reduction than predicted with theory with the exception of the highest velocity keywords aquaculture fish cages deformation drag forces numerical simulation 1 introduction the united nations food and agriculture organization fao 2018 issued a report stating that aquaculture with a 5 8 annual growth rate since 2010 continues to grow faster than other major food production sectors one trend is the development of aquaculture production at offshore sites that are more exposed to currents and waves in this context the sea cage is a new fishing concept based on floating flexible and circular gravity cages which are the most widely used or completely new net based farming systems in the past several experiments have been carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of net cages and structures e g løland 1991 zhan et al 2006 balash et al 2009 and patursson et al 2010 a review can be found in klebert et al 2013 studies on net panels or net cages can further be used for development of numerical models for hydrodynamic forces on nets and net cages these may be categorized into two approaches 1 the morison type force model and 2 the screen model in the morison type force model nets are modeled as individual twines but due to the large number of twines in net cages the physical net cage may be represented by an equivalent mesh system with fewer twines a morison type model is then applied to calculate the forces on each twine see for example li et al 2006 moe et al 2010 in the screen model the net is divided into a number of panels each subjected to a force dependent among others on the orientation of the entire panel a morison type model typically focus on individual twines for calculation of hydrodynamic loading while a screen type model focus on the panel hybrid models where the net is divided into panels while hydrodynamic force calculations are based on the orientation of the twines equal along each individual panel also exists endresen et al 2014 for all methods the resulting force is usually decomposed into a drag force and a lift force both main types of models may or may not include wake effect considerations i e parts of the net shielded by upstream parts of the net in steady currents studies on shielding and the flow field inside and around net cages include løland 1991 patursson et al 2010 gansel et al 2012 and zhao et al 2015 both methods usually consider solidity directly or indirectly and in some instances effect of knots a morison type force model may overestimate forces for low angles of attack e g when the inflow direction goes towards parallel with the net panel partly due to self shielding from adjacent parts of the net løland 1991 derived a screen model where the drag and lift force coefficients were found and validated by data from laboratory tests on net panels the tests involved variation in netting solidity and angle of attack and included wake effect considerations kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 used a theoretical and semi empirical approach to derive a screen force model the model was compared with model test data a difference from løland 1991 is the addition of reynolds number dependency on the drag coefficient and the possibility of using a second harmonic function cos 3 θ and sin 4 θ dependent on panel normal angle θ to the current for determining the shape of the drag and lift coefficient function for each net panel respectively the drag and lift formulations from kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 were integrated in sintef oceans in house software fhsim it was used to assess the ability to obtain full scale estimates of forces on aquaculture net cages by comparing its performance to up scaled model scale experiments this numerical model uses established methods for the evaluation of hydrodynamic loads on and structural forces in the netting material enabling verification against previously published works that have modeled current forces on aquaculture net cages in the present study the drag forces obtained for various net cage designs exposed to uniform water current in model scale experiments in a towing tank are presented and the results are compared with numerical simulations the experiments included two separate net cage designs a cylindrical main section with vertical walls a conical bottom and sinker tube weight system fig 1 and b conical design with slanted walls a conical bottom and a central weight fig 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the two fish cage models figs 1 and 2 and table 1 were tested by towing of scaled models scale 1 25 with constant velocities the water velocities and forces were measured while the deformation experienced by the cages were assessed qualitatively with a video camera assuming similar magnitudes for the drag coefficient for the net for model and full scale it can be shown that forces and velocities can be scaled in the same manner as for froude scaling model and full scale dimensions for the two net cage designs can be found in table 2 netting parameters are described in section 2 3 the cylinder shaped net fig 1 had a sinker tube type weight system with a central weight in the bottom of the net cone while the cone shaped net cage fig 2 had two central loads one of these loads was connected to the net cone bottom while the heaviest weight was connected to the bottom perimeter of the upper conical part of the net by long suspension ropes the vertical position and attachment method of the sinker tube of the cylindrical net and the vertical position of the main load weight of the conical cage were varied along with the magnitude of the selected weights to assess how the net cage designs reacted to water currents the main geometry of the net cage and floating collar and sinker tube was geometrically scaled the diameter of the floating collar cross section was however slightly larger than the diameter of floating collars commonly used today for flexible gravity type net cages due to the decision to use one floating collar instead of two 2 2 weights for the cone shaped cage three different bottom weights were used and assessed in addition to two different suspension rope lengths fig 2 for the cylinder shaped cage only one bottom ring weight was used in the three different configurations integrated in the net suspended from the bottom of the net and suspended from the collar at the surface fig 1 all cases are summarized with case numbers in table 1 2 3 net model the twine diameter and half mesh width of the netting were not scaled geometrically as this would not have been feasible due to the resulting small diameter and length of the mesh bars in the netting instead model nets with a smaller thread diameter and mesh bar length than the full scale equivalent were used while maintaining the same solidity ratio as the full scale netting material solidity is defined as the ratio between the projected area of the netting material and the total area of the net panel the two most common formulas used to determine netting solidity are s n 2 d l and s n 2 d l d l 2 where d and l are the mesh bar diameter and length respectively the latter formula evaluates the netting as an idealized structure consisting of crossing circular cylinders while the former may better account for the extra material often found in the knots of aquaculture netting the netting material used in the experiments has a measured half mesh mesh bar length of approximately 6 3 mm the twine diameter could not be reliably measured to assess the solidity image analysis was applied a threshold was used to generate a two color image for which an average solidity of 0 245 was obtained fig 3 it should be noted that the measured half mesh and solidity cannot be used to derive the actual twine diameter as per standard formulas for estimation of solidity based on twine diameter and half mesh size due to the structure of the knots and the added projected area it produces although the term knot is used for the intersections between the twines the netting material has a raschel knitting pattern meaning that the net does not have conventional knots 2 4 test facilities and force measurements the tests were conducted in the bulgarian ship hydrodynamics centre in varna bulgaria the tests were run in a towing tank with a length width and depth of 200 m 16 m and 6 5 m respectively the floating collar and net cages were connected to the tank s towing carriage through a horizontal mooring system fig 4 fig 5 thus simulating water current through towing of the model the accuracy of the velocity measurements on the carriage was 1 mm s in rms values drag forces on the floating collar and net structure were measured by two hbm u9b 100 n force transducers one upstream of the structure and one downstream connected to ropes parallel to the towing direction these ropes were connected to bridles attached to the fore and aft ends of the floating collar fig 5 the alignment of the mooring lines ensured that the drag forces on the structure could be measured directly as the difference between the inline forces measured by the strain gauges the transducers have an accuracy class of 0 5 with a range of 0 100 n drag force measurements were obtained by towing the model through the tank at a variety of constant velocities the mooring lines were pretensioned to 65 kn full scale value while a rope was stretched between the front upstream and aft downstream part of the floating collar due to the flexibility of the floating collar it was necessary to avoid excessive horizontal deformations which affect the drag forces by altering the shape of the net cage forcing the shape of the floating collar significantly reduce the impact on the net from horizontal deformations of the floating collar while also negating the effect of having only two bridles attached in line with the towing direction 2 5 numerical simulation setup sintef ocean s in house software fhsim reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 was used to numerically simulate the model test setups in full scale fhsim is a software platform and framework for mathematical modeling and numerical simulation with a focus on marine applications as only constant water velocities were assessed the numerical setup was simplified the net ropes fixed to the sinker tube and the central weight conical net cage weights and the sinker tube cylindrical net cage were modeled while the floating collar and bridles were not included in the model this simplification is equivalent to a floating collar that perfectly holds its shape circle while this is only an approximation it was deemed appropriate for the cases investigated it will also reduce uncertainties in the simulations by reduction of parameters the sinker tube was modeled as a cable with resistance to axial bending and torsional deformations table 3 while all ropes were modeled as cables with negligible bending stiffness table 4 the net was modeled with triangular priour structural elements priour 1999 by connecting the vertices to form a complete net structure with sides vertical or slanted and a conical bottom hydrodynamic forces on the net elements were estimated using the screen type model formulated by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 the net cables and sinker tube are connected by constraints position or applied force for each timestep in the simulation further references on fhsim structural models connections between elements in the model and time integrations schemes can be found in su et al 2019 endresen et al 2014 and reite et al 2014 the net cage geometry was realized by dividing the net cage into a set number of four sided surfaces each divided into two triangular panels the cylindrical net structure has 16 4 6 four sided elements distribution along the circumference vertical walls and radially in the bottom respectively fig 6 fig 7 the distribution is 16 5 6 for the conical net structure fig 8 fig 9 this yields a total number of 762 and 960 triangular elements for the cylindrical and conical cases respectively the twine diameter and half mesh length were set to 2 62 mm and 20 mm respectively s n 2 d l d l 2 was used to determine the twine diameter by using the solidity found by image analysis 0 245 and a realistic half mesh length 20 mm for a full scale netting this formula for solidity represents the projected area of the net as an idealized structure consisting of cylinders without excess material in the knots in effect this will yield a higher ratio between the twine diameter and half mesh length in the simulations compared to the model tests this relation was used by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 to determine solidity and is used in the numerical method in the present study to conform with the method the calculated drag coefficient for the net element is dependent on both the solidity and twine diameter the solidity affects the panel element drag coefficient by being directly used in the formula while the twine or mesh bar diameter is used together with the solidity to determine the effective reynolds number giving the equivalent drag coefficient for the presumed cylindrical mesh bars the equivalent drag coefficient is used together with the solidity ratio to determine the drag and lift coefficient for the net panel this means that change in solidity have a large effect on the drag coefficient for full scale netting materials a brief description of how to calculate the drag and lift coefficients on net panels from kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 are as follows the drag coefficient c d θ and lift coefficient c l θ for the panel are given as c d θ c d a 1 cos θ a 3 cos 3 θ and c l θ c l b 2 sin 2 θ b 4 sin 4 θ where θ is the angle between the panel normal vector and the undisturbed incident flow θ varies between 0 and π 2 c d and c l are the drag coefficient for the panel for θ 0 and lift coefficient for θ π 4 respectively hence the criterion a 1 a 3 1 must be satisfied while b 2 1 c d and c l are calculated by first finding the drag coefficient for a circular cylinder c d c y l as the function of the reynolds number c d c y l can be found from experiments or published data while the reynolds number is given as r e d t u r e l ν 1 s n where d t u r e l ν and s n are the twine diameter of the netting incident relative flow velocity to the panel kinematic viscosity and netting solidity respectively further c d is given as c d c d c y l s n 2 s n 2 1 s n 2 the lift coefficient is then found by evaluating the relation between normal and tangential forces on the panel resulting in c l c d 0 5 π 16 c d 2 the drag and lift force on each panel is then given as f d l θ 0 5 ρ a c d l θ u r e l 2 where f d l θ and c d l θ are the drag or lift force and drag or lift coefficient respectively ρ is water density while a is the panel area the numerical model in the present study did only use the first harmonic function cos θ sin 2 θ presented in kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 for determining the drag and lift force giving a 1 b 2 1 and a 3 b 4 0 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 indicates that 0 a 3 0 1 and b 4 0 setting a 3 b 4 0 results in a possibly conservative formula with slightly higher drag forces and a shift of the angle for which maximum lift occurs compared with 0 a 3 0 1 and b 4 0 since only constant water velocity was evaluated the buoyancy of the floating collar did not influence the drag forces on the net or weight system and the floating collar was omitted from the numerical setup the drag forces on the collar alone obtained through model tests were subtracted from the model test results of the net cages before comparing them with the numerical results 3 results and discussion 3 1 scaling all results are given as full scale values froude scaling was used to convert the model test results to full scale values with a scale factor of λ 25 scale 1 25 before comparing them with numerical values simulated in full scale the main dimensions were scaled with the scale factor λ and velocity with λ while weight and forces were scaled as 1 025 λ 3 the factor 1 025 is due to the difference in water density between the evaluated model and the full scale model 3 2 cylindrical net cage the model tests of the cylindrical cage did not reveal significant difference in the forces between the integrated bottom ring suspended in the net s1 in table 1 and the bottom ring suspended in the floating collar s3 however there was a significant increase in the drag force experienced by the bottom ring suspended 10 m below the cylindrical bottom of the cage s2 fig 10 in contrast the simulation results fig 11 did not reveal differences in drag forces between the three cases comparison between the model tests and numerical simulations for the integrated bottom ring s1 are shown in fig 12 the ratio between simulation results and experiments s1 s3 can be found in fig 13 the cases with an integrated bottom ring s1 and the bottom ring suspended in the floating collar s3 were similar in the sense that the vertical position of the bottom ring in relation to the net are comparable the length of the ropes connecting the collar suspended bottom ring to the net are relatively short and the effect of the bottom ring on the net when subjected to currents may have been comparable to the case with the integrated bottom ring the main difference between the cases is which part of the net structure supports the weight of the bottom ring the net supports the entire weight of the bottom ring in the integrated and net suspended cases whereas a larger portion of the weight presumably is supported by the floating collar in the case where the bottom ring is connected to the floating collar however when velocity and subsequently the loading and deformations on the cage increase for the floating collar supported setup a larger portion of the bottom ring may be supported by the net pictures from the model tests are shown in fig 14 3 3 conical net cage for the conical net cage both the model tests and simulation results showed not surprisingly dependency on the magnitude of the central weight however whereas the model tests indicated a moderate reduction in drag forces when the weight is reduced fig 15 the simulations showed a much larger decrease fig 16 drag forces on the cone shaped cage seem to be reduced by a small amount model test results when shortening the length of the lines the central load weights are equal between the cases with long and short lines indicating that both geometry and tension in the lines affect the deformation of the net cage fig 15 evaluating a static case without current implies that tensions in the lines holding the central weight will increase with decreasing length of the lines due to the higher angle of the line with respect to the vertical the comparison of the two cases implies that a larger angle shorter lines results in larger inward radial forces compared with the long line case the simulations partly support this assessment but show approximately equal drag force at 1 25 ms 1 fig 16 the comparison of drag forces between the experiments and numerical simulations for the cone shaped cages fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 show that for the 4 ton case c1 fig 17 the numerical results are with the exception of 0 25 m s lower than the experiments results for all velocities the largest difference between numerical simulations and experiments occur for 1 25 m s for 0 8 m s and higher c1 shows the largest difference between the numerical simulations and the experiments for all the cone shaped cases fig 19 the 8 ton case c2 has similar to c1 a decreasing ratio between numerical results and experiments for increasing velocity for 0 5 m s and higher velocities numerical results for c2 compares better with experiments than c1 for 0 7 m s and higher velocities numerical results for c3 10 5 ton fig 18 compare best with experiments among the three conical cases with similar geometry c1 c2 and c3 for c3 the numerical results were closest to the experiment results for 0 7 m s to 1 0 m s the largest underestimations of forces for c3 were found for 0 25 m s 0 5 m s and 1 25 m s numerical results for the 10 5 ton short lines case c4 compared best with experiments for 0 5 m s 1 0 m s and 1 25 m s while the drag force was overestimated compared with experiments for 0 7 m s and 0 8 m s for full scale velocities of 0 8 m s and higher the results indicate that increasing the central bottom weight results in better comparison between simulations and experiments with regards to drag forces it also indicates that the numerical method is able to reproduce loads and deformations up to a certain global deformation level evaluation of deformation is more complex than simply comparing vertical displacement of the bottom part of the net for a net cage with small or negligible global deformation large parts of the netting will still have a medium or low angle of attack this is prevalent on the sides of the cage where the panel planes are parallel to the incident current velocity with high currents and possibly large global deformations the numbers of panels with small angles of attack will increase thus discrepancies with respect to low angles of attack will most likely be larger for large global deformations one effect seen in the numerical model of the conical net is that a portion of the rear top part of the net is lifted towards the water surface when this happens many of the panels orient themselves horizontally and parallel to the velocity vector this effect was more present for the 4 ton bottom weight than for the 10 5 ton bottom weight fig 20 while it was not observed to this degree for the cylindrical cages fig 21 this may be a physical effect or an effect of the structural modeling arising when large forces cause the downstream part of the net to lift thereby also causing the top rear part of the net to lift and become flat and parallel with the velocity vector this effect however is not observed visually in the model tests where a fold occurred in the net below the surface on the downstream side of the net figs 20 and 22 the force estimated for each net panel in the numerical model tends toward zero for small angles of attack yet there still may be a force contribution from that part of the net in the physical model which might partly explain why the simulation is underestimating the drag for the 4 ton bottom weight case 3 4 wake effect when modeling the forces affecting a net cage the reduced velocity or wake behind the upstream parts of the net must be considered kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 used the formulation from løland 1991 where the rear downstream side of the net is subjected to a reduced velocity due to blockage from the fore upstream part of the net this approach was also applied in the numerical model used in this work using the same formulation for velocity reduction this means that the entire downstream part of the net experiences the same reduced velocity an earlier work patursson et al 2010 suggests that velocity reduction is dependent on the orientation angle of attack of preceding panels another factor is the possibility of change in the flow pattern e g direction due to the presence of the net gansel et al 2012 which can modify the angles of attack on both the upstream and downstream parts of the net when comparing the measured velocity at the center of the cage it was found that it rarely matched with the theoretical velocity the measured velocities are presented as a velocity reduction factor r u 1 u in fig 23 and fig 24 where u 1 u are the velocities after passing through one net panel and undisturbed velocity respectively in general the measured values were closer to the theoretical values at higher flow velocities and matched better overall for the conical cages than for the cylindrical cages the velocity reduction was on average higher than predicted by theory and there was no definite rule to whether measured velocity reduction would indicate how well model tests and numerical simulations would compare in terms of total drag forces the exception was the conical cage with long suspension ropes and a 10 5 ton weight c3 for which both the measured drag forces and velocity in the center of the cage matched well with numerical results as mentioned the measured velocities compared better with the theoretical velocities at higher velocities with the exception of the 4 ton conical case c1 and the cylindrical cage with the bottom ring suspended 10 m below the main part of the cage s2 the latter were also the cases where the numerical results differed the most from the measured drag forces 3 5 uncertainties as the model tests were performed on model scale netting with a small twine diameter there may be flow pattern effects not accounted for by the numerical model other works on net panels zhan et al 2006 patursson et al 2010 show that the drag coefficient may depend on reynolds number the relatively small velocities in model scale combined with the small twine diameter in the model net may affect drag coefficients for the model net due to low reynolds numbers this may also have an effect on flow velocities through the cage as both the velocities and the measured forces in model scale were relatively low measuring accuracy may be a source of uncertainty especially for the lowest velocities tested solidity measurements may also be a source for uncertainty the largest differences between model tests and simulations occurs for 0 25 m s for the cylindrical cages s1 s3 while this is only the case for the two conical cages with the 10 5 ton center weight c3 and c4 the ratio between simulated drag forces and measured drag forces generally decrease with increasing velocity for the conical 4 and 8 ton cases c1 and c2 respectively 4 conclusion the results for the model tests and numerical simulations were very similar for the cylindrical net cages with the bottom ring integrated fully supported in the net and supported by the floating collar by lines traditional setup and for the conical net cages with a heavy central load 10 5 tons the simulations of the cylindrical cage with the bottom ring supported by the net and 10 m lines and the conical cage with an 8 ton central weight indicated a drag force 87 of that measured in the model tests at a flow velocity of 1 25 m s for a complex structure such as a net cage these results are not unexpected but compared to the other cylindrical cases they still indicate a significant underestimation of the forces numerically the three cylindrical cases experienced similar drag forces while the model tests showed noticeably higher forces on the net supported bottom ring with 10 m long lines adequate explanations for this discrepancy were not found the results of the simulations of the conical net with an 8 ton central weight were adequate compared with the model tests 87 whereas the simulations of the 4 ton case had a drag force 75 of that found in the model tests for 1 25 m s for the conical net cages lower weights seemed to decrease the performance of the numerical model this may partly be due to increased global deformations of the net cage and discrepancies between simulations and model tests in local deformation at the rear top part of the net for high flow velocities furthermore it is possible that low reynolds numbers in the model tests affect the results credit authorship contribution statement per christian endresen formal analysis investigation methodology project

are the mesh bar diameter and length respectively the latter formula evaluates the netting as an idealized structure consisting of crossing circular cylinders while the former may better account for the extra material often found in the knots of aquaculture netting the netting material used in the experiments has a measured half mesh mesh bar length of approximately 6 3 mm the twine diameter could not be reliably measured to assess the solidity image analysis was applied a threshold was used to generate a two color image for which an average solidity of 0 245 was obtained fig 3 it should be noted that the measured half mesh and solidity cannot be used to derive the actual twine diameter as per standard formulas for estimation of solidity based on twine diameter and half mesh size due to the structure of the knots and the added projected area it produces although the term knot is used for the intersections between the twines the netting material has a raschel knitting pattern meaning that the net does not have conventional knots 2 4 test facilities and force measurements the tests were conducted in the bulgarian ship hydrodynamics centre in varna bulgaria the tests were run in a towing tank with a length width and depth of 200 m 16 m and 6 5 m respectively the floating collar and net cages were connected to the tank s towing carriage through a horizontal mooring system fig 4 fig 5 thus simulating water current through towing of the model the accuracy of the velocity measurements on the carriage was 1 mm s in rms values drag forces on the floating collar and net structure were measured by two hbm u9b 100 n force transducers one upstream of the structure and one downstream connected to ropes parallel to the towing direction these ropes were connected to bridles attached to the fore and aft ends of the floating collar fig 5 the alignment of the mooring lines ensured that the drag forces on the structure could be measured directly as the difference between the inline forces measured by the strain gauges the transducers have an accuracy class of 0 5 with a range of 0 100 n drag force measurements were obtained by towing the model through the tank at a variety of constant velocities the mooring lines were pretensioned to 65 kn full scale value while a rope was stretched between the front upstream and aft downstream part of the floating collar due to the flexibility of the floating collar it was necessary to avoid excessive horizontal deformations which affect the drag forces by altering the shape of the net cage forcing the shape of the floating collar significantly reduce the impact on the net from horizontal deformations of the floating collar while also negating the effect of having only two bridles attached in line with the towing direction 2 5 numerical simulation setup sintef ocean s in house software fhsim reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 was used to numerically simulate the model test setups in full scale fhsim is a software platform and framework for mathematical modeling and numerical simulation with a focus on marine applications as only constant water velocities were assessed the numerical setup was simplified the net ropes fixed to the sinker tube and the central weight conical net cage weights and the sinker tube cylindrical net cage were modeled while the floating collar and bridles were not included in the model this simplification is equivalent to a floating collar that perfectly holds its shape circle while this is only an approximation it was deemed appropriate for the cases investigated it will also reduce uncertainties in the simulations by reduction of parameters the sinker tube was modeled as a cable with resistance to axial bending and torsional deformations table 3 while all ropes were modeled as cables with negligible bending stiffness table 4 the net was modeled with triangular priour structural elements priour 1999 by connecting the vertices to form a complete net structure with sides vertical or slanted and a conical bottom hydrodynamic forces on the net elements were estimated using the screen type model formulated by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 the net cables and sinker tube are connected by constraints position or applied force for each timestep in the simulation further references on fhsim structural models connections between elements in the model and time integrations schemes can be found in su et al 2019 endresen et al 2014 and reite et al 2014 the net cage geometry was realized by dividing the net cage into a set number of four sided surfaces each divided into two triangular panels the cylindrical net structure has 16 4 6 four sided elements distribution along the circumference vertical walls and radially in the bottom respectively fig 6 fig 7 the distribution is 16 5 6 for the conical net structure fig 8 fig 9 this yields a total number of 762 and 960 triangular elements for the cylindrical and conical cases respectively the twine diameter and half mesh length were set to 2 62 mm and 20 mm respectively s n 2 d l d l 2 was used to determine the twine diameter by using the solidity found by image analysis 0 245 and a realistic half mesh length 20 mm for a full scale netting this formula for solidity represents the projected area of the net as an idealized structure consisting of cylinders without excess material in the knots in effect this will yield a higher ratio between the twine diameter and half mesh length in the simulations compared to the model tests this relation was used by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 to determine solidity and is used in the numerical method in the present study to conform with the method the calculated drag coefficient for the net element is dependent on both the solidity and twine diameter the solidity affects the panel element drag coefficient by being directly used in the formula while the twine or mesh bar diameter is used together with the solidity to determine the effective reynolds number giving the equivalent drag coefficient for the presumed cylindrical mesh bars the equivalent drag coefficient is used together with the solidity ratio to determine the drag and lift coefficient for the net panel this means that change in solidity have a large effect on the drag coefficient for full scale netting materials a brief description of how to calculate the drag and lift coefficients on net panels from kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 are as follows the drag coefficient c d θ and lift coefficient c l θ for the panel are given as c d θ c d a 1 cos θ a 3 cos 3 θ and c l θ c l b 2 sin 2 θ b 4 sin 4 θ where θ is the angle between the panel normal vector and the undisturbed incident flow θ varies between 0 and π 2 c d and c l are the drag coefficient for the panel for θ 0 and lift coefficient for θ π 4 respectively hence the criterion a 1 a 3 1 must be satisfied while b 2 1 c d and c l are calculated by first finding the drag coefficient for a circular cylinder c d c y l as the function of the reynolds number c d c y l can be found from experiments or published data while the reynolds number is given as r e d t u r e l ν 1 s n where d t u r e l ν and s n are the twine diameter of the netting incident relative flow velocity to the panel kinematic viscosity and netting solidity respectively further c d is given as c d c d c y l s n 2 s n 2 1 s n 2 the lift coefficient is then found by evaluating the relation between normal and tangential forces on the panel resulting in c l c d 0 5 π 16 c d 2 the drag and lift force on each panel is then given as f d l θ 0 5 ρ a c d l θ u r e l 2 where f d l θ and c d l θ are the drag or lift force and drag or lift coefficient respectively ρ is water density while a is the panel area the numerical model in the present study did only use the first harmonic function cos θ sin 2 θ presented in kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 for determining the drag and lift force giving a 1 b 2 1 and a 3 b 4 0 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 indicates that 0 a 3 0 1 and b 4 0 setting a 3 b 4 0 results in a possibly conservative formula with slightly higher drag forces and a shift of the angle for which maximum lift occurs compared with 0 a 3 0 1 and b 4 0 since only constant water velocity was evaluated the buoyancy of the floating collar did not influence the drag forces on the net or weight system and the floating collar was omitted from the numerical setup the drag forces on the collar alone obtained through model tests were subtracted from the model test results of the net cages before comparing them with the numerical results 3 results and discussion 3 1 scaling all results are given as full scale values froude scaling was used to convert the model test results to full scale values with a scale factor of λ 25 scale 1 25 before comparing them with numerical values simulated in full scale the main dimensions were scaled with the scale factor λ and velocity with λ while weight and forces were scaled as 1 025 λ 3 the factor 1 025 is due to the difference in water density between the evaluated model and the full scale model 3 2 cylindrical net cage the model tests of the cylindrical cage did not reveal significant difference in the forces between the integrated bottom ring suspended in the net s1 in table 1 and the bottom ring suspended in the floating collar s3 however there was a significant increase in the drag force experienced by the bottom ring suspended 10 m below the cylindrical bottom of the cage s2 fig 10 in contrast the simulation results fig 11 did not reveal differences in drag forces between the three cases comparison between the model tests and numerical simulations for the integrated bottom ring s1 are shown in fig 12 the ratio between simulation results and experiments s1 s3 can be found in fig 13 the cases with an integrated bottom ring s1 and the bottom ring suspended in the floating collar s3 were similar in the sense that the vertical position of the bottom ring in relation to the net are comparable the length of the ropes connecting the collar suspended bottom ring to the net are relatively short and the effect of the bottom ring on the net when subjected to currents may have been comparable to the case with the integrated bottom ring the main difference between the cases is which part of the net structure supports the weight of the bottom ring the net supports the entire weight of the bottom ring in the integrated and net suspended cases whereas a larger portion of the weight presumably is supported by the floating collar in the case where the bottom ring is connected to the floating collar however when velocity and subsequently the loading and deformations on the cage increase for the floating collar supported setup a larger portion of the bottom ring may be supported by the net pictures from the model tests are shown in fig 14 3 3 conical net cage for the conical net cage both the model tests and simulation results showed not surprisingly dependency on the magnitude of the central weight however whereas the model tests indicated a moderate reduction in drag forces when the weight is reduced fig 15 the simulations showed a much larger decrease fig 16 drag forces on the cone shaped cage seem to be reduced by a small amount model test results when shortening the length of the lines the central load weights are equal between the cases with long and short lines indicating that both geometry and tension in the lines affect the deformation of the net cage fig 15 evaluating a static case without current implies that tensions in the lines holding the central weight will increase with decreasing length of the lines due to the higher angle of the line with respect to the vertical the comparison of the two cases implies that a larger angle shorter lines results in larger inward radial forces compared with the long line case the simulations partly support this assessment but show approximately equal drag force at 1 25 ms 1 fig 16 the comparison of drag forces between the experiments and numerical simulations for the cone shaped cages fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 show that for the 4 ton case c1 fig 17 the numerical results are with the exception of 0 25 m s lower than the experiments results for all velocities the largest difference between numerical simulations and experiments occur for 1 25 m s for 0 8 m s and higher c1 shows the largest difference between the numerical simulations and the experiments for all the cone shaped cases fig 19 the 8 ton case c2 has similar to c1 a decreasing ratio between numerical results and experiments for increasing velocity for 0 5 m s and higher velocities numerical results for c2 compares better with experiments than c1 for 0 7 m s and higher velocities numerical results for c3 10 5 ton fig 18 compare best with experiments among the three conical cases with similar geometry c1 c2 and c3 for c3 the numerical results were closest to the experiment results for 0 7 m s to 1 0 m s the largest underestimations of forces for c3 were found for 0 25 m s 0 5 m s and 1 25 m s numerical results for the 10 5 ton short lines case c4 compared best with experiments for 0 5 m s 1 0 m s and 1 25 m s while the drag force was overestimated compared with experiments for 0 7 m s and 0 8 m s for full scale velocities of 0 8 m s and higher the results indicate that increasing the central bottom weight results in better comparison between simulations and experiments with regards to drag forces it also indicates that the numerical method is able to reproduce loads and deformations up to a certain global deformation level evaluation of deformation is more complex than simply comparing vertical displacement of the bottom part of the net for a net cage with small or negligible global deformation large parts of the netting will still have a medium or low angle of attack this is prevalent on the sides of the cage where the panel planes are parallel to the incident current velocity with high currents and possibly large global deformations the numbers of panels with small angles of attack will increase thus discrepancies with respect to low angles of attack will most likely be larger for large global deformations one effect seen in the numerical model of the conical net is that a portion of the rear top part of the net is lifted towards the water surface when this happens many of the panels orient themselves horizontally and parallel to the velocity vector this effect was more present for the 4 ton bottom weight than for the 10 5 ton bottom weight fig 20 while it was not observed to this degree for the cylindrical cages fig 21 this may be a physical effect or an effect of the structural modeling arising when large forces cause the downstream part of the net to lift thereby also causing the top rear part of the net to lift and become flat and parallel with the velocity vector this effect however is not observed visually in the model tests where a fold occurred in the net below the surface on the downstream side of the net figs 20 and 22 the force estimated for each net panel in the numerical model tends toward zero for small angles of attack yet there still may be a force contribution from that part of the net in the physical model which might partly explain why the simulation is underestimating the drag for the 4 ton bottom weight case 3 4 wake effect when modeling the forces affecting a net cage the reduced velocity or wake behind the upstream parts of the net must be considered kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 used the formulation from løland 1991 where the rear downstream side of the net is subjected to a reduced velocity due to blockage from the fore upstream part of the net this approach was also applied in the numerical model used in this work using the same formulation for velocity reduction this means that the entire downstream part of the net experiences the same reduced velocity an earlier work patursson et al 2010 suggests that velocity reduction is dependent on the orientation angle of attack of preceding panels another factor is the possibility of change in the flow pattern e g direction due to the presence of the net gansel et al 2012 which can modify the angles of attack on both the upstream and downstream parts of the net when comparing the measured velocity at the center of the cage it was found that it rarely matched with the theoretical velocity the measured velocities are presented as a velocity reduction factor r u 1 u in fig 23 and fig 24 where u 1 u are the velocities after passing through one net panel and undisturbed velocity respectively in general the measured values were closer to the theoretical values at higher flow velocities and matched better overall for the conical cages than for the cylindrical cages the velocity reduction was on average higher than predicted by theory and there was no definite rule to whether measured velocity reduction would indicate how well model tests and numerical simulations would compare in terms of total drag forces the exception was the conical cage with long suspension ropes and a 10 5 ton weight c3 for which both the measured drag forces and velocity in the center of the cage matched well with numerical results as mentioned the measured velocities compared better with the theoretical velocities at higher velocities with the exception of the 4 ton conical case c1 and the cylindrical cage with the bottom ring suspended 10 m below the main part of the cage s2 the latter were also the cases where the numerical results differed the most from the measured drag forces 3 5 uncertainties as the model tests were performed on model scale netting with a small twine diameter there may be flow pattern effects not accounted for by the numerical model other works on net panels zhan et al 2006 patursson et al 2010 show that the drag coefficient may depend on reynolds number the relatively small velocities in model scale combined with the small twine diameter in the model net may affect drag coefficients for the model net due to low reynolds numbers this may also have an effect on flow velocities through the cage as both the velocities and the measured forces in model scale were relatively low measuring accuracy may be a source of uncertainty especially for the lowest velocities tested solidity measurements may also be a source for uncertainty the largest differences between model tests and simulations occurs for 0 25 m s for the cylindrical cages s1 s3 while this is only the case for the two conical cages with the 10 5 ton center weight c3 and c4 the ratio between simulated drag forces and measured drag forces generally decrease with increasing velocity for the conical 4 and 8 ton cases c1 and c2 respectively 4 conclusion the results for the model tests and numerical simulations were very similar for the cylindrical net cages with the bottom ring integrated fully supported in the net and supported by the floating collar by lines traditional setup and for the conical net cages with a heavy central load 10 5 tons the simulations of the cylindrical cage with the bottom ring supported by the net and 10 m lines and the conical cage with an 8 ton central weight indicated a drag force 87 of that measured in the model tests at a flow velocity of 1 25 m s for a complex structure such as a net cage these results are not unexpected but compared to the other cylindrical cases they still indicate a significant underestimation of the forces numerically the three cylindrical cases experienced similar drag forces while the model tests showed noticeably higher forces on the net supported bottom ring with 10 m long lines adequate explanations for this discrepancy were not found the results of the simulations of the conical net with an 8 ton central weight were adequate compared with the model tests 87 whereas the simulations of the 4 ton case had a drag force 75 of that found in the model tests for 1 25 m s for the conical net cages lower weights seemed to decrease the performance of the numerical model this may partly be due to increased global deformations of the net cage and discrepancies between simulations and model tests in local deformation at the rear top part of the net for high flow velocities furthermore it is possible that low reynolds numbers in the model tests affect the results credit authorship contribution statement per christian endresen formal analysis investigation methodology project

21486,the availability of detailed environmental hindcast data opens the door for virtual structural health monitoring however the impact of hindcast wave data selection on the results of such an approach have not been explored while studies on the differences between wave models have been conducted in the past extensions of these comparisons to resultant vessel response predictions and fatigue damage estimates are limited at three separate geographical locations this work compared hindcast wave data from noaa s wavewatch iii nww3 multigrid production hindcast the eu s cmems global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product and national data buoy center buoys in addition to comparisons of wave parameters at each location the resultant heave pitch and vertical bending moment responses and fatigue damage of a destroyer sized naval combatant the dtmb 5415 were compared the novelty of this work lies in its large scope which calculated responses every 3 h for all of 2017 in 32 speed and heading combinations for each location and wave data source the results show that differences between wave data sources propagated to the vessel response predictions these differences were then amplified in the calculation of fatigue damage causing significant discrepancies between data sources after just one year keywords fatigue damage estimation seakeeping prediction structural health monitoring wave hindcast data 1 introduction multiple agencies release global wave forecast and hindcast data on a daily basis that are of interest to mariners and researchers alike these data sources provide wave model output characterizing conditions at specific times and geographic locations often defined by a uniform geospatial grid by latitude and longitude over a region while comparisons of these wave models have been conducted in the past to benchmark performance for oceanographic modeling purposes among other reasons published studies on the consequences of these differences for vessel response prediction are limited it is clear that significant differences between predicted and experienced wave conditions and resultant responses could be catastrophic for a vessel and its crew if sea state severity is underestimated however it is also important to consider that as the marine industry pushes toward digital monitoring and autonomous vessels understanding these differences will become increasingly important as human judgement is removed from the equation furthermore hindcast data present an opportunity for virtual structural health monitoring using vessel position and wave data alone which may be a valuable low cost support mechanism for vessel owners operators and maintainers if viable for these reasons it is of utmost importance to conduct a formal investigation on the significance of which wave data source is selected for design stage and through life analyses of vessel motions structural responses and fatigue damage while subtle differences between predicted vessel motions and structural responses may seem relatively inconsequential for an experienced crew these discrepancies may have serious implications for an unmanned vessel however these differences may also be significant in examples of marine digitalization for conventional platforms for example thompson 2018 introduced and evaluated the concept of virtual hull monitoring using a vessel s known location and measured or numerically modeled wave data the investigation used data from a naval vessel trial and included a comparison of wave hindcast data to those collected via a deployed wave buoy as well as a comparison between stresses derived from strain gauge measurements and those predicted using a spectral fatigue analysis and the hindcast data similarly schirmann et al 2019b demonstrated that wave forecast or hindcast data could be used to predict vessel motions structural responses and fatigue damage resulting from a vessel s known route for the purposes of operational guidance and life cycle management more specifically schirmann et al 2019b discussed tracking damage estimates generated using wave data and periodically balancing fatigue damage among ships in a fleet by adjusting deployment responsibilities hulkkonen et al 2019 also discussed the use of wave model data and a vessel s known locations to track the fatigue damage accumulated by the vessel as well as the uncertainties associated with this method of virtual monitoring e g vessel loading conditions corrosion etc similar studies such as mondoro et al 2016 and zhu and collette 2017 have considered means of structural health monitoring using limited onboard response measurements to update a vessel s operational profile and expected responses in unseen operating conditions magoga et al 2019 proposed a fatigue life updating method based on in service measurements and maintenance data and nielsen et al 2011 explored the implementation of a real time onboard decision support system that considers fatigue damage accumulation rates a more recent study conducted by thompson 2020 further investigated the accuracy of virtual hull monitoring via wave hindcast data using strain gauge measurements from a naval vessel the study compared structural responses calculated using wave data from different hindcast data sources which aligns well with the goals of the present work while the results of thompson 2020 were very promising for this method of structural health monitoring and showed agreement between stress spectra generated using different wave hindcast sources it was noted that the data considered were limited to a two week cruise with a relatively narrow set of operating conditions the present study seeks to make these comparisons between wave data sets over an extended period of time with a broad set of operating conditions considered while the use of wave forecast or hindcast data to support operational maintenance and deployment decisions seems promising and beneficial uncertainty in the wave data used may overshadow the benefits of this application for example while differences between wave hindcast data may seem insignificant when looking at minimal differences between resultant structural responses fatigue damage estimation is a higher order function of these responses meaning the discrepancies between wave models may be amplified drastically the primary goal of this work is to compare vessel motions structural responses and fatigue damage predicted using data from different hindcast wave data sources to determine the significance of wave data source selection in these analyses preliminary results of this work were originally published in schirmann et al 2019a time and place specific wave forecast and hindcast data have been made widely available by agencies such as noaa s national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the eu s copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems in addition to these theoretical wave models although generally confined to coastal regions a wide array of wave measurement buoys provide measured sea spectra that are also of interest to vessel operators and researchers often as validation of the wave models satellite measurements have also been employed for sea state characterization and in some cases as data assimilated into wave hindcasts other work such as that of nielsen 2006 nielsen et al 2018 and duz et al 2019 has focused on sea state estimation using vessel motions i e ship as a wave buoy approaches nielsen et al 2019 recently published a framework for extension of ship as a wave buoy approaches to incorporate data from multiple vessels there have been numerous comparison studies on the differences between data from forecast and hindcast wave models as well as real world measurements from buoys and satellites however these comparison studies focus on wind and wave conditions rather than vessel motions and structural responses to name a few recent studies stopa and cheung 2014 compared wind speeds and wave heights between different weather models using buoy data and satellite altimeters for several geographically diverse regions and campos and guedes soares 2016 compared three wave hindcasts with satellite data over a large region in the north atlantic ocean guedes soares and moan 1991 also examined the effect of uncertainty in wave statistics on fatigue damage showing that wave data source selection has been an ongoing concern in the marine industry for decades rather than further validation of existing wave models or investigation of the differences between them from an oceanographic standpoint the goal of this work was to examine the effects of these differences on vessel response predictions and fatigue damage estimates in this work vessel responses and fatigue damage estimates resulting from different hindcast wave data sources were compared at two locations off the coast of alaska and one location near hawaii the wave data compared in this work came from noaa s wavewatch iii nww3 multigrid production hindcast noaa national centers for environmental prediction 2018 the eu s cmems global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product fernandez and aouf 2018 and the national data buoy center noaa s national data buoy center center of excellence in marine technology 2018 the heave pitch vertical bending moments and fatigue damage of a ship predicted using these data sources operating with an array of speed and heading combinations were compared for the full year of 2017 although the most compelling findings in the following discussion relate to vertical bending moments and fatigue damage for virtual structural monitoring heave and pitch were included to show the implications of wave data differences for operational guidance furthermore in comparison to heave and pitch vertical bending moments are difficult and expensive to measure onboard a vessel as such establishing a similarity between the influence of wave data differences on motions and structural responses may prove beneficial for future studies this comparison approach highlights the impact of wave data selection on ship response predictions and fatigue estimates without addressing uncertainties from ship modeling itself e g 2 d strip theory idealization locations of the vertical and longitudinal centers of gravity etc 2 methodology the following section discusses the approach employed in this work to investigate the significance of wave data source selection for vessel response predictions and fatigue damage estimates section 2 1 discusses the three wave data comparison locations considered in this work and section 2 2 discusses the simulations performed at each location sections 2 3 and 2 4 discuss the wave model and buoy data considered at each location respectively and the breadth of this study is summarized in section 2 5 sections 2 6 and 2 7 describe the response prediction and fatigue damage estimation procedures employed in this work and sections 2 8 and 2 9 discuss the metrics and parameters used to compare wave data sources 2 1 comparison locations three locations were selected for comparison of wave data from different sources as well as vessel response predictions and cumulative fatigue damage estimates generated using these wave data two locations were selected off the coast of the aleutian islands in alaska and the third location was chosen near the northwestern hawaiian islands fig 1 gives a broad overview of both regions and the three locations within them in the pacific ocean the two regions identified in fig 1 are enhanced in fig 2 these two regions were chosen in part because they had wave data available from multiple wave data sources at varying geospatial grid resolutions and had potential to experience severe sea states that would add to the breadth of this study within the two regions these three specific locations were selected because they were close in proximity to buoys managed by the national data buoy center ndbc with measured directional wave spectra available additionally the geospatial output grids defined as the locations where wave hindcast data were available from multiple wave data sources overlapped exactly at these locations the three analysis locations where the considered wave model grids overlapped and the locations of the nearby ndbc buoys are described in table 1 table 1 includes the approximate distance between each analysis location and the nearby buoy s location which was calculated using https www gpsvisualizer com calculators the outlined regions of fig 2 are enhanced further in fig 3 to show the placement of the buoys relative to the three analysis locations 2 2 simulations performed the dtmb 5415 a destroyer sized naval combatant described in stern et al 2011 was placed at each location for the full year of 2017 i e from january 1 december 31 2017 table 2 provides select characteristics of the dtmb 5415 that were used in hydrodynamic modeling for this study vessel response simulations were carried out using all combinations of four speeds and eight compass headings which resulted in 32 total cases for each given time location and wave data source the four speeds tested were 0 10 20 and 30 knots and the eight headings were evenly spaced on 0 315 in increments of 45 in each of these 32 test cases heave pitch and vertical bending moment vbm responses were predicted for every 3 h time increment during the one year exposure time three hour intervals were selected to ensure data availability from all wave data sources at each time step due to the large volume of data and test cases considered this work was performed using a high performance computing cluster provided by advanced research computing at the university of michigan ann arbor the predicted vbm responses were used to estimate the fatigue damage accumulated amidships over time the wave data and resultant predicted responses and fatigue damage estimates from different wave data sources were then compared 2 3 wave model data four nww3 hindcast datasets and one cmems hindcast dataset were used in this study the availability of each dataset at the three locations is indicated in table 3 these datasets had varying geospatial resolutions which are indicated in the dataset name i e nww3 glo 30 min had an approximate latitude longitude resolution of 30 arcminutes or 0 5 note however that these resolutions were approximate and not always consistent between latitude and longitude due to the actual geospatial increments and different masking patterns in the datasets it was only possible to overlap two of the considered nww3 datasets and the one cmems dataset at locations a and b therefore one nww3 dataset was exchanged for another when shifting the analysis from location a to location b table 3 also notes that while nww3 glo 30 min data were available at location c they were not considered in this study due to the preliminary findings of schirmann et al 2019a at locations a and b which showed that nww3 grid resolution did not matter these results at locations a and b are revisited in the following discussion 2 3 1 nww3 multigrid production hindcast as shown in table 3 the four nww3 grids used in order of increasing spatial resolution were the global 30 arcminute grid nww3 glo 30 min alaskan 10 arcminute grid nww3 ak 10 min the east pacific 10 arcminute grid nww3 ep 10 min and the alaskan 4 arcminute grid nww3 ak 4 min note that within the same region e g near alaska as spatial resolution increases the geographical area with available data typically decreases the nww3 glo 30 min grid spatial domain includes a majority of the world s oceans while the nww3 ak 10 min grid is masked to cover a large coastal region off the coast of alaska and the nww3 ak 4 min grid covers a less expansive area off the coast of alaska the nww3 ep 10 min grid covers a large region off the western coast of the united states as well as a separate region surrounding the hawaiian island chain that contains location c the nww3 multigrid production hindcast that provided these datasets used the ncep s global forecast system gfs winds as input forcing to the multi grid spectral wave model wavewatch iii noaa national centers for environmental prediction 2018 there was no wave data assimilation from wave buoys satellites or other sources included in these data meaning no real world wave data were used to correct the hindcasted output at a given time and location the nww3 datasets characterized the wave conditions using a varying number of independent directional wave partitions each defined by a significant wave height peak period and mean direction detailed information about the nww3 partitioning scheme can be found in the wavewatch iii development group ww3dg 2016 2 3 2 cmems global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product the single cmems grid analyzed in this study referred to as cmems glo 5 min in the following discussion to be consistent with the nww3 abbreviations comes from the global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product global analysis forecast wav 001 027 this dataset covers a majority of the world s oceans with an approximate geospatial resolution of 5 arcminutes and uses winds and ice fields from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf to force the meteo france wave model mfwam fernandez and aouf 2018 significant wave height data are assimilated in this wave model from satellite altimeters field output wave data for a given time and location were provided as three independent directional wave partitions wind waves primary swell and secondary swell to maintain consistency between different datasets the specific classification of each wave partition type was not used to differentiate between partitions in this analysis i e the assumed spectral shape was not modified based on partition type each of the three wave partitions from cmems glo 5 min was characterized by a significant wave height mean period and mean direction 2 3 3 nww3 and cmems idealized wave spectra for all of the wave model datasets used in this work a bretschneider ittc two parameter spectrum was constructed for each independent directional wave partition at a given time step and location using the provided significant wave height and period this step was necessary because only characteristic parameters were provided for each wave partition rather than fully defined spectra note that the copernicus climate change service does provide hindcast 2 d wave spectra however to limit the scope of the current work only one data source with 2 d spectra was used which was the measured wave buoy data described in the following section nevertheless comparisons between the copernicus data options 2 d spectra and cmems directional wave partitions are worthy of further study 2 4 wave buoy data the measured ndbc buoy wave data for a given time step and location were provided as fully defined 1 d spectra with coefficients included for a directional fourier series expansion to appropriately spread the spectral energy on 0 2 π radians the directional spreading function using the four parameters r 1 r 2 α 1 and α 2 which were provided in the datasets for each discrete frequency f is defined in equation 1 1 d f α 1 π 1 2 2 3 r 1 cos α α 1 1 6 r 2 cos 2 α α 2 in equation 1 α is the direction that the waves come from measured clockwise from true north and integration of d f α on 0 2 π radians yields a value of 1 0 note that the weighting terms 2 3 and 1 6 discussed in earle et al 1999 are incorporated in equation 1 which noaa s national data buoy center center of excellence in marine technology 2018 presented as an option to avoid negative values in the spreading function through smoothing as noted in earle et al 1999 without these weighting terms the directional resolution half power width of this spreading function would be 88 with these weighting terms this directional resolution metric is increased to 130 after transforming the 1 d wave spectrum using the provided spreading parameters for each frequency the resulting 2 d spectrum was partitioned into eight evenly spaced bins covering 45 each each of the eight bins was defined by a 1 d wave spectrum and the mean direction within the bin both resulting from integration over the bin s directional spread for the purposes of this analysis the eight bins were then treated as eight directional wave partitions for calculation of the vessel s responses in contrast to the wave model data because the measured spectral shape associated with each directional wave partition was known for the buoy data construction of a bretschneider spectrum was not necessary however to investigate the importance of spectral shape on these analyses an additional experiment was completed at location b in which the mean period and significant wave height of each of the eight bins were used to generate a bretschneider spectrum while peak period could have been used to construct the idealized spectrum the measured spectrum in a single bin was not necessarily unimodal so mean period was selected nevertheless either period metric would have yielded a change in spectral shape relative to the measured data which was the desired effect this additional experiment at location b is indicated in table 3 as in the other experiments simulations in all 32 heading speed combinations were completed for the full one year period and the resultant response predictions and fatigue damage estimates were compared to the buoy data results using measured spectra as well as the wave model data results 2 5 summary of study breadth as outlined in sections 2 2 2 4 and summarized in table 3 a minimum of three wave data sources and their resultant responses and fatigue damage were compared at each of the three locations for a given 3 h time increment of the one year period as shown by the check marks in table 3 between the three locations 12 different wave data sources including repeats between locations and variants of the sources i e bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data were tested for each of these 12 wave data source instances considered and 2920 3 h time increments in the year 2017 32 speed and heading combinations were simulated to generate 3 types of response predictions heave pitch and vertical bending moment vbm combination of these numbers 12 2 920 32 3 yields a total of 3 363 840 responses predicted in this work as mentioned in section 2 2 these response prediction calculations were performed using a high performance computing cluster and the methodology presented in the following section 2 6 2 6 response prediction this section details the frequency domain approach used to predict heave pitch and vbm responses for the dtmb 5415 naval combatant hull form as mentioned previously the wave data from all sources were analyzed in 3 h time increments a required assumption to obtain cumulative fatigue damage from this frequency domain approach was that the wave environment and operating conditions were stationary over the entire 3 h period from 1 5 h before to 1 5 h after the specified wave data time during real world operation of a ship forward speed would lead to variation in the vessel s location during this period as a result even if conditions were temporally stationary the wave conditions seen by the vessel could change the primary goal of this work was not to simulate a ship at sea for a whole year as a realistic demonstration but rather to make controlled comparisons between wave data sources and their resultant responses and fatigue damage while forward speed was considered for the sake of response prediction and fatigue damage estimation the vessel s physical location was assumed constant over the 3 h window this constraint is analogous to a scenario in which a ship travels within a region that is temporally and spatially stationary during the 3 h period in addition to the assumption of stationarity the frequency domain approach employed in this work assumed that the vessel s response was a linear function of the wave spectrum for each time increment location wave data source speed and heading the pseudo response spectrum due to wave partition w p was calculated using equation 2 where j specifies the response type heave pitch or vbm nonlinear response calculations would be expected to yield higher bending moments in some of the extreme sea states encountered with corresponding increases in fatigue damage 2 s j w p ω 0 s w p ω 0 r a o j w p ω 0 2 in equation 2 s w p ω 0 is the wave spectrum for a single directional wave partition and r a o j w p ω 0 is the response amplitude operator rao magnitude for response type j as a function of wave frequency ω 0 note that this rao is also a function of the vessel s speed and heading relative to each wave partition which is the reason for inclusion of the w p subscript shipmo bm a linear 2 d strip theory code developed at the university of michigan by beck and troesch 1990 was used to calculate raos for this work heave pitch and vbm raos were calculated at all four speeds and in 5 relative heading θ increments on 0 355 for each wave partition the rao with the closest θ value to the calculated relative heading between the waves and ship was used directional interpolation between raos was deemed unnecessary because the 5 relative heading increments yielded minimal differences between raos it should also be noted that wave spreading functions were not applied to any of the wave partitions from any of the wave data sources this decision was made to avoid unfairly influencing any of the wave data sources with arbitrary spreading functions prior to comparisons using the formula for the k t h spectral moment given in equation 3 and solving through trapezoidal integration the zeroth k 0 second k 2 and fourth k 4 spectral moments for response type j due to a single wave partition m j k w p were calculated lloyd 1989 zeroth spectral moments were calculated for all three response types but second and fourth spectral moments were only calculated for the vbm responses the use of these vbm spectral moments for fatigue damage estimation is discussed in section 2 7 equation 3 accounts for the doppler shift between wave frequency and the vessel s encounter frequency due to forward speed u and relative heading to the wave partition μ w p this doppler shift takes effect when k 0 in equation 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 3 m j k w p 0 ω 0 ω 0 2 u g cos μ w p k s j w p ω 0 d ω 0 through the principle of linear superposition the k t h total spectral moment for response type j m j k t due to all n wave partitions for a given location time wave data source speed and heading was calculated via the summation presented in equation 4 4 m j k t w p 1 n m j k w p using the zeroth k 0 total spectral moment m j 0 t resulting from equation 4 the total response standard deviation σ j t and significant amplitude ζ s t were calculated using equations 5 and 6 respectively 5 σ j t m j 0 t 6 ζ j t 2 σ j t the vessel response comparisons in the following discussion are made using the response significant amplitudes ζ j t averaged over all eight headings for a given location time wave data source and speed while directional averaging was necessary to make the following analysis and discussion tractable given the large amount of data the implications of this decision are discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 2 7 fatigue damage estimation the purpose of the fatigue analysis performed in this work was not to exactly model a specific structural detail but instead to have a representative calculation for comparison between wave data sources in the previous work of schirmann et al 2019a a narrow banded fatigue damage approximation was used to simplify the analysis although individual wave partitions of the wave model data were constructed using narrow banded bretschneider spectra due to the multidirectionality of the wave data many of the analyzed 3 h time windows were inherently wide banded furthermore the wave data measured from the buoy were not necessarily narrow banded therefore in this extension of schirmann et al 2019a it was deemed necessary to utilize a fatigue damage estimation approach that addressed the bandwidth of the vbm responses following the guide for fatigue assessment of offshore structures american bureau of shipping 2018 from the american bureau of shipping abs this study employed the spectral fatigue analysis of wirsching and light 1980 which incorporates a rainflow correction factor based on bandwidth as described in the following paragraphs note that as a result of this improved fatigue damage estimation procedure and adjustments in the wave data used for response prediction some of the preliminary results presented in schirmann et al 2019a have changed to characterize the number of fatigue cycles experienced during a given 3 h exposure period it was necessary to calculate the zero up crossing frequency using equation 7 7 f z 1 2 π m m 2 t m m 0 t in equation 7 m m 0 t and m m 2 w p are the zeroth k 0 and second k 2 total vbm spectral moments respectively which were calculated using equations 3 and 4 similarly the bandwidth ε of the total vbm response was calculated using equation 8 which additionally considers the fourth k 4 total vbm spectral moment 8 ε 1 m m 2 t 2 m m 0 t m m 4 t prior to fatigue damage calculation it was also necessary to transform the standard deviation of the total vbm response σ m t into a stress standard deviation σ s t using the section modulus s m at a select location within the cross section of the ship this transformation is defined in equation 9 9 σ s t σ m t s m a bottom cross section modulus of 3 77 m 3 for the dtmb 5415 was selected from ashe et al 2009 as a representative value to compare cumulative fatigue damage between wave data sources the damage d accumulated by the vessel during a 3 h interval for a given location wave data source speed and heading was then estimated using equation 10 american bureau of shipping 2018 wirsching and light 1980 which is based on palmgren miner s rule in this theoretical fatigue damage formulation a nondimensional fatigue damage value equal to 1 0 corresponds to structural failure note that palgren miner s rule assumes linear

each location and speed using the average damage value over all eight ship headings as mentioned previously the implications of direction averaging are revisited in sections 3 2 and 3 3 2 8 comparison methods although several comparison metrics were considered and tested one metric monthly mean bias was selected for presentation in the following analysis to quantify the differences between wave data sources and their resultant heave pitch and vbm responses bias was selected in particular because it preserves the sign of the differences between wave data sources monthly mean bias b i a s was calculated using equation 14 which was adapted from a bias equation used in campos and guedes soares 2016 for comparison of wave hindcast data and satellite measurements analyzing the data on a monthly basis allowed potential seasonal variation in the relationships between data sources to be uncovered 14 b i a s 1 n i 1 n m i b i in equation 14 m i was the value from or resulting from a given wave model nww3 or cmems data source at time step i and b i was the value from or resulting from the nearby buoy data using measured spectra at time step i when comparing the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data to the measured buoy data at location b the bretschneider reconstruction results were used as m i for heave pitch and vbm responses separate monthly mean bias values were calculated for each speed at a given speed the differences between m i and b i were averaged over all n 3 h time steps for all eight directions considered in the month i e n 8 number of 3 h time intervals in the month when comparing mean wave directions the absolute value was taken in the numerator of equation 14 to yield the monthly mean absolute bias because the sign of the difference was not significant for direction note that although the buoy was treated as the foundation for the comparisons made using equation 14 there was no intention to suggest that the buoy measurements were the ground truth or even that they were more accurate than the wave model data the goal of this work was not to validate or find fault with any of the tested wave data sources but rather to analyze the differences between these sources and the effects on response predictions and fatigue damage estimates 2 9 wave data comparison parameters five characteristic parameters were used for wave data comparison in the following analysis significant wave height mean period spectral peak period mean direction and bandwidth for a given time location and wave data source the total wave spectrum was calculated by summing the independent wave partition spectra at each wave frequency the significant wave height and mean period were then calculated using conventional methods from this total wave spectrum the spectral peak period was the wave period corresponding to the maximum value in the total wave spectrum which is an indicator of the dominant wave partition period the mean direction was determined by taking the average of individual wave partition mean directions weighted by the zeroth moment of the wave partition spectra these mean direction calculations were performed using vectors to avoid issues with circularity the wave direction data presented in the following discussion are defined as the direction of wave propagation with 0 and 90 corresponding to north and east respectively the bandwidth of the wave spectrum was calculated following equations 3 4 and 8 the five characteristic values described here allowed direct comparisons of wave data sources with differing data formats 3 results and discussion the following section compares wave data resultant responses and fatigue damage estimates from different wave data sources at three different locations as mentioned previously some of the results and discussion for locations a and b were adapted from schirmann et al 2019a however some of these previously discussed results have been updated due to an improved fatigue damage estimation procedure and adjustments in the wave data used for response prediction 3 1 wave data comparisons a time series for july 2017 showing the significant wave height mean period spectral peak period mean direction and bandwidth of the input wave data at location a is shown in fig 4 july 2017 was selected because it had the lowest monthly mean significant wave height measured at ndbc buoy 46075 for the year meaning wave conditions were relatively benign the nww3 ak 10 min and nww3 ak 4 min plots overlap nearly perfectly which implies that spatial resolution was not a large factor in the nww3 data sets for location a specifically this nearly identical agreement continued for the entire year which also yielded nearly identical response predictions and fatigue damage estimates it was found that this agreement also held true between nww3 ak 10 min and nww3 glo 30 min at location b it is possible that locations closer to the coast or in different geographical regions would yield larger differences between nww3 spatial resolutions and the higher resolution grids include points that are not included in the other data sets which are useful for near shore analyses nevertheless at these two locations the differences in spatial resolutions of the nww3 grids did not have a significant effect therefore in the following discussion only the ak 10 min grid is presented for locations a and b the ak 10 min wave data were selected as the representative nww3 data set because they were available at both analysis locations as indicated in table 3 due to the findings at locations a and b only one nww3 grid ep 10 min was analyzed at location c as shown in the july 2017 time series of fig 4 while the significant wave heights from nww3 cmems and the buoy appear to show reasonably strong agreement there are times in which the curves deviate from each other even in these benign conditions the mean period and direction data from all three sources also agree reasonably well excluding a few time steps where the buoy appears to be approximately 180 out of phase with the two models but the spectral peak periods of these data sets include stretches of notable disagreement as mentioned in section 2 9 the peak period is an indicator of the dominant wave partition period some areas of disagreement in the spectral peak periods between wave data sources may be due to time lags in wave system arrivals to the analyzed location additionally the differences in spectral peak periods may have resulted from the required assumption of spectral shape bretschneider for the wave model data which was also influenced by the wave period definition mean vs peak provided by the wave data source the bandwidth time series shows that the measured buoy data typically had a lower bandwidth than the wave models which was unexpected because the wave models were constructed using narrow banded bretschneider spectra for each directional wave partition although complex and not easily quantifiable the effect of these peak period and bandwidth discrepancies on the predicted responses and fatigue damage estimates may be significant a time series of the five wave data parameters for a november 2017 storm with severe wave conditions at location a is shown in fig 5 once again nww3 and cmems show reasonably strong agreement however at the highest significant wave heights seen nww3 and cmems underestimate the significant wave height relative to the buoy data better agreement is present in the spectral peak period here than previously in the july time series this agreement is largely attributed to the selected period metric because these large sea states have a high likelihood of being dominated by a single wave partition once again the measured buoy data appear to be more narrow banded than the nww3 and cmems wave model data the mean wave periods and directions show reasonably strong agreement for the entire storm plots of the monthly mean bias in significant wave height mean period spectral peak period mean direction and bandwidth calculated using equation 14 are shown in fig 6 for locations a b and c location b also includes the monthly mean bias plots of the bretschneider reconstruction which was an idealized spectrum created using the measured significant wave height and mean period from the buoy as a result all the bias values of significant wave height mean period and mean direction for the bretschneider reconstruction are zero however the peak period and bandwidth bias plots show notable disagreements between the bretschneider reconstruction and the buoy data because these parameters were not preserved in the reconstruction note that if the reconstruction was performed using peak period instead of mean period the peak period bias values of the bretschneider reconstruction would be zero and the mean period bias values would be nonzero in fig 6 the monthly mean bias values in significant wave height at all three locations show that subtle disagreement exists between the wave data sources that were used to generate response predictions and fatigue damage estimates fig 6 also reveals that while the mean periods of all three wave data sources agree reasonably well cmems tends to overestimate the spectral peak period relative to nww3 and the buoy which may also be the result of the period definition differences between nww3 and cmems datasets at location b the peak period bias values of the bretschneider buoy reconstruction and the nww3 datasets are very similar which is interesting because peak period was used to construct the nww3 idealized spectra while mean period was used for the buoy reconstruction the mean absolute bias in mean direction shows strong agreement between nww3 and cmems in general but both absolute bias values indicate a difference relative to the buoy this difference reinforces the fact that the buoy data should not necessarily be treated as the ground truth as mentioned in section 2 4 the directional resolution half power width of the buoy data used in this work was 130 which may have led to the directional discrepancies between the buoy and wave model data as shown by the differences outlined here wave data source selection for response prediction and fatigue damage estimation should not be trivialized 3 2 response comparisons time series plots of the direction averaged heave pitch and vbm significant amplitudes for july 2017 are shown in fig 7 for a speed of 20 knots at location a the significant wave height time series that was originally shown in fig 4 is also included here for comparison purposes it can be seen in fig 7 that the differences between significant wave heights from each wave data source propagated to the vessel responses note that while only the 20 knots responses are shown this propagation was also evident for the other three forward speeds as well as at locations b and c the direction averaged response time series plots for a speed of 10 knots in the november storm examined previously are shown in fig 8 which also shows that relationships between significant wave heights from different data sources propagated to all three responses while significant wave height is included in figs 7 and 8 for reference the discrepancies between responses are also the result of differences in the other four wave parameters of figs 4 and 5 monthly mean bias plots for direction averaged heave pitch and vbm significant amplitudes are shown in fig 9 the four speeds are plotted as different markers and the lines indicate the monthly mean bias over all speeds as in fig 6 location b includes the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data the significant wave height mean bias values from fig 6 are also included for comparison in fig 9 the significant wave height biases of nww3 and cmems propagated to the response significant amplitude biases for all wave data sources and locations variation in speed did not have a significant impact on bias excluding vbm predictions at 30 knots as mentioned in section 2 6 while direction averaging was necessary to make this discussion tractable there was certainly variation in response magnitudes and the resultant bias values as the vessel s relative heading to the wave partition s changed for example in general predominant head seas yield a much higher pitch and vbm response than predominant beam seas as a result large bias values in predominant head seas may not be adequately portrayed by the direction averaged values if the beam seas responses from all wave data sources were near zero therefore the key takeaway from figs 7 9 are that the differences in wave data from different sources were propagated to the vessel s responses but the effect of these differences varied with speed and heading despite the notable peak period and bandwidth differences recall that the significant wave height mean period and mean direction were identical between the measured and bretschneider reconstructed buoy data shown in fig 6 for location b the resultant responses of the two datasets are much more similar to each other than to the cmems and nww3 data as shown in the bias plots of fig 9 this similarity between buoy data with different spectral shapes implies that significant wave height and wave direction may have been more significant for response prediction than peak period and bandwidth which are more directly linked to spectral shape than the former two parameters although wave peak period and wave bandwidth may not have been excessively detrimental to the predicted motions and vbm responses examined here these parameters may have still had a significant impact in the calculation of fatigue damage which is discussed further in section 3 3 to examine the propagation of bandwidth from wave spectra to the resultant vbm responses fig 10 shows the direction averaged monthly wave and vbm bandwidth bias values as a function of vessel speed in addition to the wave bandwidth bias plots from fig 6 for comparison although the plots of fig 10 are direction averaged despite bandwidth being heavily dependent on forward speed and direction through the encounter frequency fig 10 does show that bandwidth differences exist between wave models which directly influence fatigue damage as shown in equation 10 the second row of fig 10 may be the most informative because it is not influenced by forward speed comparing the wave bandwidth of the first row with the vbm response bandwidth of the second row it appears that the vbm raos may act as a filter on the wave model spectra which leads to better agreement with the measured wave buoy data despite wave bandwidth differences for the three rows with forward speed it seems that the bandwidths of cmems and nww3 are in better agreement than their respective wave datasets however for location b the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data remains different than cmems nww3 and the measured buoy data 3 3 fatigue damage comparisons the direction averaged cumulative fatigue damage at locations a b and c and the nearby buoys are shown in fig 11 for each curve the 13 plotted values include an assumed damage value of 0 0 at the beginning of the year and 12 values corresponding to the cumulative damage at the end of each month including all prior months damage the horizontal black lines at d 0 06 are included for reference to the ordinate scale between speeds in fig 11 it is evident that the differences between wave data sources led to notable differences in cumulative fatigue damage after just one year these differences at the end of the one year period are quantified in table 4 which gives the percentage difference of direction averaged fatigue damage from each wave data source relative to the direction averaged damage estimated using the measured ndbc buoy data i e 100 m i b i b i in the first columns of table 4 and fig 11 corresponding to location a the relative percentage differences of cmems and nww3 show that both wave model datasets yielded notably less damage than the measured buoy data although the magnitudes of these differences are slightly greater for cmems than nww3 at all four speeds in contrast for locations b and c and speeds of 0 10 and 20 knots the relative percentage differences of cmems and nww3 were separated by approximately 16 20 with the cmems predicted damage typically being less than the measured buoy and nww3 predicted damage being greater than the buoy for 30 knots at locations b and c while both cmems and nww3 yielded less damage than the measured buoy data cmems percentage difference magnitudes were nearly double that of nww3 in fig 9 the effect of speed on response bias was only notable for vbm responses at 30 knots and the effect was more pronounced for cmems than nww3 especially at locations b and c these speed effects are evident in the final rows of table 4 and fig 11 which show significantly more damage resulting from the buoy data than the cmems and nww3 data at 30 knots note that given the length of this study and the harsh conditions encountered some of the simulations performed e g 30 knots in a severe sea state were not entirely realistic however these results still provide insight into the significance of which wave hindcast dataset is selected for structural health monitoring furthermore as mentioned in section 2 7 while direction averaging of fatigue damage was necessary for tractability less significant vbm responses and fewer loading cycles resulting from predominant beams seas may have detracted from the observed magnitude of fatigue differences in predominant head seas on the contrary the structural fatigue life assessment discussed by stambaugh et al 2014 for a us coast guard cutter noted that vessels often practice heavy weather avoidance whenever possible although infrequent stambaugh et al 2014 showed that given a critical mission e g search and rescue traveling at undesirable headings and speeds in severe sea states may be unavoidable and result in sudden large increases in fatigue damage the simulations performed in this work yielded equal likelihood of all eight headings meaning a higher occurrence of fatigue damage values from undesirable headings may have skewed the direction averaged data to more significant damage values nevertheless if the differences shown in table 4 and fig 11 continued to accumulate over multiple years the estimated fatigue damages may become drastically different in a fraction of the vessel s operating life as shown for location b in table 4 and fig 11 the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data yielded nearly identical fatigue damage results to the measured buoy data as mentioned in section 3 2 this similarity may imply that significant wave height and wave direction identical between buoy datasets were more influential than peak period and bandwidth which are more directly related to spectral shape however this result may be local to the selected location and it is clear through equation 10 that bandwidth and period zero up crossing period specifically do have a direct impact on fatigue damage to more explicitly examine the effects of a change in significant wave height or peak period on the ship s vbm response and fatigue damage accumulation rate a brief demonstration was performed in head seas at 20 knots in four different sea states ss table 5 shows the percentage change in vbm significant amplitude ζ m caused by a 10 change in significant wave height h s or peak period t p the values of h s and t p were provided in bales 1983 for open ocean in the north pacific and used to construct a bretschneider spectrum the vbm significant amplitudes in the fourth column of table 5 are the values calculated without a 10 change in h s or t p as shown in table 5 a 10 change in significant wave height yielded an identical percentage change in vbm response which was expected given the linear response prediction approach employed in this work i e changing h s just scales the energy of the idealized wave spectrum before it is multiplied by the square of the rao magnitude in equation 2 in contrast a 10 change in peak period showed potential to yield higher magnitude percentage differences in vbm significant amplitude e g ss3 and ss4 in table 5 unlike significant wave height a change in peak period means a shift in the frequency alignment between the wave spectrum and the rao the corresponding percentage changes in fatigue damage due to changes in significant wave height and peak period are given in table 6 the fatigue rates in the second column of table 6 are the values calculated without a 10 change in h s or t p the magnitudes of the fatigue damage rate fluctuations due to a 10 change in significant wave height demonstrate the amplification of vbm differences in the fatigue damage calculation of equation 10 which is a higher order function of stress as shown in table 6 a 10 change in peak period has potential to cause even greater fatigue damage differences than a change in significant wave height in addition to a change in vbm response a shift in peak period also effects the number of loading cycles experienced by the vessel although this demonstration was limited to head seas at 20 knots in four select sea states it showed the transformation of seemingly benign significant wave height and peak period differences into notable differences in vbm response which yielded potentially drastic differences in fatigue damage rate despite the simplicity of the frequency domain response prediction and fatigue damage estimation procedures employed in this work based on the wave data comparisons made in section 3 1 it is expected that similar discrepancies between wave data sources would arise for higher fidelity hydro structural models the relative differences presented here show that selection of a wave data source can heavily influence the estimation of cumulative fatigue damage 4 conclusions in this study at three different locations hindcast wave data from multiple sources and the resultant heave pitch and vbm responses and fatigue damage estimates calculated for 32 speed and heading combinations were compared in 3 h increments for the entire year of 2017 these wave data included multidirectional hindcast model data from cmems and nww3 in addition to measured wave spectra from ndbc buoys differences between these three wave data sources propagated to the vessel s heave pitch and vbm responses at all three locations the vbm response differences were then magnified in the calculation of fatigue damage a higher order function of stress causing notable disagreement in damage estimates after just one year at location a for each speed the cmems and nww3 data sources yielded similar fatigue damage accumulations at the end of the year but this damage was significantly less than the damage estimated using measured buoy data at locations b and c and select speeds cmems and nww3 produced significant differences in fatigue damage when compared to each other and the measured buoy if these differences accrued over multiple years the estimated damage for a vessel may vary drastically depending on the wave data employed in just a fraction of the vessel s service life as mentioned previously the goal of this work was not to comment on the validity of these wave data sources or determine a hierarchy but rather to demonstrate the significance of wave data source selection for response forecasting or hindcasting and digital structural health monitoring although the relationships between different wave model and buoy data sources examined here were potentially dependent on geography this work demonstrated the challenges associated with wave data source selection for time and place specific response predictions and in particular fatigue damage estimates using wave data alone these challenges are more significant now than ever before as the marine industry pushes towards digital vessel monitoring and eventually autonomous vessels both of which remove human judgement from real time decisions while higher fidelity seakeeping and hydro structural models could be employed the propagation of wave data differences to response predictions and fatigue damage estimates seen here suggests that the quality of results would be limited by the accuracy of the input wave data used despite the readily accessible wave data and advanced state of oceanographic models through calculation of over three million responses this work suggested that more study on wave data sources and their selection is required for reliable implementation of vessel response prediction and

21486,the availability of detailed environmental hindcast data opens the door for virtual structural health monitoring however the impact of hindcast wave data selection on the results of such an approach have not been explored while studies on the differences between wave models have been conducted in the past extensions of these comparisons to resultant vessel response predictions and fatigue damage estimates are limited at three separate geographical locations this work compared hindcast wave data from noaa s wavewatch iii nww3 multigrid production hindcast the eu s cmems global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product and national data buoy center buoys in addition to comparisons of wave parameters at each location the resultant heave pitch and vertical bending moment responses and fatigue damage of a destroyer sized naval combatant the dtmb 5415 were compared the novelty of this work lies in its large scope which calculated responses every 3 h for all of 2017 in 32 speed and heading combinations for each location and wave data source the results show that differences between wave data sources propagated to the vessel response predictions these differences were then amplified in the calculation of fatigue damage causing significant discrepancies between data sources after just one year keywords fatigue damage estimation seakeeping prediction structural health monitoring wave hindcast data 1 introduction multiple agencies release global wave forecast and hindcast data on a daily basis that are of interest to mariners and researchers alike these data sources provide wave model output characterizing conditions at specific times and geographic locations often defined by a uniform geospatial grid by latitude and longitude over a region while comparisons of these wave models have been conducted in the past to benchmark performance for oceanographic modeling purposes among other reasons published studies on the consequences of these differences for vessel response prediction are limited it is clear that significant differences between predicted and experienced wave conditions and resultant responses could be catastrophic for a vessel and its crew if sea state severity is underestimated however it is also important to consider that as the marine industry pushes toward digital monitoring and autonomous vessels understanding these differences will become increasingly important as human judgement is removed from the equation furthermore hindcast data present an opportunity for virtual structural health monitoring using vessel position and wave data alone which may be a valuable low cost support mechanism for vessel owners operators and maintainers if viable for these reasons it is of utmost importance to conduct a formal investigation on the significance of which wave data source is selected for design stage and through life analyses of vessel motions structural responses and fatigue damage while subtle differences between predicted vessel motions and structural responses may seem relatively inconsequential for an experienced crew these discrepancies may have serious implications for an unmanned vessel however these differences may also be significant in examples of marine digitalization for conventional platforms for example thompson 2018 introduced and evaluated the concept of virtual hull monitoring using a vessel s known location and measured or numerically modeled wave data the investigation used data from a naval vessel trial and included a comparison of wave hindcast data to those collected via a deployed wave buoy as well as a comparison between stresses derived from strain gauge measurements and those predicted using a spectral fatigue analysis and the hindcast data similarly schirmann et al 2019b demonstrated that wave forecast or hindcast data could be used to predict vessel motions structural responses and fatigue damage resulting from a vessel s known route for the purposes of operational guidance and life cycle management more specifically schirmann et al 2019b discussed tracking damage estimates generated using wave data and periodically balancing fatigue damage among ships in a fleet by adjusting deployment responsibilities hulkkonen et al 2019 also discussed the use of wave model data and a vessel s known locations to track the fatigue damage accumulated by the vessel as well as the uncertainties associated with this method of virtual monitoring e g vessel loading conditions corrosion etc similar studies such as mondoro et al 2016 and zhu and collette 2017 have considered means of structural health monitoring using limited onboard response measurements to update a vessel s operational profile and expected responses in unseen operating conditions magoga et al 2019 proposed a fatigue life updating method based on in service measurements and maintenance data and nielsen et al 2011 explored the implementation of a real time onboard decision support system that considers fatigue damage accumulation rates a more recent study conducted by thompson 2020 further investigated the accuracy of virtual hull monitoring via wave hindcast data using strain gauge measurements from a naval vessel the study compared structural responses calculated using wave data from different hindcast data sources which aligns well with the goals of the present work while the results of thompson 2020 were very promising for this method of structural health monitoring and showed agreement between stress spectra generated using different wave hindcast sources it was noted that the data considered were limited to a two week cruise with a relatively narrow set of operating conditions the present study seeks to make these comparisons between wave data sets over an extended period of time with a broad set of operating conditions considered while the use of wave forecast or hindcast data to support operational maintenance and deployment decisions seems promising and beneficial uncertainty in the wave data used may overshadow the benefits of this application for example while differences between wave hindcast data may seem insignificant when looking at minimal differences between resultant structural responses fatigue damage estimation is a higher order function of these responses meaning the discrepancies between wave models may be amplified drastically the primary goal of this work is to compare vessel motions structural responses and fatigue damage predicted using data from different hindcast wave data sources to determine the significance of wave data source selection in these analyses preliminary results of this work were originally published in schirmann et al 2019a time and place specific wave forecast and hindcast data have been made widely available by agencies such as noaa s national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the eu s copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems in addition to these theoretical wave models although generally confined to coastal regions a wide array of wave measurement buoys provide measured sea spectra that are also of interest to vessel operators and researchers often as validation of the wave models satellite measurements have also been employed for sea state characterization and in some cases as data assimilated into wave hindcasts other work such as that of nielsen 2006 nielsen et al 2018 and duz et al 2019 has focused on sea state estimation using vessel motions i e ship as a wave buoy approaches nielsen et al 2019 recently published a framework for extension of ship as a wave buoy approaches to incorporate data from multiple vessels there have been numerous comparison studies on the differences between data from forecast and hindcast wave models as well as real world measurements from buoys and satellites however these comparison studies focus on wind and wave conditions rather than vessel motions and structural responses to name a few recent studies stopa and cheung 2014 compared wind speeds and wave heights between different weather models using buoy data and satellite altimeters for several geographically diverse regions and campos and guedes soares 2016 compared three wave hindcasts with satellite data over a large region in the north atlantic ocean guedes soares and moan 1991 also examined the effect of uncertainty in wave statistics on fatigue damage showing that wave data source selection has been an ongoing concern in the marine industry for decades rather than further validation of existing wave models or investigation of the differences between them from an oceanographic standpoint the goal of this work was to examine the effects of these differences on vessel response predictions and fatigue damage estimates in this work vessel responses and fatigue damage estimates resulting from different hindcast wave data sources were compared at two locations off the coast of alaska and one location near hawaii the wave data compared in this work came from noaa s wavewatch iii nww3 multigrid production hindcast noaa national centers for environmental prediction 2018 the eu s cmems global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product fernandez and aouf 2018 and the national data buoy center noaa s national data buoy center center of excellence in marine technology 2018 the heave pitch vertical bending moments and fatigue damage of a ship predicted using these data sources operating with an array of speed and heading combinations were compared for the full year of 2017 although the most compelling findings in the following discussion relate to vertical bending moments and fatigue damage for virtual structural monitoring heave and pitch were included to show the implications of wave data differences for operational guidance furthermore in comparison to heave and pitch vertical bending moments are difficult and expensive to measure onboard a vessel as such establishing a similarity between the influence of wave data differences on motions and structural responses may prove beneficial for future studies this comparison approach highlights the impact of wave data selection on ship response predictions and fatigue estimates without addressing uncertainties from ship modeling itself e g 2 d strip theory idealization locations of the vertical and longitudinal centers of gravity etc 2 methodology the following section discusses the approach employed in this work to investigate the significance of wave data source selection for vessel response predictions and fatigue damage estimates section 2 1 discusses the three wave data comparison locations considered in this work and section 2 2 discusses the simulations performed at each location sections 2 3 and 2 4 discuss the wave model and buoy data considered at each location respectively and the breadth of this study is summarized in section 2 5 sections 2 6 and 2 7 describe the response prediction and fatigue damage estimation procedures employed in this work and sections 2 8 and 2 9 discuss the metrics and parameters used to compare wave data sources 2 1 comparison locations three locations were selected for comparison of wave data from different sources as well as vessel response predictions and cumulative fatigue damage estimates generated using these wave data two locations were selected off the coast of the aleutian islands in alaska and the third location was chosen near the northwestern hawaiian islands fig 1 gives a broad overview of both regions and the three locations within them in the pacific ocean the two regions identified in fig 1 are enhanced in fig 2 these two regions were chosen in part because they had wave data available from multiple wave data sources at varying geospatial grid resolutions and had potential to experience severe sea states that would add to the breadth of this study within the two regions these three specific locations were selected because they were close in proximity to buoys managed by the national data buoy center ndbc with measured directional wave spectra available additionally the geospatial output grids defined as the locations where wave hindcast data were available from multiple wave data sources overlapped exactly at these locations the three analysis locations where the considered wave model grids overlapped and the locations of the nearby ndbc buoys are described in table 1 table 1 includes the approximate distance between each analysis location and the nearby buoy s location which was calculated using https www gpsvisualizer com calculators the outlined regions of fig 2 are enhanced further in fig 3 to show the placement of the buoys relative to the three analysis locations 2 2 simulations performed the dtmb 5415 a destroyer sized naval combatant described in stern et al 2011 was placed at each location for the full year of 2017 i e from january 1 december 31 2017 table 2 provides select characteristics of the dtmb 5415 that were used in hydrodynamic modeling for this study vessel response simulations were carried out using all combinations of four speeds and eight compass headings which resulted in 32 total cases for each given time location and wave data source the four speeds tested were 0 10 20 and 30 knots and the eight headings were evenly spaced on 0 315 in increments of 45 in each of these 32 test cases heave pitch and vertical bending moment vbm responses were predicted for every 3 h time increment during the one year exposure time three hour intervals were selected to ensure data availability from all wave data sources at each time step due to the large volume of data and test cases considered this work was performed using a high performance computing cluster provided by advanced research computing at the university of michigan ann arbor the predicted vbm responses were used to estimate the fatigue damage accumulated amidships over time the wave data and resultant predicted responses and fatigue damage estimates from different wave data sources were then compared 2 3 wave model data four nww3 hindcast datasets and one cmems hindcast dataset were used in this study the availability of each dataset at the three locations is indicated in table 3 these datasets had varying geospatial resolutions which are indicated in the dataset name i e nww3 glo 30 min had an approximate latitude longitude resolution of 30 arcminutes or 0 5 note however that these resolutions were approximate and not always consistent between latitude and longitude due to the actual geospatial increments and different masking patterns in the datasets it was only possible to overlap two of the considered nww3 datasets and the one cmems dataset at locations a and b therefore one nww3 dataset was exchanged for another when shifting the analysis from location a to location b table 3 also notes that while nww3 glo 30 min data were available at location c they were not considered in this study due to the preliminary findings of schirmann et al 2019a at locations a and b which showed that nww3 grid resolution did not matter these results at locations a and b are revisited in the following discussion 2 3 1 nww3 multigrid production hindcast as shown in table 3 the four nww3 grids used in order of increasing spatial resolution were the global 30 arcminute grid nww3 glo 30 min alaskan 10 arcminute grid nww3 ak 10 min the east pacific 10 arcminute grid nww3 ep 10 min and the alaskan 4 arcminute grid nww3 ak 4 min note that within the same region e g near alaska as spatial resolution increases the geographical area with available data typically decreases the nww3 glo 30 min grid spatial domain includes a majority of the world s oceans while the nww3 ak 10 min grid is masked to cover a large coastal region off the coast of alaska and the nww3 ak 4 min grid covers a less expansive area off the coast of alaska the nww3 ep 10 min grid covers a large region off the western coast of the united states as well as a separate region surrounding the hawaiian island chain that contains location c the nww3 multigrid production hindcast that provided these datasets used the ncep s global forecast system gfs winds as input forcing to the multi grid spectral wave model wavewatch iii noaa national centers for environmental prediction 2018 there was no wave data assimilation from wave buoys satellites or other sources included in these data meaning no real world wave data were used to correct the hindcasted output at a given time and location the nww3 datasets characterized the wave conditions using a varying number of independent directional wave partitions each defined by a significant wave height peak period and mean direction detailed information about the nww3 partitioning scheme can be found in the wavewatch iii development group ww3dg 2016 2 3 2 cmems global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product the single cmems grid analyzed in this study referred to as cmems glo 5 min in the following discussion to be consistent with the nww3 abbreviations comes from the global ocean waves analysis and forecasting product global analysis forecast wav 001 027 this dataset covers a majority of the world s oceans with an approximate geospatial resolution of 5 arcminutes and uses winds and ice fields from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf to force the meteo france wave model mfwam fernandez and aouf 2018 significant wave height data are assimilated in this wave model from satellite altimeters field output wave data for a given time and location were provided as three independent directional wave partitions wind waves primary swell and secondary swell to maintain consistency between different datasets the specific classification of each wave partition type was not used to differentiate between partitions in this analysis i e the assumed spectral shape was not modified based on partition type each of the three wave partitions from cmems glo 5 min was characterized by a significant wave height mean period and mean direction 2 3 3 nww3 and cmems idealized wave spectra for all of the wave model datasets used in this work a bretschneider ittc two parameter spectrum was constructed for each independent directional wave partition at a given time step and location using the provided significant wave height and period this step was necessary because only characteristic parameters were provided for each wave partition rather than fully defined spectra note that the copernicus climate change service does provide hindcast 2 d wave spectra however to limit the scope of the current work only one data source with 2 d spectra was used which was the measured wave buoy data described in the following section nevertheless comparisons between the copernicus data options 2 d spectra and cmems directional wave partitions are worthy of further study 2 4 wave buoy data the measured ndbc buoy wave data for a given time step and location were provided as fully defined 1 d spectra with coefficients included for a directional fourier series expansion to appropriately spread the spectral energy on 0 2 π radians the directional spreading function using the four parameters r 1 r 2 α 1 and α 2 which were provided in the datasets for each discrete frequency f is defined in equation 1 1 d f α 1 π 1 2 2 3 r 1 cos α α 1 1 6 r 2 cos 2 α α 2 in equation 1 α is the direction that the waves come from measured clockwise from true north and integration of d f α on 0 2 π radians yields a value of 1 0 note that the weighting terms 2 3 and 1 6 discussed in earle et al 1999 are incorporated in equation 1 which noaa s national data buoy center center of excellence in marine technology 2018 presented as an option to avoid negative values in the spreading function through smoothing as noted in earle et al 1999 without these weighting terms the directional resolution half power width of this spreading function would be 88 with these weighting terms this directional resolution metric is increased to 130 after transforming the 1 d wave spectrum using the provided spreading parameters for each frequency the resulting 2 d spectrum was partitioned into eight evenly spaced bins covering 45 each each of the eight bins was defined by a 1 d wave spectrum and the mean direction within the bin both resulting from integration over the bin s directional spread for the purposes of this analysis the eight bins were then treated as eight directional wave partitions for calculation of the vessel s responses in contrast to the wave model data because the measured spectral shape associated with each directional wave partition was known for the buoy data construction of a bretschneider spectrum was not necessary however to investigate the importance of spectral shape on these analyses an additional experiment was completed at location b in which the mean period and significant wave height of each of the eight bins were used to generate a bretschneider spectrum while peak period could have been used to construct the idealized spectrum the measured spectrum in a single bin was not necessarily unimodal so mean period was selected nevertheless either period metric would have yielded a change in spectral shape relative to the measured data which was the desired effect this additional experiment at location b is indicated in table 3 as in the other experiments simulations in all 32 heading speed combinations were completed for the full one year period and the resultant response predictions and fatigue damage estimates were compared to the buoy data results using measured spectra as well as the wave model data results 2 5 summary of study breadth as outlined in sections 2 2 2 4 and summarized in table 3 a minimum of three wave data sources and their resultant responses and fatigue damage were compared at each of the three locations for a given 3 h time increment of the one year period as shown by the check marks in table 3 between the three locations 12 different wave data sources including repeats between locations and variants of the sources i e bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data were tested for each of these 12 wave data source instances considered and 2920 3 h time increments in the year 2017 32 speed and heading combinations were simulated to generate 3 types of response predictions heave pitch and vertical bending moment vbm combination of these numbers 12 2 920 32 3 yields a total of 3 363 840 responses predicted in this work as mentioned in section 2 2 these response prediction calculations were performed using a high performance computing cluster and the methodology presented in the following section 2 6 2 6 response prediction this section details the frequency domain approach used to predict heave pitch and vbm responses for the dtmb 5415 naval combatant hull form as mentioned previously the wave data from all sources were analyzed in 3 h time increments a required assumption to obtain cumulative fatigue damage from this frequency domain approach was that the wave environment and operating conditions were stationary over the entire 3 h period from 1 5 h before to 1 5 h after the specified wave data time during real world operation of a ship forward speed would lead to variation in the vessel s location during this period as a result even if conditions were temporally stationary the wave conditions seen by the vessel could change the primary goal of this work was not to simulate a ship at sea for a whole year as a realistic demonstration but rather to make controlled comparisons between wave data sources and their resultant responses and fatigue damage while forward speed was considered for the sake of response prediction and fatigue damage estimation the vessel s physical location was assumed constant over the 3 h window this constraint is analogous to a scenario in which a ship travels within a region that is temporally and spatially stationary during the 3 h period in addition to the assumption of stationarity the frequency domain approach employed in this work assumed that the vessel s response was a linear function of the wave spectrum for each time increment location wave data source speed and heading the pseudo response spectrum due to wave partition w p was calculated using equation 2 where j specifies the response type heave pitch or vbm nonlinear response calculations would be expected to yield higher bending moments in some of the extreme sea states encountered with corresponding increases in fatigue damage 2 s j w p ω 0 s w p ω 0 r a o j w p ω 0 2 in equation 2 s w p ω 0 is the wave spectrum for a single directional wave partition and r a o j w p ω 0 is the response amplitude operator rao magnitude for response type j as a function of wave frequency ω 0 note that this rao is also a function of the vessel s speed and heading relative to each wave partition which is the reason for inclusion of the w p subscript shipmo bm a linear 2 d strip theory code developed at the university of michigan by beck and troesch 1990 was used to calculate raos for this work heave pitch and vbm raos were calculated at all four speeds and in 5 relative heading θ increments on 0 355 for each wave partition the rao with the closest θ value to the calculated relative heading between the waves and ship was used directional interpolation between raos was deemed unnecessary because the 5 relative heading increments yielded minimal differences between raos it should also be noted that wave spreading functions were not applied to any of the wave partitions from any of the wave data sources this decision was made to avoid unfairly influencing any of the wave data sources with arbitrary spreading functions prior to comparisons using the formula for the k t h spectral moment given in equation 3 and solving through trapezoidal integration the zeroth k 0 second k 2 and fourth k 4 spectral moments for response type j due to a single wave partition m j k w p were calculated lloyd 1989 zeroth spectral moments were calculated for all three response types but second and fourth spectral moments were only calculated for the vbm responses the use of these vbm spectral moments for fatigue damage estimation is discussed in section 2 7 equation 3 accounts for the doppler shift between wave frequency and the vessel s encounter frequency due to forward speed u and relative heading to the wave partition μ w p this doppler shift takes effect when k 0 in equation 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 3 m j k w p 0 ω 0 ω 0 2 u g cos μ w p k s j w p ω 0 d ω 0 through the principle of linear superposition the k t h total spectral moment for response type j m j k t due to all n wave partitions for a given location time wave data source speed and heading was calculated via the summation presented in equation 4 4 m j k t w p 1 n m j k w p using the zeroth k 0 total spectral moment m j 0 t resulting from equation 4 the total response standard deviation σ j t and significant amplitude ζ s t were calculated using equations 5 and 6 respectively 5 σ j t m j 0 t 6 ζ j t 2 σ j t the vessel response comparisons in the following discussion are made using the response significant amplitudes ζ j t averaged over all eight headings for a given location time wave data source and speed while directional averaging was necessary to make the following analysis and discussion tractable given the large amount of data the implications of this decision are discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 2 7 fatigue damage estimation the purpose of the fatigue analysis performed in this work was not to exactly model a specific structural detail but instead to have a representative calculation for comparison between wave data sources in the previous work of schirmann et al 2019a a narrow banded fatigue damage approximation was used to simplify the analysis although individual wave partitions of the wave model data were constructed using narrow banded bretschneider spectra due to the multidirectionality of the wave data many of the analyzed 3 h time windows were inherently wide banded furthermore the wave data measured from the buoy were not necessarily narrow banded therefore in this extension of schirmann et al 2019a it was deemed necessary to utilize a fatigue damage estimation approach that addressed the bandwidth of the vbm responses following the guide for fatigue assessment of offshore structures american bureau of shipping 2018 from the american bureau of shipping abs this study employed the spectral fatigue analysis of wirsching and light 1980 which incorporates a rainflow correction factor based on bandwidth as described in the following paragraphs note that as a result of this improved fatigue damage estimation procedure and adjustments in the wave data used for response prediction some of the preliminary results presented in schirmann et al 2019a have changed to characterize the number of fatigue cycles experienced during a given 3 h exposure period it was necessary to calculate the zero up crossing frequency using equation 7 7 f z 1 2 π m m 2 t m m 0 t in equation 7 m m 0 t and m m 2 w p are the zeroth k 0 and second k 2 total vbm spectral moments respectively which were calculated using equations 3 and 4 similarly the bandwidth ε of the total vbm response was calculated using equation 8 which additionally considers the fourth k 4 total vbm spectral moment 8 ε 1 m m 2 t 2 m m 0 t m m 4 t prior to fatigue damage calculation it was also necessary to transform the standard deviation of the total vbm response σ m t into a stress standard deviation σ s t using the section modulus s m at a select location within the cross section of the ship this transformation is defined in equation 9 9 σ s t σ m t s m a bottom cross section modulus of 3 77 m 3 for the dtmb 5415 was selected from ashe et al 2009 as a representative value to compare cumulative fatigue damage between wave data sources the damage d accumulated by the vessel during a 3 h interval for a given location wave data source speed and heading was then estimated using equation 10 american bureau of shipping 2018 wirsching and light 1980 which is based on palmgren miner s rule in this theoretical fatigue damage formulation a nondimensional fatigue damage value equal to 1 0 corresponds to structural failure note that palgren miner s rule assumes linear

each location and speed using the average damage value over all eight ship headings as mentioned previously the implications of direction averaging are revisited in sections 3 2 and 3 3 2 8 comparison methods although several comparison metrics were considered and tested one metric monthly mean bias was selected for presentation in the following analysis to quantify the differences between wave data sources and their resultant heave pitch and vbm responses bias was selected in particular because it preserves the sign of the differences between wave data sources monthly mean bias b i a s was calculated using equation 14 which was adapted from a bias equation used in campos and guedes soares 2016 for comparison of wave hindcast data and satellite measurements analyzing the data on a monthly basis allowed potential seasonal variation in the relationships between data sources to be uncovered 14 b i a s 1 n i 1 n m i b i in equation 14 m i was the value from or resulting from a given wave model nww3 or cmems data source at time step i and b i was the value from or resulting from the nearby buoy data using measured spectra at time step i when comparing the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data to the measured buoy data at location b the bretschneider reconstruction results were used as m i for heave pitch and vbm responses separate monthly mean bias values were calculated for each speed at a given speed the differences between m i and b i were averaged over all n 3 h time steps for all eight directions considered in the month i e n 8 number of 3 h time intervals in the month when comparing mean wave directions the absolute value was taken in the numerator of equation 14 to yield the monthly mean absolute bias because the sign of the difference was not significant for direction note that although the buoy was treated as the foundation for the comparisons made using equation 14 there was no intention to suggest that the buoy measurements were the ground truth or even that they were more accurate than the wave model data the goal of this work was not to validate or find fault with any of the tested wave data sources but rather to analyze the differences between these sources and the effects on response predictions and fatigue damage estimates 2 9 wave data comparison parameters five characteristic parameters were used for wave data comparison in the following analysis significant wave height mean period spectral peak period mean direction and bandwidth for a given time location and wave data source the total wave spectrum was calculated by summing the independent wave partition spectra at each wave frequency the significant wave height and mean period were then calculated using conventional methods from this total wave spectrum the spectral peak period was the wave period corresponding to the maximum value in the total wave spectrum which is an indicator of the dominant wave partition period the mean direction was determined by taking the average of individual wave partition mean directions weighted by the zeroth moment of the wave partition spectra these mean direction calculations were performed using vectors to avoid issues with circularity the wave direction data presented in the following discussion are defined as the direction of wave propagation with 0 and 90 corresponding to north and east respectively the bandwidth of the wave spectrum was calculated following equations 3 4 and 8 the five characteristic values described here allowed direct comparisons of wave data sources with differing data formats 3 results and discussion the following section compares wave data resultant responses and fatigue damage estimates from different wave data sources at three different locations as mentioned previously some of the results and discussion for locations a and b were adapted from schirmann et al 2019a however some of these previously discussed results have been updated due to an improved fatigue damage estimation procedure and adjustments in the wave data used for response prediction 3 1 wave data comparisons a time series for july 2017 showing the significant wave height mean period spectral peak period mean direction and bandwidth of the input wave data at location a is shown in fig 4 july 2017 was selected because it had the lowest monthly mean significant wave height measured at ndbc buoy 46075 for the year meaning wave conditions were relatively benign the nww3 ak 10 min and nww3 ak 4 min plots overlap nearly perfectly which implies that spatial resolution was not a large factor in the nww3 data sets for location a specifically this nearly identical agreement continued for the entire year which also yielded nearly identical response predictions and fatigue damage estimates it was found that this agreement also held true between nww3 ak 10 min and nww3 glo 30 min at location b it is possible that locations closer to the coast or in different geographical regions would yield larger differences between nww3 spatial resolutions and the higher resolution grids include points that are not included in the other data sets which are useful for near shore analyses nevertheless at these two locations the differences in spatial resolutions of the nww3 grids did not have a significant effect therefore in the following discussion only the ak 10 min grid is presented for locations a and b the ak 10 min wave data were selected as the representative nww3 data set because they were available at both analysis locations as indicated in table 3 due to the findings at locations a and b only one nww3 grid ep 10 min was analyzed at location c as shown in the july 2017 time series of fig 4 while the significant wave heights from nww3 cmems and the buoy appear to show reasonably strong agreement there are times in which the curves deviate from each other even in these benign conditions the mean period and direction data from all three sources also agree reasonably well excluding a few time steps where the buoy appears to be approximately 180 out of phase with the two models but the spectral peak periods of these data sets include stretches of notable disagreement as mentioned in section 2 9 the peak period is an indicator of the dominant wave partition period some areas of disagreement in the spectral peak periods between wave data sources may be due to time lags in wave system arrivals to the analyzed location additionally the differences in spectral peak periods may have resulted from the required assumption of spectral shape bretschneider for the wave model data which was also influenced by the wave period definition mean vs peak provided by the wave data source the bandwidth time series shows that the measured buoy data typically had a lower bandwidth than the wave models which was unexpected because the wave models were constructed using narrow banded bretschneider spectra for each directional wave partition although complex and not easily quantifiable the effect of these peak period and bandwidth discrepancies on the predicted responses and fatigue damage estimates may be significant a time series of the five wave data parameters for a november 2017 storm with severe wave conditions at location a is shown in fig 5 once again nww3 and cmems show reasonably strong agreement however at the highest significant wave heights seen nww3 and cmems underestimate the significant wave height relative to the buoy data better agreement is present in the spectral peak period here than previously in the july time series this agreement is largely attributed to the selected period metric because these large sea states have a high likelihood of being dominated by a single wave partition once again the measured buoy data appear to be more narrow banded than the nww3 and cmems wave model data the mean wave periods and directions show reasonably strong agreement for the entire storm plots of the monthly mean bias in significant wave height mean period spectral peak period mean direction and bandwidth calculated using equation 14 are shown in fig 6 for locations a b and c location b also includes the monthly mean bias plots of the bretschneider reconstruction which was an idealized spectrum created using the measured significant wave height and mean period from the buoy as a result all the bias values of significant wave height mean period and mean direction for the bretschneider reconstruction are zero however the peak period and bandwidth bias plots show notable disagreements between the bretschneider reconstruction and the buoy data because these parameters were not preserved in the reconstruction note that if the reconstruction was performed using peak period instead of mean period the peak period bias values of the bretschneider reconstruction would be zero and the mean period bias values would be nonzero in fig 6 the monthly mean bias values in significant wave height at all three locations show that subtle disagreement exists between the wave data sources that were used to generate response predictions and fatigue damage estimates fig 6 also reveals that while the mean periods of all three wave data sources agree reasonably well cmems tends to overestimate the spectral peak period relative to nww3 and the buoy which may also be the result of the period definition differences between nww3 and cmems datasets at location b the peak period bias values of the bretschneider buoy reconstruction and the nww3 datasets are very similar which is interesting because peak period was used to construct the nww3 idealized spectra while mean period was used for the buoy reconstruction the mean absolute bias in mean direction shows strong agreement between nww3 and cmems in general but both absolute bias values indicate a difference relative to the buoy this difference reinforces the fact that the buoy data should not necessarily be treated as the ground truth as mentioned in section 2 4 the directional resolution half power width of the buoy data used in this work was 130 which may have led to the directional discrepancies between the buoy and wave model data as shown by the differences outlined here wave data source selection for response prediction and fatigue damage estimation should not be trivialized 3 2 response comparisons time series plots of the direction averaged heave pitch and vbm significant amplitudes for july 2017 are shown in fig 7 for a speed of 20 knots at location a the significant wave height time series that was originally shown in fig 4 is also included here for comparison purposes it can be seen in fig 7 that the differences between significant wave heights from each wave data source propagated to the vessel responses note that while only the 20 knots responses are shown this propagation was also evident for the other three forward speeds as well as at locations b and c the direction averaged response time series plots for a speed of 10 knots in the november storm examined previously are shown in fig 8 which also shows that relationships between significant wave heights from different data sources propagated to all three responses while significant wave height is included in figs 7 and 8 for reference the discrepancies between responses are also the result of differences in the other four wave parameters of figs 4 and 5 monthly mean bias plots for direction averaged heave pitch and vbm significant amplitudes are shown in fig 9 the four speeds are plotted as different markers and the lines indicate the monthly mean bias over all speeds as in fig 6 location b includes the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data the significant wave height mean bias values from fig 6 are also included for comparison in fig 9 the significant wave height biases of nww3 and cmems propagated to the response significant amplitude biases for all wave data sources and locations variation in speed did not have a significant impact on bias excluding vbm predictions at 30 knots as mentioned in section 2 6 while direction averaging was necessary to make this discussion tractable there was certainly variation in response magnitudes and the resultant bias values as the vessel s relative heading to the wave partition s changed for example in general predominant head seas yield a much higher pitch and vbm response than predominant beam seas as a result large bias values in predominant head seas may not be adequately portrayed by the direction averaged values if the beam seas responses from all wave data sources were near zero therefore the key takeaway from figs 7 9 are that the differences in wave data from different sources were propagated to the vessel s responses but the effect of these differences varied with speed and heading despite the notable peak period and bandwidth differences recall that the significant wave height mean period and mean direction were identical between the measured and bretschneider reconstructed buoy data shown in fig 6 for location b the resultant responses of the two datasets are much more similar to each other than to the cmems and nww3 data as shown in the bias plots of fig 9 this similarity between buoy data with different spectral shapes implies that significant wave height and wave direction may have been more significant for response prediction than peak period and bandwidth which are more directly linked to spectral shape than the former two parameters although wave peak period and wave bandwidth may not have been excessively detrimental to the predicted motions and vbm responses examined here these parameters may have still had a significant impact in the calculation of fatigue damage which is discussed further in section 3 3 to examine the propagation of bandwidth from wave spectra to the resultant vbm responses fig 10 shows the direction averaged monthly wave and vbm bandwidth bias values as a function of vessel speed in addition to the wave bandwidth bias plots from fig 6 for comparison although the plots of fig 10 are direction averaged despite bandwidth being heavily dependent on forward speed and direction through the encounter frequency fig 10 does show that bandwidth differences exist between wave models which directly influence fatigue damage as shown in equation 10 the second row of fig 10 may be the most informative because it is not influenced by forward speed comparing the wave bandwidth of the first row with the vbm response bandwidth of the second row it appears that the vbm raos may act as a filter on the wave model spectra which leads to better agreement with the measured wave buoy data despite wave bandwidth differences for the three rows with forward speed it seems that the bandwidths of cmems and nww3 are in better agreement than their respective wave datasets however for location b the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data remains different than cmems nww3 and the measured buoy data 3 3 fatigue damage comparisons the direction averaged cumulative fatigue damage at locations a b and c and the nearby buoys are shown in fig 11 for each curve the 13 plotted values include an assumed damage value of 0 0 at the beginning of the year and 12 values corresponding to the cumulative damage at the end of each month including all prior months damage the horizontal black lines at d 0 06 are included for reference to the ordinate scale between speeds in fig 11 it is evident that the differences between wave data sources led to notable differences in cumulative fatigue damage after just one year these differences at the end of the one year period are quantified in table 4 which gives the percentage difference of direction averaged fatigue damage from each wave data source relative to the direction averaged damage estimated using the measured ndbc buoy data i e 100 m i b i b i in the first columns of table 4 and fig 11 corresponding to location a the relative percentage differences of cmems and nww3 show that both wave model datasets yielded notably less damage than the measured buoy data although the magnitudes of these differences are slightly greater for cmems than nww3 at all four speeds in contrast for locations b and c and speeds of 0 10 and 20 knots the relative percentage differences of cmems and nww3 were separated by approximately 16 20 with the cmems predicted damage typically being less than the measured buoy and nww3 predicted damage being greater than the buoy for 30 knots at locations b and c while both cmems and nww3 yielded less damage than the measured buoy data cmems percentage difference magnitudes were nearly double that of nww3 in fig 9 the effect of speed on response bias was only notable for vbm responses at 30 knots and the effect was more pronounced for cmems than nww3 especially at locations b and c these speed effects are evident in the final rows of table 4 and fig 11 which show significantly more damage resulting from the buoy data than the cmems and nww3 data at 30 knots note that given the length of this study and the harsh conditions encountered some of the simulations performed e g 30 knots in a severe sea state were not entirely realistic however these results still provide insight into the significance of which wave hindcast dataset is selected for structural health monitoring furthermore as mentioned in section 2 7 while direction averaging of fatigue damage was necessary for tractability less significant vbm responses and fewer loading cycles resulting from predominant beams seas may have detracted from the observed magnitude of fatigue differences in predominant head seas on the contrary the structural fatigue life assessment discussed by stambaugh et al 2014 for a us coast guard cutter noted that vessels often practice heavy weather avoidance whenever possible although infrequent stambaugh et al 2014 showed that given a critical mission e g search and rescue traveling at undesirable headings and speeds in severe sea states may be unavoidable and result in sudden large increases in fatigue damage the simulations performed in this work yielded equal likelihood of all eight headings meaning a higher occurrence of fatigue damage values from undesirable headings may have skewed the direction averaged data to more significant damage values nevertheless if the differences shown in table 4 and fig 11 continued to accumulate over multiple years the estimated fatigue damages may become drastically different in a fraction of the vessel s operating life as shown for location b in table 4 and fig 11 the bretschneider reconstruction of the buoy data yielded nearly identical fatigue damage results to the measured buoy data as mentioned in section 3 2 this similarity may imply that significant wave height and wave direction identical between buoy datasets were more influential than peak period and bandwidth which are more directly related to spectral shape however this result may be local to the selected location and it is clear through equation 10 that bandwidth and period zero up crossing period specifically do have a direct impact on fatigue damage to more explicitly examine the effects of a change in significant wave height or peak period on the ship s vbm response and fatigue damage accumulation rate a brief demonstration was performed in head seas at 20 knots in four different sea states ss table 5 shows the percentage change in vbm significant amplitude ζ m caused by a 10 change in significant wave height h s or peak period t p the values of h s and t p were provided in bales 1983 for open ocean in the north pacific and used to construct a bretschneider spectrum the vbm significant amplitudes in the fourth column of table 5 are the values calculated without a 10 change in h s or t p as shown in table 5 a 10 change in significant wave height yielded an identical percentage change in vbm response which was expected given the linear response prediction approach employed in this work i e changing h s just scales the energy of the idealized wave spectrum before it is multiplied by the square of the rao magnitude in equation 2 in contrast a 10 change in peak period showed potential to yield higher magnitude percentage differences in vbm significant amplitude e g ss3 and ss4 in table 5 unlike significant wave height a change in peak period means a shift in the frequency alignment between the wave spectrum and the rao the corresponding percentage changes in fatigue damage due to changes in significant wave height and peak period are given in table 6 the fatigue rates in the second column of table 6 are the values calculated without a 10 change in h s or t p the magnitudes of the fatigue damage rate fluctuations due to a 10 change in significant wave height demonstrate the amplification of vbm differences in the fatigue damage calculation of equation 10 which is a higher order function of stress as shown in table 6 a 10 change in peak period has potential to cause even greater fatigue damage differences than a change in significant wave height in addition to a change in vbm response a shift in peak period also effects the number of loading cycles experienced by the vessel although this demonstration was limited to head seas at 20 knots in four select sea states it showed the transformation of seemingly benign significant wave height and peak period differences into notable differences in vbm response which yielded potentially drastic differences in fatigue damage rate despite the simplicity of the frequency domain response prediction and fatigue damage estimation procedures employed in this work based on the wave data comparisons made in section 3 1 it is expected that similar discrepancies between wave data sources would arise for higher fidelity hydro structural models the relative differences presented here show that selection of a wave data source can heavily influence the estimation of cumulative fatigue damage 4 conclusions in this study at three different locations hindcast wave data from multiple sources and the resultant heave pitch and vbm responses and fatigue damage estimates calculated for 32 speed and heading combinations were compared in 3 h increments for the entire year of 2017 these wave data included multidirectional hindcast model data from cmems and nww3 in addition to measured wave spectra from ndbc buoys differences between these three wave data sources propagated to the vessel s heave pitch and vbm responses at all three locations the vbm response differences were then magnified in the calculation of fatigue damage a higher order function of stress causing notable disagreement in damage estimates after just one year at location a for each speed the cmems and nww3 data sources yielded similar fatigue damage accumulations at the end of the year but this damage was significantly less than the damage estimated using measured buoy data at locations b and c and select speeds cmems and nww3 produced significant differences in fatigue damage when compared to each other and the measured buoy if these differences accrued over multiple years the estimated damage for a vessel may vary drastically depending on the wave data employed in just a fraction of the vessel s service life as mentioned previously the goal of this work was not to comment on the validity of these wave data sources or determine a hierarchy but rather to demonstrate the significance of wave data source selection for response forecasting or hindcasting and digital structural health monitoring although the relationships between different wave model and buoy data sources examined here were potentially dependent on geography this work demonstrated the challenges associated with wave data source selection for time and place specific response predictions and in particular fatigue damage estimates using wave data alone these challenges are more significant now than ever before as the marine industry pushes towards digital vessel monitoring and eventually autonomous vessels both of which remove human judgement from real time decisions while higher fidelity seakeeping and hydro structural models could be employed the propagation of wave data differences to response predictions and fatigue damage estimates seen here suggests that the quality of results would be limited by the accuracy of the input wave data used despite the readily accessible wave data and advanced state of oceanographic models through calculation of over three million responses this work suggested that more study on wave data sources and their selection is required for reliable implementation of vessel response prediction and through life fatigue analyses using wave data alone credit authorship contribution statement matthew l schirmann conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original

21487,in past decades the technologies of ship building and engine manufacturing have developed quickly which may alter underwater radiated noise urn source levels the urn from many merchant ships was recorded by self sustained hydrophones mounted on the seabed near the ship lanes in the yellow sea of china twenty seven samples of the recording are selected based on iso and ansi standards the sources were assumed obeying gaussian distribution in depth direction and the ship source spectra were computed as a logarithmic average of source spectra calculated for different positions of ships to improve the fault tolerance of source position information a key conclusion is that the estimated broadband ship noise source levels between 20 and 1000 hz by randi 3 model are generally much greater than the measured results for ships whose length is larger than 200 m though they are close for ships with length being less than 200 m furthermore the data samples were divided into two categories to analyze with each category the 20 1000 hz broadband noise of modern merchant ships is not highly correlated to ship length but closely related to ship speed finally noise source spectrum models of the two ship categories were established which express ship noise source spectra as a function of frequency ship length and ship speed the models can represent experimental results properly keywords merchant ship source spectrum model radiated noise yellow sea of china 1 introduction the detecting frequency range of sonar has gradually extended to low or very low frequency recently ocean ambient noise is the main background field of sonar detection systems of all the ocean noise generators merchant ships are the principal contributor over the low frequency band from 5 hz to as high as 1 khz wenz 1962 commercial shipping has developed rapidly in the past century the expansion of shipping and ships correlates with the increase in deep ocean noise levels ross analyzed the noise levels measured in the mid 20th century and suggested that the low frequency noise was increasing at an average rate of about 0 5 db per year ross 2005 he also pointed out that this trend would not be sustained the rate was later proved to be 0 2 db year by analyzing the ocean ambient data measured in the northeast pacific from 1978 to 1986 chapman and price 2011 most recently andrew howe and mercer s measurement in the northeast pacific showed a flat or slightly decreasing trend in low frequency noise andrew et al 2011 sound spectrum generated by a ship consists of two parts a broadband component created by propeller cavitation and a number of narrow band line spectra created by both propeller cavitation the blade lines and internal machinery engine generators pumps etc however narrow band line spectra are difficult to predict therefore more have focused on the representation of broadband spectra the noise data from a large number of individual ships were acquired experimentally and sound transmission loss tl was calculated to estimate ship source levels then the relationship between ship noise source level and different parameters was analyzed the mean source spectrum curve of selected ships was fitted and the source spectrum model for merchant ship radiated noise was established so far many empirical models have been proposed the two earliest were proposed by ross 1976 and urick 1983 who expressed the spectral source levels ssls of merchant ships or naval vessels as a function of ship length draft and speed furthermore randi 2 model hamson and wagstaff 1983 and randi 3 model breeding et al 1996 were developed based on a reference ship ssl thus an individual source level can be calculated as a function of its speed and length randi 3 model has been used in modeling ambient noise from traffic and provided the reference for assessing the impact on marine ecology from shipping noise gordon et al 2003 hom et al 2016 however it should be noted that these measurements were made from older ships and had a narrower frequency band and their tl was estimated by empirical formula rather than numerical models furthermore different ship types were combined into the same analysis making it difficult to examine dissimilarities of source levels wales and heitmeyer 2002 mckenna and ross measured urn for seven types of modern merchant ships and pointed out that simple models are not possible to predict source levels of modern merchant ships as a group from particular ship characteristics e g length gross tonnage and speed of different ship types mckenna and ross 2012 wittekind s model wittekind 2014 and aquo project s model audoly and rizzuto 2015 audoly et al 2017 are different from previous models by considering the radiated noise being decomposed into three components in aquo model the parameters can be obtained by the numerical process of minimizing cost function in which data of at least two different speeds are needed however it is difficult in forecasting the source level of non cooperative ships because ships are generally sailing at one constant speed some researchers have paid attention to the directionality of the urn from ships trevorrow examined underwater source spectra of a small single screw oceanographic vessel focusing on directionality and effects on maneuver by changing the heading and speed of the ship mark and boris 2008 brooker measured the radiated noise of a small research vessel with three hydrophone arrays deployed at shallow water sponsored by a sonic project brooker and humphrey 2016 martin martin et al 2017 analyzed the signatures and directionality of urn of two container ships whose signals were recorded by several hydrophones located at portside underneath and starboard side with respect to the transiting ship in compliance with ship noise measurements standards proposed by himself furthermore some recent works were published simard analyzed and modeled 255 source levels of merchant ships from an acoustic observatory along st lawrence seaway simard et al 2016 jansen and de jong measured the shipping noise around the port of rotterdam and obtained the acoustic monopole source levels of 23 ships both of them compared the source levels of different ship types jansen and de jong 2017 the development of merchant shipping includes not only the increase in ship numbers to support burgeoning global trade but also the increase in ship size propulsion power and sophistication since the designs of modern commercial ships have changed the previous models may be not suitable anymore and need to be updated in this study we took an opportunistic approach to measure radiated noise from modern merchant ships after 2000 in the yellow sea of china at least one day in each month from may 2014 to march 2016 this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the measurement methodology presents the typical measured background noise of each month and specifies the selection criteria and processing approach tl was calculated by wave number integral method scooter based on the assumption of gaussian distribution of the sources section 3 partitions the 27 ships into two categories the relation between 20 and 1000 hz broadband source levels and speed and length was analyzed section 4 establishes the source spectrum models for the two categories and the estimated results were compared with randi 3 model a summary and a discussion of the results follow in section 5 2 data acquisition and processing 2 1 data acquisition the measurements were made by qingdao branch of institute of acoustics of chinese academy of sciences over a 2 year period from may 2014 to march 2016 we measured the noise radiated from merchant ships and the ambient noise every month notice that even though it is recommended by the ansi s12 64 2009 standard ansi asa 2009 that the three probe hydrophones used should be placed at the depths corresponding to target depression angles of 15 30 and 45 the depth of yellow sea of china is difficult to satisfy this condition the bottom mounted acoustic observatory in this research deployed at two sites is shown in fig 1 the data of noise radiated from ships were mainly obtained in the sea area of site i where the water depth is about 30 m the hydrophone was deployed near the ship lane about 0 5 m from the seabed and the lateral distance from the lane was no more than 500 m as is well known qingdao port is one of the busiest in the world there are many kinds of ships passing each day the hydrophone type iclisten hf was made by ocean sonic its bandwidth is from 10 hz to 200 khz and its sensitivity is 179 8 dbreμv pa the sampling frequency was commonly set as 64 khz each file contains 10 min recorded data activities of merchant ships were monitored using automatic identification system ais which was installed in the experimental ship and in nearby base station during the experiment the sound speed profiles ssps were measured by ctd several times typical sound speed profiles measured in different months are given in fig 2 2 2 the closest point of approach the closest point of approach cpa was derived from ship passage information i e ais data it was assumed that the courses of ships are invariant near the cpas the horizontal distance between cpa and the hydrophone can be expressed as 1 δ 1852 60 cos φ 0 λ 2 λ 1 φ 1 φ 0 λ 1 λ 0 φ 2 φ 1 λ 1 λ 2 2 cos 2 φ 0 φ 1 φ 2 2 where λ 0 φ 0 λ 1 φ 1 λ 2 φ 2 are respectively the latitudes and longitudes of the hydrophone and two points on the trajectory near the hydrophone shown fig 3 generally speaking cpa must be located at the center of the bathtub pattern due to the interference effects created by the combination of direct surface reflected and seabed reflected acoustic paths or in the passing characteristic pattern in time domain which are shown in fig 3 one pattern in the passing curves of fig 3 shows the asymmetry between the bow and stern aspects meaning more radiated energy at the stern aspects i e positive time from cpa 2 3 background noise as recommended in iso and ansi standards the effect of background noise will be ignored if the difference between the radiated noise level and the background noise level is greater than 10 db invalid if the difference is less than 3 db and corrected if the difference is between 3 db and 10 db in data processing we firstly picked out the noise data segments with only one ship in half an hour based on ais data then made sure that the received sound levels at cpa are almost 10 db greater than the background noise before and after the passing of the ship considering signal to noise ratio snr may not be sufficient in some frequency bands the received level rl was corrected as 2 r l 10 lg 10 r l 10 10 b l 10 where r l represents the received level before correction bl represents background noise level the measurement of background noise was made at the beginning and at the end of each run by analyzing the recorded data and combining with recorded ais we picked out the noise data segments with no ships being within a radius of 5 km as the representative background noise and the typical background noise spectra of each month at site i and ii are shown in fig 4 site ii dash dot line is far away from the ship lane and the ambient noise level is lower while site i solid line is near the ship lane where the noise level is higher because of the influence of ships 2 4 transmission loss the source spectra were obtained from the time series of the ship radiated noise spectra after dividing by the range frequency tl the source spectrum itself was computed as a logarithmic average of the source spectrogram over a t interval centered at the cpa time t can be obtained as follows 3 t 2 δ tan 30 v where v is ship speed the complex ship radiated noise spectra were computed as 2 s fourier transforms using hanning window to provide a 0 5 hz resolution the ssps were obtained by averaging the measured results during the experiment based on the sea chart and the nearby sound propagation experiment it is assumed that the seabed is muddy and not clearly stratified notice that there do exist some uncertainties in deciding the depth and distance of noise sources in tl calculation however considering business reality on merchant ships being usually fully or nearly fully loaded full load draft was used in this study which might cause some error on source depth the inaccuracy of distance between source and receiver may be introduced by the uncertainties of gps surveys furthermore propeller rotation can produce further variability of source positions in vertical z axis and horizontal directions y axis normal to ship routes x axis nevertheless considering that horizontal distance deviation is indeed unknown and that δ is usually much greater than gps error and dimensions of propellers the uncertainties caused by gps and source variability in y direction was neglected in addition it is well known that source depths have greater influence on tl in shallow waters a vertical distribution of sources instead of point source was established to reduce tl sensitivity to the uncertainties of source depth oast henrik 2011 a wavenumber integration model was used to compute the tl from each of the point sources the point source distribution was assumed to obey a gaussian weighting function a consequence of the individual propeller blade passing through the uneven wake field behind the ship the areas with the highest wake smallest axial flow velocity into the propeller in a single screw ship are observed in the upper region around the 12 o clock position of the propeller disk wittekind 2014 under these conditions it was assumed that cavitation bubbles are formed mostly in the upper quarter quadrants of propeller disk and the source intensity with depth satisfies a gaussian distribution wales andheitmeyer 2002 4 w

since the bottom of the propeller usually can t extend to the bottom of the ship the corrected depth z 0 0 875 d 0 85 d was used in this paper this distribution was cut off at the sea surface and the bottom of ship as is stated previously source spectrum s l was the logarithmic average of source spectra s l x i at different ship positions x 1 x 2 x n n t 2 along ship route positioned symmetrically around the cpa 5 s l 10 lg 1 n i 1 n 10 s l x i 10 s l x i r l x i t l x i f z s where s l x i is the total source level at ship position x i a vertical distribution of incoherent point sources was assumed for the same ship δ and the receiving depth are both constant t l x i f z s is the equivalent transmission loss for the source depth distribution model to be given later f the source distribution weighting function in z axis gaussian weighting function was used in this paper f z s w z s the received level from the ship located at x i was described as the sum of energy contributed by the sources at different depths 6 r l x i 10 lg z s 10 s l z s x i t l z s x i 10 where z s is source depth x i the position of the ship t l z s x i the transmission loss s l z s x i the source level at x i and z s expressed as 7 s l z s x i 10 lg s e x i w z s z s w z s where s e x i is the total energy of source located at x i hence it can be derived from formulas 6 and 7 8 10 r l x i 10 z s 10 s l z s x i 10 10 t l z s x i 10 s e x i z s w z s 10 t l z s x i 10 z s w z s taking logarithm on both sides of the equation and multiplying by 10 s l x i and t l x i w z s are obtained 9 s l x i 10 lg s e x i r l x i t l x i w z s t l x i w z s 10 lg z s w z s 10 t l z s x i 10 z s w z s source spectrum was obtained by substituting formula 9 into formula 5 the variation of tl with time and frequency in two hypotheses of source depth gaussian distribution and point source are shown in fig 5 the difference of tl caused by the error of the draft d is given in fig 6 the ship speed is 18 kt the draft of the full load is 10 m given by ais and used as d in tl calculation the actual draft is 9 m the cpa is 140 m it can be seen that when noise source is assumed as a vertical distribution the fluctuation of tl with frequency and time range is obviously smaller than that of the point source when ships are not fully loaded causing inaccurate source depth the error of the former is much smaller than that of the latter point source meaning vertical distribution of sources reduces the sensitivity of tl to the uncertainties of source depth and improves the fault tolerance of source depth it is noteworthy that this effect bases on the average in the vertical direction and is not related to the shape of the distribution 3 analysis table 1 provides a set of selected ship samples 9 cargo ships 13 container ships and 5 tankers of which the length of the container ships is all more than 200 m and the bulk carriers and the oil tankers are mostly less than 200 m fig 7 shows the variation of 20 1000 hz broad band noise source level and absolute difference between data and randi 3 with the length of ship for all samples there is no obvious correlation between the two the blue circle is the broadband noise source level of the ship and the red box is calculation of randi 3 for the ships whose length is more than 200 m the calculated results from randi 3 model are generally higher than the measured results and the maximum difference can reach almost 20 db the main reason may be the most recent large ships are generally equipped with large 2 strengines rigidly mounted on the hull with a fixed pitch propeller and low rotation speed for the ships whose length is less than 200 m there is little gap between the levels given by the randi 3 model and by the measured ones considering that the engine technology of many modern large merchant ships has been updated the samples of table 1 were divided into two categories to build the ship noise source level model respectively category i whose length is greater than 200 m including 13 containers 1 cargo ships category ii whose length is less than 200 m including 8 cargo ships and 5 tankers fig 8 shows the variation of the broad band noise source level of ships whose length is greater than 200 m and less than 200 m with speed it can be seen that the two have a good correlation for the ships whose length is greater than 200 m the correlation coefficient is 0 81 and the function of linear fitting is 10 s s l 20 1000 h z 121 4 49 2 lg v where v represents the ship velocity for the ships whose length is

different frequencies both the means and the medians of absolute error for most frequencies are less than 4 db the 75th percentiles for most frequencies are less than 6 db fig 15 shows the measured ssls the ssls of the proposed model and the estimated ssls of randi 3 for 13 ships of category ii it seems the results from both models are acceptable fig 16 demonstrates the box plots and the mean of

gives the maximum and 75th percentiles of the estimated error of the two models from the box plots for most frequencies the maximum and 75th percentiles of error for the proposed model are less than those of the randi 3 5 summary and discussion we have measured ship urn and ocean ambient noise in yellow sea using a bottom mounted and self contained hydrophone from may 2014 to march 2016 an ensemble of 27 merchant ships urn was measured near the busy shipping lane to qingdao port for deriving the ssls of merchant ships from the received noise data we assumed that incoherent point sources were distributed vertically according to a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation equal to one quarter of the propeller diameter the tls were calculated using a wave number integration model oast the correlation between the ship s broadband noise source level and the length speed of the ship was also analyzed finally the ship samples were divided into two categories by their length and noise source spectrum models were established respectively the measured ssls were also compared with the estimated results ofrandi 3 based on the above work we found some features as below 1 our results show that the background noise level at the site i which is nearer the ship lane is obviously higher than that received at the site ii because of significant influence of shipping considering snr may be not sufficient in some frequency bands especially for ships whose δ are big the received level has been corrected by subtracting background noise level 2 the gaussian source distribution assumption actually means logarithmic average over a certain range of positions which makes the results of the analysis be less sensitive to the changes in input data to source depth therefore this assumption can improve the fault tolerance of source depth 3 for the ships whose length is more than 200 m the ship s broadband noise source level calculated by randi 3 model are generally higher than the measured ones and the maximum difference can reach 15 db the main reason may be the most recent large ships are generally equipped with large 2strengines rigidly mounted on the hull with a fixed pitch propeller and low rotations peed with each category the broad band noise source levels of modern merchant ships are not highly correlated to ship length but closely related to ship speed and the correlation coefficient is higher than 0 8 4 in addition the noise source spectrum models of two categories of ship are established by best fitting the measured data respectively for category i the means of absolute estimated error of the proposed model are less than 4 db for most frequencies while the estimated results of randi 3 are generally far greater than the measured ones for the category ii the estimated results of both models are acceptable to some extent overall the estimation results of the proposed model are better than the ones of randi 3 for all frequencies except 20 hz 5 the source spectrum model of ship radiation noise should be established according to ship categories however how to classify the category needs to be further studied in the future more effective samples

21487,in past decades the technologies of ship building and engine manufacturing have developed quickly which may alter underwater radiated noise urn source levels the urn from many merchant ships was recorded by self sustained hydrophones mounted on the seabed near the ship lanes in the yellow sea of china twenty seven samples of the recording are selected based on iso and ansi standards the sources were assumed obeying gaussian distribution in depth direction and the ship source spectra were computed as a logarithmic average of source spectra calculated for different positions of ships to improve the fault tolerance of source position information a key conclusion is that the estimated broadband ship noise source levels between 20 and 1000 hz by randi 3 model are generally much greater than the measured results for ships whose length is larger than 200 m though they are close for ships with length being less than 200 m furthermore the data samples were divided into two categories to analyze with each category the 20 1000 hz broadband noise of modern merchant ships is not highly correlated to ship length but closely related to ship speed finally noise source spectrum models of the two ship categories were established which express ship noise source spectra as a function of frequency ship length and ship speed the models can represent experimental results properly keywords merchant ship source spectrum model radiated noise yellow sea of china 1 introduction the detecting frequency range of sonar has gradually extended to low or very low frequency recently ocean ambient noise is the main background field of sonar detection systems of all the ocean noise generators merchant ships are the principal contributor over the low frequency band from 5 hz to as high as 1 khz wenz 1962 commercial shipping has developed rapidly in the past century the expansion of shipping and ships correlates with the increase in deep ocean noise levels ross analyzed the noise levels measured in the mid 20th century and suggested that the low frequency noise was increasing at an average rate of about 0 5 db per year ross 2005 he also pointed out that this trend would not be sustained the rate was later proved to be 0 2 db year by analyzing the ocean ambient data measured in the northeast pacific from 1978 to 1986 chapman and price 2011 most recently andrew howe and mercer s measurement in the northeast pacific showed a flat or slightly decreasing trend in low frequency noise andrew et al 2011 sound spectrum generated by a ship consists of two parts a broadband component created by propeller cavitation and a number of narrow band line spectra created by both propeller cavitation the blade lines and internal machinery engine generators pumps etc however narrow band line spectra are difficult to predict therefore more have focused on the representation of broadband spectra the noise data from a large number of individual ships were acquired experimentally and sound transmission loss tl was calculated to estimate ship source levels then the relationship between ship noise source level and different parameters was analyzed the mean source spectrum curve of selected ships was fitted and the source spectrum model for merchant ship radiated noise was established so far many empirical models have been proposed the two earliest were proposed by ross 1976 and urick 1983 who expressed the spectral source levels ssls of merchant ships or naval vessels as a function of ship length draft and speed furthermore randi 2 model hamson and wagstaff 1983 and randi 3 model breeding et al 1996 were developed based on a reference ship ssl thus an individual source level can be calculated as a function of its speed and length randi 3 model has been used in modeling ambient noise from traffic and provided the reference for assessing the impact on marine ecology from shipping noise gordon et al 2003 hom et al 2016 however it should be noted that these measurements were made from older ships and had a narrower frequency band and their tl was estimated by empirical formula rather than numerical models furthermore different ship types were combined into the same analysis making it difficult to examine dissimilarities of source levels wales and heitmeyer 2002 mckenna and ross measured urn for seven types of modern merchant ships and pointed out that simple models are not possible to predict source levels of modern merchant ships as a group from particular ship characteristics e g length gross tonnage and speed of different ship types mckenna and ross 2012 wittekind s model wittekind 2014 and aquo project s model audoly and rizzuto 2015 audoly et al 2017 are different from previous models by considering the radiated noise being decomposed into three components in aquo model the parameters can be obtained by the numerical process of minimizing cost function in which data of at least two different speeds are needed however it is difficult in forecasting the source level of non cooperative ships because ships are generally sailing at one constant speed some researchers have paid attention to the directionality of the urn from ships trevorrow examined underwater source spectra of a small single screw oceanographic vessel focusing on directionality and effects on maneuver by changing the heading and speed of the ship mark and boris 2008 brooker measured the radiated noise of a small research vessel with three hydrophone arrays deployed at shallow water sponsored by a sonic project brooker and humphrey 2016 martin martin et al 2017 analyzed the signatures and directionality of urn of two container ships whose signals were recorded by several hydrophones located at portside underneath and starboard side with respect to the transiting ship in compliance with ship noise measurements standards proposed by himself furthermore some recent works were published simard analyzed and modeled 255 source levels of merchant ships from an acoustic observatory along st lawrence seaway simard et al 2016 jansen and de jong measured the shipping noise around the port of rotterdam and obtained the acoustic monopole source levels of 23 ships both of them compared the source levels of different ship types jansen and de jong 2017 the development of merchant shipping includes not only the increase in ship numbers to support burgeoning global trade but also the increase in ship size propulsion power and sophistication since the designs of modern commercial ships have changed the previous models may be not suitable anymore and need to be updated in this study we took an opportunistic approach to measure radiated noise from modern merchant ships after 2000 in the yellow sea of china at least one day in each month from may 2014 to march 2016 this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the measurement methodology presents the typical measured background noise of each month and specifies the selection criteria and processing approach tl was calculated by wave number integral method scooter based on the assumption of gaussian distribution of the sources section 3 partitions the 27 ships into two categories the relation between 20 and 1000 hz broadband source levels and speed and length was analyzed section 4 establishes the source spectrum models for the two categories and the estimated results were compared with randi 3 model a summary and a discussion of the results follow in section 5 2 data acquisition and processing 2 1 data acquisition the measurements were made by qingdao branch of institute of acoustics of chinese academy of sciences over a 2 year period from may 2014 to march 2016 we measured the noise radiated from merchant ships and the ambient noise every month notice that even though it is recommended by the ansi s12 64 2009 standard ansi asa 2009 that the three probe hydrophones used should be placed at the depths corresponding to target depression angles of 15 30 and 45 the depth of yellow sea of china is difficult to satisfy this condition the bottom mounted acoustic observatory in this research deployed at two sites is shown in fig 1 the data of noise radiated from ships were mainly obtained in the sea area of site i where the water depth is about 30 m the hydrophone was deployed near the ship lane about 0 5 m from the seabed and the lateral distance from the lane was no more than 500 m as is well known qingdao port is one of the busiest in the world there are many kinds of ships passing each day the hydrophone type iclisten hf was made by ocean sonic its bandwidth is from 10 hz to 200 khz and its sensitivity is 179 8 dbreμv pa the sampling frequency was commonly set as 64 khz each file contains 10 min recorded data activities of merchant ships were monitored using automatic identification system ais which was installed in the experimental ship and in nearby base station during the experiment the sound speed profiles ssps were measured by ctd several times typical sound speed profiles measured in different months are given in fig 2 2 2 the closest point of approach the closest point of approach cpa was derived from ship passage information i e ais data it was assumed that the courses of ships are invariant near the cpas the horizontal distance between cpa and the hydrophone can be expressed as 1 δ 1852 60 cos φ 0 λ 2 λ 1 φ 1 φ 0 λ 1 λ 0 φ 2 φ 1 λ 1 λ 2 2 cos 2 φ 0 φ 1 φ 2 2 where λ 0 φ 0 λ 1 φ 1 λ 2 φ 2 are respectively the latitudes and longitudes of the hydrophone and two points on the trajectory near the hydrophone shown fig 3 generally speaking cpa must be located at the center of the bathtub pattern due to the interference effects created by the combination of direct surface reflected and seabed reflected acoustic paths or in the passing characteristic pattern in time domain which are shown in fig 3 one pattern in the passing curves of fig 3 shows the asymmetry between the bow and stern aspects meaning more radiated energy at the stern aspects i e positive time from cpa 2 3 background noise as recommended in iso and ansi standards the effect of background noise will be ignored if the difference between the radiated noise level and the background noise level is greater than 10 db invalid if the difference is less than 3 db and corrected if the difference is between 3 db and 10 db in data processing we firstly picked out the noise data segments with only one ship in half an hour based on ais data then made sure that the received sound levels at cpa are almost 10 db greater than the background noise before and after the passing of the ship considering signal to noise ratio snr may not be sufficient in some frequency bands the received level rl was corrected as 2 r l 10 lg 10 r l 10 10 b l 10 where r l represents the received level before correction bl represents background noise level the measurement of background noise was made at the beginning and at the end of each run by analyzing the recorded data and combining with recorded ais we picked out the noise data segments with no ships being within a radius of 5 km as the representative background noise and the typical background noise spectra of each month at site i and ii are shown in fig 4 site ii dash dot line is far away from the ship lane and the ambient noise level is lower while site i solid line is near the ship lane where the noise level is higher because of the influence of ships 2 4 transmission loss the source spectra were obtained from the time series of the ship radiated noise spectra after dividing by the range frequency tl the source spectrum itself was computed as a logarithmic average of the source spectrogram over a t interval centered at the cpa time t can be obtained as follows 3 t 2 δ tan 30 v where v is ship speed the complex ship radiated noise spectra were computed as 2 s fourier transforms using hanning window to provide a 0 5 hz resolution the ssps were obtained by averaging the measured results during the experiment based on the sea chart and the nearby sound propagation experiment it is assumed that the seabed is muddy and not clearly stratified notice that there do exist some uncertainties in deciding the depth and distance of noise sources in tl calculation however considering business reality on merchant ships being usually fully or nearly fully loaded full load draft was used in this study which might cause some error on source depth the inaccuracy of distance between source and receiver may be introduced by the uncertainties of gps surveys furthermore propeller rotation can produce further variability of source positions in vertical z axis and horizontal directions y axis normal to ship routes x axis nevertheless considering that horizontal distance deviation is indeed unknown and that δ is usually much greater than gps error and dimensions of propellers the uncertainties caused by gps and source variability in y direction was neglected in addition it is well known that source depths have greater influence on tl in shallow waters a vertical distribution of sources instead of point source was established to reduce tl sensitivity to the uncertainties of source depth oast henrik 2011 a wavenumber integration model was used to compute the tl from each of the point sources the point source distribution was assumed to obey a gaussian weighting function a consequence of the individual propeller blade passing through the uneven wake field behind the ship the areas with the highest wake smallest axial flow velocity into the propeller in a single screw ship are observed in the upper region around the 12 o clock position of the propeller disk wittekind 2014 under these conditions it was assumed that cavitation bubbles are formed mostly in the upper quarter quadrants of propeller disk and the source intensity with depth satisfies a gaussian distribution wales andheitmeyer 2002 4 w z σ 2 π 1 exp z z 0 2 2 σ 2 where d represents the draft d the propeller diameter being estimated as d 0 75 d σ d 4 the standard deviation the mean depth z 0 d 0 85 d was used by gray and geeley 1980 since the bottom of the propeller usually can t extend to the bottom of the ship the corrected depth z 0 0 875 d 0 85 d was used in this paper this distribution was cut off at the sea surface and the bottom of ship as is stated previously source spectrum s l was the logarithmic average of source spectra s l x i at different ship positions x 1 x 2 x n n t 2 along ship route positioned symmetrically around the cpa 5 s l 10 lg 1 n i 1 n 10 s l x i 10 s l x i r l x i t l x i f z s where s l x i is the total source level at ship position x i a vertical distribution of incoherent point sources was assumed for the same ship δ and the receiving depth are both constant t l x i f z s is the equivalent transmission loss for the source depth distribution model to be given later f the source distribution weighting function in z axis gaussian weighting function was used in this paper f z s w z s the received level from the ship located at x i was described as the sum of energy contributed by the sources at different depths 6 r l x i 10 lg z s 10 s l z s x i t l z s x i 10 where z s is source depth x i the position of the ship t l z s x i the transmission loss s l z s x i the source level at x i and z s expressed as 7 s l z s x i 10 lg s e x i w z s z s w z s where s e x i is the total energy of source located at x i hence it can be derived from formulas 6 and 7 8 10 r l x i 10 z s 10 s l z s x i 10 10 t l z s x i 10 s e x i z s w z s 10 t l z s x i 10 z s w z s taking logarithm on both sides of the equation and multiplying by 10 s l x i and t l x i w z s are obtained 9 s l x i 10 lg s e x i r l x i t l x i w z s t l x i w z s 10 lg z s w z s 10 t l z s x i 10 z s w z s source spectrum was obtained by substituting formula 9 into formula 5 the variation of tl with time and frequency in two hypotheses of source depth gaussian distribution and point source are shown in fig 5 the difference of tl caused by the error of the draft d is given in fig 6 the ship speed is 18 kt the draft of the full load is 10 m given by ais and used as d in tl calculation the actual draft is 9 m the cpa is 140 m it can be seen that when noise source is assumed as a vertical distribution the fluctuation of tl with frequency and time range is obviously smaller than that of the point source when ships are not fully loaded causing inaccurate source depth the error of the former is much smaller than that of the latter point source meaning vertical distribution of sources reduces the sensitivity of tl to the uncertainties of source depth and improves the fault tolerance of source depth it is noteworthy that this effect bases on the average in the vertical direction and is not related to the shape of the distribution 3 analysis table 1 provides a set of selected ship samples 9 cargo ships 13 container ships and 5 tankers of which the length of the container ships is all more than 200 m and the bulk carriers and the oil tankers are mostly less than 200 m fig 7 shows the variation of 20 1000 hz broad band noise source level and absolute difference between data and randi 3 with the length of ship for all samples there is no obvious correlation between the two the blue circle is the broadband noise source level of the ship and the red box is calculation of randi 3 for the ships whose length is more than 200 m the calculated results from randi 3 model are generally higher than the measured results and the maximum difference can reach almost 20 db the main reason may be the most recent large ships are generally equipped with large 2 strengines rigidly mounted on the hull with a fixed pitch propeller and low rotation speed for the ships whose length is less than 200 m there is little gap between the levels given by the randi 3 model and by the measured ones considering that the engine technology of many modern large merchant ships has been updated the samples of table 1 were divided into two categories to build the ship noise source level model respectively category i whose length is greater than 200 m including 13 containers 1 cargo ships category ii whose length is less than 200 m including 8 cargo ships and 5 tankers fig 8 shows the variation of the broad band noise source level of ships whose length is greater than 200 m and less than 200 m with speed it can be seen that the two have a good correlation for the ships whose length is greater than 200 m the correlation coefficient is 0 81 and the function of linear fitting is 10 s s l 20 1000 h z 121 4 49 2 lg v where v represents the ship velocity for the ships whose length is less than 200 m the correlation coefficient is 0 88 and the function of linear fitting is 11 s s l 20 1000 h z 111 8 62 1 lg v 4 model following the modeling principle of randi 3 the mean curves were first fitted considering that the model is mainly aimed at the continuous spectrum of ship noise the source spectra of the measured ships were smoothed by 6th polynomial fitting firstly figs 9 and 10

different frequencies both the means and the medians of absolute error for most frequencies are less than 4 db the 75th percentiles for most frequencies are less than 6 db fig 15 shows the measured ssls the ssls of the proposed model and the estimated ssls of randi 3 for 13 ships of category ii it seems the results from both models are acceptable fig 16 demonstrates the box plots and the mean of

gives the maximum and 75th percentiles of the estimated error of the two models from the box plots for most frequencies the maximum and 75th percentiles of error for the proposed model are less than those of the randi 3 5 summary and discussion we have measured ship urn and ocean ambient noise in yellow sea using a bottom mounted and self contained hydrophone from may 2014 to march 2016 an ensemble of 27 merchant ships urn was measured near the busy shipping lane to qingdao port for deriving the ssls of merchant ships from the received noise data we assumed that incoherent point sources

21488,a combined piled raft foundation cprf is generally used for massive and tall structures the conventional design of piled raft does not include the capacity of piled raft under combined lateral and vertical load however vertical v horizontal h and moment m loading may act on the foundation simultaneously the present study examines the behaviour of piled raft foundation in sandy soil under v m h interaction using three dimensional finite element analysis the horizontal and moment capacity of piled raft is assessed due to various influential parameters such as relative stiffness of pile and soil raft soil relative stiffness spacing to diameter ratio of the pile length to width ratio of the foundation and pile head connection with the raft it is observed that piled raft lateral capacity increases due to combined loading than that of independent capacity both failure and design envelopes are also developed considering v m h interaction finally the design implication of the outcome of the present study is presented using a case study it is revealed that the design of piled raft with lateral capacity obtained from the combined action of the v m h load may reduce the number of piles as compared to conventional design performed using individual capacity keywords piled raft foundation v m h interaction 3d finite element analysis failure envelope design envelope 1 introduction piled rafts have been widely adopted as a foundation system for supporting high rise buildings towers and offshore structures resting on soft or loose to medium soil deposit the prime advantage of the piled raft foundation is that it controls total and differential settlements and enhances the serviceability of the whole structure significantly piles under the raft act as a settlement reducer while raft also provides reasonable stiffness and soil resistance hence the capacity of a piled raft considering the combined behaviour of raft and pile is required to design the foundation based on the field observations the concept of pile raft foundation system has been successfully adopted by several countries for various high rises and complex structures e g hooper 1973 yamashita et al 1993 2011 2012 dash et al 2009 katzenbach et al 2000 2016 choudhury et al 2019 in fact the conventional design of piled raft considers the capacity of piled raft under sole vertical and lateral load previous research studies have given considerable efforts for the development of optimum design guideline of piled raft foundation under vertical loading e g horikoshi and randolph 1994 clancy and randolph 1996 katzenbach and reul 1997 horikoshi and randolph 1998 architectural institute of japan 2001 katzenbach and moorman 2001 poulos 2001 reul and randolph 2003 desanctis and mandolini 2006 poulos et al 2011 kumar et al 2015 kumar and choudhury 2018 mali and singh 2018 apart from this the international society for soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering issmge has also published design and construction guidelines for a vertically loaded piled raft for different subsoil conditions katzenbach and choudhury 2013 however the piled raft foundation system is often subjected to a combined vertical lateral and moment load simultaneously the earthquake hydrological wave lateral soil pressure and wind wave may impart significant horizontal forces and moments in addition to gravity load the behaviour of the piled raft foundation is complex due to combined action of vertical v horizontal h and moment m loading and may be considered as governing design criteria for the rational design of the foundation system hence consideration of combined capacity under v m h interaction is required in obtaining the design response and sustainable design of the piled raft foundation few experimental studies are attempted to investigate the horizontal and vertical response of piled raft foundation under combined loading by performing model as well as full scale studies e g pastsakorn et al 2002 matsumoto et al 2004a 2004b hamada et al 2012 sawada and takemura 2014 model or full scale experimental study on combined interaction of load is however cumbersome hence numerical analysis or analytical approach can be an alternative solution that may provide better insight into the problem few numerical small and zhang 2002 unsever et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 comodromos et al 2015 bhaduri and choudhury 2019 and analytical studies mu et al 2014 roy et al 2018 bhaduri and choudhury 2020 have also been conducted in the past to understand the behaviour of piled raft under combined loading mu et al 2014 have reported various analytical solutions to incorporate the effect of soil non homogeneity on vertical and lateral response of piled raft under combined loading further unsever et al 2015 and bhaduri and choudhury 2020 has reported about the load sharing proportion of the components of piled raft under combined loading from both the studies it was perceived that the raft present in a piled raft carried the maximum lateral load at the beginning of loading however at higher deformation level the load sharing of raft reduces and that of the pile increases these studies have primarily indicated the importance of consideration of v m h loading for the design of piled raft foundation moreover these past studies of combined loading effect on the piled raft behaviour have not highlighted the influence of various other design parameters such as relative stiffness of pile and soil raft soil relative stiffness spacing to diameter ratio of the pile length to width ratio of the foundation and pile head connection with the raft on the behaviour of piled raft these design parameters have been outlined as controlling factors in the design of piled raft foundation by many researchers e g hain and lee 1978 poulos and davis 1980 clancy 1993 clancy and randolph 1996 horikoshi and randolph 1998 poulos 2001 nguyen et al 2013 hence the state of art research indicates that a comprehensive study on v m h interaction on a piled raft supported structure including the effect of these influential parameters is limited and needs to be studied therefore the present study is an attempt in this direction to investigate the influence of various parametric variations on the lateral response of piled raft under combined v m h loading on the other hand various other studies have presented two dimensional and three dimensional parabolic failure envelope curves due to v m h loads for a different type of footings and shallow foundation system roscoe and schofield 1957 tan 1990 houlsby 1997 bransby and randolph 1998 gourvenec and randolph 2003 bienen et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 li et al 2017 the exploration of the shape of the failure envelope or yield surface within three dimensional v m h load space was first introduced by roscoe and schofield 1957 later ticof 1977 conducted several combined loading tests on a rough strip footing resting on sand and plotted the data in two dimensional v h and m h load space butterfield and ticof 1979 used the concept of ticof 1977 and developed a three dimensional cigar shaped parabolic yield surface within v m h load space further tan 1990 investigated the v h yield loci for various conical and spudcan footings resting on saturated sands by performing displacement controlled side swipe tests in a geotechnical centrifuge the benefit of this swipe test is that a complete failure locus on a certain plane can be determined in a single test apart from this another concept named displacement probe to determine the yield locus of a failure envelope was suggested by bransby and randolph 1997 in this method the load state and failure mechanism at one point on the failure envelope was obtained by keeping a fixed ratio of displacements in a particular direction this concept of swipe test and displacement probe test has been adopted by several researchers to date to develop failure envelopes for various types of footing and shallow foundation system houlsby 1997 bransby and randolph 1998 gourvenec and randolph 2003 bienen et al 2006 el marassi 2011 el marassi et al 2017 li et al 2017 based on the available literature in this direction it has been realized that limited efforts have been made to develop failure envelope for piled raft foundation system considering the interaction of v m h loading the development of the failure envelope is done based on yield displacement of the piled raft and may help to predict the upper bound yield surface of lateral and moment capacities for the applied vertical loading on the other hand the conventional design of the foundation is performed based on serviceability criteria by considering the allowable limit of deformation and not on yield deformation therefore the development of design envelopes based on allowable deformation may also prove to be an essential tool for the design of piled raft under v m h loading various guidelines are available for the selection of allowable deformation of piled raft under lateral loading for example japan road association jra 2002 has suggested maximum allowable lateral displacement of pile foundation for highway bridges in japan is limited to 1 of pile diameter further das et al 2016 considered maximum allowable lateral displacement of a pile of 30 mm in a piled raft system based on a study published elsewhere salgado 2008 it may be concluded that jra criteria seem to be conservative for piled raft foundation and on the contrary allowable displacement of pile suggested by salgado 2008 may be a rational one for the design of piled raft foundation system given the above state of the art research in this direction the present study is an attempt to investigate the behaviour of piled raft foundation embedded in homogenous sand deposit considering combined action of static v m h loading in a coupled form besides this the development of failure and design envelopes are also performed herein following probe test method as suggested elsewhere yun and bransby 2007 and el marassi et al 2017 3d finite element analysis considering soil as nonlinear and structure as linear material is performed using plaxis 3d 2008 commercial software first the 3d numerical model is validated with an experimental study and numerical study by sawada and takemura 2014 and kumar et al 2016 after that the influence of the interaction of combined v m h load on lateral load and moment deformation behaviour piled raft foundation are studied encompassing various influential parameters such as relative stiffness of raft and pile length to width ratio of the foundation l b spacing to diameter ratio of piles s d and pile head connection with the raft to develop design insight into the problem the influence of v m h load interaction on bending moment and shear force profile along the depth of the pile of piled raft foundation are also presented finally a case study is presented highlighting the design implication of this study hence this study aims at developing a broad understanding of the behaviour of piled raft foundation system considering static coupled v m h load interaction which helps to formulate a design guideline 2 modelling of soil piled raft foundation system a three dimensional analysis using plaxis 3d 2008 is carried out for a piled raft foundation embedded in a homogenous sand deposit the piled raft is considered to be embedded below the ground surface fig 1 presents the schematic representation of the piled raft system embedded in the soil domain soil is modelled as a saturated homogeneous medium with an angle of internal friction ϕ and dilatancy angle φ of 31 and 1 respectively the properties of the sand medium are referred from bowels 1997 and are presented in table 1 the soil domain is assumed as a 3d prismatic cube having a dimension of 28m length 28m breadth 16m height the 15 noded wedge elements are used to create the soil domain this element is composed of 6 node triangles in the horizontal direction and 8 node quadrilaterals in the vertical direction as shown in fig 2 the soil domain is meshed by adopting variable mesh density to achieve acceptable accuracy and computational efficiency of analysis local refinements with coarseness factor of 0 25 in soil mesh are assigned near to piled raft foundation where large stress concentrations or deformation gradients are anticipated a typical 3d mesh discretization is shown in fig 2 from a convergence study the total number of nodes and elements are obtained as 5351 and 1848 respectively the average element size of each element is 2 84m the lateral soil boundaries are kept as seven times the width of the foundation while the vertical boundary is kept as four times the width of the foundation to minimize the boundary effects kumar et al 2016 the side boundaries of the soil domain are constrained against the horizontal direction and the bottom boundaries are constrained against both horizontal and vertical directions non linear elastic perfectly plastic mohr coulomb constitutive model is used for sandy soil the size of the raft is considered as 4m length 4m width 1m thickness which is modelled using a plate element and meshed using a 6 noded triangular element the raft is considered to be made of aluminum material having young s modulus and poisson s ratio in the order of 70 gpa and 0 35 respectively steel piles having length 9m and diameter 0 5m with the centre to centre spacing of four times of diameter is modelled using an embedded pile element with linear elastic section properties this embedded pile element consists of a beam element and its behaviour is defined using elastic stiffness properties 4 noded line element is used to mesh the embedded pile the superstructure is idealized as a column in a simplified form which is modelled using a beam element fig 2 presents the column section through which a combined v m h load is developed on the top of the foundation the vertical steel column having a circular cross section is attached rigidly at the centroid of the raft height and diameter of the steel column are assumed as 3m and 0 5m respectively this column section is created to develop moment load m at the raft level by applying a horizontal load h at the top end of the column i e m h e where e is the eccentric distance between the top end of the column to raft surface gravity load is also applied on the column to the foundation the detailed parameters of the linear elastic and nonporous pile raft and superstructure are presented in table 1 the surface to surface contact method is used to model the soil raft interface while the interaction with soil at the pile shaft and toe is described using embedded interface elements the roughness coefficient in the form of strength reduction factor r inter is used for interface modelling of both raft and pile with soil this factor represents interface strength to the soil strength the present study considers r inter 0 7 in sandy soil as proposed elsewhere brinkgreve et al 2008 3 application of v m h load and method of analysis to simulate combined v m h loading load controlled probe test method suggested elsewhere yun and bransby 2007 and el marassi et al 2017 is considered in the present study in the probe test method the loads are applied in two stages in the first loading stage the prescribed vertical load is applied to the foundation in the second stage of loading coupled horizontal h and moment m loads are applied simultaneously on the foundation keeping the vertical load v constant the vertical load v is taken equal to 10 50 and 100 of the ultimate vertical load capacity v max of the piled raft foundation system i e v v max 0 1 0 5 and 1 the double tangent method is used to obtain the ultimate vertical load capacity v max of the piled raft foundation from the load settlement curve monotonically increasing horizontal load h is applied at the top end of a vertical column with an eccentricity e from the top of the raft surface therefore the moment at the top central node of the raft is equal to the horizontal force applied at the top of column times the eccentricity above the raft surface i e m h e the moment is increased by gradually increasing h up to a higher deformation range i e failure range and keeping e constant throughout the study hence h m relationship is linear in the present study fig 1 presents the schematic diagram of the adopted load path on the piled raft foundation the central node at the top surface of the raft is considered as the load reference point lrf the sign convention for displacements and loads presented in this numerical study obeys right handed axes and positive clockwise convention as proposed by butterfield et al 1997 lateral displacement vertical settlement and rotation of the foundation under v m h load are measured at the central bottom node of the raft and are denoted as u x u y and θ respectively c f fig 1 finite element calculation is divided into several sequential calculation phases the first calculation phase i e the initial stress field condition under initial geometry configuration is performed employing k 0 procedure option in built in plaxis 3d 2008 the first phase is followed by a plastic calculation phase of the piled raft to simulate the elastoplastic deformation analysis of the piled raft under v m h loading further the horizontal load deformation curves are plotted for different parametric cases and the yield lateral capacity of the piled raft is ascertained using the double tangent method on this curve an exemplary case for the determination of yield lateral load using the double tangent method in the load deformation curve is presented in fig 3 4 parametric cases a parametric study considering various influential parameters related to the pile raft system is carried out to investigate the interaction of combined v m h loading on the design response of a piled raft foundation system influence of variation in several parameters such as relative stiffness of both raft and pile length to width ratio l b of the foundation system spacing to diameter ratio s d and pile head connection with raft are studied within a feasible range of interest of piled raft system the relative stiffness of raft is modelled by following relationship proposed by clancy and randolph 1996 1 k r s 4 e r b t r 3 1 ν s 2 3 π e s l r 4 1 ν r 2 where e r and e s are young s modulus of the raft and the soil respectively l r and b is the length and width of the raft respectively t r represents the thickness of the raft ν r and ν s are the poisson s ratio of the raft and the soil respectively according to horikoshi and randolph 1998 an increase in k rs indicates the raft behaviour changes from flexible to rigid hence the present study incorporates three relative stiffness values of the raft k rs in order of 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 attributing raft thickness t r 0 1m 0 5m and 1 0m respectively to incorporate flexible to rigid behaviour of raft under v m h loading loose and medium sand consistency are considered which represents two different relative stiffness of pile i e e p e s in order of 28 570 and 15 380 respectively the piled raft foundation having three different lengths to width ratios l b of the foundation system namely 1 2 25 and 5 are considered in this study piled raft foundation having l b ratio of 1 2 25 indicates stiff behaviour whereas the l b ratio of 5 indicates flexible behaviour further two different spacing to diameter s d ratio in the order of 2 and 4 are considered in this study horikoshi et al 2003 reported that the horizontal stiffness of the piled raft foundation with a hinged pile head connection with a raft is smaller than that of a piled raft foundation system with a rigid pile head connection the present study also attempts to investigate the behaviour of piled raft foundation with two different pile head connection with the raft namely rigid and hinged table 2 presents a detailed summary of parametric cases considered in the present study 5 results and discussion 5 1 validation of the proposed numerical model the numerical model of piled raft foundation developed in plaxis 3d 2008 is validated with experimental and numerical studies published elsewhere sawada and takemura 2014 and kumar et al 2016 to verify the sanctity of developed model the parameters pertaining to soil pile raft and superstructure for both the studies are presented in table 3 at first the 3d numerical model is validated considering an experimental study sawada and takemura 2014 the model tests were performed in toyoura sand by sawada and takemura 2014 in a geotechnical centrifuge to examine the performance of laterally loaded piled raft foundation a centrifuge acceleration of 50g was employed in the study pre vertical i e vertical load test before application of horizontal load and lateral push in and push out tests i e application of lateral load from the left towards the right direction and vice versa were performed on model piled raft the pre vertical loading test was performed on the model piled raft system in centrifuge with displacement controlled loading intensity of 0 0162 mm s the total mass of the raft and superstructure was assumed as 2 7 kg which was equivalent to 3330 kn in the prototype scale under 50g centrifugal acceleration further push in and push out tests were performed by applying lateral load at a height equivalent to the spacing between the piles i e h s 1 and at 1 8 times the spacing between the piles i e h s 1 8 respectively numerical validation of the model structure is performed for the pre vertical load test and the first half cycle of push in load test cases with h s 1 respectively for the pre vertical load case the load is assigned uniformly at the top of the raft in the numerical model and allowed maximum displacement up to 0 4 mm in model scale the reaction with respect to settlement and lateral deformation is recorded at the centre of the base level of the raft during 3d finite element analysis and compared with the experimental results fig 4 a and b presents both numerical and experimental results of the vertical load settlement and lateral load deformation curve which indicates a good agreement a maximum variation in vertical load settlement and lateral load deformation results in order of 6 is observed which may be considered to be reasonably good for using the numerical model for detailed study besides another numerical study of kumar et al 2016 on the behaviour of the combined piled raft foundation under earthquake loading is considered to validate the present numerical model the validation is performed for static vertical and pseudo static horizontal loading cases the numerical model of the piled raft is developed considering the foundation to be embedded in toyoura sand for static vertical load analysis vertical pressure of 366 406 kn m2 is applied on the raft surface further for horizontal loading analysis a maximum pseudo static load of 621 4 kn and 1635 6 kn is applied to the generic piled raft foundation for bhuj 2001 pga 0 106g and loma prieta 1989 pga 0 279g earthquakes respectively fig 5 presents a profile of settlement contour obtained after application of vertical load in present numerical analysis the maximum value of settlement obtained from the present numerical analysis is found to be 0 02149m the obtained settlement is in good agreement with the value of settlement reported by kumar et al 2016 showing a marginal variation of 1 41 further fig 6 a and b present the maximum normalized horizontal displacement and bending moment along pile length respectively which is found to be a good agreement with the results reported in kumar et al 2016 thus both the validation ensures the reliability of the numerical model which may be used for further study 5 2 lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation under combined v m h loading 5 2 1 effect of the relative stiffness of raft krs the present study emphasized understanding the behaviour of piled raft foundation system with an increase in stiffness of raft from flexible to rigid incorporating combined v m h loading which is presented in this section horizontal displacement is recorded at the bottom central node of the raft under a constant vertical load and with increasing lateral load at the top of the column attached to the raft fig 7 a presents lateral load deformation behaviour of pile raft foundation system under combined loading with an increase in relative stiffness of raft with respect to soil k rs and vertical load the piled raft foundation with a 1 2 pile group and varying relative stiffness of raft k rs 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 respectively embedded in medium sand consistency is considered herein the piles are considered to have l b of 2 25 and s d of 4 results are reported for v m h loading with a different combination of v v max taken as 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively it is observed from fig 7 a that lateral load carrying capacity increases considerably with the increase in relative stiffness of raft for instance fig 7 a indicates that the lateral capacity of the foundation increased from 2600 kn to 3250 kn i e 25 with the change of relative stiffness of raft from 0 03 to 37 03 at a deformation of 0 4m for v v max 1 which seems to be maximum this may be due to higher passive lateral resistance offered by the raft with an increase in the stiffness of the raft further it is also observed from fig 7 a that lateral capacity increases significantly with an increase in vertical loading for instance fig 7 a presents a maximum increase in lateral capacity in order of 40 83 and 117 when v v max changes from 0 to 0 1 0 to 0 5 and 0 to 1 respectively for k rs 37 03 at lateral deformation of 0 4m the reason for this increase may be due to the increase in passive resistance of the soil within the pressure triangle beneath the foundation on the other hand fig 7 b presents the moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation subjected to v m h load for varying relative stiffness of raft k rs 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 respectively it is observed from fig 7 b that the rotation of foundation is relatively lesser for the higher relative stiffness of raft i e k rs 37 03 as compared to k rs 0 03 and 4 62 irrespective of amplitude of vertical loading for instance at moment load of 1500 kn m and v v max 0 the rotation of foundation is found to be 0 000109 radians 0 000417 radians and 0 00452 radians for k rs 37 03 4 62 and 0 03 respectively which indicates a significant increase of 40 times with change of k rs 37 03 to 0 03 it is due to higher rigidity offered by thick raft towards the lateral and rotational movement of foundation as compared to a flexible raft further the rotational deformation of the foundation is found to reduce considerably when the piled raft is subjected to combined v m h load however the moment capacity increased with an increase in vertical load despite the different values of k rs for instance it can be noticed from fig 7 b that for k rs 37 03 and rotation angle 0 008 radians moment capacity increased in order of 17 32 and 55 when v v max changes from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively 5 2 2 effect of length to width ratio l b the effect of flexible and stiff behaviour of pile on lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation due to v m h load is investigated considering different l b ratios three values of l b such as 1 0 2 25 and 5 0 are chosen to simulate rigid to flexible behaviour of foundation for the selected soil consistency the l b ratio of 1 behaves more of a rigid foundation with length is equal to the width of the foundation whereas l b ratios of 2 25 and 5 0 behave as a flexible foundation effect of l b of foundation on lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of pile raft foundation system under the action of v m h loading is presented in fig 8 a and b respectively the foundation comprises of a flexible raft of k rs 37 03 and 1 2 pile group with pile length l varied uniformly from rigid to flexible i e l 4m 9m and 20m the s d ratio of the piles is kept to be 4 it is observed from fig 8 a that lateral load capacity increases with the increase in l b of the foundation system for instance fig 8 a indicates that the lateral load capacity increased maximum in order of 1 88 times when l b changed from 1 0 to 2 25 for a lateral deformation of 0 43m and v v max 1 however marginal variation in load deformation behaviour is observed for a change of l b 2 25 to 5 0 further it may also be inferred from fig 8 a that lateral capacity increases with the increase in vertical loading for example the lateral capacity increases in the order of 40 83 and 117 when v v max is increased from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively considering a deformation of 0 4m and l b ratio of 2 25 on the other hand the increase in capacity with the change in vertical load is found to be marginal for change in l b ratio from 2 0 to 5 0 the reason for this similarity maybe because both pile group exhibits flexible nature and pile length beyond a certain depth of fixity marginally influence the lateral capacity a similar observation is noticed in terms of moment capacity from fig 8 b where the capacity increased significantly in order of 110 when l b changed from 1 0 to 2 25 for rotation angle 0 008 radians and v v max 1 the reason may be due to an increase in lateral stiffness offered by piled raft with l b 2 25 as compared to l b 1 however the same marginal variation in moment capacity is observed for a change of l b 2 25 to 5 0 further it may also be inferred from fig 8 b that moment capacity increases with the increase in vertical loading for example the moment capacity increases in the order of 17 32 and 55 when v v max is increased from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively for a rotation of 0 008 radians and l b ratio of 2 25 5 2 3 effect of spacing to diameter s d ratio of pile fig 9 a presents the lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation system for s d of 2 and 4 with a 1 2 pile group under v m h loading a considerable increase in lateral capacity is observed with variation of the s d ratio for instance it is observed from fig 9 a that the lateral capacity of the foundation increased from 3100 kn to 3450 kn i e 11 due to the change of s d ratio from 2 to 4 which seems to be maximum at a deformation of 0 55m with v v max 1 further the application of vertical load along with the action of horizontal and moment load can influence the load carrying capacity of the piled raft foundation system fig 9 a presents that the maximum lateral load resisting capacity is observed in the order of 40 83 and 117 as v v max changes from 0 to 0 1 0 to 0 5 and 0 to 1 respectively for deformation of 0 4m and s d ratio of 4 further at similar deformation and s d 2 a minimum increase in lateral load resistance is observed in the order of 32 at v v max 0 1 79 at v v max 0 5 and 114 at v v max 1 when compared with individual horizontal load i e v v max 0 fig 9 b indicates that the moment capacity increases maximum in order of 15 with the change in s d ratio from 2 to 4 at v v max 1 and rotation angle of 0 008 radians however the increase in capacity is relatively more prominent with the application of vertical load for example a maximum increase in the order of 73 and 55 is observed at a rotation of 0 008 radians when v v max is increased from 0 to 1 for s d 2 and 4 respectively furthermore increasing the s d ratio of piles and vertical load can minimize a significant amount of rotation occurring in such a foundation system when subjected to high lateral loads under combined v m h loading conditions for instance the rotation is reduced by 25 at a moment of 4500 kn m when s d changes from 2 to 4 and v v max 1 is taken into account results indicate that variation of s d may cause a significant increase in lateral and moment load capacity and further can control rotational response of such foundation which may be a vital input in design for piled raft foundation 5 2 4 effect of fixity of pile head the section presents lateral load deformation behaviour of 1 2 pile group with rigid and hinged pile head connection with raft piles with spacing 4d and l b of 2 25 connected with a square raft of k rs 37 03 is used herein fig 10 a and b present the load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation system with rigid and hinged pile head connection with raft under v m h loading the marginal effect in lateral load deformation behaviour is observed for both rigid and hinge connection of pile head with the raft the capacity in case of hinged pile head connection has not shown any significant difference concerning rigid pile head connection however a moderate increase in capacity is observed for hinged pile head connection as compared to rigid pile head connection at v v max 0 5 and 1 and deformation of 0 4m for instance the value of lateral capacity for hinged pile head connection with raft increased by 4 and 2 of the capacity for rigid head connection with the raft at v v max 0 5 and 1 respectively the increase is however very negligible the results thus indicate that hinged and rigid pile head connection under the v m h load condition has a marginal effect on lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation however the observation is comparatively different in terms of moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation for example from fig 10 b it is observed that the moment capacity of piled raft foundation reduced by a maximum of 44 for v v max 0 and a minimum 8 53 for v v max 0 1 when pile head connection is changed from rigid to hinge further it can also be inferred from fig 10 b that the rotation of the foundation increased by a change in pile head connection from rigid to hinge hence it can be suggested that a rigid pile head connection is more suitable to counter the influence of rocking effect lateral and rotational both of piled raft foundation as compared to hinged connection 5 2 5 effect of varying ep es ratio lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of pile raft foundation system with varying e p e s ratio under v m h loading are presented in fig 11 a and b respectively increase in lateral and moment capacity is observed with a decrease in e p e s ratio for instance fig 11 a and b indicates that the lateral load capacity of the foundation increased maximum by 21 and 24 due to decrease in e p e s ratio from 28570 to 15380 at a deformation of 0 25m and rotation of 0 008 radians respectively with v v max 1 however the capacity increased considerably if combined v m h load is considered on the piled raft foundation system as compared to individual lateral loading i e v v max 0 for instance the maximum increase in capacity is observed in the order of 120 when v v max increased from 0 to 1 at a deformation of 0 4m and e p e s ratio of 28570 5 3 lateral load sharing among components of piled raft foundation under combined v m h loading this section presents the percentage of sharing of lateral load within a raft and pile elements of the piled raft foundation under combined v m h loading which seems to be another significant concern in design table 4 presents the percentage of lateral load shared by pile and raft attached to piled raft when subjected to combined v m h load encompassing different parametric variations the percentage of the lateral load carried by pile and raft in a pile raft system is calculated using the following equations 2 α p l p l c p r f 100 3 α r 100 α p where α p and α r are the percentage of load shared by pile and raft element respectively l p is the lateral load shared by pile and l c p r f is the total lateral load applied on the piled raft foundation under constant vertical load table 4 indicates that a significant proportion of the load is shared by pile in a piled raft foundation compared to the raft at v v max 0 the raft carries around 16 30 of the total lateral load applied on the foundation whereas the pile carries 70 84 of this total lateral load however with the increase in the ratio of v v max the load carrying proportion of pile increases irrespective of various parametric variations the percentage increases to a maximum of 90 for v v max 1 further the parametric variations such as a k rs l b ratio of foundation and e p e s ratio have considerable influence on the lateral load sharing proportion between the pile and raft however the effect of other parameters such as the s d ratio of the pile and pile head connection with the raft is found to be marginal for example the percentage of lateral load proportion of raft increases with the increase in relative stiffness of raft with respect to soil k rs this may be because thick raft may offer higher passive resistance to the applied load coming on the foundation as compared to a flexible raft further it is also observed that the increase in the l b ratio of foundation increases the load sharing proportion of piles in a piled raft this is expected as long flexible pile offers higher load resistance as compared to a short rigid pile 5 4 development of failure and design envelopes considering v m h interaction 5 4 1 interaction mechanism due to coupled v m h load numerical load controlled probing tests are performed on fem based prototype piled raft foundation model encompassing parametric variation to assess the interaction between combinedly acting vertical v moment m and horizontal h load under the application of constant v v max the monotonically increasing horizontal and associated moment load created coupled sway and rotational deformation of the foundation simultaneously as discussed in the previous section the yield lateral and moment capacity are calculated from load deformation behaviour for each test under constant v v max a three dimensional plot of yield capacities is plotted in three dimensional v m h load space which represents the yield failure envelope for the corresponding parametric case fig 12 a presents the three dimensional failure envelope of piled raft foundation under complex interaction of v m h load for the parametric case of spacing 4d l b of 2 25 and rigidly connected with a square raft of k rs 37 03 the best fitted polynomial curve of the second order is used to construct the nonlinear envelope the envelope is presented in normalized form as a function of h v max and m bv max with respect to v v max in v h and v m planes respectively for better visualization of the 3d envelope its projection in two dimensional v h v m and h m planes along with the proposed closed form equation of the yield envelope are presented in fig 12 b c and d respectively it is observed from v h v m plots that the failure envelope is parabolic and a similar trend is also observed in past studies for other types of foundation gourvenec and randolph 2003 yun and bransby 2007 el marassi et al 2017 further the h m plot is found to increase linearly with the increase in the ratio of v v max this is because m h ratio is kept constant in the present study 5 4 2 effect of parametric variations on failure and design envelopes considering v m h interaction this section presents the effect of different parametric variations on failure and design envelopes of the piled raft under combined v m h interaction both the envelopes are presented in the same two dimensional v h load space design envelopes are developed by joining lateral load corresponding to allowable lateral displacement of 30 mm for piled raft foundation as suggested elsewhere salgado 2008 fig 13 a to 13 e presents failure and design envelopes in the form of h v max for varying v v max encompassing different parametric variations such as raft flexibility pile length l to the width of raft b ratio s d ratio of the pile pile head connection and e p e s ratio respectively it is observed from fig 13 a that h v max follows the nonlinear increasing trend with maximum value observed at v v max 0 75 in case of failure envelope this infers that the maximum lateral load capacity of the piled raft foundation in sandy soil may be achieved when vertical loading is in order of 75 of the ultimate vertical load capacity of the piled raft system v v max 0 75 indicates the factor of safety of 1 33 which may be considered as optimum from the viewpoint of lateral loading however considering the design envelope it may be inferred that h v max is maximum when v v max 0 50 i e factor of safety f s 2 0 hence as a design guideline f s in a range between 1 33 and 2 0 is preferable for the design of such foundation considering combined v m h loading furthermore fig 13 a presents that lateral load capacity increases significantly with an increase in relative stiffness of raft for example the increment in lateral capacity is calculated to be 32 with the increment of k rs 0 03 to 37 03 further the increase in lateral yield load at v v max 0 75 is observed in the order of 19 and 11 with a change of k rs 0 03 to 4 62 and 4 62 to 37 03 respectively fig 13 b presents failure and design envelope considering the variation of l b of piled raft foundation within stiff to flexible range under v m h loading interaction both failure and design envelope for this case exhibits a similar trend as observed in fig 13 a the maximum lateral capacity increases significantly with an increase in l b ratio from 1 0 to 2 25 it is found that the maximum increment in h v max at v v max 0 80 is found in order of 110 and 75 for failure and design envelope respectively when l b ratio changes from 1 0 to 2 25 piled raft with l b 1 0 which represents a short stiff piled raft system may tend to overturn with an increase of lateral loading this is due to the fact yield lateral load capacity is significantly lesser compared to l b 2 25 which exhibits flexible behaviour further the increase in l b ratio from 2 25 to 5 0 exhibits marginal variation in yield lateral capacity the reason may be because both l b 2 25 and 5 behave as a flexible piled raft foundation the study reveals that the presence of flexible piles in a piled raft foundation may contribute to a maximum lateral load resistance of the foundation system fig 13 c to 13 e presents failure and design envelope for piled raft foundation for a parametric variation of s d ratio pile head connection and e p e s ratio a similar trend in failure and design envelop is observed in all cases in all the cases design envelope attains a maximum value of h v max at v v max 0 50 and failure envelope attains maximum value within a range of v v max 0 60 to 0 80 these observations suggest a need to consider f s within a range of 1 33 2 to utilize the optimum maximum lateral as well as moment capacity it can be outlined in fig 13 c that the failure curve marginally shifted upward with the increase in the s d ratio of the pile for instance at v v max 0 60 the value of h v max has shown a maximum increase of around 12 when the spacing of the pile has changed from 2d to 4d the study showcased the influence of pile spacing may affect the lateral load resistance capacity under combined v m h load interaction further fig 13 d indicates that the variation of the pile head connection has a marginal influence on the envelopes in addition it is observed from fig 13 e that varying e p e s ratio has considerable influence on both the design and failure envelope for instance the maximum lateral load h v max is found at v v max 0 7 which varies in order of 28 with a change of e p e s 28570 to 15380 as observed from fig 13 e finally table 5 is a comprehensive representation of the optimum vertical load at which maximum yield lateral load will occur for a piled raft foundation embedded in sandy soil encompassing different parametric variations 5 5 influence of v m h interaction on bending moment and shear force profile of piled raft foundation this section presents the bending moment profile along with the depth of pile considering combined v m h loading condition and different parametric cases this is primarily aimed to verify the limit state of collapse criteria of the design of piled raft foundation under the combined action of v m h loading the failure and design envelopes for the piled raft foundation presented in the previous section are developed based on serviceability criteria which may be generally considered as benchmark criteria for the design of the pile the present study also considered the same philosophy however the maximum bending moment profile along pile length with respect to the application of a different combination of vertical loading i e v v max 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 and yield horizontal load is highlighted in this section will help to develop insight for design the ultimate moment resistance of the pile section is also presented in the same plot to assess the safety margin considering collapse criteria the horizontal load applied to the foundation is the yield lateral load used to develop the failure envelope as discussed in section 5 4 fig 14 a e presents bending moment profile along the depth of pile section under v m h loading and encompassing different parametric variations such as k rs l b ratio s d ratio pile head connection and e p e s ratio the maximum bending moment developed in a pile due to combined v m h loading is compared with the resisting moment of each pile section the resisting moment is calculated to be 5092 8 kn m for steel piles it is observed from fig 14 a e that the maximum bending moment developed in a pile due to application of yield lateral load and v v max 0 to 1 for different parametric variation is lesser than the resisting moment of pile section this infers that the failure envelopes generated from corresponding yield lateral load for various parametric cases is safe from collapse criteria the curves thus can be used for the capacity based design of piled raft foundation subjected to combined v m h loading further it is evident from fig 14 a e that the bending moment tends to increase with the increase in the percentage of vertical load in v m h loading irrespective of different parametric variations for instance it can be observed in fig 14 a that the bending moment increased by 1 85 times with change in v v max from 0 to 1 and at a depth of 3m from the top surface this may be due to p δ effect of loading on the pile head furthermore it is observed from fig 14 a e that pile head bending moment is either positive or in some cases is found to be negative the maximum bending moment is however developed at around 4 5m depth i e half of the length of the pile and ultimately reduces to zero bending moment at pile tip the cross over point from positive to negative bending moment in some cases occurred at shallow depth i e in between 0m and 1m the observation is similar to the observations reported by poulos and davis 1980 and gazetas 1984 further the effect of different parametric variations on the bending moment profile is however marginal for example from fig 14 e a maximum variation of 18 25 is observed in the bending moment at 4m depth when e p e s decreased from 28570 to 15380 further fig 15 a e presents the shear force along with pile depth for different parametric variations as discussed in previous sections it is observed from fig 15 a e the pile head shear is negative for different variations of vertical load and also for parametric variation however for v v max 1 case the pile head shear is found to be positive in all the figures further a cross over point i e point of contraflacture at a depth between 3m and 4 5m is observed when shear force changes from negative to the positive side this is quite evident as the bending moment of the pile section is found to be maximum c f fig 14 in this region i e 3m 4 5m depth furthermore a significant variation in shear force is observed when v v max changes from 0 to 1 for example from fig 15 c for s d 2 and at pile depth of 1m it is observed that shear force increased in the order of 4 16 times 12 57 times and 18 27 times when v v max increased from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively however the effect of different parametric variations on shear force along pile depth is marginal the observation is similar to the observation made from the bending moment profile as discussed in the previous section 5 6 sensitivity analysis on lateral capacity involving different parameters this section presents the percentage increase in the yield lateral capacity of the piled raft for different parametric cases considered in the present study this comparative analysis is performed to identify the sensitive design parameters which have a significant influence on the design of piled raft foundation under combined loading the percentage increase in lateral load capacity is evaluated using the following equation 4 p i h c v m h c h c h 100 where p i h is the percentage increase in yield lateral load capacity of the piled raft for the different parametric cases c v m h is the yield lateral load capacity of piled raft under combined v m h loading and c h is the yield lateral load capacity of the piled raft under pure lateral load i e v v max 0 fig 16 presents a sample of percentage increase in yield lateral capacity of the piled raft for the different parametric cases using a bar diagram v v max 0 1 case is considered as the sample case a significant increase in yield lateral load capacity of piled raft under v m h loading is observed for the various parametric cases for instance a maximum and minimum increase in yield lateral capacity in the order of 86 and 22 respectively are observed for piled raft under combined v m h loading the increase further rises with the increase in the value of v v max as observed in the previous sections further the effect of k rs l b s d and e p e s is found to be significant in the percentage increase of yield lateral capacity however the effect of the pile head connection with the raft is marginal for example the percentage increase in yield lateral capacity is found to be 86 for k rs 0 03 and 64 for k rs 37 03 this shows that rigid raft i e k rs 37 03 offers higher passive resistance even for pure lateral load case i e v v max 0 6 case study and design implication a representative 15 storey tall bare frame building consisting of a single bay 8 5 m 8 5 m with 3 5m storey height is considered to be supported by piled raft foundation embedded in medium sandy type soil the properties of raft pile and sand are kept similar to that presented in table 1 in the first step the piled raft foundation is designed based on gravity loading the loading on each floor is considered as 8 0 kn m2 factored dl ll the maximum vertical load from 15 storey building along with the weight of the roof slab is calculated as 9248 kn i e w 16 8 5 8 5 8 9248 kn raft size of 10 m 10 m 1m thick is assumed for this building the raft exhibits an adequate factor of safety f s 3 with respect to shear failure criteria considering imposed vertical loading the settlement of raft is calculated as 91 87 mm under applied loading using plaxis 3d 2008 which is found to be higher than the allowable limit of 75 mm as suggested in bowels 1997 fig 17 a presents the settlement profile under applied gravity loading hence a 3 3 pile group of length 10 8m and diameter 0 6m rigidly connected with the raft is designed following poulos 2001 in order to reduce the settlement of the raft the centre to centre spacing between the piles is kept as 4d it can be observed from fig 17 b that the settlement of the raft is reduced to 72 92 mm in order of 20 63 incorporating 9 numbers of symmetrically placed piles beneath the raft which is within the permissible value the ultimate vertical load capacity v max of a 3 3 piled raft foundation is calculated as 67000 kn from the load settlement curve which is obtained using plaxis 3d 2008 in the next step the design lateral load capacity of a 3 3 piled raft foundation is obtained as 3630 kn at v v max 0 condition using plaxis 3d 2008 considering 30 mm as allowable lateral displacement fig 18 a presents the horizontal load deflection behaviour of the piled raft foundation on the other hand the design lateral capacity of the same piled raft foundation is computed using the dimensionless envelope proposed in this study ref fig 13 a which represents similar system parameters of the case study problem the calculated design lateral load h is 3886 kn for v v max 0 which validates the computed capacity of 3630 kn obtained after analyzing in plaxis 3d 2008 showing a marginal variation of 7 hence this confirms the sanctity of using proposed envelopes for computing yield lateral capacity as well as the design capacity of piled raft foundation in sandy soil however the actual lateral capacity h of the 3 3 pile group using fig 18 b is calculated as 4490 kn for v v max 0 14 calculated for this case study which is found to be higher increase in the order of 24 than counterpart result corresponding to v v max 0 condition this concludes that the actual lateral capacity considering v m h loading will always be higher compared to the capacity calculated under v v max 0 condition and hence will always lead to an over safe design for lateral capacity the extent of over safety will depend on the factor of safety with respect to vertical loading i e v v max as per the trend observed in the results of the present study hence to ensure an economical as well as rational design redesign of 3 3 piled raft foundation supporting 15 storey building structures is performed keeping target lateral capacity as 3630 kn obtained at v v max 0 condition for 3 3 piled raft and permissible settlement of 75 mm the design capacity of 3630 kn will be achieved with a lesser number of pile groups if the capacity is calculated considering v m h loading which is presented in the next subsection 6 1 proposed redesign of piled raft system several trials are performed with a reduced number of pile groups to satisfy the target lateral capacity and settlement criteria a 3 2 group of piled raft foundation with the same length and diameter is suggested for this problem which is found to satisfy both the criteria however the centre to centre spacing between the piles is increased from 4d to 5d since the lateral capacity of the piled raft system increases when s d increases as outlined in the present study fig 19 a presents the plan of the revised pile group obtained after analyzing in plaxis 3d 2008 for both settlement and lateral load further fig 19 b presents the settlement contour of the piled raft it is observed that the settlement increased marginally from 72 92 mm to 73 90 mm for a 3 2 pile group as compared to the 3 3 pile group furthermore fig 19 c presents a comparison between the lateral load vs horizontal deformation for 3 2 and 3 3 pile group under combined v m h load condition it is observed that the lateral design capacity of a 3 2 piled raft foundation under the v m h condition v v max 0 14 condition is 4000 kn which is higher than the design capacity of 3 3 piled raft system obtained under v v max 0 condition hence the proposed redesign based on the outcome of the present study will help to reduce the number of piles in a piled raft foundation and will lead to economic design 7 summary and conclusions the present study highlights the influence of the interaction of combined v m h load on the static response of piled raft foundation embedded in homogenous sandy soil a parametric study incorporating a variation of different influential parameters such as variation of the relative stiffness of raft k rs length to width ratio of the foundation l b spacing to the diameter of piles s d the variation of pile head connection with the raft and variation of the ratio of young s modulus of pile and soil e p e s is carried out to investigate the influence on the response of pile raft incorporating static v m h interaction in addition two dimensional design curves for estimation of lateral load are also presented encompassing parametric variations the study offers the following salient conclusions 1 study of lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation system incorporating different relative stiffness of raft i e k rs 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 under combined v m h loading indicates that the lateral and moment capacity of piled raft increases considerably with increase in rigidity of raft while such an increase may further go up with the gradual increase in vertical loading on the piled raft system the maximum increase in lateral capacity may go up to 25 if k rs varies from 0 03 to 37 03 on the other hand the increase in lateral capacity may further rise maximum up to 117 for k rs 37 03 when v v max increases from 0 to 1 and at a deformation level of 40 mm similarly the increase in maximum moment capacity is found in order of 55 at 0 008 radians of rotation for k rs 37 03 2 the influence of variation of l b ratio on lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour indicates that the lateral and moment capacity increases maximum in order of 1 88 times and 1 10 times due to combined loading effect when the l b ratio varies from 1 0 to 2 25 further it is interestingly observed that the increase becomes too marginal with a further increase in the l b ratio i e l b 2 25 to 5 0 this is due to pile behaves like a long or flexible slender member under horizontal loading beyond the l b ratio of 2 25 3 the influence of variation of s d ratio on lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour is found to be marginal for instance the increase in lateral and moment capacity is found to be in the order of 11 and 15 for v m h loading when the s d ratio varies from 2 0 to 4 0 however a significant increase in lateral capacity is observed in the order of 114 and 117 at s d 2 and 4 respectively with an increase of v v max from 0 to 1 4 it is observed that the influence of the pile head connection is marginal on the lateral capacity of the piled raft foundation system under v m h loading for instance a maximum increment of 4 and 2 in lateral capacity are observed at v v max 0 5 and 1 respectively when the pile head connection changed from rigid to hinge however the observation is entirely different fo the moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation the moment capacity of piled raft foundation reduced by a maximum of 44 for v v max 0 and a minimum of 8 53 for v v max 0 1 when the pile head connection is changed from rigid to hinge 5 variation of e p e s has a considerable influence of lateral and moment capacity under combined v m h loading it is observed that variation of e p e s of 28570 loose sand to 15380 medium sand may result from increasing of 21 and 24 in lateral and moment capacity respectively under v m h loading further the maximum increment in lateral capacity is found in order of 120 when v v max varies from 0 to 1 in v m h loading 6 the load sharing proportion of various components of the piled raft is presented under combined v m h loading it is observed that at high deformation level the pile shares around 70 84 to the total applied lateral load for v v max 0 further the load sharing by piles increases with an increase in v v max furthermore the considerable influence of parametric variations such as a change in the value of k rs l b ratio of foundation and e p e s ratio on the lateral load sharing proportion between pile and raft is observed while the effect of other parameters such as the s d ratio of the pile and pile head connection with a raft is found to be marginal 7 non dimensional failure as well as design envelopes for piled raft system under lateral loading with respect to normalized vertical loading i e v v max is presented encompassing parametric variation in general the failure envelope considering v m h loading is observed to be increasing nonlinearly with respect to v v max it is observed that maximum failure load h v max on the piled raft foundation is found within a range of v v max 0 6 to 0 85 encompassing different parametric variations however the influence of different parametric variation is found to be marginal on the failure curve on the other hand the failure envelope for variation in l b and k rs presents significant variation for instance a maximum variation of 110 in lateral yield load is observed when l b changed from 1 0 to 2 25 at v v max 0 80 similarly at v v max 0 75 the value of h v max has shown a maximum increase of around 32 when the rigidity of raft changed from k rs 0 03 to 37 03 this issue may be studied further in addition the effect of parametric variations seemed to be marginal on the design envelope however in all the envelopes a peak point is observed within a range of v v max 0 50 to 0 70 this indicates that considering a factor of safety in between 1 42 and 2 the actual lateral capacity of piled raft can be obtained under a combined v m h load 8 the influence of v m h load on bending moment and shear force profile along the depth of the pile section is also studied herein to verify the collapse criteria it is observed that the maximum bending moment developed in a pile due to application of yield lateral load and variation of v v max from 0 to 1 for different parametric variation is lesser than the resisting moment of the pile section this infers that the failure envelopes generated from corresponding yield lateral load for various parametric cases is safe from collapse criteria further both shear force and bending moment along pile length are found to increase with the increase in the percentage of vertical load in v m h loading irrespective of different parametric variations furthermore the maximum bending moment is observed at half of the pile length where the shear force is found to be 0 however the bending moment reduced to 0 at the tip of the pile 9 sensitivity analysis on the comparative influence of different parameters indicates that yield lateral load capacity increases significantly for piled raft under v m h loading a maximum increase of 86 in yield capacity is observed for v v max 0 1 the increase is found to rise further with the increase in the ratio of v v max irrespective of different parametric variations on the other hand a considerable effect in the percentage increase of yield lateral capacity is observed for different parameters such as k rs l b s d and e p e s while the effect of another parameter i e pile head connection with the raft is found to be marginal finally a case study problem of piled raft supported building structure is critically analyzed from the point of view of design guidelines presented in this study this study infers that the conventional design of a piled raft foundation based on single vertical or lateral loading provides a conservative design hence the redesign is worked out following the outcome of the present study with a reduced number of piles keeping view of design constraints and finally leads to an economical piled raft foundation design credit authorship contribution statement diptesh chanda conceptualization methodology software validation resources writing original draft visualization

21488,a combined piled raft foundation cprf is generally used for massive and tall structures the conventional design of piled raft does not include the capacity of piled raft under combined lateral and vertical load however vertical v horizontal h and moment m loading may act on the foundation simultaneously the present study examines the behaviour of piled raft foundation in sandy soil under v m h interaction using three dimensional finite element analysis the horizontal and moment capacity of piled raft is assessed due to various influential parameters such as relative stiffness of pile and soil raft soil relative stiffness spacing to diameter ratio of the pile length to width ratio of the foundation and pile head connection with the raft it is observed that piled raft lateral capacity increases due to combined loading than that of independent capacity both failure and design envelopes are also developed considering v m h interaction finally the design implication of the outcome of the present study is presented using a case study it is revealed that the design of piled raft with lateral capacity obtained from the combined action of the v m h load may reduce the number of piles as compared to conventional design performed using individual capacity keywords piled raft foundation v m h interaction 3d finite element analysis failure envelope design envelope 1 introduction piled rafts have been widely adopted as a foundation system for supporting high rise buildings towers and offshore structures resting on soft or loose to medium soil deposit the prime advantage of the piled raft foundation is that it controls total and differential settlements and enhances the serviceability of the whole structure significantly piles under the raft act as a settlement reducer while raft also provides reasonable stiffness and soil resistance hence the capacity of a piled raft considering the combined behaviour of raft and pile is required to design the foundation based on the field observations the concept of pile raft foundation system has been successfully adopted by several countries for various high rises and complex structures e g hooper 1973 yamashita et al 1993 2011 2012 dash et al 2009 katzenbach et al 2000 2016 choudhury et al 2019 in fact the conventional design of piled raft considers the capacity of piled raft under sole vertical and lateral load previous research studies have given considerable efforts for the development of optimum design guideline of piled raft foundation under vertical loading e g horikoshi and randolph 1994 clancy and randolph 1996 katzenbach and reul 1997 horikoshi and randolph 1998 architectural institute of japan 2001 katzenbach and moorman 2001 poulos 2001 reul and randolph 2003 desanctis and mandolini 2006 poulos et al 2011 kumar et al 2015 kumar and choudhury 2018 mali and singh 2018 apart from this the international society for soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering issmge has also published design and construction guidelines for a vertically loaded piled raft for different subsoil conditions katzenbach and choudhury 2013 however the piled raft foundation system is often subjected to a combined vertical lateral and moment load simultaneously the earthquake hydrological wave lateral soil pressure and wind wave may impart significant horizontal forces and moments in addition to gravity load the behaviour of the piled raft foundation is complex due to combined action of vertical v horizontal h and moment m loading and may be considered as governing design criteria for the rational design of the foundation system hence consideration of combined capacity under v m h interaction is required in obtaining the design response and sustainable design of the piled raft foundation few experimental studies are attempted to investigate the horizontal and vertical response of piled raft foundation under combined loading by performing model as well as full scale studies e g pastsakorn et al 2002 matsumoto et al 2004a 2004b hamada et al 2012 sawada and takemura 2014 model or full scale experimental study on combined interaction of load is however cumbersome hence numerical analysis or analytical approach can be an alternative solution that may provide better insight into the problem few numerical small and zhang 2002 unsever et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 comodromos et al 2015 bhaduri and choudhury 2019 and analytical studies mu et al 2014 roy et al 2018 bhaduri and choudhury 2020 have also been conducted in the past to understand the behaviour of piled raft under combined loading mu et al 2014 have reported various analytical solutions to incorporate the effect of soil non homogeneity on vertical and lateral response of piled raft under combined loading further unsever et al 2015 and bhaduri and choudhury 2020 has reported about the load sharing proportion of the components of piled raft under combined loading from both the studies it was perceived that the raft present in a piled raft carried the maximum lateral load at the beginning of loading however at higher deformation level the load sharing of raft reduces and that of the pile increases these studies have primarily indicated the importance of consideration of v m h loading for the design of piled raft foundation moreover these past studies of combined loading effect on the piled raft behaviour have not highlighted the influence of various other design parameters such as relative stiffness of pile and soil raft soil relative stiffness spacing to diameter ratio of the pile length to width ratio of the foundation and pile head connection with the raft on the behaviour of piled raft these design parameters have been outlined as controlling factors in the design of piled raft foundation by many researchers e g hain and lee 1978 poulos and davis 1980 clancy 1993 clancy and randolph 1996 horikoshi and randolph 1998 poulos 2001 nguyen et al 2013 hence the state of art research indicates that a comprehensive study on v m h interaction on a piled raft supported structure including the effect of these influential parameters is limited and needs to be studied therefore the present study is an attempt in this direction to investigate the influence of various parametric variations on the lateral response of piled raft under combined v m h loading on the other hand various other studies have presented two dimensional and three dimensional parabolic failure envelope curves due to v m h loads for a different type of footings and shallow foundation system roscoe and schofield 1957 tan 1990 houlsby 1997 bransby and randolph 1998 gourvenec and randolph 2003 bienen et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 li et al 2017 the exploration of the shape of the failure envelope or yield surface within three dimensional v m h load space was first introduced by roscoe and schofield 1957 later ticof 1977 conducted several combined loading tests on a rough strip footing resting on sand and plotted the data in two dimensional v h and m h load space butterfield and ticof 1979 used the concept of ticof 1977 and developed a three dimensional cigar shaped parabolic yield surface within v m h load space further tan 1990 investigated the v h yield loci for various conical and spudcan footings resting on saturated sands by performing displacement controlled side swipe tests in a geotechnical centrifuge the benefit of this swipe test is that a complete failure locus on a certain plane can be determined in a single test apart from this another concept named displacement probe to determine the yield locus of a failure envelope was suggested by bransby and randolph 1997 in this method the load state and failure mechanism at one point on the failure envelope was obtained by keeping a fixed ratio of displacements in a particular direction this concept of swipe test and displacement probe test has been adopted by several researchers to date to develop failure envelopes for various types of footing and shallow foundation system houlsby 1997 bransby and randolph 1998 gourvenec and randolph 2003 bienen et al 2006 el marassi 2011 el marassi et al 2017 li et al 2017 based on the available literature in this direction it has been realized that limited efforts have been made to develop failure envelope for piled raft foundation system considering the interaction of v m h loading the development of the failure envelope is done based on yield displacement of the piled raft and may help to predict the upper bound yield surface of lateral and moment capacities for the applied vertical loading on the other hand the conventional design of the foundation is performed based on serviceability criteria by considering the allowable limit of deformation and not on yield deformation therefore the development of design envelopes based on allowable deformation may also prove to be an essential tool for the design of piled raft under v m h loading various guidelines are available for the selection of allowable deformation of piled raft under lateral loading for example japan road association jra 2002 has suggested maximum allowable lateral displacement of pile foundation for highway bridges in japan is limited to 1 of pile diameter further das et al 2016 considered maximum allowable lateral displacement of a pile of 30 mm in a piled raft system based on a study published elsewhere salgado 2008 it may be concluded that jra criteria seem to be conservative for piled raft foundation and on the contrary allowable displacement of pile suggested by salgado 2008 may be a rational one for the design of piled raft foundation system given the above state of the art research in this direction the present study is an attempt to investigate the behaviour of piled raft foundation embedded in homogenous sand deposit considering combined action of static v m h loading in a coupled form besides this the development of failure and design envelopes are also performed herein following probe test method as suggested elsewhere yun and bransby 2007 and el marassi et al 2017 3d finite element analysis considering soil as nonlinear and structure as linear material is performed using plaxis 3d 2008 commercial software first the 3d numerical model is validated with an experimental study and numerical study by sawada and takemura 2014 and kumar et al 2016 after that the influence of the interaction of combined v m h load on lateral load and moment deformation behaviour piled raft foundation are studied encompassing various influential parameters such as relative stiffness of raft and pile length to width ratio of the foundation l b spacing to diameter ratio of piles s d and pile head connection with the raft to develop design insight into the problem the influence of v m h load interaction on bending moment and shear force profile along the depth of the pile of piled raft foundation are also presented finally a case study is presented highlighting the design implication of this study hence this study aims at developing a broad understanding of the behaviour of piled raft foundation system considering static coupled v m h load interaction which helps to formulate a design guideline 2 modelling of soil piled raft foundation system a three dimensional analysis using plaxis 3d 2008 is carried out for a piled raft foundation embedded in a homogenous sand deposit the piled raft is considered to be embedded below the ground surface fig 1 presents the schematic representation of the piled raft system embedded in the soil domain soil is modelled as a saturated homogeneous medium with an angle of internal friction ϕ and dilatancy angle φ of 31 and 1 respectively the properties of the sand medium are referred from bowels 1997 and are presented in table 1 the soil domain is assumed as a 3d prismatic cube having a dimension of 28m length 28m breadth 16m height the 15 noded wedge elements are used to create the soil domain this element is composed of 6 node triangles in the horizontal direction and 8 node quadrilaterals in the vertical direction as shown in fig 2 the soil domain is meshed by adopting variable mesh density to achieve acceptable accuracy and computational efficiency of analysis local refinements with coarseness factor of 0 25 in soil mesh are assigned near to piled raft foundation where large stress concentrations or deformation gradients are anticipated a typical 3d mesh discretization is shown in fig 2 from a convergence study the total number of nodes and elements are obtained as 5351 and 1848 respectively the average element size of each element is 2 84m the lateral soil boundaries are kept as seven times the width of the foundation while the vertical boundary is kept as four times the width of the foundation to minimize the boundary effects kumar et al 2016 the side boundaries of the soil domain are constrained against the horizontal direction and the bottom boundaries are constrained against both horizontal and vertical directions non linear elastic perfectly plastic mohr coulomb constitutive model is used for sandy soil the size of the raft is considered as 4m length 4m width 1m thickness which is modelled using a plate element and meshed using a 6 noded triangular element the raft is considered to be made of aluminum material having young s modulus and poisson s ratio in the order of 70 gpa and 0 35 respectively steel piles having length 9m and diameter 0 5m with the centre to centre spacing of four times of diameter is modelled using an embedded pile element with linear elastic section properties this embedded pile element consists of a beam element and its behaviour is defined using elastic stiffness properties 4 noded line element is used to mesh the embedded pile the superstructure is idealized as a column in a simplified form which is modelled using a beam element fig 2 presents the column section through which a combined v m h load is developed on the top of the foundation the vertical steel column having a circular cross section is attached rigidly at the centroid of the raft height and diameter of the steel column are assumed as 3m and 0 5m respectively this column section is created to develop moment load m at the raft level by applying a horizontal load h at the top end of the column i e m h e where e is the eccentric distance between the top end of the column to raft surface gravity load is also applied on the column to the foundation the detailed parameters of the linear elastic and nonporous pile raft and superstructure are presented in table 1 the surface to surface contact method is used to model the soil raft interface while the interaction with soil at the pile shaft and toe is described using embedded interface elements the roughness coefficient in the form of strength reduction factor r inter is used for interface modelling of both raft and pile with soil this factor represents interface strength to the soil strength the present study considers r inter 0 7 in sandy soil as proposed elsewhere brinkgreve et al 2008 3 application of v m h load and method of analysis to simulate combined v m h loading load controlled probe test method suggested elsewhere yun and bransby 2007 and el marassi et al 2017 is considered in the present study in the probe test method the loads are applied in two stages in the first loading stage the prescribed vertical load is applied to the foundation in the second stage of loading coupled horizontal h and moment m loads are applied simultaneously on the foundation keeping the vertical load v constant the vertical load v is taken equal to 10 50 and 100 of the ultimate vertical load capacity v max of the piled raft foundation system i e v v max 0 1 0 5 and 1 the double tangent method is used to obtain the ultimate vertical load capacity v max of the piled raft foundation from the load settlement curve monotonically increasing horizontal load h is applied at the top end of a vertical column with an eccentricity e from the top of the raft surface therefore the moment at the top central node of the raft is equal to the horizontal force applied at the top of column times the eccentricity above the raft surface i e m h e the moment is increased by gradually increasing h up to a higher deformation range i e failure range and keeping e constant throughout the study hence h m relationship is linear in the present study fig 1 presents the schematic diagram of the adopted load path on the piled raft foundation the central node at the top surface of the raft is considered as the load reference point lrf the sign convention for displacements and loads presented in this numerical study obeys right handed axes and positive clockwise convention as proposed by butterfield et al 1997 lateral displacement vertical settlement and rotation of the foundation under v m h load are measured at the central bottom node of the raft and are denoted as u x u y and θ respectively c f fig 1 finite element calculation is divided into several sequential calculation phases the first calculation phase i e the initial stress field condition under initial geometry configuration is performed employing k 0 procedure option in built in plaxis 3d 2008 the first phase is followed by a plastic calculation phase of the piled raft to simulate the elastoplastic deformation analysis of the piled raft under v m h loading further the horizontal load deformation curves are plotted for different parametric cases and the yield lateral capacity of the piled raft is ascertained using the double tangent method on this curve an exemplary case for the determination of yield lateral load using the double tangent method in the load deformation curve is presented in fig 3 4 parametric cases a parametric study considering various influential parameters related to the pile raft system is carried out to investigate the interaction of combined v m h loading on the design response of a piled raft foundation system influence of variation in several parameters such as relative stiffness of both raft and pile length to width ratio l b of the foundation system spacing to diameter ratio s d and pile head connection with raft are studied within a feasible range of interest of piled raft system the relative stiffness of raft is modelled by following relationship proposed by clancy and randolph 1996 1 k r s 4 e r b t r 3 1 ν s 2 3 π e s l r 4 1 ν r 2 where e r and e s are young s modulus of the raft and the soil respectively l r and b is the length and width of the raft respectively t r represents the thickness of the raft ν r and ν s are the poisson s ratio of the raft and the soil respectively according to horikoshi and randolph 1998 an increase in k rs indicates the raft behaviour changes from flexible to rigid hence the present study incorporates three relative stiffness values of the raft k rs in order of 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 attributing raft thickness t r 0 1m 0 5m and 1 0m respectively to incorporate flexible to rigid behaviour of raft under v m h loading loose and medium sand consistency are considered which represents two different relative stiffness of pile i e e p e s in order of 28 570 and 15 380 respectively the piled raft foundation having three different lengths to width ratios l b of the foundation system namely 1 2 25 and 5 are considered in this study piled raft foundation having l b ratio of 1 2 25 indicates stiff behaviour whereas the l b ratio of 5 indicates flexible behaviour further two different spacing to diameter s d ratio in the order of 2 and 4 are considered in this study horikoshi et al 2003 reported that the horizontal stiffness of the piled raft foundation with a hinged pile head connection with a raft is smaller than that of a piled raft foundation system with a rigid pile head connection the present study also attempts to investigate the behaviour of piled raft foundation with two different pile head connection with the raft namely rigid and hinged table 2 presents a detailed summary of parametric cases considered in the present study 5 results and discussion 5 1 validation of the proposed numerical model the numerical model of piled raft foundation developed in plaxis 3d 2008 is validated with experimental and numerical studies published elsewhere sawada and takemura 2014 and kumar et al 2016 to verify the sanctity of developed model the parameters pertaining to soil pile raft and superstructure for both the studies are presented in table 3 at first the 3d numerical model is validated considering an experimental study sawada and takemura 2014 the model tests were performed in toyoura sand by sawada and takemura 2014 in a geotechnical centrifuge to examine the performance of laterally loaded piled raft foundation a centrifuge acceleration of 50g was employed in the study pre vertical i e vertical load test before application of horizontal load and lateral push in and push out tests i e application of lateral load from the left towards the right direction and vice versa were performed on model piled raft the pre vertical loading test was performed on the model piled raft system in centrifuge with displacement controlled loading intensity of 0 0162 mm s the total mass of the raft and superstructure was assumed as 2 7 kg which was equivalent to 3330 kn in the prototype scale under 50g centrifugal acceleration further push in and push out tests were performed by applying lateral load at a height equivalent to the spacing between the piles i e h s 1 and at 1 8 times the spacing between the piles i e h s 1 8 respectively numerical validation of the model structure is performed for the pre vertical load test and the first half cycle of push in load test cases with h s 1 respectively for the pre vertical load case the load is assigned uniformly at the top of the raft in the numerical model and allowed maximum displacement up to 0 4 mm in model scale the reaction with respect to settlement and lateral deformation is recorded at the centre of the base level of the raft during 3d finite element analysis and compared with the experimental results fig 4 a and b presents both numerical and experimental results of the vertical load settlement and lateral load deformation curve which indicates a good agreement a maximum variation in vertical load settlement and lateral load deformation results in order of 6 is observed which may be considered to be reasonably good for using the numerical model for detailed study besides another numerical study of kumar et al 2016 on the behaviour of the combined piled raft foundation under earthquake loading is considered to validate the present numerical model the validation is performed for static vertical and pseudo static horizontal loading cases the numerical model of the piled raft is developed considering the foundation to be embedded in toyoura sand for static vertical load analysis vertical pressure of 366 406 kn m2 is applied on the raft surface further for horizontal loading analysis a maximum pseudo static load of 621 4 kn and 1635 6 kn is applied to the generic piled raft foundation for bhuj 2001 pga 0 106g and loma prieta 1989 pga 0 279g earthquakes respectively fig 5 presents a profile of settlement contour obtained after application of vertical load in present numerical analysis the maximum value of settlement obtained from the present numerical analysis is found to be 0 02149m the obtained settlement is in good agreement with the value of settlement reported by kumar et al 2016 showing a marginal variation of 1 41 further fig 6 a and b present the maximum normalized horizontal displacement and bending moment along pile length respectively which is found to be a good agreement with the results reported in kumar et al 2016 thus both the validation ensures the reliability of the numerical model which may be used for further study 5 2 lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation under combined v m h loading 5 2 1 effect of the relative stiffness of raft krs the present study emphasized understanding the behaviour of piled raft foundation system with an increase in stiffness of raft from flexible to rigid incorporating combined v m h loading which is presented in this section horizontal displacement is recorded at the bottom central node of the raft under a constant vertical load and with increasing lateral load at the top of the column attached to the raft fig 7 a presents lateral load deformation behaviour of pile raft foundation system under combined loading with an increase in relative stiffness of raft with respect to soil k rs and vertical load the piled raft foundation with a 1 2 pile group and varying relative stiffness of raft k rs 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 respectively embedded in medium sand consistency is considered herein the piles are considered to have l b of 2 25 and s d of 4 results are reported for v m h loading with a different combination of v v max taken as 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively it is observed from fig 7 a that lateral load carrying capacity increases considerably with the increase in relative stiffness of raft for instance fig 7 a indicates that the lateral capacity of the foundation increased from 2600 kn to 3250 kn i e 25 with the change of relative stiffness of raft from 0 03 to 37 03 at a deformation of 0 4m for v v max 1 which seems to be maximum this may be due to higher passive lateral resistance offered by the raft with an increase in the stiffness of the raft further it is also observed from fig 7 a that lateral capacity increases significantly with an increase in vertical loading for instance fig 7 a presents a maximum increase in lateral capacity in order of 40 83 and 117 when v v max changes from 0 to 0 1 0 to 0 5 and 0 to 1 respectively for k rs 37 03 at lateral deformation of 0 4m the reason for this increase may be due to the increase in passive resistance of the soil within the pressure triangle beneath the foundation on the other hand fig 7 b presents the moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation subjected to v m h load for varying relative stiffness of raft k rs 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 respectively it is observed from fig 7 b that the rotation of foundation is relatively lesser for the higher relative stiffness of raft i e k rs 37 03 as compared to k rs 0 03 and 4 62 irrespective of amplitude of vertical loading for instance at moment load of 1500 kn m and v v max 0 the rotation of foundation is found to be 0 000109 radians 0 000417 radians and 0 00452 radians for k rs 37 03 4 62 and 0 03 respectively which indicates a significant increase of 40 times with change of k rs 37 03 to 0 03 it is due to higher rigidity offered by thick raft towards the lateral and rotational movement of foundation as compared to a flexible raft further the rotational deformation of the foundation is found to reduce considerably when the piled raft is subjected to combined v m h load however the moment capacity increased with an increase in vertical load despite the different values of k rs for instance it can be noticed from fig 7 b that for k rs 37 03 and rotation angle 0 008 radians moment capacity increased in order of 17 32 and 55 when v v max changes from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively 5 2 2 effect of length to width ratio l b the effect of flexible and stiff behaviour of pile on lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation due to v m h load is investigated considering different l b ratios three values of l b such as 1 0 2 25 and 5 0 are chosen to simulate rigid to flexible behaviour of foundation for the selected soil consistency the l b ratio of 1 behaves more of a rigid foundation with length is equal to the width of the foundation whereas l b ratios of 2 25 and 5 0 behave as a flexible foundation effect of l b of foundation on lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of pile raft foundation system under the action of v m h loading is presented in fig 8 a and b respectively the foundation comprises of a flexible raft of k rs 37 03 and 1 2 pile group with pile length l varied uniformly from rigid to flexible i e l 4m 9m and 20m the s d ratio of the piles is kept to be 4 it is observed from fig 8 a that lateral load capacity increases with the increase in l b of the foundation system for instance fig 8 a indicates that the lateral load capacity increased maximum in order of 1 88 times when l b changed from 1 0 to 2 25 for a lateral deformation of 0 43m and v v max 1 however marginal variation in load deformation behaviour is observed for a change of l b 2 25 to 5 0 further it may also be inferred from fig 8 a that lateral capacity increases with the increase in vertical loading for example the lateral capacity increases in the order of 40 83 and 117 when v v max is increased from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively considering a deformation of 0 4m and l b ratio of 2 25 on the other hand the increase in capacity with the change in vertical load is found to be marginal for change in l b ratio from 2 0 to 5 0 the reason for this similarity maybe because both pile group exhibits flexible nature and pile length beyond a certain depth of fixity marginally influence the lateral capacity a similar observation is noticed in terms of moment capacity from fig 8 b where the capacity increased significantly in order of 110 when l b changed from 1 0 to 2 25 for rotation angle 0 008 radians and v v max 1 the reason may be due to an increase in lateral stiffness offered by piled raft with l b 2 25 as compared to l b 1 however the same marginal variation in moment capacity is observed for a change of l b 2 25 to 5 0 further it may also be inferred from fig 8 b that moment capacity increases with the increase in vertical loading for example the moment capacity increases in the order of 17 32 and 55 when v v max is increased from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively for a rotation of 0 008 radians and l b ratio of 2 25 5 2 3 effect of spacing to diameter s d ratio of pile fig 9 a presents the lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation system for s d of 2 and 4 with a 1 2 pile group under v m h loading a considerable increase in lateral capacity is observed with variation of the s d ratio for instance it is observed from fig 9 a that the lateral capacity of the foundation increased from 3100 kn to 3450 kn i e 11 due to the change of s d ratio from 2 to 4 which seems to be maximum at a deformation of 0 55m with v v max 1 further the application of vertical load along with the action of horizontal and moment load can influence the load carrying capacity of the piled raft foundation system fig 9 a presents that the maximum lateral load resisting capacity is observed in the order of 40 83 and 117 as v v max changes from 0 to 0 1 0 to 0 5 and 0 to 1 respectively for deformation of 0 4m and s d ratio of 4 further at similar deformation and s d 2 a minimum increase in lateral load resistance is observed in the order of 32 at v v max 0 1 79 at v v max 0 5 and 114 at v v max 1 when compared with individual horizontal load i e v v max 0 fig 9 b indicates that the moment capacity increases maximum in order of 15 with the change in s d ratio from 2 to 4 at v v max 1 and rotation angle of 0 008 radians however the increase in capacity is relatively more prominent with the application of vertical load for example a maximum increase in the order of 73 and 55 is observed at a rotation of 0 008 radians when v v max is increased from 0 to 1 for s d 2 and 4 respectively furthermore increasing the s d ratio of piles and vertical load can minimize a significant amount of rotation occurring in such a foundation system when subjected to high lateral loads under combined v m h loading conditions for instance the rotation is reduced by 25 at a moment of 4500 kn m when s d changes from 2 to 4 and v v max 1 is taken into account results indicate that variation of s d may cause a significant increase in lateral and moment load capacity and further can control rotational response of such foundation which may be a vital input in design for piled raft foundation 5 2 4 effect of fixity of pile head the section presents lateral load deformation behaviour of 1 2 pile group with rigid and hinged pile head connection with raft piles with spacing 4d and l b of 2 25 connected with a square raft of k rs 37 03 is used herein fig 10 a and b present the load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation system with rigid and hinged pile head connection with raft under v m h loading the marginal effect in lateral load deformation behaviour is observed for both rigid and hinge connection of pile head with the raft the capacity in case of hinged pile head connection has not shown any significant difference concerning rigid pile head connection however a moderate increase in capacity is observed for hinged pile head connection as compared to rigid pile head connection at v v max 0 5 and 1 and deformation of 0 4m for instance the value of lateral capacity for hinged pile head connection with raft increased by 4 and 2 of the capacity for rigid head connection with the raft at v v max 0 5 and 1 respectively the increase is however very negligible the results thus indicate that hinged and rigid pile head connection under the v m h load condition has a marginal effect on lateral load deformation behaviour of piled raft foundation however the observation is comparatively different in terms of moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation for example from fig 10 b it is observed that the moment capacity of piled raft foundation reduced by a maximum of 44 for v v max 0 and a minimum 8 53 for v v max 0 1 when pile head connection is changed from rigid to hinge further it can also be inferred from fig 10 b that the rotation of the foundation increased by a change in pile head connection from rigid to hinge hence it can be suggested that a rigid pile head connection is more suitable to counter the influence of rocking effect lateral and rotational both of piled raft foundation as compared to hinged connection 5 2 5 effect of varying ep es ratio lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of pile raft foundation system with varying e p e s ratio under v m h loading are presented in fig 11 a and b respectively increase in lateral and moment capacity is observed with a decrease in e p e s ratio for instance fig 11 a and b indicates that the lateral load capacity of the foundation increased maximum by 21 and 24 due to decrease in e p e s ratio from 28570 to 15380 at a deformation of 0 25m and rotation of 0 008 radians respectively with v v max 1 however the capacity increased considerably if combined v m h load is considered on the piled raft foundation system as compared to individual lateral loading i e v v max 0 for instance the maximum increase in capacity is observed in the order of 120 when v v max increased from 0 to 1 at a deformation of 0 4m and e p e s ratio of 28570 5 3 lateral load sharing among components of piled raft foundation under combined v m h loading this section presents the percentage of sharing of lateral load within a raft and pile elements of the piled raft foundation under combined v m h loading which seems to be another significant concern in design table 4 presents the percentage of lateral load shared by pile and raft attached to piled raft when subjected to combined v m h load encompassing different parametric variations the percentage of the lateral load carried by pile and raft in a pile raft system is calculated using the following equations 2 α p l p l c p r f 100 3 α r 100 α p where α p and α r are the percentage of load shared by pile and raft element respectively l p is the lateral load shared by pile and l c p r f is the total lateral load applied on the piled raft foundation under constant vertical load table 4 indicates that a significant proportion of the load is shared by pile in a piled raft foundation compared to the raft at v v max 0 the raft carries around 16 30 of the total lateral load applied on the foundation whereas the pile carries 70 84 of this total lateral load however with the increase in the ratio of v v max the load carrying proportion of pile increases irrespective of various parametric variations the percentage increases to a maximum of 90 for v v max 1 further the parametric variations such as a k rs l b ratio of foundation and e p e s ratio have considerable influence on the lateral load sharing proportion between the pile and raft however the effect of other parameters such as the s d ratio of the pile and pile head connection with the raft is found to be marginal for example the percentage of lateral load proportion of raft increases with the increase in relative stiffness of raft with respect to soil k rs this may be because thick raft may offer higher passive resistance to the applied load coming on the foundation as compared to a flexible raft further it is also observed that the increase in the l b ratio of foundation increases the load sharing proportion of piles in a piled raft this is expected as long flexible pile offers higher load resistance as compared to a short rigid pile 5 4 development of failure and design envelopes considering v m h interaction 5 4 1 interaction mechanism due to coupled v m h load numerical load controlled probing tests are performed on fem based prototype piled raft foundation model encompassing parametric variation to assess the interaction between combinedly acting vertical v moment m and horizontal h load under the application of constant v v max the monotonically increasing horizontal and associated moment load created coupled sway and rotational deformation of the foundation simultaneously as discussed in the previous section the yield lateral and moment capacity are calculated from load deformation behaviour for each test under constant v v max a three dimensional plot of yield capacities is plotted in three dimensional v m h load space which represents the yield failure envelope for the corresponding parametric case fig 12 a presents the three dimensional failure envelope of piled raft foundation under complex interaction of v m h load for the parametric case of spacing 4d l b of 2 25 and rigidly connected with a square raft of k rs 37 03 the best fitted polynomial curve of the second order is used to construct the nonlinear envelope the envelope is presented in normalized form as a function of h v max and m bv max with respect to v v max in v h and v m planes respectively for better visualization of the 3d envelope its projection in two dimensional v h v m and h m planes along with the proposed closed form equation of the yield envelope are presented in fig 12 b c and d respectively it is observed from v h v m plots that the failure envelope is parabolic and a similar trend is also observed in past studies for other types of foundation gourvenec and randolph 2003 yun and bransby 2007 el marassi et al 2017 further the h m plot is found to increase linearly with the increase in the ratio of v v max this is because m h ratio is kept constant in the present study 5 4 2 effect of parametric variations on failure and design envelopes considering v m h interaction this section presents the effect of different parametric variations on failure and design envelopes of the piled raft under combined v m h interaction both the envelopes are presented in the same two dimensional v h load space design envelopes are developed by joining lateral load corresponding to allowable lateral displacement of 30 mm for piled raft foundation as suggested elsewhere salgado 2008 fig 13 a to 13 e presents failure and design envelopes in the form of h v max for varying v v max encompassing different parametric variations such as raft flexibility pile length l to the width of raft b ratio s d ratio of the pile pile head connection and e p e s ratio respectively it is observed from fig 13 a that h v max follows the nonlinear increasing trend with maximum value observed at v v max 0 75 in case of failure envelope this infers that the maximum lateral load capacity of the piled raft foundation in sandy soil may be achieved when vertical loading is in order of 75 of the ultimate vertical load capacity of the piled raft system v v max 0 75 indicates the factor of safety of 1 33 which may be considered as optimum from the viewpoint of lateral loading however considering the design envelope it may be inferred that h v max is maximum when v v max 0 50 i e factor of safety f s 2 0 hence as a design guideline f s in a range between 1 33 and 2 0 is preferable for the design of such foundation considering combined v m h loading furthermore fig 13 a presents that lateral load capacity increases significantly with an increase in relative stiffness of raft for example the increment in lateral capacity is calculated to be 32 with the increment of k rs 0 03 to 37 03 further the increase in lateral yield load at v v max 0 75 is observed in the order of 19 and 11 with a change of k rs 0 03 to 4 62 and 4 62 to 37 03 respectively fig 13 b presents failure and design envelope considering the variation of l b of piled raft foundation within stiff to flexible range under v m h loading interaction both failure and design envelope for this case exhibits a similar trend as observed in fig 13 a the maximum lateral capacity increases significantly with an increase in l b ratio from 1 0 to 2 25 it is found that the maximum increment in h v max at v v max 0 80 is found in order of 110 and 75 for failure and design envelope respectively when l b ratio changes from 1 0 to 2 25 piled raft with l b 1 0 which represents a short stiff piled raft system may tend to overturn with an increase of lateral loading this is due to the fact yield lateral load capacity is significantly lesser compared to l b 2 25 which exhibits flexible behaviour further the increase in l b ratio from 2 25 to 5 0 exhibits marginal variation in yield lateral capacity the reason may be because both l b 2 25 and 5 behave as a flexible piled raft foundation the study reveals that the presence of flexible piles in a piled raft foundation may contribute to a maximum lateral load resistance of the foundation system fig 13 c to 13 e presents failure and design envelope for piled raft foundation for a parametric variation of s d ratio pile head connection and e p e s ratio a similar trend in failure and design envelop is observed in all cases in all the cases design envelope attains a maximum value of h v max at v v max 0 50 and failure envelope attains maximum value within a range of v v max 0 60 to 0 80 these observations suggest a need to consider f s within a range of 1 33 2 to utilize the optimum maximum lateral as well as moment capacity it can be outlined in fig 13 c that the failure curve marginally shifted upward with the increase in the s d ratio of the pile for instance at v v max 0 60 the value of h v max has shown a maximum increase of around 12 when the spacing of the pile has changed from 2d to 4d the study showcased the influence of pile spacing may affect the lateral load resistance capacity under combined v m h load interaction further fig 13 d indicates that the variation of the pile head connection has a marginal influence on the envelopes in addition it is observed from fig 13 e that varying e p e s ratio has considerable influence on both the design and failure envelope for instance the maximum lateral load h v max is found at v v max 0 7 which varies in order of 28 with a change of e p e s 28570 to 15380 as observed from fig 13 e finally table 5 is a comprehensive representation of the optimum vertical load at which maximum yield lateral load will occur for a piled raft foundation embedded in sandy soil encompassing different parametric variations 5 5 influence of v m h interaction on bending moment and shear force profile of piled raft foundation this section presents the bending moment profile along with the depth of pile considering combined v m h loading condition and different parametric cases this is primarily aimed to verify the limit state of collapse criteria of the design of piled raft foundation under the combined action of v m h loading the failure and design envelopes for the piled raft foundation presented in the previous section are developed based on serviceability criteria which may be generally considered as benchmark criteria for the design of the pile the present study also considered the same philosophy however the maximum bending moment profile along pile length with respect to the application of a different combination of vertical loading i e v v max 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 and yield horizontal load is highlighted in this section will help to develop insight for design the ultimate moment resistance of the pile section is also presented in the same plot to assess the safety margin considering collapse criteria the horizontal load applied to the foundation is the yield lateral load used to develop the failure envelope as discussed in section 5 4 fig 14 a e presents bending moment profile along the depth of pile section under v m h loading and encompassing different parametric variations such as k rs l b ratio s d ratio pile head connection and e p e s ratio the maximum bending moment developed in a pile due to combined v m h loading is compared with the resisting moment of each pile section the resisting moment is calculated to be 5092 8 kn m for steel piles it is observed from fig 14 a e that the maximum bending moment developed in a pile due to application of yield lateral load and v v max 0 to 1 for different parametric variation is lesser than the resisting moment of pile section this infers that the failure envelopes generated from corresponding yield lateral load for various parametric cases is safe from collapse criteria the curves thus can be used for the capacity based design of piled raft foundation subjected to combined v m h loading further it is evident from fig 14 a e that the bending moment tends to increase with the increase in the percentage of vertical load in v m h loading irrespective of different parametric variations for instance it can be observed in fig 14 a that the bending moment increased by 1 85 times with change in v v max from 0 to 1 and at a depth of 3m from the top surface this may be due to p δ effect of loading on the pile head furthermore it is observed from fig 14 a e that pile head bending moment is either positive or in some cases is found to be negative the maximum bending moment is however developed at around 4 5m depth i e half of the length of the pile and ultimately reduces to zero bending moment at pile tip the cross over point from positive to negative bending moment in some cases occurred at shallow depth i e in between 0m and 1m the observation is similar to the observations reported by poulos and davis 1980 and gazetas 1984 further the effect of different parametric variations on the bending moment profile is however marginal for example from fig 14 e a maximum variation of 18 25 is observed in the bending moment at 4m depth when e p e s decreased from 28570 to 15380 further fig 15 a e presents the shear force along with pile depth for different parametric variations as discussed in previous sections it is observed from fig 15 a e the pile head shear is negative for different variations of vertical load and also for parametric variation however for v v max 1 case the pile head shear is found to be positive in all the figures further a cross over point i e point of contraflacture at a depth between 3m and 4 5m is observed when shear force changes from negative to the positive side this is quite evident as the bending moment of the pile section is found to be maximum c f fig 14 in this region i e 3m 4 5m depth furthermore a significant variation in shear force is observed when v v max changes from 0 to 1 for example from fig 15 c for s d 2 and at pile depth of 1m it is observed that shear force increased in the order of 4 16 times 12 57 times and 18 27 times when v v max increased from 0 to 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively however the effect of different parametric variations on shear force along pile depth is marginal the observation is similar to the observation made from the bending moment profile as discussed in the previous section 5 6 sensitivity analysis on lateral capacity involving different parameters this section presents the percentage increase in the yield lateral capacity of the piled raft for different parametric cases considered in the present study this comparative analysis is performed to identify the sensitive design parameters which have a significant influence on the design of piled raft foundation under combined loading the percentage increase in lateral load capacity is evaluated using the following equation 4 p i h c v m h c h c h 100 where p i h is the percentage increase in yield lateral load capacity of the piled raft for the different parametric cases c v m h is the yield lateral load capacity of piled raft under combined v m h loading and c h is the yield lateral load capacity of the piled raft under pure lateral load i e v v max 0 fig 16 presents a sample of percentage increase in yield lateral capacity of the piled raft for the different parametric cases using a bar diagram v v max 0 1 case is considered as the sample case a significant increase in yield lateral load capacity of piled raft under v m h loading is observed for the various parametric cases for instance a maximum and minimum increase in yield lateral capacity in the order of 86 and 22 respectively are observed for piled raft under combined v m h loading the increase further rises with the increase in the value of v v max as observed in the previous sections further the effect of k rs l b s d and e p e s is found to be significant in the percentage increase of yield lateral capacity however the effect of the pile head connection with the raft is marginal for example the percentage increase in yield lateral capacity is found to be 86 for k rs 0 03 and 64 for k rs 37 03 this shows that rigid raft i e k rs 37 03 offers higher passive resistance even for pure lateral load case i e v v max 0 6 case study and design implication a representative 15 storey tall bare frame building consisting of a single bay 8 5 m 8 5 m with 3 5m storey height is considered to be supported by piled raft foundation embedded in medium sandy type soil the properties of raft pile and sand are kept similar to that presented in table 1 in the first step the piled raft foundation is designed based on gravity loading the loading on each floor is considered as 8 0 kn m2 factored dl ll the maximum vertical load from 15 storey building along with the weight of the roof slab is calculated as 9248 kn i e w 16 8 5 8 5 8 9248 kn raft size of 10 m 10 m 1m thick is assumed for this building the raft exhibits an adequate factor of safety f s 3 with respect to shear failure criteria considering imposed vertical loading the settlement of raft is calculated as 91 87 mm under applied loading using plaxis 3d 2008 which is found to be higher than the allowable limit of 75 mm as suggested in bowels 1997 fig 17 a presents the settlement profile under applied gravity loading hence a 3 3 pile group of length 10 8m and diameter 0 6m rigidly connected with the raft is designed following poulos 2001 in order to reduce the settlement of the raft the centre to centre spacing between the piles is kept as 4d it can be observed from fig 17 b that the settlement of the raft is reduced to 72 92 mm in order of 20 63 incorporating 9 numbers of symmetrically placed piles beneath the raft which is within the permissible value the ultimate vertical load capacity v max of a 3 3 piled raft foundation is calculated as 67000 kn from the load settlement curve which is obtained using plaxis 3d 2008 in the next step the design lateral load capacity of a 3 3 piled raft foundation is obtained as 3630 kn at v v max 0 condition using plaxis 3d 2008 considering 30 mm as allowable lateral displacement fig 18 a presents the horizontal load deflection behaviour of the piled raft foundation on the other hand the design lateral capacity of the same piled raft foundation is computed using the dimensionless envelope proposed in this study ref fig 13 a which represents similar system parameters of the case study problem the calculated design lateral load h is 3886 kn for v v max 0 which validates the computed capacity of 3630 kn obtained after analyzing in plaxis 3d 2008 showing a marginal variation of 7 hence this confirms the sanctity of using proposed envelopes for computing yield lateral capacity as well as the design capacity of piled raft foundation in sandy soil however the actual lateral capacity h of the 3 3 pile group using fig 18 b is calculated as 4490 kn for v v max 0 14 calculated for this case study which is found to be higher increase in the order of 24 than counterpart result corresponding to v v max 0 condition this concludes that the actual lateral capacity considering v m h loading will always be higher compared to the capacity calculated under v v max 0 condition and hence will always lead to an over safe design for lateral capacity the extent of over safety will depend on the factor of safety with respect to vertical loading i e v v max as per the trend observed in the results of the present study hence to ensure an economical as well as rational design redesign of 3 3 piled raft foundation supporting 15 storey building structures is performed keeping target lateral capacity as 3630 kn obtained at v v max 0 condition for 3 3 piled raft and permissible settlement of 75 mm the design capacity of 3630 kn will be achieved with a lesser number of pile groups if the capacity is calculated considering v m h loading which is presented in the next subsection 6 1 proposed redesign of piled raft system several trials are performed with a reduced number of pile groups to satisfy the target lateral capacity and settlement criteria a 3 2 group of piled raft foundation with the same length and diameter is suggested for this problem which is found to satisfy both the criteria however the centre to centre spacing between the piles is increased from 4d to 5d since the lateral capacity of the piled raft system increases when s d increases as outlined in the present study fig 19 a presents the plan of the revised pile group obtained after analyzing in plaxis 3d 2008 for both settlement and lateral load further fig 19 b presents the settlement contour of the piled raft it is observed that the settlement increased marginally from 72 92 mm to 73 90 mm for a 3 2 pile group as compared to the 3 3 pile group furthermore fig 19 c presents a comparison between the lateral load vs horizontal deformation for 3 2 and 3 3 pile group under combined v m h load condition it is observed that the lateral design capacity of a 3 2 piled raft foundation under the v m h condition v v max 0 14 condition is 4000 kn which is higher than the design capacity of 3 3 piled raft system obtained under v v max 0 condition hence the proposed redesign based on the outcome of the present study will help to reduce the number of piles in a piled raft foundation and will lead to economic design 7 summary and conclusions the present study highlights the influence of the interaction of combined v m h load on the static response of piled raft foundation embedded in homogenous sandy soil a parametric study incorporating a variation of different influential parameters such as variation of the relative stiffness of raft k rs length to width ratio of the foundation l b spacing to the diameter of piles s d the variation of pile head connection with the raft and variation of the ratio of young s modulus of pile and soil e p e s is carried out to investigate the influence on the response of pile raft incorporating static v m h interaction in addition two dimensional design curves for estimation of lateral load are also presented encompassing parametric variations the study offers the following salient conclusions 1 study of lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation system incorporating different relative stiffness of raft i e k rs 0 03 4 62 and 37 03 under combined v m h loading indicates that the lateral and moment capacity of piled raft increases considerably with increase in rigidity of raft while such an increase may further go up with the gradual increase in vertical loading on the piled raft system the maximum increase in lateral capacity may go up to 25 if k rs varies from 0 03 to 37 03 on the other hand the increase in lateral capacity may further rise maximum up to 117 for k rs 37 03 when v v max increases from 0 to 1 and at a deformation level of 40 mm similarly the increase in maximum moment capacity is found in order of 55 at 0 008 radians of rotation for k rs 37 03 2 the influence of variation of l b ratio on lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour indicates that the lateral and moment capacity increases maximum in order of 1 88 times and 1 10 times due to combined loading effect when the l b ratio varies from 1 0 to 2 25 further it is interestingly observed that the increase becomes too marginal with a further increase in the l b ratio i e l b 2 25 to 5 0 this is due to pile behaves like a long or flexible slender member under horizontal loading beyond the l b ratio of 2 25 3 the influence of variation of s d ratio on lateral load deformation and moment rotation behaviour is found to be marginal for instance the increase in lateral and moment capacity is found to be in the order of 11 and 15 for v m h loading when the s d ratio varies from 2 0 to 4 0 however a significant increase in lateral capacity is observed in the order of 114 and 117 at s d 2 and 4 respectively with an increase of v v max from 0 to 1 4 it is observed that the influence of the pile head connection is marginal on the lateral capacity of the piled raft foundation system under v m h loading for instance a maximum increment of 4 and 2 in lateral capacity are observed at v v max 0 5 and 1 respectively when the pile head connection changed from rigid to hinge however the observation is entirely different fo the moment rotation behaviour of piled raft foundation the moment capacity of piled raft foundation reduced by a maximum of 44 for v v max 0 and a minimum of 8 53 for v v max 0 1 when the pile head connection is changed from rigid to hinge 5 variation of e p e s has a considerable influence of lateral and moment capacity under combined v m h loading it is observed that variation of e p e s of 28570 loose sand to 15380 medium sand may result from increasing of 21 and 24 in lateral and moment capacity respectively under v m h loading further the maximum increment in lateral capacity is found in order of 120 when v v max varies from 0 to 1 in v m h loading 6 the load sharing proportion of various components of the piled raft is presented under combined v m h loading it is observed that at high deformation level the pile shares around 70 84 to the total applied lateral load for v v max 0 further the load sharing by piles increases with an increase in v v max furthermore the considerable influence of parametric variations such as a change in the value of k rs l b ratio of foundation and e p e s ratio on the lateral load sharing proportion between pile and raft is observed while the effect of other parameters such as the s d ratio of the pile and pile head connection with a raft is found to be marginal 7 non dimensional failure as well as design envelopes for piled raft system under lateral loading with respect to normalized vertical loading i e v v max is presented encompassing parametric variation in general the failure envelope considering v m h loading is observed to be increasing nonlinearly with respect to v v max it is observed that maximum failure load h v max on the piled raft foundation is found within a range of v v max 0 6 to 0 85 encompassing different parametric variations however the influence of different parametric variation is found to be marginal on the failure curve on the other hand the failure envelope for variation in l b and k rs presents significant variation for instance a maximum variation of 110 in lateral yield load is observed when l b changed from 1 0 to 2 25 at v v max 0 80 similarly at v v max 0 75 the value of h v max has shown a maximum increase of around 32 when the rigidity of raft changed from k rs 0 03 to 37 03 this issue may be studied further in addition the effect of parametric variations seemed to be marginal on the design envelope however in all the envelopes a peak point is observed within a range of v v max 0 50 to 0 70 this indicates that considering a factor of safety in between 1 42 and 2 the actual lateral capacity of piled raft can be obtained under a combined v m h load 8 the influence of v m h load on bending moment and shear force profile along the depth of the pile section is also studied herein to verify the collapse criteria it is observed that the maximum bending moment developed in a pile due to application of yield lateral load and variation of v v max from 0 to 1 for different parametric variation is lesser than the resisting moment of the pile section this infers that the failure envelopes generated from corresponding yield lateral load for various parametric cases is safe from collapse criteria further both shear force and bending moment along pile length are found to increase with the increase in the percentage of vertical load in v m h loading irrespective of different parametric variations furthermore the maximum bending moment is observed at half of the pile length where the shear force is found to be 0 however the bending moment reduced to 0 at the tip of the pile 9 sensitivity analysis on the comparative influence of different parameters indicates that yield lateral load capacity increases significantly for piled raft under v m h loading a maximum increase of 86 in yield capacity is observed for v v max 0 1 the increase is found to rise further with the increase in the ratio of v v max irrespective of different parametric variations on the other hand a considerable effect in the percentage increase of yield lateral capacity is observed for different parameters such as k rs l b s d and e p e s while the effect of another parameter i e pile head connection with the raft is found to be marginal finally a case study problem of piled raft supported building structure is critically analyzed from the point of view of design guidelines presented in this study this study infers that the conventional design of a piled raft foundation based on single vertical or lateral loading provides a conservative design hence the redesign is worked out following the outcome of the present study with a reduced number of piles keeping view of design constraints and finally leads to an economical piled raft foundation design credit authorship contribution statement diptesh chanda conceptualization methodology software validation resources writing original draft visualization

structure interaction 1 introduction structures submerged in a fluid or in contact with fluid can be commonly observed in nature and widely utilized in various engineering fields such as aerospace engineering biomedical engineering civil engineering ocean engineering and energy engineering the vibrational characteristics of plates immersed in fluid are very different from those immersed in air the decrease in the natural frequency of the plates in contact with fluid due to the effect of added mass makes the vibration analysis more complicated thus an exact prediction of the changes in natural frequency of the plates immersed in fluid is necessary numerous studies have been carried out to investigate free and forced vibrations of isotropic plates in partial contact with a fluid these works are reported by lamb 1920 fu and price 1987 kwak 1996 1997 kerboua et al 2008 kerboua kerboua et al 2008 zhou an cheung zhou and cheung 2000 khorshidi khorshidi 2010 khorshidi et al 2017

various engineering fields because of the high strength to weight ratio modulus to weight ratio and low production cost the effect of surrounding liquid on the natural vibration characteristics of

galerkin method canales and mantari 2018 determined natural frequencies of laminated composite plates in contact with a compressible bounded fluid the discrepancy of the free vibrational characteristic between incompressible and compressible fluid model has been indicated recently functionally graded materials fgms have been developing rapidly and widely used in many engineering applications such as aerospace nuclear energy biology electromagnetism optics energy etc the evaluation of static and dynamic characteristics of fg plate is a practical engineering problem and has attracted the attention of many researchers such as chakraverty and pradhan 2014 mantari 2016 wang and zu 2017 shahsavari et al 2018 tu et al 2019 van do and lee van do and lee 2019 a lot of works with focus on the vibrational behavior of functionally graded plates in air have been carried out but studies on vibrational characteristics of fg plates submerged in fluid medium are very limited shafiee et al 2014 analyzed the hydroelastic vibration of functionally graded circular plates resting on winkler elastic foundations in contact with a quiescent fluid using semi analytical approach based on energy method using the rayleigh ritz method khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 calculated natural frequencies of the fg vertical plate coupled with sloshing fluid modes based on the first shear deformation plate theory shahbaztabar and ranji 2018 used ritz method to present free vibration analysis of vertical fg plates on elastic foundation and in contact with stationary fluid according to the above literature survey studies focused on vibration behavior of horizontal fg rectangular plates in contact with fluid or immersed in fluid are scarce thus this problem will be investigated in this study comparisons with existing numerical results in open literature are made to verify the accuracy of the present results numerical investigations are conducted to show the influence of the fluid levels material properties aspect ratios thickness to length ratios as well as fluid density on the frequency parameters of the plate 2 statement of the problem according to the first order

analytical solution is demonstrated discrepancy 1 61 for a fg plate and discrepancy 0 1 for a metallic submerged plate in water 8 2 parametric studies in this section several new results for first mode of natural frequency in terms of nondimensional frequency parameter of a fg plate submerged in fluid are given the frequencies of the fluid fg plate are presented for different volume fraction index fluid depth fluid densities aspect ratios thickness to length ratios and interaction boundary conditions a functionally graded al al2o3 rectangular simply supported plate is studied four following interaction boundary conditions ibc are investigated ibc1 plate submerged in fluid with free surface fig 3 ibc2 floating and submerged plate bounded by a rigid wall fig 4 ibc3 two identical parallel plates filled with fluid fig 5 ibc4 in vacuum ρ f 0 8 2 1 mode shapes of the submerged fg rectangular plates in table 3 nine nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 a b 1 5 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 versus various number of modes m 1 to 3 n 1 to 3 and percentage decrease in frequency are presented simultaneously the mode shapes and corresponding non dimensional natural frequencies of the submerged fg rectangular plate subjected to ibc2 are plotted in fig 7 the results show that for all four interaction boundary conditions the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate increase as m or n increases and ω 11 m n 1 is smallest in addition one can see that the mode shapes do not change according to the fluid submergence it is evident that ω of fg plate without fluid ibc4 is the biggest that of fg plate with ibc3 is the second biggest and with ibc1 is the smallest the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate with ibc2 are smallest it is remarkable that the values of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate with ibc1 and ibc3 are similar for higher vibration modes the percentage decrease in nondimensional natural frequencies of submerged fg plate with icb1 icb2 and icb3 is important for all lower modes for example the percentage decrease of ω 11 is 31 26 19 84 and 18 29 under ibc2 ibc1 and ibc3 respectively meanwhile the percentage decreases of ω 33 is only 13 76 7 63 and 7 63 that is why in the following sections we concentrate on the analysis of fundamental nondimensional natural frequency ω 11 of submerged fg plate 8 2 2 influence of power law index on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies ω 11 of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 a b 1 5 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 for various values of power law index p are calculated and presented in table 4 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate versus power law index p is given graphically in fig 8 from the results presented in table 4 and fig 8 one can observe that the ω of fluid fg plate subjected to 4 ibc decreases as the power law index p increases and strongly decreases for p 2 in addition under ibc1 and ibc2 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate is approximately identical for any value of p under the four above mentioned ibcs the percentage decrease of fg plate is around 50 when p varies from 0 pure ceramic plate to pure metallic plate 8 2 3 influence of metal to ceramic young s modulus and density ratios on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 05 a b 2 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 and e c 207 gpa ρ c 7850 kg m3 ν 0 3 subjected to four ibc are calculated and presented in table 5 and fig 9 as follows the results presented in table 5 and fig 9 show that the nondimensional natural frequencies ω increase as the metal to ceramic young s modulus ratio e m e c increases and the metal to ceramic young s density ratio ρ m ρ c decreases and vice versa for examples under ibc1 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 12 2328 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 33 0292 170 01 of increase under ibc2 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 10 6579 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 26 4895 148 54 of increase under ibc3 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 12 4405 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 34 0286 173 53 of increase under ibc4 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 14 7817 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 49 2810 233 39 of increase in addition the aspect ratio e m e c has a greater impact than ρ m ρ c on nondimensional natural frequencies ω for example under the four considered ibc for a given ratio ρ m ρ c and e m e c varying from 0 05 to 0 95 ω is doubled for a given ratio e m e c and ρ m ρ c varies from 0 05 to 0 95 ω increases 20 30 with ibc1 ibc2 ibc3 meanwhile the percentage increase is around 60 for fg plate in vacuum ibc4 8 2 4 effect of thickness to length ratio h a on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m a b 1 5 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 for various values of plate thickness to length ratio h a are calculated and presented in table 6 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate versus thickness to length ratio h a is graphically plotted in fig 10 as seen from table 6 and fig 10 the plate thickness to length ratio h a considerably influences the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate for vibrating fg plate in vacuum the nondimensional natural frequencies ω continuously diminishes as the thickness to length ratio h a increases however for fluid fg plate with ibc1 ibc2 and ibc3 when the thickness to length ratio h a is still small h a 0 1 and increases the nondimensional natural frequencies ω increases to maximum frequency and then decreases as the thickness to length ratio h a increases moreover for the thin plate h a is small the nondimensional natural frequencies ω are different from ibc1 and ibc3 but for the thick plate h a 0 15 they are almost coincident the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate subjected to icb2 strongly increases percentage of increase is around 50 when h a varies from 0 03 thin plate to 0 2 thick plate while ω of this plate under icb3 increases by only 4 8 2 5 effect of plate aspect ratio a b on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 for various values of plate aspect ratio a b are calculated and presented in table 7 the variation of these frequencies ω of fg plate versus aspect ratio a b is graphically illustrated in fig 11 the obtained results show that under four ibc the ω of fluid fg plate increases as the plate aspect ratio a b increases in addition to that the higher the aspect ratio a b is the higher the nondimensional natural frequencies are it is obvious that ω increases by 6 and 8 times when a b varies from 0 3 to 2 5 respectively 8 2 6 effect of fluid density ρ f on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 a b 1 5 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 submerged in different fluids various values of ρ f are calculated and presented in table 8 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate versus fluid mass density ρ f is graphically shown in fig 12 as observed from table 8 and fig 12 the ω of fg plate without fluid is biggest as ρ f increases the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate under ibc1 ibc2 and ibc3 decrease especially the ω of fg plate under icb2 forcefully decreases 33 01 of decrease as ρ f 1100 kg m3 moreover one can observe that under ibc1 and ibc3 the decrease of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate is almost linear in contrary this variation is nonlinear for the fg plate under ibc2 8 2 7 effect of fluid depth on nondimensional natural frequencies in tables 9 11 the variations of the nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate against the fluid depth h 1 a or d a and power law index p thickness to length ratio h a and plate aspect ratio a b are shown for three interaction boundary conditions respectively figs 13 15 reveal the variations of nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate versus the fluid depth h 1 a or d a under three ibc for various values of p similar the variations of nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate against the fluid depth h 1 a or d a under three ibc for various values of h a and a b are illustrated in figs 16 21 respectively the results in table 9 and figs 13 15 show that nondimensional natural frequencies ω considerably decreases as p 2 and h 1 a 0 5 under ibc1 and ibc2 d a 0 5 under ibc3 for high values of p h 1 a and d a ω slightly decreases especialy as h 1 a 0 5 the ω of fg plate under ibc1 and ibc2 is constant the influence of p on nondimensional natural frequencies ω is stronger than that of h 1 a and d a from table 10 and figs 16 18 it is observed that for the thin fg plate h a 0 03 nondimensional natural frequencies ω is lowest with various high values of fluid depth h 1 a d a 0 1 with low values of fluid depth the variation of ω depends on interaction boundary conditions nondimensional natural frequencies ω of both thin and thick fg plate decreases as h 1 a or d a increases from table 11 and figs 19 21 it is observed that nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate ω is lowest with small a b and high values of h 1 a or d a and vice versa the influence of plate aspect ratio a b on nondimensional natural frequencies ω is stronger than that of h 1 a and d a 9 conclusions in this study free vibrational characteristics of the totally submerged functionally graded al al2o3 horizontal rectangular plate or floating on the surface of liquid is investigated analytically by using first order shear deformation plate theory with five independent variables and the potential flow theory for stationary fluid it was shown that the results obtained by the present navier s solution procedure are in excellent agreement with the results reported in other literature based on the obtained numerical results the influence of different parameters including interaction boundary conditions material parameters of the fg plate thickness to length ratios aspect ratios fluid density and fluid depth on the nondimensional natural frequencies of horizontal rectangular plate is quantitatively evaluated and discussed in details these new results are tabulated and illustrated in various figures and show that for all types of interaction boundary conditions investigated in consequence of added mass effects the nondimensional natural frequencies of a fg plate in presence of fluid are more considerable than those without fluid additionally the fundamental nondimensional natural frequencies decrease as the power law index p the metal to ceramic density ratio ρ m ρ c the fluid density ρ c and the fluid depth h 1 a or d a increase in contrary increasing the thickness to length ratio h a the aspect ratio a b and the metal to ceramic young s modulus ratio e m e c causes a considerable increase in the nondimensional natural frequencies of a horizontal functionally graded rectangular plate submerged in fluid medium based on these analyses results it is concluded that the vibration characteristics of functionally graded horizontal rectangular plate is considerably influenced by surrounding fluid medium credit authorship

thickness direction according to a simple power law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents while other properties are assumed to be constant the fluid is considered to be ideal incompressible inviscid and irrotational thus the effects of hydrostatic pressure and free surface waves are not taken into account governing equation for the fluid plate system is derived based on the first order shear deformation theory the fluid velocity potential is derived from the boundary conditions for the plate fluid system and is used to determine the added mass to demonstrate the accuracy of the present analytical solution a comparison is made with those reported in open literature the influence of different parameters including interaction boundary conditions power law index metal to ceramic young s modulus density ratios of the fg plate thickness to length ratios aspect ratios fluid density and fluid depth on the nondimensional natural frequencies of fg rectangular plate

structure interaction 1 introduction structures submerged in a fluid or in contact with fluid can be commonly observed in nature and widely utilized in various engineering fields such as aerospace engineering biomedical engineering civil engineering ocean engineering and energy engineering the vibrational characteristics of plates immersed in fluid are very different from those immersed in air the decrease in the natural frequency of the plates in contact with fluid due to the effect of added mass makes the vibration analysis more complicated thus an exact prediction of the changes in natural frequency of the plates immersed in fluid is necessary numerous studies have been carried out to investigate free and forced vibrations of isotropic plates in partial contact with a fluid these works are reported by lamb 1920 fu and price 1987 kwak 1996 1997 kerboua et al 2008 kerboua kerboua et al 2008 zhou an cheung zhou and cheung 2000 khorshidi khorshidi 2010 khorshidi et al 2017

various engineering fields because of the high strength to weight ratio modulus to weight ratio and low production cost the effect of surrounding liquid on the natural vibration characteristics of composite plates is reported by many researchers chang and liu 2001 studied the vibrational behavior of a rectangular composite plate in contact with fluid for various boundary conditions natural frequencies for free vibration and frequency response of forced vibration of the composite plate floating on fluid were analyzed and calculated by jafari and rahmanei rahmanei and jafari 2016 natural frequencies of a laminated composite rectangular plate partially in contact with a bounded fluid is examined by khorshid and farhadi 2013 using the ritz method based on the first order shear deformation theory shahbaztabar and ranji 2016 investigated the effects of uniform in plane loads on vibrational behavior of laminated composite plates on elastic foundation and vertically in contact with fluid pradyumna et al watts et al 2018 analyzed free vibration of thin isotropic and laminated composite skew trapezoidal bottom of a rectangular liquid containing tank using element free galerkin method canales and mantari 2018 determined natural frequencies of laminated composite plates in contact with a compressible bounded fluid the discrepancy of the free vibrational characteristic between incompressible and compressible fluid model has been indicated recently functionally graded materials fgms have been developing rapidly and widely used in many engineering applications such as aerospace nuclear energy biology electromagnetism optics energy etc the evaluation of static and dynamic characteristics of fg plate is a practical engineering problem and has attracted the attention of many researchers such as chakraverty and pradhan 2014 mantari 2016 wang and zu 2017 shahsavari et al 2018 tu et al 2019 van do and lee van do and lee 2019 a lot of works with focus on the vibrational behavior of functionally graded plates in air have been carried out but studies on vibrational characteristics of fg plates submerged in fluid medium are very limited shafiee et al 2014 analyzed the hydroelastic vibration of functionally graded circular plates resting on winkler elastic foundations in contact with a quiescent fluid using semi analytical approach based on energy method using the rayleigh ritz method khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 calculated natural frequencies of the fg vertical plate coupled with sloshing fluid modes based on the first shear deformation plate theory shahbaztabar and ranji 2018 used ritz method to present free vibration analysis of vertical fg plates on elastic foundation and in contact with stationary fluid according to the above literature survey studies focused on vibration behavior of horizontal fg rectangular plates in contact with fluid or immersed in fluid are scarce thus this problem will be investigated in this study comparisons with existing numerical results in open literature are made to verify the accuracy of the present results numerical investigations are conducted to show the influence of the fluid levels material properties aspect ratios thickness to length ratios as well as fluid density on the frequency parameters of the plate 2 statement of the problem according to the first order

compared in table 1 with those of thai and choi 2011 who used analytical solution based on simple higher order theory with four independent variables the fundamental nondimensional natural frequencies ω of a simply supported rectangular metallic plate h 0 1 m h a 0 05 a b 2 and e 207 gpa ρ 7850 kg m3 ν 0 3 totally or partially in contact with water ibc2 are reported in table 2 for different fluid depth ratios including h 1 a 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 2 and the dimensions of the reservoir tank are taken as 5 m 5 m 5 m the results are compared with those obtained by hosseini hashemi hosseini hashemi et al 2012 based on the fsdt with 3 independent variables for a better observation the data in tables 1 and 2 are shown graphically in fig 6 from the obtained results the accuracy of the present navier s analytical solution is demonstrated discrepancy 1 61 for a fg plate and discrepancy 0 1 for a metallic submerged plate in water 8 2 parametric studies in this section several new results for first mode of natural frequency in terms of nondimensional frequency parameter of a fg plate submerged in fluid are given the frequencies of the fluid fg plate are presented for different volume fraction index fluid depth fluid densities aspect ratios thickness to length ratios and interaction boundary conditions a functionally graded al al2o3 rectangular simply supported plate is studied four following interaction boundary conditions ibc are investigated ibc1 plate submerged in fluid with free surface fig 3 ibc2 floating and submerged plate bounded by a rigid wall fig 4 ibc3 two identical parallel plates filled with fluid fig 5 ibc4 in vacuum ρ f 0 8 2 1 mode shapes of the submerged fg rectangular plates in table 3 nine nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 a b 1 5 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 versus various number of modes m 1 to 3 n 1 to 3 and percentage decrease in frequency are presented simultaneously the mode shapes and corresponding non dimensional natural frequencies of the submerged fg rectangular plate subjected to ibc2 are plotted in fig 7 the results show that for all four interaction boundary conditions the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate increase as m or n increases and ω 11 m n 1 is smallest in addition one can see that the mode shapes do not change according to the fluid submergence it is evident that ω of fg plate without fluid ibc4 is the biggest that of fg plate with ibc3 is the second biggest and with ibc1 is the smallest the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate with ibc2 are smallest it is remarkable that the values of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate with ibc1 and ibc3 are similar for higher vibration modes the percentage decrease in nondimensional natural frequencies of submerged fg plate with icb1 icb2 and icb3 is important for all lower modes for example the percentage decrease of ω 11 is 31 26 19 84 and 18 29 under ibc2 ibc1 and ibc3 respectively meanwhile the percentage decreases of ω 33 is only 13 76 7 63 and 7 63 that is why in the following sections we concentrate on the analysis of fundamental nondimensional natural frequency ω 11 of submerged fg plate 8 2 2 influence of power law index on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies ω 11 of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 a b 1 5 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 for various values of power law index p are calculated and presented in table 4 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate versus power law index p is given graphically in fig 8 from the results presented in table 4 and fig 8 one can observe that the ω of fluid fg plate subjected to 4 ibc decreases as the power law index p increases and strongly decreases for p 2 in addition under ibc1 and ibc2 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate is approximately identical for any value of p under the four above mentioned ibcs the percentage decrease of fg plate is around 50 when p varies from 0 pure ceramic plate to pure metallic plate 8 2 3 influence of metal to ceramic young s modulus and density ratios on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 05 a b 2 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 and e c 207 gpa ρ c 7850 kg m3 ν 0 3 subjected to four ibc are calculated and presented in table 5 and fig 9 as follows the results presented in table 5 and fig 9 show that the nondimensional natural frequencies ω increase as the metal to ceramic young s modulus ratio e m e c increases and the metal to ceramic young s density ratio ρ m ρ c decreases and vice versa for examples under ibc1 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 12 2328 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 33 0292 170 01 of increase under ibc2 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 10 6579 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 26 4895 148 54 of increase under ibc3 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 12 4405 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 34 0286 173 53 of increase under ibc4 when ρ m ρ c 0 95 and e m e c 0 05 then ω 14 7817 while ρ m ρ c 0 05 and e m e c 0 95 then ω 49 2810 233 39 of increase in addition the aspect ratio e m e c has a greater impact than ρ m ρ c on nondimensional natural frequencies ω for example under the four considered ibc for a given ratio ρ m ρ c and e m e c varying from 0 05 to 0 95 ω is doubled for a given ratio e m e c and ρ m ρ c varies from 0 05 to 0 95 ω increases 20 30 with ibc1 ibc2 ibc3 meanwhile the percentage increase is around 60 for fg plate in vacuum ibc4 8 2 4 effect of thickness to length ratio h a on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m a b 1 5 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 for various values of plate thickness to length ratio h a are calculated and presented in table 6 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate versus thickness to length ratio h a is graphically plotted in fig 10 as seen from table 6 and fig 10 the plate thickness to length ratio h a considerably influences the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate for vibrating fg plate in vacuum the nondimensional natural frequencies ω continuously diminishes as the thickness to length ratio h a increases however for fluid fg plate with ibc1 ibc2 and ibc3 when the thickness to length ratio h a is still small h a 0 1 and increases the nondimensional natural frequencies ω increases to maximum frequency and then decreases as the thickness to length ratio h a increases moreover for the thin plate h a is small the nondimensional natural frequencies ω are different from ibc1 and ibc3 but for the thick plate h a 0 15 they are almost coincident the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fg plate subjected to icb2 strongly increases percentage of increase is around 50 when h a varies from 0 03 thin plate to 0 2 thick plate while ω of this plate under icb3 increases by only 4 8 2 5 effect of plate aspect ratio a b on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies of fluid fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 for various values of plate aspect ratio a b are calculated and presented in table 7 the variation of these frequencies ω of fg plate versus aspect ratio a b is graphically illustrated in fig 11 the obtained results show that under four ibc the ω of fluid fg plate increases as the plate aspect ratio a b increases in addition to that the higher the aspect ratio a b is the higher the nondimensional natural frequencies are it is obvious that ω increases by 6 and 8 times when a b varies from 0 3 to 2 5 respectively 8 2 6 effect of fluid density ρ f on nondimensional natural frequencies nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate h 0 1 m h a 0 1 a b 1 5 p 2 h 1 a 0 5 d a 0 5 submerged in different fluids various values of ρ f are calculated and presented in table 8 the variation of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate versus fluid mass density ρ f is graphically shown in fig 12 as observed from table 8 and fig 12 the ω of fg plate without fluid is biggest as ρ f increases the nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate under ibc1 ibc2 and ibc3 decrease especially the ω of fg plate under icb2 forcefully decreases 33 01 of decrease as ρ f 1100 kg m3 moreover one can observe that under ibc1 and ibc3 the decrease of nondimensional natural frequencies ω of fluid fg plate is almost linear in contrary this variation is nonlinear for the fg plate under ibc2 8 2 7 effect of fluid depth on nondimensional natural frequencies in tables 9 11 the variations of the nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate against the fluid depth h 1 a or d a and power law index p thickness to length ratio h a and plate aspect ratio a b are shown for three interaction boundary conditions respectively figs 13 15 reveal the variations of nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate versus the fluid depth h 1 a or d a under three ibc for various values of p similar the variations of nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate against the fluid depth h 1 a or d a under three ibc for various values of h a and a b are illustrated in figs 16 21 respectively the results in table 9 and figs 13 15 show that nondimensional natural frequencies ω considerably decreases as p 2 and h 1 a 0 5 under ibc1 and ibc2 d a 0 5 under ibc3 for high values of p h 1 a and d a ω slightly decreases especialy as h 1 a 0 5 the ω of fg plate under ibc1 and ibc2 is constant the influence of p on nondimensional natural frequencies ω is stronger than that of h 1 a and d a from table 10 and figs 16 18 it is observed that for the thin fg plate h a 0 03 nondimensional natural frequencies ω is lowest with various high values of fluid depth h 1 a d a 0 1 with low values of fluid depth the variation of ω depends on interaction boundary conditions nondimensional natural frequencies ω of both thin and thick fg plate decreases as h 1 a or d a increases from table 11 and figs 19 21 it is observed that nondimensional natural frequencies of fg plate ω is lowest with small a b and high values of h 1 a or d a and vice versa the influence of plate aspect ratio a b on nondimensional natural frequencies ω is stronger than that of h 1 a and d a 9 conclusions in this study free vibrational characteristics of the totally submerged functionally graded al al2o3 horizontal rectangular plate or floating on the surface of liquid is investigated analytically by using first order shear deformation plate theory with five independent variables and the potential flow theory for stationary fluid it was shown that the results obtained by the present navier s solution procedure are in excellent agreement with the results reported in other literature based on the obtained numerical results the influence of different parameters including interaction boundary conditions material parameters of the fg plate thickness to length ratios aspect ratios fluid density and fluid depth on the nondimensional natural frequencies of horizontal rectangular plate is quantitatively evaluated and discussed in details these new results are tabulated and illustrated in various figures and show that for all types of interaction boundary conditions investigated in consequence of added mass effects the nondimensional natural frequencies of a fg plate in presence of fluid are more considerable than those without fluid additionally the fundamental nondimensional natural frequencies decrease as the power law index p the metal to ceramic density ratio ρ m ρ c the fluid density ρ c and the fluid depth h 1 a or d a increase in contrary increasing the thickness to length ratio h a the aspect ratio a b and the metal to ceramic young s modulus ratio e m e c causes a considerable increase in the nondimensional natural frequencies of a horizontal functionally graded rectangular plate submerged in fluid medium based on these analyses results it is concluded that the vibration characteristics of functionally graded horizontal rectangular plate is considerably influenced by surrounding fluid medium credit authorship
