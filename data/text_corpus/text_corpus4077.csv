20385,when jack up platforms are deployed for long term services such as those functioning as production units the consolidation settlement of spudcan footings is an issue of particular concern unpredicted and thus unprepared settlement may do harm to the serviceability and safety of jack up rigs through centrifuge experiment and large deformation finite element calculation this paper first illustrates the inherent correlation between the excess pore pressure dissipation inside soil and spudcan settlement development with the measured and calculated settlement time histories subsequent efforts are directed towards exploring how to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement with accuracy particular attentions are placed on investigating the applicability and advantages of two

which most offshore drilling activities in shallow to moderate water depths are performed a typical jack up unit is comprised of a buoyant hull three to four retractable lattice legs passing through the hull spudcan footings attached to the bottom of the legs the spudcan is generally a saucer shaped footing with diameter d ranging between 5 and 25 m sabetamal et al 2014 the jack up installation includes first lowering the spudcan footings to the seabed and then embedding them underground first under self weight of the jack up unit and subsequently by pumping seawater into the hull i e pre loading subjected to the pre load spudcan resting on soft sediments may penetrate deeply up to 3d below the mudline the process featuring large soil deformation and backflow as well as significant generation and accumulation of excess pore water pressures after the pre loading seawater is discharged from the hull i e partial unloading which marks the end of jack up installation and signifies the onset of jack up operation whilst spudcan installation itself can be reasonably regarded as an undrained event due to its rapid installation process which typically takes a few hours osborne et al 2011 purwana et al 2005 significant consolidation is anticipated in the operational period that follows with the dissipation of excess pore pressures underneath the spudcan consolidation settlement develops albeit that the post installation operational settlement of spudcan foundation is known to stem from more than one source yi et al 2020 the consolidation plays a significant role this is particularly true in cases where jack up units serve as production platforms thus operating for long periods at one location before relocation whilst jack up units are often designed with foundation settlement tolerances large unpredicted settlements and in particular uneven settlements among spudcan footings can alter the force balance of the jack up rigs and endanger the serviceability stability and safety of the platforms the post installation consolidation settlement of spudcan is thus a subject of not only scholarly interest but practical concern over the past decades the spudcan consolidation behaviors have received considerable attentions in the research literature barbosa cruz 2007 bienen and cassidy 2013 bienen et al 2015 li et al 2018 purwnan 2007 stanier et al 2014 wang and bienen 2016 nonetheless most of these publications were centered on the consolidation induced stiffening and strengthening of soil beneath the spudcan and its influence on the re penetration capacity of spudcan bienen et al 2015 ragni et al 2016 wang and bienen 2016 yi et al 2014 the consolidation settlement on the other hand drew limited attentions and were covered only in a few publications such as purwana 2007 bienen and cassidy 2013 and li et al 2018 moreover although it has been made clear in the industry iso guideline iso 2016 that the consolidation settlements need to be assessed with care especially for production units no recommendation is explicitly given with regard to the settlement assessment method in an attempt to remedy this situation yi et al 2020 performed an in depth numerical study and established the appropriate forms of dimensionless time t see eq 1 and normalized consolidation settlement or consolidation degree u s see eq 2 which can unify settlement time histories of different scenarios 1 t c o t d d e i r 0 25 2 u s s t s where s is the long term ultimate consolidation settlement of spudcan s t the consolidation settlement at time t d e spudcan embedment depth i r soil s rigid index c o is a so called operative coefficient of consolidation given by 3 c o 3 1 υ 1 e p 1 υ κ 0 5 λ 0 5 k γ w where υ is soil s poisson ratio e the void ratio k the permeability κ the slope of swelling recompression line λ the slopes of the isotropic virgin compression line as illustrated in fig 1 the adoption of t and u s enables settlement time curves of spudcans with various soil loading embedment and geometrical conditions to converge which can thus be represented by one unique curve the black line in the graph this unique curve thus equips engineers working in the field with a useful tool to assess the consolidation degree nonetheless one issue was left for further investigation therein i e the determination of ultimate settlement s provided s can be predicted a prior the engineers can then have a full view of consolidation settlement information including not only u s t but also s t t curves as a follow up to yi et al 2020 the principal objective of this paper is to figure out how to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement s with accuracy the present research includes both centrifuge testing and large deformation finite element ldfe calculation particular emphasis is placed on exploring the workability and exploiting the advantage of two observational methods asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach when they are applied to offshore spudcan settlement prediction practices 2 prediction methods of ultimate consolidation settlement due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the initial distribution of excess pore pressures soil properties drainage paths etc the analytical solutions of consolidation equations have been shown to work unsatisfactorily in predicting the ultimate consolidation settlement of offshore spudcan yi et al 2020 in this research attentions are thereby directed towards another category of predictive methods observational methods the philosophy of the latter is that analyzing the settlement data collected at early stages of consolidation allows the trend line of settlement development to be figured out and thus the subsequent settlement as well as the ultimate settlement to be predicted the attractiveness of the observational methods lies mainly in its simplicity and accuracy after bypassing the complexity of the consolidation theory as well as the uncertainties involved they are thus particularly useful for monitoring in the field 2 1 asaoka s method for consolidation settlement prediction asaoka 1978 developed an observational settlement prediction method which is founded on the one dimensional consolidation equation as expressed by 4 ε t z t c v ε t z z where ε is the vertical strain z is the depth and c v is soil s coefficient of consolidation in vertical direction the length integration of ε along the soil thickness h gives 5 s t 0 h ε t z d t with initial and boundary conditions it can be proven that the solution of eq 5 after necessary approximations takes the following form 6 s t s s s 0 e t t 0 c where c is a coefficient to be determined t 0 refers to the start time after which loading remains unchanged s 0 is the initial settlement i e s t s 0 when t t 0 when a series of settlements at different time are selected from the monitoring data in such a way that s i is the settlement at time t i and the sampling interval δt t i t i 1 is a constant a unique relationship eq 7 between two successive settlements s i and s i 1 can be established where s i 1 is the settlement at time t i 1 with t i t i 1 δt 7 s i β 0 β 1 s i 1 in which β 0 and β 1 are two coefficients which can be graphically determined by plotting the s i against s i 1 as shown in fig 2 a β 0 and β 1 correspond to the intercept and slope of the linear trend line of s i vs s i 1 diagram respectively besides it can be proven that β 1 e δ t c given sufficiently long time s i s i 1 s from eq 7 it can be readily derived out 8 s β 0 1 β 1 it is clear from the preceding description that asaoka s method bases itself on the governing partial different equation eq 4 rather than the actual data as such it tacitly assumes that the consolidation settlement ceases after primary consolidation there thus exists a likely tendency for asaoka s method to underestimate the final settlement tan et al 1991 2 2 hyperbolic approach based on analytical solution field measurements and experimental observations tan et al 1991 postulated that both the small and large strain consolidation behavior follows a hyperbolic pattern after some time which can be mathematically expressed by the following equation 9 s t s 0 t t 0 a b t t 0 where a and b are two unknown constants to be determined to account for the fact that settlement measurements may follow the hyperbolic relation only after some time it is advisable to choose the start time t 0 as the time after which the settlement behavior approaches a hyperbolic line rather than the commencement of the load hold according to tan et al 1991 the hyperbolic approach is a little restrictive in that it is applicable only after the consolidation behavior starts to approach a hyperbolic relation which often comes about when the u s 40 thus it is advisable to choose the time instant when the u s is 40 as the start time t 0 through equation transformation eq 9 can be rewritten as 10 t t 0 s t s 0 a b t t 0 by plotting t t 0 s t s 0 against t t 0 a straight trend line can then be fitted through the data as depicted in fig 2b the parameters a and b thus correspond to the intercept and slope of the line respectively from eq 9 it can be derived out that the ultimate consolidation settlement takes the following form 11 s s 0 1 b 3 modelling methodology and details 3 1 centrifuge modeling in this study centrifuge testing is first undertaken with two objectives 1 to obtain the first hand pore pressure dissipation and consolidation settlement data under a well controlled laboratory condition 2 to benchmark the subsequent computational results which generate most of the research findings centrifuge experiments are performed in the geotechnical beam centrifuge at the national university of singapore through two consecutive phases spudcan installation phase 1 and soil consolidation phase 2 since soil and spudcan responses during the phase 1 have been reported in one earlier publication i e yi et al 2018 they are not repeatedly described herein this contribution is concerned only with the post installation consolidation behavior in the phase 2 also because most of experimental details including laboratory apparatus soil sample preparation in flight strength profiling and model spudcan installation have been covered in that publication for the phase 1 only a synopsis is presented for completeness to facilitate the description of the post installation experimental procedures that follows as shown in fig 3 a a 270 mm thick soft clay bed made of normally consolidated malaysian kaolin with properties detailed in table 1 is housed in a 600 mm diameter cylindrical container six pore pressure transducers ppt1 6 are pre embedded in soil bed at various distances to the target position of a 120 mm diameter full model spudcan so as to track the pore pressure changes in soils during and after the spudcan installation one additional pore pressure transducer ppt s is fitted into the conical underside of the spudcan to monitor the pore pressure variation right on the spudcan base all the seven pore pressure traducers are ge druck pdcr 81 miniature transducers with diameter of 6 mm sensitivity of 0 008 kpa measurement range from 1 to 7 bars during the phase 1 the model spudcan which is initially suspended above soil surface is continuously jacked into soil at a centrifugal acceleration of 100 g by a servo controlled vertical actuator which operates in a displacement controlled mode the penetration rate is set as 0 6 mm s which has been pre calibrated to warrant an undrained penetration condition yi et al 2018 with the continuous jacking the penetration resistance is kept track of by means of a load cell fitted to the top of spudcan shaft see fig 3a as reported in yi et al 2018 the measured penetration resistance force features a linearly increasing tendency with depth fig 3b which is typical in a normally consolidated soil after reaching the target depth d e 150 mm or 1 25d where d e is measured from the ground surface to the lowest elevation of the largest spudcan width see fig 3a the control of actuator is switched to a load controlled mode half of the pre load i e the maximum penetration force recorded during the spudcan penetration is then removed to simulate the partial unloading as described in section 1 given the pre load as shown in fig 3b is about 29 mn 14 5 mn is then maintained throughout the phase 2 as the operational load in other words the load ratio μ defined as the ratio of operational load over the pre load is equal to 0 5 in the meantime spudcan or more precisely its abutting soil is allowed for consolidation for as long as 3 5 h equivalent to nearly 4 years in the prototype scale settlement of spudcan and dissipation of excess pore pressure are closely monitored while the consolidation progresses in the phase 2 3 2 large deformation finite element modeling in this research the spudcan installation and consolidation are consecutively modelled using an effective stress large deformation finite element ldfe technique named dual stage eulerian lagrangian dsel since the development of the dsel technique has been reported by yi et al 2012 2014 in details only an outline is given here with reference to fig 4 the entire package of dsel program consists of three integral modules namely the effective stress eulerian module the coupled flow lagrangian module and the mesh to mesh variable mapping module the effective stress eulerian module capable to analyze undrained large deformation geotechnical events in effective stress framework with simultaneous outputs of pore water pressure is herein utilized to replicate the spudcan installation in the first calculation stage the coupled flow lagrangian module ideal for solving the pore fluid diffusion events with insignificant soil deformation is employed to model the spudcan post installation consolidation in the second calculation stage the mesh to mesh variable mapping module is invoked to bridge the first eulerian with the second lagrangian calculation stages where the analysis results are transferred from the end of the former to the beginning of the latter through spatial interpolation in this research the first stage is performed on the platform of abaqus explicit by incorporating an in house developed subroutine while the second stage is undertaken in abaqus standard the solution mapping is undertaken outside the abaqus environment by executing a matlab program since eulerian calculation in abaqus explicit is only compatible with three dimensional 3d model the finite element model established for the first stage is a 30 slice of a circular spudcan with surrounding soil as shown in fig 5 a the diameter and height of soil domain are 30 m and 27 m respectively which are consistent to the prototype dimensions of sample container in the aforementioned centrifuge experiment a graded mesh is adopted herein to balance computational efficiency and accuracy as shown in fig 5a a highly refined mesh with size of 0 025d is prescribed in the central areas underneath the spudcan further away a coarser mesh is adopted for computational efficiency similar meshing strategy has been practiced by many other researchers hu et al 2014 liu f 2020 tho et al 2012 yi j t 2021 symmetric boundary conditions are imposed on the two vertical faces of the 30 slice by constraining the soil flows normal to the faces yet allowing for tangential components no flows into and out of the exterior curved surface are admissible neither for volume mass conservation at the bottom of the slice soil flow in the vertical direction is constrained to accommodate the anticipated large deformation caused by spudcan installation the soil domain is discretized into 8 noded eulerian brick elements the constitutive behaviour of soil is modelled using the modified cam clay mcc model with parameters listed in table 1 the coefficient of earth pressure at rest k 0 is expressed in term of friction angle ϕ by the empirical formula suggested by jaky 1944 given as k 0 1 sin ϕ atop the soil surface lies a 10 m thick layer of void elements see fig 5a which is warranted to accommodate the soil heave above the original surface as the deformation of spudcan itself is by all means far smaller than soil the former is modelled as a rigid lagrangian body with infinite stiffness to save computational resource the interaction between the eulerian soil domain and lagrangian spudcan body is assumed to be free of friction for simplicity since the effect of spudcan soil friction was previously found insignificant yi et al 2012 during the first calculation stage the spudcan initially located above the soil surface is continually penetrated into clayey soil until reaching the predetermined embedment depth d e 15 0 m or 1 25d see fig 5b afterwards the deformed geometry of soil domain is extracted from eulerian model fig 5b which is then used to define the initial geometry of the lagrangian model fig 5c for the second calculation stage various calculation results including effective stresses pore pressure and void ratio are then transferred from the end of the first stage to the beginning of second stage via the meshes to mesh mapping algorithm as with the preceding centrifuge testing the partial unloading is modelled right at the commencement of second calculation stage what then follows is the coupled flow analysis to study the consolidation behaviors of spudcan it has been well recognized that for a certain type of soil its permeability k is a function of void ratio e since e varies throughout the soil thickness as well as over the consolidation period k thus changes in a similar fashion additionally some soft soil with higher e and thus k that is originally situated in shallow depths may be dragged down due to the passage of spudcan and subsequently trapped underneath spudcan such trapped soil with k contrasting from the surrounding soils is expected to influence the post installation consolidation responses of spudcan in the present study to realistically model the consolidation behavior endeavors are made to factor these into dsel calculation since the technical details regarding these endeavors have been elaborated on by yi et al 2020 they are explained here only in outline basically efforts are made first to establish the k e relationship and then to incorporate such relationship into the dsel analysis through programing in abaqus by doing so k in the dsel calculation is no longer a material constant instead it dynamically varies as e changes 4 results and discussion this section is going to present and compare the measured and calculated post installation consolidation responses of spudcan i e results of the phase 2 as for the spudcan installation behaviors in the phase 1 including penetration resistance and excess pore pressure generation and accumulation interested readers may refer to the mentioned publication yi et al 2018 and they are not included herein to avoid repetition note that experimental results presented in this and following sections are in the prototype scale to facilitate the comparison with numerical counterparts wherever necessary to distinguish the experiment and numerical results subscripts or superscripts in some cases e and n are adopted to denote the former and the latter respectively fig 6 shows the measured and calculated dissipation curves of excess pore pressure δ u at the spudcan base i e ppt s see fig 3 while consolidation progresses the initial value δ u 0 marked in the graph corresponds to the excess pore pressure recorded upon the completion of partial unloading or the commencement of load hold period clearly δ u 0 are of significant amounts 149 and 156 kpa based on experimental and numerical results respectively reflecting the significance of excess pore pressure by the end of spudcan installation as previously described in yi et al 2018 once the consolidation kicks off with load held δ u dissipates rapidly with the development of time t from both experimental and numerical results it appears that the dissipation rates are apparently faster at the early stages of consolidation t 0 5 years thereafter they declines rapidly with the development of time by the end of the fourth year there are virtually no or negligibly small excess pore pressures left at the spudcan base it can be noted that the dissipation trend of experimental measurement can be well mirrored by the numerical counterpart although the latter seems to somewhat overestimate the former throughout the consolidation process such insignificant discrepancy can be at least partially attributed to the overestimation in δ u 0 i e δ u 0 n δ u 0 e the root cause is likely the insignificant strength overestimation of mcc model in modelling normally consolidated malaysian kaolin yi et al 2018 as for the excess pore pressure dissipations insides soil fig 7 a f compare the measured and calculated results generally the dissipation pace differs from one transducer positon to another mainly because of different distance to the drainage boundary top surface and the excess pore pressure redistribution within the soil domain comparing the numerical and experimental results suggests that they are by and large in favorable agreement nonetheless there also exist some discernible discrepancies between them apart from some overestimation in δ u 0 as earlier explained these discrepancies are also likely attributable to the transducer drifts inside soil in the wake of the spudcan deep penetration the pre embedded pore pressure transducers albeit not situated at close proximity of spudcan may have drifted slightly from their original embedment positions this is not accounted for in the present dsel calculation where the material movement is not explicitly traced however this is not supposed to detract from the validity of the calculation as the pore pressure field itself have been correctly produced fig 8 presents the experimentally measured and numerically calculated post installation settlement s t time histories of spudcan note that any settlements take place prior to the commencement of load hold period have been excluded from s t at first glance s t t curves bear much resemblance to the preceding δ u t curves shown in figs 6 and 7 this is not surprising as the settlement development results from the excess pore pressure dissipation nonetheless it should be pointed out that the development of spudcan consolidation settlement indicates the average dissipation progress of the entire influenced region whereas the pore pressure readings from ppt s in fig 6 and ppts 1 6 in fig 7 reflect the consolidation situations at sparse locations rather than the entire region this explains why a careful inspection can readily identify the dissimilarity between of fig 8 and figs 6 and 7 firstly s t develops fairly rapidly within the first two years and apparently slows down only afterwards whereas the bulk of δ u at the ppt s location fig 6 gets dissipated within the first one year and there is no much dissipation taking place thereafter secondly by the end of the fourth year there still exists some tendency for s t to continually develop albeit at much slower paces it signifies the consolidation period prescribed in the centrifuge is not sufficiently long to allow for 100 consolidation of the whole influenced area although δ u at certain locations such as ppt s and ppts 1 6 positions seems to fully dissipate as described earlier numerically this can be readily illustrated by allowing the dsel calculation to proceed until the settlement fully stabilizes which thus gives the calculated ultimate settlement s n it is found that s n 0 328 m as superimposed in the graph and denoted by a red dash line one thing should be clarified that the abscissa of fig 8 is not continuous but broken between 4 and 19 years for the sake better illustration since the calculated consolidation settlement at the end of fourth year s t n 0 290 m it can then be inferred the consolidation degree u s n at that time is roughly 88 4 by assuming experimental data reach the same degree of consolidation as the calculated one u s e u s n it can then be derived out s e 0 332 m which is fairly close to the calculated equivalence from the above description it is reasonable to conclude that there are favorable agreements between numerically computed and experimentally measured results including excess pore pressure and settlement time histories clearly the dsel calculation can numerically replicate the consolidation response of spudcan with confidence 5 ultimate settlement prediction this section as well as the following sections are going to concentrate on the prediction of spudcan ultimate settlement s by making use of experimental and numerical settlement results presented above discussions will be given about the asaoka s method asaoka 1978 zhu et al 2018 and the hyperbolic approach guo et al 2018 tan et al 1991 in terms of their workability suitability and efficacy when applied to offshore spudcan practices before moving to the details it may be more convenient to briefly describe the application backgrounds for an engineer working in the field some consolidation settlement data of spudcan footings are readily available once the operation on the jack up rig commences depending on the operational time and the permeability of soil settlement data that can be collected may come from various consolidation stages for reasons as to be explained later the consolidation progress shown in fig 1 are deliberately divided into three different stages which are demarcated by two dimensionless time t 1 0 0433 corresponding to u s 40 and t 2 0 3680 corresponding to u s 85 these three stages are named stage i t t 1 and thus u s 40 stage ii t 1 t t 2 and thus 40 u s 85 and stage iii t t 2 and thus u s 85 with reference to fig 1 if settlement monitoring data are available only from stage i it is defined as short term consolidation condition if the data avail until stage ii and iii they are defined as intermediate term and long term consolidation conditions respectively the principal objective herein is to explore the possibility and assess the accuracy to predict s based on settlement measurements collated from short intermediate and long terms separately 5 1 short term consolidation condition as discussed in section 2 2 the hyperbolic method is applicable when the consolidation degree exceeds 40 or the consolidation behavior approaches a hyperbolic line as such for the short term consolidation condition with settlement data from stage i only the asaoka s method is relevant and discussed herein this also explains why t 1 is chosen at 0 0433 as its corresponding consolidation degree u s is equal to 40 the discussion is to be given based on both measured and calculated data extracted from the preceding fig 8 where a minor horizontal axis expressed in term of t is added at the bottom to distinguish different consolidation stages since the short term consolidation condition or the first stage spans a wide time range 0 t 80 days in this case it is impractical to evaluate the performance of asaoka s method at each and every time point instead three representative time points are chosen and discussed which include t 20 40 and 70 days their corresponding dimensionless time t are equal to 0 0104 0 0208 and 0 0364 respectively of which the consolidation degrees can be read from fig 1 u s 14 24 36 with these the problem can now be specified as that when the early settlement data of spudcan footing is provided from the commencement of load hold t 0 0 to a particular time point say t 70 days in the short term condition how well the asaoka s method can predict s for the asaoka s method the time interval δt is involved in the calculation process as described in section 2 1 hence attention is first paid to investigating the influence of the time interval based on numerical calculated settlement data s t n in fig 8 within the first 70 days asaoka s method is practiced with five different time intervals δt 2 5 10 15 20 days as shown in fig 9 it is clearly observed from the graphs that the s i vs s i 1 plot can be reasonably fitted by straight lines regardless of δt in other words the workability of asaoka s method to spudcan consolidation settlement prediction is confirmed besides it can be found from table 2 that although the time interval apparently influences the linear best fit the predicted ultimate settlement s n which is inferred from the intersect β 0 and slope β 1 and of the best fit seems to be unaffected when δt becomes less than 10 days accordingly the prediction error δ n where δ n s n s n s n becomes converged when δt reduces to 10days and less this is not illogical if one recognizes that the prediction results will be insensitive to the number of data points or the length of δt when the distribution of data points are sufficiently dense with the consideration of both accuracy and efficiency δt 5 days is adopted hereafter table 3 presents the results of asaoka s prediction exercises for the aforementioned three time points t 20 40 and 70days based on both experimental s t e and numerical s t n settlement data extracted from fig 8 it is clear that substantial discrepancies exist between predictions s and measurements s whether the prediction exercises are with centrifuge or numerical data this is particularly true when t is short take t 20 days as an example the prediction errors of numerical δ n and experimental δ e results are as much as 60 5 and 75 2 respectively in fact this make sense since approximations are involved to develop the unique settlement relationship eq 7 that asaoka s method is founded on which may manifest themselves more clearly at the early stages as expected the prediction accuracy improves apparently as t increases from 20 to 70 days where δ n declines from 60 5 to 44 5 and δ e reduces from 75 2 to 55 2 in other words if one utilizes the asaoka s method to predict the spudcan ultimate settlement with settlement monitoring data of the first 70 days the prediction error or accuracy is roughly of the order of 50 5 2 intermediate term consolidation condition for the intermediate term consolidation condition with settlement data collected from stages i and ii the hyperbolic approach is considered additionally to the asaoka s method as shown in tables 3 and 4 again three typical time points t 110 190 and 500 days are selected for discussion for which the equivalent normalized time t are 0 055 0 107 and 0 260 it can be checked from fig 1 that their corresponding u s are approximately 45 0 62 5 and 80 0 respectively take t 190 days as an illustrative example fig 10 a plots its hyperbolic plots i e t t 0 s t s 0 vs t t 0 diagram by processing the numerical data from fig 8 and setting the start time t 0 80 days the reason why t 0 is chosen at 80 days is due to the conclusion drawn by tan et al 1991 that the settlement time data follow a hyperbolic rule only after the consolidation degree u s exceeds approximately 40 as such time is initialized at t t 1 where u s 40 which in this case corresponds to that time i e t 0 80 days notwithstanding there remains a discernible tendency for the settlement time data t t 0 s t s 0 t t 0 to deviate from the linear relationship at the early stages as shown in fig 10a except for that the settlement time plots as a whole can be well fitted by a straight line with the slope of the linear best fit the ultimate settlement predicted can then be inferred by invoking eq 11 which gives s n 0 279 m given s n 0 328 m the hyperbolic approach seems to under predict the ultimate settlement by around 14 9 as detailed in table 4 under prediction of a somewhat larger amount 18 0 can be similarly identified when practicing the hyperbolic approach with the experimental settlement results as shown in fig 10b and table 4 unsurprisingly provided with a longer observational period i e a larger t the prediction accuracy of the hyperbolic approach can be effectively improved as illustrated in table 4 δ n declines from 31 1 to 14 9 and then 8 2 as t increases from t 110 190 and 500 days a similar conclusion can be drawn from the experimental counterparts i e δ e for the intermediate consolidation condition asaoka s method can also be continually relied on as shown in table 3 its prediction accuracy are apparently improved when moving from the short term into the intermediate term nonetheless by comparing table 3 with 4 it is clear that the hyperbolic approach outperforms the asaoka s method within the intermediate term for instance for t 190 days δ n of asaoka s method is 26 8 whereas its equivalence of hyperbolic approach is only 14 9 in other words the hyperbolic approach is preferable for the intermediate term consolidation condition 5 3 long term consolidation condition whilst the hyperbolic approach has been shown to produce satisfactory prediction results for the intermediate term consolidation condition its settlement prediction s cannot converge to s in the long term consolidation condition as detailed in table 4 the prediction error of the hyperbolic approach seems to plateau when t increases from 770 to 1440 days δ n and δ e stabilizing around 10 11 and 13 14 respectively in other words once the observational period is sufficiently long the prediction accuracy of the hyperbolic approach does not further benefit from the increase in time the reason why s from the hyperbolic approach cannot approach s asymptotically is at least partially because that the linear best fit of hyperbolic plot has to go through the entire data set the deviation from the linear trend at the early stages shortly after t 0 as previously noted in fig 10 may obstruct s to converge towards s in the long term although this can be remedied by reinitializing the hyperbolic plot with a larger t 0 for the long term consolidation condition it may generate another problem how to choose an appropriate t 0 t 0 may differ from one case to another the uncertainty and difficulty involved in the selection of t 0 may then hinder its practical application given the prediction error is not very substantial δ n of 10 11 and δ e of 13 14 it may be more advisable to keep t 0 pegged at the time corresponding to u s 40 even when the hyperbolic approach is practiced in the long term consolidation condition asaoka s method on the other hand does not suffer from the foregoing limitation it is clear from table 3 that s from asaoka s method can approach s asymptomatically this may be attributed to that s i vs s i 1 plot of asaoka s method follows a linear trend line right at the beginning as previous noted in fig 9 with the increase in the observational period the prediction error becomes increasingly small and then negligible besides for the long term consolidation condition asaoka s method is advantageous over hyperbolic approach in terms of prediction accuracy take t 1000 days as an example δ n of asaoka s method is only 5 82 whereas its equivalence of the hyperbolic approach is 11 0 in fact the prediction accuracy of asaoka s method surpasses the hyperbolic approach only after t exceeds t 2 this explains why t 2 is selected as the boundary of the third stage hence from the viewpoints of both prediction stability and accuracy the asaoka s method is more recommended for the long term consolidation condition 6 parametric investigation whilst the workability and suitability of the asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement of spudcan have been testified through section 5 their prediction accuracies have yet to be evaluated under more general conditions for spudcan with different geometrical embedment and loading conditions and soil of various properties the purpose of this section is to describe how these factors influence the prediction performance through a comprehensive numerical parametric investigation and more importantly to establish the upper and lower limits of their prediction errors in general as tabulated in table 5 there are six groups of numerical calculations which are designed to explore the influence of spudcan diameter d loading ratio μ embedment depth d e and soil s mcc parameters κ λ and m in each group there is only one parameter chosen and thus varied while the other parameters remain at the base reference values i e those used in section 5 care is taken to ensure the variation range of the parameter can broadly encompass those commonly encountered in offshore practices the details of these numerical calculations are virtually the identical to those described in section 3 and hence not repeated herein upon the completion of numerical computations analyses results s t are extracted and processed to produce s in the same way as earlier described it is similarly found that asaoka s method is more advantageous for the short and long term consolidation conditions i e t t 1 and t t 2 while the hyperbolic approach is superior for the intermediate term consolidation condition i e t 1 t t 2 by comparing s with s their prediction errors δ are then obtained and plotted in fig 11 there are a few observations which can be made from this graph firstly the prediction accuracy apparently improves as the dimensionless time t gets larger in other words with a longer observational period and thus more monitoring data taken from the field the settlement prediction can be undertaken with more confidence secondly it appears that all factors in question are relevant to the prediction accuracy and there is no such a factor as the most critical factor thirdly the prediction error does not vary much significantly when these parameters are adjusted within the aforementioned range with all calculation results constituting a relatively narrow band the upper and lower bounds of this band are indicated by two nearly parallel dash lines in the graph that is to say although the prediction performance differs for one case to another their associated errors are bracketed by the upper and lower limits this will be helpful for engineers who are intent to apply the asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach to predict the ultimate settlement of spudcan since it give them an idea of the prediction accuracy or a first order estimation of prediction error 7 example and verification up to this point recommendations of suitable prediction methods i e asaoka s method for short and long term conditions hyperbolic approach for the intermediate term condition and their associated prediction errors see fig 11 haven been explicitly given above to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of these research outcomes a demonstrative example is further provided in this section which takes advantage of consolidation settlement data reported in the literature bienen and cassidy 2013 performed a well controlled centrifuge experiment at an acceleration level of 200 g at the university of western australia using normally consolidated australian kaolin clay with properties detailed in table 6 the centrifuge experiment was undertaken mainly to investigate the consolidation induced strength build up of soil underneath spudcan where the spudcan consolidation settlement was continuously tracked thus providing the full record of settlement development history for as long as 20 years see fig 12 for settlement prediction exercises three different time points t 30 150 790 days are selected from the time history curve of settlement development with eq 1 it can be readily figured out that their corresponding dimensionless time t are approximately 0 022 0 108 0 585 respectively by referring to fig 1 it can then be figured out they belong to short intermediate and long term consolidation conditions respectively following the recommendation given above asaoka s method is selected for t 0 022 0 585 whereas the hyperbolic approach is chosen for t 0 108 prediction exercises are then practiced for them with settlement prediction results s summarized in table 7 with the benefit of hindsight it is clear that s is consistently lower than the actual measurement s shown in table 7 as expected the estimated prediction error δ which is checked from fig 11 is appended besides s indicating the anticipated the error range of prediction excise on the other hand the actual prediction error δ is attached to the right of s in the same table clearly δ is well within the anticipated error range of δ see table 7 and enclosed by the lower and upper bounds see fig 11 8 comments conclusions as jack up rigs are increasingly utilized as production units the spudcan consolidation settlement occurring in a long operational period is becoming an issue of more partial concern and scholarly interest in one recent publication the authors developed the appropriate forms of dimensionless time t and normalized settlement u s which can unify settlement time histories of spudcan with various soil loading embedment and geometrical conditions nonetheless without a prior knowledge of the ultimate settlement application of the developed unique u s t relation is restricted as a follow up to the foregoing work the present research is undertaken to investigate how to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement with accuracy as the inherent uncertainties involved in analytical solutions of the consolidation equations attentions are herein placed on observational methods through the combination of centrifuge experiment and ldfe calculation the excess pore pressure dissipation and settlement development characteristics are first elucidated where inherent correlation between them are identified with the measured and calculated settlement data the prediction exercises are then undertaken to explore the applicability and exploit the advantage of the asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach it is concluded that the asaoka s method is suited to predicting the ultimate settlement when monitoring data are collated from short and long term consolidation condition the hyperbolic approach on the other hand is ideal if observational measurements are from the intermediate term consolidation term their associated prediction errors are found to decline with the increasing length of observational period particular efforts are made to establish the upper and lower bounds of prediction errors through comprehensive numerical parametric investigation explicit recommendations of appropriate prediction approaches for different consolidation conditions as well as estimation of their associated prediction errors are provided these research outcomes are likely of help for practicing engineers to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement with accuracy if further combining them with previous research findings i e the unique u s t relation fig 1 one can then have a complete view of consolidation settlement development i e the s t t curve two additional things should be clarified first the preceding findings are obtained mainly from numerical analyses where secondary compression is not accounted for nonetheless this is not expected to significantly weaken the research outcomes since the secondary compression typically comprises only less than 10 of the primary compression berre and iversen 1972 moreover when applied in practice the observational methods which are based on field observations can intrinsically include the secondary compression second whilst the present research outcomes have been testified by centrifuge experimental results from more than one source additional verification with field measurements may still be required in the future credit authorship contribution statement jiang tao yi conceptualization methodology writing review editing fei liu data curation software investigation

20385,when jack up platforms are deployed for long term services such as those functioning as production units the consolidation settlement of spudcan footings is an issue of particular concern unpredicted and thus unprepared settlement may do harm to the serviceability and safety of jack up rigs through centrifuge experiment and large deformation finite element calculation this paper first illustrates the inherent correlation between the excess pore pressure dissipation inside soil and spudcan settlement development with the measured and calculated settlement time histories subsequent

which most offshore drilling activities in shallow to moderate water depths are performed a typical jack up unit is comprised of a buoyant hull three to four retractable lattice legs passing through the hull spudcan footings attached to the bottom of the legs the spudcan is generally a saucer shaped footing with diameter d ranging between 5 and 25 m sabetamal et al 2014 the jack up installation includes first lowering the spudcan footings to the seabed and then embedding them underground first under self weight of the jack up unit and subsequently by pumping seawater into the hull i e pre loading subjected to the pre load spudcan resting on soft sediments may penetrate deeply up to 3d below the mudline the process featuring large soil deformation and backflow as well as significant generation and accumulation of excess pore water pressures after the pre loading seawater is discharged from the hull i e partial unloading which marks the end of jack up installation and signifies the onset of jack up operation whilst spudcan installation itself can be reasonably regarded as an undrained event due to its rapid installation process which typically takes a few hours osborne et al 2011 purwana et al 2005 significant consolidation is anticipated in the operational period that follows with the dissipation of excess pore pressures underneath the spudcan consolidation settlement develops albeit that the post installation operational settlement of spudcan foundation is known to stem from more than one source yi et al 2020 the consolidation plays a significant role this is particularly true in cases where jack up units serve as production platforms thus operating for long periods at one location before relocation whilst jack up units are often designed with foundation settlement tolerances large unpredicted settlements and in particular uneven settlements among spudcan footings can alter the force balance of the jack up rigs and endanger the serviceability stability and safety of the platforms the post installation consolidation settlement of spudcan is thus a subject of not only scholarly interest but practical concern over the past decades the spudcan consolidation behaviors have received considerable attentions in the research literature barbosa cruz 2007 bienen and cassidy 2013 bienen et al 2015 li et al 2018 purwnan 2007 stanier et al 2014 wang and bienen 2016 nonetheless most of these publications were centered on the consolidation induced stiffening and strengthening of soil beneath the spudcan and its influence on the re penetration capacity of spudcan bienen et al 2015 ragni et al 2016 wang and bienen 2016 yi et al 2014 the consolidation settlement on the other hand drew limited attentions and were covered only in a few publications such as purwana 2007 bienen and cassidy 2013 and li et al 2018 moreover although it has been made clear in the industry iso guideline iso 2016 that the consolidation settlements need to be assessed with care especially for production units no recommendation is explicitly given with regard to the settlement assessment method in an attempt to remedy this situation yi et al 2020 performed an in depth numerical study and established the appropriate forms of dimensionless time t see eq 1 and normalized consolidation settlement or consolidation degree u s see eq 2 which can unify settlement time histories of different scenarios 1 t c o t d d e i r 0 25 2 u s s t s where s is the long term ultimate consolidation settlement of spudcan s t the consolidation settlement at time t d e spudcan embedment depth i r soil s rigid index c o is a so called operative coefficient of consolidation given by 3 c o 3 1 υ 1 e p 1 υ κ 0 5 λ 0 5 k γ w where υ is soil s poisson ratio e the void ratio k the permeability κ the slope of swelling recompression line λ the slopes of the isotropic virgin compression line as illustrated in fig 1 the adoption of t and u s enables settlement time curves of spudcans with various soil loading embedment and geometrical conditions to converge which can thus be represented by one unique curve the black line in the graph this unique curve thus equips engineers working in the field with a useful tool to assess the consolidation degree nonetheless one issue was left for further investigation therein i e the determination of ultimate settlement s provided s can be predicted a prior the engineers can then have a full view of consolidation settlement information including not only u s t but also s t t curves as a follow up to yi et al 2020 the principal objective of this paper is to figure out how to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement s with accuracy the present research includes both centrifuge testing and large deformation finite element ldfe calculation particular emphasis is placed on exploring the workability and exploiting the advantage of two observational methods asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach when they are applied to offshore spudcan settlement prediction practices 2 prediction methods of ultimate consolidation settlement due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the initial distribution of excess pore pressures soil properties drainage paths etc the analytical solutions of consolidation equations have been shown to work unsatisfactorily in predicting the ultimate consolidation settlement of offshore spudcan yi et al 2020 in this research attentions are thereby directed towards another category of predictive methods observational methods the philosophy of the latter is that analyzing the settlement data collected at early stages of consolidation allows the trend line of settlement development to be figured out and thus the subsequent settlement as well as the ultimate settlement to be predicted the attractiveness of the observational methods lies mainly in its simplicity and accuracy after bypassing the complexity of the consolidation theory as well as the uncertainties involved they are thus particularly useful for monitoring in the field 2 1 asaoka s method for consolidation settlement prediction asaoka 1978 developed an observational settlement prediction method which is founded on the one dimensional consolidation equation as expressed by 4 ε t z t c v ε t z z where ε is the vertical strain z is the depth and c v is soil s coefficient of consolidation in vertical direction the length integration of ε along the soil thickness h gives 5 s t 0 h ε t z d t with initial and boundary conditions it can be proven that the solution of eq 5 after necessary approximations takes the following form 6 s t s s s 0 e t t 0 c where c is a coefficient to be determined t 0 refers to the start time after which loading remains unchanged s 0 is the initial settlement i e s t s 0 when t t 0 when a series of settlements at different time are selected from the monitoring data in such a way that s i is the settlement at time t i and the sampling interval δt t i t i 1 is a constant a unique relationship eq 7 between two successive settlements s i and s i 1 can be established where s i 1 is the settlement at time t i 1 with t i t i 1 δt 7 s i β 0 β 1 s i 1 in which β 0 and β 1 are two coefficients which can be graphically determined by plotting the s i against s i 1 as shown in fig 2 a β 0 and β 1 correspond to the intercept and slope of the linear trend line of s i vs s i 1 diagram respectively besides it can be proven that β 1 e δ t c given sufficiently long time s i s i 1 s from eq 7 it can be readily derived out 8 s β 0 1 β 1 it is clear from the preceding description that asaoka s method bases itself on the governing partial different equation eq 4 rather than the actual data as such it tacitly assumes that the consolidation settlement ceases after primary consolidation there thus exists a likely tendency for asaoka s method to underestimate the final settlement tan et al 1991 2 2 hyperbolic approach based on analytical solution field measurements and experimental observations tan et al 1991 postulated that both the small and large strain consolidation behavior follows a hyperbolic pattern after some time which can be mathematically expressed by the following equation 9 s t s 0 t t 0 a b t t 0 where a and b are two unknown constants to be determined to account for the fact that settlement measurements may follow the hyperbolic relation only after some time it is advisable to choose the start time t 0 as the time after which the settlement behavior approaches a hyperbolic line rather than the commencement of the load hold according to tan et al 1991 the hyperbolic approach is a little restrictive in that it is applicable only after the consolidation behavior starts to approach a hyperbolic relation which often comes about when the u s 40 thus it is advisable to choose the time instant when the u s is 40 as the start time t 0 through equation transformation eq 9 can be rewritten as 10 t t 0 s t s 0 a b t t 0 by plotting t t 0 s t s 0 against t t 0 a straight trend line can then be fitted through the data as depicted in fig 2b the parameters a and b thus correspond to the intercept and slope of the line respectively from eq 9 it can be derived out that the ultimate consolidation settlement takes the following form 11 s s 0 1 b 3 modelling methodology and details 3 1 centrifuge modeling in this study centrifuge testing is first undertaken with two objectives 1 to obtain the first hand pore pressure dissipation and consolidation settlement data under a well controlled laboratory condition 2 to benchmark the subsequent computational results which generate most of the research findings centrifuge experiments are performed in the geotechnical beam centrifuge at the national university of singapore through two consecutive phases spudcan installation phase 1 and soil consolidation phase 2 since soil and spudcan responses during the phase 1 have been reported in one earlier publication i e yi et al 2018 they are not repeatedly described herein this contribution is concerned only with the post installation consolidation behavior in the phase 2 also because most of experimental details including laboratory apparatus soil sample preparation in flight strength profiling and model spudcan installation have been covered in that publication for the phase 1 only a synopsis is presented for completeness to facilitate the description of the post installation experimental procedures that follows as shown in fig 3 a a 270 mm thick soft clay bed made of normally consolidated malaysian kaolin with properties detailed in table 1 is housed in a 600 mm diameter cylindrical container six pore pressure transducers ppt1 6 are pre embedded in soil bed at various distances to the target position of a 120 mm diameter full model spudcan so as to track the pore pressure changes in soils during and after the spudcan installation one additional pore pressure transducer ppt s is fitted into the conical underside of the spudcan to monitor the pore pressure variation right on the spudcan base all the seven pore pressure traducers are ge druck pdcr 81 miniature transducers with diameter of 6 mm sensitivity of 0 008 kpa measurement range from 1 to 7 bars during the phase 1 the model spudcan which is initially suspended above soil surface is continuously jacked into soil at a centrifugal acceleration of 100 g by a servo controlled vertical actuator which operates in a displacement controlled mode the penetration rate is set as 0 6 mm s which has been pre calibrated to warrant an undrained penetration condition yi et al 2018 with the continuous jacking the penetration resistance is kept track of by means of a load cell fitted to the top of spudcan shaft see fig 3a as reported in yi et al 2018 the measured penetration resistance force features a linearly increasing tendency with depth fig 3b which is typical in a normally consolidated soil after reaching the target depth d e 150 mm or 1 25d where d e is measured from the ground surface to the lowest elevation of the largest spudcan width see fig 3a the control of actuator is switched to a load controlled mode half of the pre load i e the maximum penetration force recorded during the spudcan penetration is then removed to simulate the partial unloading as described in section 1 given the pre load as shown in fig 3b is about 29 mn 14 5 mn is then maintained throughout the phase 2 as the operational load in other words the load ratio μ defined as the ratio of operational load over the pre load is equal to 0 5 in the meantime spudcan or more precisely its abutting soil is allowed for consolidation for as long as 3 5 h equivalent to nearly 4 years in the prototype scale settlement of spudcan and dissipation of excess pore pressure are closely monitored while the consolidation progresses in the phase 2 3 2 large deformation finite element modeling in this research the spudcan installation and consolidation are consecutively modelled using an effective stress large deformation finite element ldfe technique named dual stage eulerian lagrangian dsel since the development of the dsel technique has been reported by yi et al 2012 2014 in details only an outline is given here with reference to fig 4 the entire package of dsel program consists of three integral modules namely the effective stress eulerian module the coupled flow lagrangian module and the mesh to mesh variable mapping module the effective stress eulerian module capable to analyze undrained large deformation geotechnical events in effective stress framework with simultaneous outputs of pore water pressure is herein utilized to replicate the spudcan installation in the first calculation stage the coupled flow lagrangian module ideal for solving the pore fluid diffusion events with insignificant soil deformation is employed to model the spudcan post installation consolidation in the second calculation stage the mesh to mesh variable mapping module is invoked to bridge the first eulerian with the second lagrangian calculation stages where the analysis results are transferred from the end of the former to the beginning of the latter through spatial interpolation in this research the first stage is performed on the platform of abaqus explicit by incorporating an in house developed subroutine while the second stage is undertaken in abaqus standard the solution mapping is undertaken outside the abaqus environment by executing a matlab program since eulerian calculation in abaqus explicit is only compatible with three dimensional 3d model the finite element model established for the first stage is a 30 slice of a circular spudcan with surrounding soil as shown in fig 5 a the diameter and height of soil domain are 30 m and 27 m respectively which are consistent to the prototype dimensions of sample container in the aforementioned centrifuge experiment a graded mesh is adopted herein to balance computational efficiency and accuracy as shown in fig 5a a highly refined mesh with size of 0 025d is prescribed in the central areas underneath the spudcan further away a coarser mesh is adopted for computational efficiency similar meshing strategy has been practiced by many other researchers hu et al 2014 liu f 2020 tho et al 2012 yi j t 2021 symmetric boundary conditions are imposed on the two vertical faces of the 30 slice by constraining the soil flows normal to the faces yet allowing for tangential components no flows into and out of the exterior curved surface are admissible neither for volume mass conservation at the bottom of the slice soil flow in the vertical direction is constrained to accommodate the anticipated large deformation caused by spudcan installation the soil domain is discretized into 8 noded eulerian brick elements the constitutive behaviour of soil is modelled using the modified cam clay mcc model with parameters listed in table 1 the coefficient of earth pressure at rest k 0 is expressed in term of friction angle ϕ by the empirical formula suggested by jaky 1944 given as k 0 1 sin ϕ atop the soil surface lies a 10 m thick layer of void elements see fig 5a which is warranted to accommodate the soil heave above the original surface as the deformation of spudcan itself is by all means far smaller than soil the former is modelled as a rigid lagrangian body with infinite stiffness to save computational resource the interaction between the eulerian soil domain and lagrangian spudcan body is assumed to be free of friction for simplicity since the effect of spudcan soil friction was previously found insignificant yi et al 2012 during the first calculation stage the spudcan initially located above the soil surface is continually penetrated into clayey soil until reaching the predetermined embedment depth d e 15 0 m or 1 25d see fig 5b afterwards the deformed geometry of soil domain is extracted from eulerian model fig 5b which is then used to define the initial geometry of the lagrangian model fig 5c for the second calculation stage various calculation results including effective stresses pore pressure and void ratio are then transferred from the end of the first stage to the beginning of second stage via the meshes to mesh mapping algorithm as with the preceding centrifuge testing the partial unloading is modelled right at the commencement of second calculation stage what then follows is the coupled flow analysis to study the consolidation behaviors of spudcan it has been well recognized that for a certain type of soil its permeability k is a function of void ratio e since e varies throughout the soil thickness as well as over the consolidation period k thus changes in a similar fashion additionally some soft soil with higher e and thus k that is originally situated in shallow depths may be dragged down due to the passage of spudcan and subsequently trapped underneath spudcan such trapped soil with k contrasting from the surrounding soils is expected to influence the post installation consolidation responses of spudcan in the present study to realistically model the consolidation behavior endeavors are made to factor these into dsel calculation since the technical details regarding these endeavors have been elaborated on by yi et al 2020 they are explained here only in outline basically efforts are made first to establish the k e relationship and then to incorporate such relationship into the dsel analysis through programing in abaqus by doing so k in the dsel calculation is no longer a material constant instead it dynamically varies as e changes 4 results and discussion this section is going to present and compare the measured and calculated post installation consolidation responses of spudcan i e results of the phase 2 as for the spudcan installation behaviors in the phase 1 including penetration resistance and excess pore pressure generation and accumulation interested readers may refer to the mentioned publication yi et al 2018 and they are not included herein to avoid repetition note that experimental results presented in this and following sections are in the prototype scale to facilitate the comparison with numerical counterparts wherever necessary to distinguish the experiment and numerical results subscripts or superscripts in some cases e and n are adopted to denote the former and the latter respectively fig 6 shows the measured and calculated dissipation curves of excess pore pressure δ u at the spudcan base i e ppt s see fig 3 while consolidation progresses the initial value δ u 0 marked in the graph corresponds to the excess pore pressure recorded upon the completion of partial unloading or the commencement of load hold period clearly δ u 0 are of significant amounts 149 and 156 kpa based on experimental and numerical results respectively reflecting the significance of excess pore pressure by the end of spudcan installation as previously described in yi et al 2018 once the consolidation kicks off with load held δ u dissipates rapidly with the development of time t from both experimental and numerical results it appears that the dissipation rates are apparently faster at the early stages of consolidation t 0 5 years thereafter they declines rapidly with the development of time by the end of the fourth year there are virtually no or negligibly small excess pore pressures left at the spudcan base it can be noted that the dissipation trend of experimental measurement can be well mirrored by the numerical counterpart although the latter seems to somewhat overestimate the former throughout the consolidation process such insignificant discrepancy can be at least partially attributed to the overestimation in δ u 0 i e δ u 0 n δ u 0 e the root cause is likely the insignificant strength overestimation of mcc model in modelling normally consolidated malaysian kaolin yi et al 2018 as for the excess pore pressure dissipations insides soil fig 7 a f compare the measured and calculated results generally the dissipation pace differs from one transducer positon to another mainly because of different distance to the drainage boundary top surface and the excess pore pressure redistribution within the soil domain comparing the numerical and experimental results suggests that they are by and large in favorable agreement nonetheless there also exist some discernible discrepancies between them apart from some overestimation in δ u 0 as earlier explained these discrepancies are also likely attributable to the transducer drifts inside soil in the wake of the spudcan deep penetration the pre embedded pore pressure transducers albeit not situated at close proximity of spudcan may have drifted slightly from their original embedment positions this is not accounted for in the present dsel calculation where the material movement is not explicitly traced however this is not supposed to detract from the validity of the calculation as the pore pressure field itself have been correctly produced fig 8 presents the experimentally measured and numerically calculated post installation settlement s t time histories of spudcan note that any settlements take place prior to the commencement of load hold period have been excluded from s t at first glance s t t curves bear much resemblance to the preceding δ u t curves shown in figs 6 and 7 this is not surprising as the settlement development results from the excess pore pressure dissipation nonetheless it should be pointed out that the development of spudcan consolidation settlement indicates the average dissipation progress of the entire influenced region whereas the pore pressure readings from ppt s in fig 6 and ppts 1 6 in fig 7 reflect the consolidation situations at sparse locations rather than the entire region this explains why a careful inspection can readily identify the dissimilarity between of fig 8 and figs 6 and 7 firstly s t develops fairly rapidly within the first two years and apparently slows down only afterwards whereas the bulk of δ u at the ppt s location fig 6 gets dissipated within the first one year and there is no much dissipation taking place thereafter secondly by the end of the fourth year there still exists some tendency for s t to continually develop albeit at much slower paces it signifies the consolidation period prescribed in the centrifuge is not sufficiently long to allow for 100 consolidation of the whole influenced area although δ u at certain locations such as ppt s and ppts 1 6 positions seems to fully dissipate as described earlier numerically this can be readily illustrated by allowing the dsel calculation to proceed until the settlement fully stabilizes which thus gives the calculated ultimate settlement s n it is found that s n 0 328 m as superimposed in the graph and denoted by a red dash line one thing should be clarified that the abscissa of fig 8 is not continuous but broken between 4 and 19 years for the sake better illustration since the calculated consolidation settlement at the end of fourth year s t n 0 290 m it can then be inferred the consolidation degree u s n at that time is roughly 88 4 by assuming experimental data reach the same degree of consolidation as the calculated one u s e u s n it can then be derived out s e 0 332 m which is fairly close to the calculated equivalence from the above description it is reasonable to conclude that there are favorable agreements between numerically computed and experimentally measured results including excess pore pressure and settlement time histories clearly the dsel calculation can numerically replicate the consolidation response of spudcan with confidence 5 ultimate settlement prediction this section as well as the following sections are going to concentrate on the prediction of spudcan ultimate settlement s by making use of experimental and numerical settlement results presented above discussions will be given about the asaoka s method asaoka 1978 zhu et al 2018 and the hyperbolic approach guo et al 2018 tan et al 1991 in terms of their workability suitability and efficacy when applied to offshore spudcan practices before moving to the details it may be more convenient to briefly describe the application backgrounds for an engineer working in the field some consolidation settlement data of spudcan footings are readily available once the operation on the jack up rig commences depending on the operational time and the permeability of soil settlement data that can be collected may come from various consolidation stages for reasons as to be explained later the consolidation progress shown in fig 1 are deliberately divided into three different stages which are demarcated by two dimensionless time t 1 0 0433 corresponding to u s 40 and t 2 0 3680 corresponding to u s 85 these three stages are named stage i t t 1 and thus u s 40 stage ii t 1 t t 2 and thus 40 u s 85 and stage iii t t 2 and thus u s 85 with reference to fig 1 if settlement monitoring data are available only from stage i it is defined as short term consolidation condition if the data avail until stage ii and iii they are defined as intermediate term and long term consolidation conditions respectively the principal objective herein is to explore the possibility and assess the accuracy to predict s based on settlement measurements collated from short intermediate and long terms separately 5 1 short term consolidation condition as discussed in section 2 2 the hyperbolic method is applicable when the consolidation degree exceeds 40 or the consolidation behavior approaches a hyperbolic line as such for the short term consolidation condition with settlement data from stage i only the asaoka s method is relevant and discussed herein this also explains why t 1 is chosen at 0 0433 as its corresponding consolidation degree u s is equal to 40 the discussion is to be given based on both measured and calculated data extracted from the preceding fig 8 where a minor horizontal axis expressed in term of t is added at the bottom to distinguish different consolidation stages since the short term consolidation condition or the first stage spans a wide time range 0 t 80 days in this case it is impractical to evaluate the performance of asaoka s method at each and every time point instead three representative time points are chosen and discussed which include t 20 40 and 70 days their corresponding dimensionless time t are equal to 0 0104 0 0208 and 0 0364 respectively of which the consolidation degrees can be read from fig 1 u s 14 24 36 with these the problem can now be specified as that when the early settlement data of spudcan footing is provided from the commencement of load hold t 0 0 to a particular time point say t 70 days in the short term condition how well the asaoka s method can predict s for the asaoka s method the time interval δt is involved in the calculation process as described in section 2 1 hence attention is first paid to investigating the influence of the time interval based on numerical calculated settlement data s t n in fig 8 within the first 70 days asaoka s method is practiced with five different time intervals δt 2 5 10 15 20 days as shown in fig 9 it is clearly observed from the graphs that the s i vs s i 1 plot can be reasonably fitted by straight lines regardless of δt in other words the workability of asaoka s method to spudcan consolidation settlement prediction is confirmed besides it can be found from table 2 that although the time interval apparently influences the linear best fit the predicted ultimate settlement s n which is inferred from the intersect β 0 and slope β 1 and of the best fit seems to be unaffected when δt becomes less than 10 days accordingly the prediction error δ n where δ n s n s n s n becomes converged when δt reduces to 10days and less this is not illogical if one recognizes that the prediction results will be insensitive to the number of data points or the length of δt when the distribution of data points are sufficiently dense with the consideration of both accuracy and efficiency δt 5 days is adopted hereafter table 3 presents the results of asaoka s prediction exercises for the aforementioned three time points t 20 40 and 70days based on both experimental s t e and numerical s t n settlement data extracted from fig 8 it is clear that substantial discrepancies exist between predictions s and measurements s whether the prediction exercises are with centrifuge or numerical data this is particularly true when t is short take t 20 days as an example the prediction errors of numerical δ n and experimental δ e results are as much as 60 5 and 75 2 respectively in fact this make sense since approximations are involved to develop the unique settlement relationship eq 7 that asaoka s method is founded on which may manifest themselves more clearly at the early stages as expected the prediction accuracy improves apparently as t increases from 20 to 70 days where δ n declines from 60 5 to 44 5 and δ e reduces from 75 2 to 55 2 in other words if one utilizes the asaoka s method to predict the spudcan ultimate settlement with settlement monitoring data of the first 70 days the prediction error or accuracy is roughly of the order of 50 5 2 intermediate term consolidation condition for the intermediate term consolidation condition with settlement data collected from stages i and ii the hyperbolic approach is considered additionally to the asaoka s method as shown in tables 3 and 4 again three typical time points t 110 190 and 500 days are selected for discussion for which the equivalent normalized time t are 0 055 0 107 and 0 260 it can be checked from fig 1 that their corresponding u s are approximately 45 0 62 5 and 80 0 respectively take t 190 days as an illustrative example fig 10 a plots its hyperbolic plots i e t t 0 s t s 0 vs t t 0 diagram by processing the numerical data from fig 8 and setting the start time t 0 80 days the reason why t 0 is chosen at 80 days is due to the conclusion drawn by tan et al 1991 that the settlement time data follow a hyperbolic rule only after the consolidation degree u s exceeds approximately 40 as such time is initialized at t t 1 where u s 40 which in this case corresponds to that time i e t 0 80 days notwithstanding there remains a discernible tendency for the settlement time data t t 0 s t s 0 t t 0 to deviate from the linear relationship at the early stages as shown in fig 10a except for that the settlement time plots as a whole can be well fitted by a straight line with the slope of the linear best fit the ultimate settlement predicted can then be inferred by invoking eq 11 which gives s n 0 279 m given s n 0 328 m the hyperbolic approach seems to under predict the ultimate settlement by around 14 9 as detailed in table 4 under prediction of a somewhat larger amount 18 0 can be similarly identified when practicing the hyperbolic approach with the experimental settlement results as shown in fig 10b and table 4 unsurprisingly provided with a longer observational period i e a larger t the prediction accuracy of the hyperbolic approach can be effectively improved as illustrated in table 4 δ n declines from 31 1 to 14 9 and then 8 2 as t increases from t 110 190 and 500 days a similar conclusion can be drawn from the experimental counterparts i e δ e for the intermediate consolidation condition asaoka s method can also be continually relied on as shown in table 3 its prediction accuracy are apparently improved when moving from the short term into the intermediate term nonetheless by comparing table 3 with 4 it is clear that the hyperbolic approach outperforms the asaoka s method within the intermediate term for instance for t 190 days δ n of asaoka s method is 26 8 whereas its equivalence of hyperbolic approach is only 14 9 in other words the hyperbolic approach is preferable for the intermediate term consolidation condition 5 3 long term consolidation condition whilst the hyperbolic approach has been shown to produce satisfactory prediction results for the intermediate term consolidation condition its settlement prediction s cannot converge to s in the long term consolidation condition as detailed in table 4 the prediction error of the hyperbolic approach seems to plateau when t increases from 770 to 1440 days δ n and δ e stabilizing around 10 11 and 13 14 respectively in other words once the observational period is sufficiently long the prediction accuracy of the hyperbolic approach does not further benefit from the increase in time the reason why s from the hyperbolic approach cannot approach s asymptotically is at least partially because that the linear best fit of hyperbolic plot has to go through the entire data set the deviation from the linear trend at the early stages shortly after t 0 as previously noted in fig 10 may obstruct s to converge towards s in the long term although this can be remedied by reinitializing the hyperbolic plot with a larger t 0 for the long term consolidation condition it may generate another problem how to choose an appropriate t 0 t 0 may differ from one case to another the uncertainty and difficulty involved in the selection of t 0 may then hinder its practical application given the prediction error is not very substantial δ n of 10 11 and δ e of 13 14 it may be more advisable to keep t 0 pegged at the time corresponding to u s 40 even when the hyperbolic approach is practiced in the long term consolidation condition asaoka s method on the other hand does not suffer from the foregoing limitation it is clear from table 3 that s from asaoka s method can approach s asymptomatically this may be attributed to that s i vs s i 1 plot of asaoka s method follows a linear trend line right at the beginning as previous noted in fig 9 with the increase in the observational period the prediction error becomes increasingly small and then negligible besides for the long term consolidation condition asaoka s method is advantageous over hyperbolic approach in terms of prediction accuracy take t 1000 days as an example δ n of asaoka s method is only 5 82 whereas its equivalence of the hyperbolic approach is 11 0 in fact the prediction accuracy of asaoka s method surpasses the hyperbolic approach only after t exceeds t 2 this explains why t 2 is selected as the boundary of the third stage hence from the viewpoints of both prediction stability and accuracy the asaoka s method is more recommended for the long term consolidation condition 6 parametric investigation whilst the workability and suitability of the asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement of spudcan have been testified through section 5 their prediction accuracies have yet to be evaluated under more general conditions for spudcan with different geometrical embedment and loading conditions and soil of various properties the purpose of this section is to describe how these factors influence the prediction performance through a comprehensive numerical parametric investigation and more importantly to establish the upper and lower limits of their prediction errors in general as tabulated in table 5 there are six groups of numerical calculations which are designed to explore the influence of spudcan diameter d loading ratio μ embedment depth d e and soil s mcc parameters κ λ and m in each group there is only one parameter chosen and thus varied while the other parameters remain at the base reference values i e those used in section 5 care is taken to ensure the variation range of the parameter can broadly encompass those commonly encountered in offshore practices the details of these numerical calculations are virtually the identical to those described in section 3 and hence not repeated herein upon the completion of numerical computations analyses results s t are extracted and processed to produce s in the same way as earlier described it is similarly found that asaoka s method is more advantageous for the short and long term consolidation conditions i e t t 1 and t t 2 while the hyperbolic approach is superior for the intermediate term consolidation condition i e t 1 t t 2 by comparing s with s their prediction errors δ are then obtained and plotted in fig 11 there are a few observations which can be made from this graph firstly the prediction accuracy apparently improves as the dimensionless time t gets larger in other words with a longer observational period and thus more monitoring data taken from the field the settlement prediction can be undertaken with more confidence secondly it appears that all factors in question are relevant to the prediction accuracy and there is no such a factor as the most critical factor thirdly the prediction error does not vary much significantly when these parameters are adjusted within the aforementioned range with all calculation results constituting a relatively narrow band the upper and lower bounds of this band are indicated by two nearly parallel dash lines in the graph that is to say although the prediction performance differs for one case to another their associated errors are bracketed by the upper and lower limits this will be helpful for engineers who are intent to apply the asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach to predict the ultimate settlement of spudcan since it give them an idea of the prediction accuracy or a first order estimation of prediction error 7 example and verification up to this point recommendations of suitable prediction methods i e asaoka s method for short and long term conditions hyperbolic approach for the intermediate term condition and their associated prediction errors see fig 11 haven been explicitly given above to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of these research outcomes a demonstrative example is further provided in this section which takes advantage of consolidation settlement data reported in the literature bienen and cassidy 2013 performed a well controlled centrifuge experiment at an acceleration level of 200 g at the university of western australia using normally consolidated australian kaolin clay with properties detailed in table 6 the centrifuge experiment was undertaken mainly to investigate the consolidation induced strength build up of soil underneath spudcan where the spudcan consolidation settlement was continuously tracked thus providing the full record of settlement development history for as long as 20 years see fig 12 for settlement prediction exercises three different time points t 30 150 790 days are selected from the time history curve of settlement development with eq 1 it can be readily figured out that their corresponding dimensionless time t are approximately 0 022 0 108 0 585 respectively by referring to fig 1 it can then be figured out they belong to short intermediate and long term consolidation conditions respectively following the recommendation given above asaoka s method is selected for t 0 022 0 585 whereas the hyperbolic approach is chosen for t 0 108 prediction exercises are then practiced for them with settlement prediction results s summarized in table 7 with the benefit of hindsight it is clear that s is consistently lower than the actual measurement s shown in table 7 as expected the estimated prediction error δ which is checked from fig 11 is appended besides s indicating the anticipated the error range of prediction excise on the other hand the actual prediction error δ is attached to the right of s in the same table clearly δ is well within the anticipated error range of δ see table 7 and enclosed by the lower and upper bounds see fig 11 8 comments conclusions as jack up rigs are increasingly utilized as production units the spudcan consolidation settlement occurring in a long operational period is becoming an issue of more partial concern and scholarly interest in one recent publication the authors developed the appropriate forms of dimensionless time t and normalized settlement u s which can unify settlement time histories of spudcan with various soil loading embedment and geometrical conditions nonetheless without a prior knowledge of the ultimate settlement application of the developed unique u s t relation is restricted as a follow up to the foregoing work the present research is undertaken to investigate how to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement with accuracy as the inherent uncertainties involved in analytical solutions of the consolidation equations attentions are herein placed on observational methods through the combination of centrifuge experiment and ldfe calculation the excess pore pressure dissipation and settlement development characteristics are first elucidated where inherent correlation between them are identified with the measured and calculated settlement data the prediction exercises are then undertaken to explore the applicability and exploit the advantage of the asaoka s method and hyperbolic approach it is concluded that the asaoka s method is suited to predicting the ultimate settlement when monitoring data are collated from short and long term consolidation condition the hyperbolic approach on the other hand is ideal if observational measurements are from the intermediate term consolidation term their associated prediction errors are found to decline with the increasing length of observational period particular efforts are made to establish the upper and lower bounds of prediction errors through comprehensive numerical parametric investigation explicit recommendations of appropriate prediction approaches for different consolidation conditions as well as estimation of their associated prediction errors are provided these research outcomes are likely of help for practicing engineers to predict the ultimate consolidation settlement with accuracy if further combining them with previous research findings i e the unique u s t relation fig 1 one can then have a complete view of consolidation settlement development i e the s t t curve two additional things should be clarified first the preceding findings are obtained mainly from numerical analyses where secondary compression is not accounted for nonetheless this is not expected to significantly weaken the research outcomes since the secondary compression typically comprises only less than 10 of the primary compression berre and iversen 1972 moreover when applied in practice the observational methods which are based on field observations can intrinsically include the secondary compression second whilst the present research outcomes have been testified by centrifuge experimental results from more than one source additional verification with field measurements may still be required in the future credit authorship contribution statement jiang tao yi conceptualization methodology writing review editing fei liu data curation software investigation

20386,the equilibrium stage of the scour caused by the wave effect around the marine piles was investigated experimentally for both slender and large piles unlike the experimental studies in the literature some of the experiments were carried out under clear water scour condition since the coarse bed material was used in the present study while the effective parameter on scour for slender piles is only the keulegan carpenter number it is understood that the diffraction parameter is also effective for large piles it has been determined that when the steady streaming structure around a large pile is effective the scour increases with the increase in the keulegan carpenter number and the diffraction parameter for the estimation of the relative equilibrium scour depth around the slender piles the results were evaluated together with the previous experimental study results and a new empirical equations based on the keulegan carpenter number kc 4 was proposed a new empirical correlation is derived which includes the keulegan carpenter number and the diffraction parameter 10 3 d l 3 10 1 for both slender and large piles in addition alternatively a new equation is proposed using the modified ursell parameter u rp 105 the nominal limit of the relative scour depth according to the diffraction parameter was determined as 0 0082 d l 1 keywords wave effect slender and large piles coarser bed material diffraction effect equilibrium scour depth nominal limit of the wave scour 1 introduction marine piles have been used in coastal structures for a long time such piles forming the pier and dock foundations are described as slender piles today offshore wind turbine design and applications are becoming widespread due to the developing technology and the demand for renewable energy offshore wind turbine foundations which are preferred as monopile foundation especially up to 30 m depth are often described as large piles in the case of large piles besides other parameters the diffraction effect is also effective in the flow and scour process when a slender or large pile is located on an erodible seabed scour can take place around the structure due to current wave or both of them marine piles owe their bearing capacity to the friction of lateral surfaces with bed material so it is crucial to predict the depth of scour that occurs around the pile the development of the scour process can be evaluated in two parts the first one is the scour developing period and second is the oscillations around an equilibrium stage the equilibrium stage of scour around a pile due to currents has been widely investigated by the researchers in conjunction with the scour around bridge piers and abutments sumer and fredsoe 2002 on the other hand studies under the wave effect are fewer than those in the steady current condition it is possible to classify these studies in four different categories these are experimental studies with standalone piles as in the presented study experimental studies with differently located pile groups numerical modeling studies and especially in recent years methods such as artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm techniques that were utilized in the prediction of experimental results the studies of wave induced scour around standalone piles and the advanced estimation method studies using the results of these studies as data are examined among the studies carried out with standalone piles in eadie and herbich 1986 the scour around a single pile under the effect of the combination of random wave and current was experimentally investigated 0 1 mm diameter bed material was used in the experiments sumer et al 1992 conducted single pile scour experiments in both narrow and wide wave channels for the bed material with a median grain size of 0 18 mm at the end of the study a relation giving the relative equilibrium scour depth based on the keulegan carpenter number for slender piles is proposed in sumer et al 1993 the cases of wave induced scour around circular and different cross section piles were analyzed experimentally in a comparative manner the studies of sumer and fredsoe 1997 and sumer and fredsoe 2001 are pioneering studies performed with large piles in these studies firstly flow visualization studies were carried out on the fixed bottom and the steady streaming structure around the large piles in small keulegan carpenter numbers was tried to be exposed subsequently scour experiments with 0 2 mm diameter sediment were carried out in carreiras et al 2000 study wave induced scour was investigated for both standalone piles and pile groups in the case of 0 27 mm diameter bed material in the study of faraci et al 2000 the flow structure around the stationary bottom was visualized first by using the hydrogen bubbles technique and then scour experiments were carried out the bed material with a median grain size of 0 54 mm was used in the experiments in prepernau et al 2008 study scour around slender piles under irregular wave effect was experimentally investigated with the help of a large scale physical model in dey et al 2006 study the first single pile scour depths were measured for several different situations in case of 0 2 mm diameter sediment and then the experiments were repeated using two different protection methods in sumer et al 2007 scour around standalone piles was experimentally studied using 0 147 mm diameter sand and 0 06 mm diameter silt bed materials separately in dey et al 2011 study the experimental studies were carried out for the case of very fine grained bed material of a mixture of sand clay in mostafa and agamy 2011 scour around single piles and pile groups was investigated for the combined effect of wave and current by using 0 5 mm diameter bed material in a relatively narrow wave channel in the study of umeda 2011 as a result of the experiments using standalone piles and 0 28 mm diameter sediment a classification of scour based on effecting mechanisms was developed in wengang and fuping 2014 study the scour around a single pile was experimentally investigated by using 0 38 diameter bed material and by creating wave plus current on the same direction and opposite to in sendong et al 2015 study the scour around the standalone pile as a result of the wave effect was investigated scour countermeasure was tested with five different methods and the scour depth reduction rates were given as percentages in the study of xu et al 2019 the bottom scour of piled breakwaters with pile group characteristics was experimentally investigated with the solitary wave tsunami simulation studies using the results of the researches listed above and using different techniques to estimate the relative equilibrium scour depth are relatively more recent in the studies of myrhaug and rue 2003 and myrhaug et al 2009 using the stationary gaussian narrow band random process technique the relative equilibrium scour depth was estimated around both the submarine pipes and the single pile in the study of ayoubloo et al 2010 data mining approach was used to estimate the scour around circular piles for regular wave condition model tree approach was tried in etemad shahisi and ghaemi 2011 to estimate the depth of scour for the wave condition affecting the pile groups in the study of zanke et al 2011 new empirical relations were derived by using the results of previous experimental studies for current and wave conditions a similar study was presented in guven et al 2012 and the gene expression programming technique was used for the estimation of scour values in this study myrhaug and ong 2013 and ong et al 2013 used the stationary gaussian narrow band random process technique to estimate the relative equilibrium scour depth for large piles and slender piles in long crested and short crested random wave conditions webb and matthews 2014 study brings together the previous experimental studies for both large piles and slender piles and proposes a new equation for relative equilibrium scour depth estimation in the homaei and najafzadeh 2020 study scour estimation studies were carried out using the reliability based probabilistic evaluation technique when the existing studies investigating the wave induced scour around the piles are examined it is seen that all of these studies are carried out in live base scour conditions depending on the bed material used furthermore most of these studies were conducted with slender piles the number of studies performed with large piles is extremely limited and therefore this number is not sufficient for parameter estimation in this study the equilibrium scour depth around both slender and large piles was examined experimentally due to the relatively coarse bed material used in the experiments it was ensured that the experiments were carried out under the conditions of clear water scour as well as the live bed in case of large piles the data obtained for the relative equilibrium scour depths increased the number of data in the available literature this enabled the effect of different diffraction parameters to be taken into account the data obtained within the scope of the presented study were evaluated together with the data of sumer et al 1992 and sumer and fredsoe 2001 and derived three new formulas for relative equilibrium scour depth while the first is suitable for slender piles the second and third can be used for both slender and large piles the first formula is based on the keulegan carpenter kc number the second is the modified ursell parameter u rp the third is the kc number and the diffraction parameter respectively 1 1 flow and scour mechanism around marine piles formation of the disturbed flow structure around piles and the developing vortex systems are shown in fig 1 in detail flow structures are periodically displaced depending on the wave crest and wave trough passing over the pile in addition to the flow structure shown in fig 1 for slender piles the diffraction and reflection effects that occur in the case of large piles are also important fig 2 in some sources it is stated that the d l ratio d pile diameter l incident wave length which is called the diffraction parameter must be greater than 0 1 in order to classify piles on a large scale however in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2001 it was seen that piles with a d l ratio greater than 0 06 are also considered large piles in case of waves the relative equilibrium scour depth s d around vertical slender piles can be computed by eq 1 given in the study of sumer et al 1992 1 s d 1 3 1 e 0 03 k c 6 k c 6 where s is the equilibrium scour depth and d is the pile diameter the keulegan carpenter number can be defined as the ratio of the length of the area of the moving fluid particles to the pile diameter and can be expressed by eq 2 2 k c u m t w d where u m is the maximum value of the orbital velocity of fluid particles and t w is the wave period the reason why eq 1 suggested in the study of sumer et al 1992 is valid for the values of the kc number greater than 6 is explained as that the horseshoe vortices around the pile are seen only after this value is exceeded in some other studies in the literature it is stated that horseshoe vortices occur in values less than 6 of the kc number in addition in case of kc 6 where horseshoe vortices are small it is understood that the effect of lee wake vortices on the scour continues in case of wave scour around marine piles penetrated on an erodible sea bed additional non dimensional parameter should be taken into account as shields parameter θ which is used to determine the initiation of the movement of the bed material and can be calculated by eq 3 3 θ u f m 2 g s 1 d 50 where g is the acceleration due to gravity s specific gravity of the sediment and d 50 is the median grain size of bed material the critical value of the shields parameter θ c r is a function of the grain reynolds number re d u f m d 50 ν where ν represents kinematic viscosity when θ θ c r no sediment motion takes place far from the pile and called as clear water scour however in case of θ θ c r the sediment motion occurs over the entire bed and called as live bed scour sumer and fredsoe 2002 the maximum value of the bed friction velocity u f m can be calculated by eq 4 4 u f m f w 2 u m in the study of fredsoe and deigaard 1992 friction coefficient of wave boundary layer flow f w was described as the function of a k b and can be calculated by eq 5 5 f w 0 04 a k b 1 4 a k b 50 f w 0 40 a k b 3 4 a k b 50 where a indicates the amplitude of horizontal component of orbital motion of fluid particle and k b is the bed roughness height and can be taken into account as 2 5 d 50 suggested in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2002 sumer and fredsoe 2001 study is one of the few studies performed for large piles in this study not only the scour mechanism for large piles but also the steady streaming that develops around the piles was investigated in detail in the study 3d steady streaming development around the piles was observed with flow visualization experiments the steady streaming can be seen at velocities nearly up to 20 25 of the maximum undisturbed near bed orbital velocity as shown in sarpkaya 1986 study in values where the kc number is less than 1 1 there is no boundary layer separation around the cylindrical piles and no vortex development is observed especially when the kc number is higher than 1 6 vortex development begins but vortex shedding mechanism starts from kc 7 however asymmetric vortex formation is observed in the wake region within the values of kc between 4 and 7 and this situation disrupts the flow structure and provides the scour development 1 2 experimental set up and equipment in the present study the wave channel in the hydraulics laboratory of the dokuz eylul university was employed to perform wave scour experiments as shown in fig 3 the wave channel has 1 2 m depth 3 6 m width and 33 m length a plunger type wave generator was located on the offshore side of the wave channel the generator allows regular wave generation in different amplitudes and periods an absorber was designed to prevent wave reflection on the onshore side of the channel the test pile was placed in the sand pit at a distance of 26 5 m from the offshore side of the channel as detailed in fig 3 the sand pit was 17 cm deep and was filled with sand at the beginning of the experiment so that the rigid bed of the channel and the sand surface were at the same level after each experiment the sand surface was smoothed and made equal with the channel bottom without any compression details of the measuring equipment installed around the test pile are given in fig 4 time dependent water level changes at two different points were recorded with the help of the uls device and the uss20130 sensors working connected to it wave heights and periods were obtained from these records wavelengths were determined by evaluating the time dependent water level records of two uss20130 sensors with a distance of 4 5 m between them time dependent water particle velocities at the undisturbed bottom level and time dependent scour depths around the pile were measured simultaneously using a uvp device and two 4 mhz sensors connected to it although the main purpose of uvp device and sensors is the derivation of velocity profile it can also be used to measure time dependent scour and deposition details of this method can be found in guney et al 2013 dogan and arisoy 2015 and dogan et al 2018 successfully measured the wave induced scour under submerged pipes laying on an erodible bed with uvp device and 4 mhz sensors in their studies since they are very small cylindrical devices with only 8 mm diameter and 40 mm length the effects of the 4 mhz uvp sensors used on the flow field are negligible some photos from the experiments are shown in fig 5 in large pile experiments ultralab uws miniature echo sounder device and its sensor were used to measure the scour and deposition depths around the pile after the experiment to determine the bottom bathymetry as with uvp and uls this device works with the principle of high frequency sound waves and determines the vertical distances between the sensor tip and the sand surface at the desired point in the test zone in the experiments uniform sand with two different median grain sizes was used to represent the seabed material when the sieve analysis results given in fig 6 are examined the median grain size of the finer material was d 50 0 55 mm and the median grain size of the coarser material was d 50 1 85 mm with geometric standard deviations of σ g d 84 d 16 1 8 and relative specific weight of 2 65 in the experiments cylindrical piles of different diameters were used and the piles were fixed to the concrete bottom under the sand pit fig 5 piles with diameters of d 63 90 110 120 160 200 480 680 and 950 mm were used in the experiments due to the wide range of pile diameters experiments with both slender piles d l 0 04 and large piles d l 0 04 conditions could be carried out the value of 0 04 which is specified as the transition value of the diffraction parameter was determined at the end of the experiments performed as can be seen from the tables given below in the experiments with a d l ratio greater than 0 04 the keulegan carpenter number is less than 4 and there is no vortex evolution and shedding around the pile this means that steady streaming is effective in scour mechanism and piles will now be defined as large piles in all experiments the water depth at still water level was h 55 cm since the motor of the plunger type wave generator is equipped with a speed control device the height and periods of the waves to be produced can be precisely adjusted experimental studies within the scope of the presented study were carried out with eight different wave characteristics the height h and period t w of these waves are respectively 6 cm 5 4 s 9 cm 4 3 s 13 cm 3 6 s 17 cm 3 1 s 20 cm 2 7 s 22 cm 2 3 s 25 cm 2 0 s and 28 cm 1 7 s since the undisturbed orbital velocity of water particles at the bed were measured in the experiments direct measurement results were used for the u m value used in the calculation of the non dimensional parameters given in the previous section table 1 summarizes the characteristic information in the experiments performed examples of two different time dependent scour depth graphs measured in the experiments performed are presented in fig 7 using the time dependent scour depths obtained from the uvp device the time scale parameter and the equilibrium scour depth can be obtained as shown on the graph the duration of each experiment is 60 min thus for high waves with periods of 2 7 3 1 and 3 6 s minimum 1000 individual waves were formed during the experiments in the case of waves with a period of 4 3 and 5 4 s the wave heights were smaller than the others and there were a minimum of 667 individual waves in the experiments the time taken for the scour to reach equilibrium stage namely the time scale was different for each experiment it was observed that the time scale parameter varied between 220 s and 1960 s in the experiments so it is clear that the test duration which was decided in accordance with the studies of sumer et al 1992 sumer et al 1993 sumer and fredsoe 2001 and dey et al 2006 is sufficient to observe the equilibrium stage of scour for all experiments 1 3 slender pile results in table 2 effective non dimensional parameters on the wave scour process around slender piles are given as it is seen from the table the experiments were conducted both in live bed and clear water scour regimes the diffraction parameter varies between 0 0050 and 0 0381 since the obtained diffraction parameter is less than 0 04 it is understood that all experiments were carried out under slender pile conditions one of the non dimensional parameters given in the table is the modified ursell parameter indicated by u rp the modified ursell parameter which can be determined by eq 6 is equal to the product of the ursell number u r and the parameter h d 2 6 u r p u r h d 2 h l 2 h 3 h 2 d 2 h 3 l 2 h 3 d 2 the variation of the relative equilibrium scour depths obtained from the experiments conducted under slender pile conditions versus kc number are plotted in fig 8 data are presented by grouping for different d l ratios and median grain sizes of bed material when the graph is examined it is seen that s d is dependent on the kc number similar dependence is not clear for the diffraction parameter this state will be discussed in the following part of the study a similar graph was obtained by plotting relative equilibrium scour depths versus the modified ursell parameter the data given in fig 9 were grouped for different d l ratios and median grain sizes of bed material since the modified ursell parameter contains both wave characteristics and pile geometry parameters it is a candidate to reflect the kc and d l dependence evaluated in the previous step due to the physical definition and mathematical expression of the modified ursell parameter s d results are spread over a very wide u rp range fig 9 u rp is considered to be a good alternative non dimensional variable especially in large pile situations where the diffraction parameter becomes effective and when slender piles are evaluated together with large piles 1 4 large pile results in table 3 the effective non dimensional parameters on the wave induced scour process around large piles d l 0 04 are given as can be seen from the table only one of the eleven experiments given was carried out under clear water scour conditions and all the others were carried out under the conditions of live bed scour the diffraction parameter varies between 0 0457 and 0 1619 thus it is understood that all 11 experiments given were carried out with large test piles as explained above in the case of slender piles the kc number is effective in the scour mechanism around the pile in the case of large piles the diffraction parameter is also effective besides kc in large pile tests the bottom bathymetry around the pile was determined after the experiments two different samples of bed form from the experiments were given in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively bathymetry graphs clearly show the bed formation occurred around the pile after the experiment fig 12 depicts the relative equilibrium scour depths obtained from the experiments performed in the case of large piles versus the kc numbers as can be seen from the graph the data are grouped for different value ranges of the diffraction parameter when the data between 0 04 d l 0 07 and 0 07 d l 0 17 are examined it is seen that the relationship between s d and kc is quite different for the two groups this finding reveals that the diffraction parameter together with the kc number is effective on the relative scour depths in the case of large piles d l 0 04 relative equilibrium scour depth plot based on modified ursell parameter is shown in fig 13 to set forth both kc and d l impact fig 13 in this figure similar to fig 12 the data are grouped for different d l intervals however when the graphics are compared in the drawing based on the modified ursell number there is no separation due to different d l ratios as in fig 12 and a visible relationship between s d and u rp is detected the reason for this situation can be explained by the fact that the modified ursell number contains the diffraction parameter at this stage it was planned to evaluate the obtained large pile data together with the data from sumer and fredsoe 2001 first data were grouped for different ranges of the d l ratio in order to see the variation easily the s d kc plot was divided into three small plots for the large pile case fig 14 combining the findings obtained within the scope of the study presented for large piles and the results of the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study the s d graphs depending on the d l ratio for different kc numbers were created fig 15 when the graph given in fig 15 is examined it is observed that s d increases depending on the number of kc regardless of the d l parameter however for large piles it is understood that as the kc number decreases the effect of the diffraction parameter on the relative scour depth decreases the result obtained confirms the explanation made with the data of a small number of large piles in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2001 the steady streaming effect grows with both the increase of the kc number and the diffraction effect the d l ratio as stated in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2001 consequently for the same d l ratio it can be said that relative scour depth increases with increasing the kc number similar behavior was observed in the increase in the d l ratio in the same kc numbers 2 results and discussion instead of evaluating the obtained findings alone it was more appropriate to evaluate them together with the experimental findings extracted from the qualified studies undertaken for this purpose with the experimental findings in the study presented for the relative equilibrium scour depth parameter and the findings obtained in the studies of sumer et al 1992 and sumer and fredsoe 2001 were evaluated together fig 16 displays the variation of the equilibrium scour depths depending on the kc numbers in the figure legend the different conditions of all the studies considered are shown with different symbols it can be seen from fig 16 that slender piles and large piles behave differently depending on the keulegan carpenter number in case of large piles it is clear that the results were separated into three different d l ratios when the results of the study presented for slender piles are evaluated together with the results of sumer et al 1992 the relative equilibrium scour depth is defined by 7 s d 1 3 1 e 0 022 k c 4 k c 4 although it is quite similar to eq 1 given in sumer et al 1992 the regression constants in eq 7 are different the proposed equation is valid for 4 and greater values of the kc number in case of kc 4 a pair of asymmetric vortices is formed in rear side of the pile and the following vortex shedding together plays an effective role in the scour mechanism williamson 1985 sumer and fredsoe 2006 the bed material used in the study of sumer et al 1992 was very fine sand with median grain sizes of 0 18 mm and 0 58 mm the use of medium sized sand with median grain size of 0 55 mm and 1 85 mm will provide new results to the literature as a result of working with the relatively coarser bed material the s d values in the presented study in the case of the same kc numbers are somewhat lower than the results of the sumer et al 1992 study the experimental s d values and the s d values obtained according to the empirical relation eq 7 are plotted in fig 17 the figure covers the 25 and 50 error bounds the correlation coefficient and the scattering index values the correlation coefficient and scattering index values obtained show that the regression model proposed are quite suitable the behavior of slender piles and large piles differ greatly in the relative scour depth depending on the kc number fig 16 in the case of slender piles the scour mechanism is dominated by the vortices developing in rear side and vortex shedding which starts as a result of the separation of the boundary layer from the pile surface and the transformation into a shear layer while in the case of a large pile the steady streaming structure created by the reflected and diffracted waves around the pile are effective in other words the diffraction effect comes to the fore in the case of large piles although the kc number contains information about wave properties and pile geometry it is not sufficient to describe the diffraction effect in order to create a single regression equation in the estimation of relative scour depth for both slender and large piles in addition to the kc number a second independent variable was added to the equation of course this independent variable is the non dimensional diffraction parameter the graph fig 18 shows the plotted data including both the slender pile and the large pile results in the presented study the slender pile results in the sumer et al 1992 study and the large pile results in the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study the results obtained from all studies were grouped for different kc numbers and plotted as relative scour depths depending on the diffraction parameter since the diffraction parameter in addition to the kc number in the relative scour depth estimation was taken into the regression expression as an independent variable instead of a single curve a family of curves for constant kc numbers are now shown on the s d d l graph using the presented study data sumer et al 1992 study data and sumer and fredsoe 2001 study data the following empirical expression was derived for both slender piles and large piles 8 s d 0 0037 k c 2 3 d l experimental s d data versus predicted s d values by eq 8 are plotted in fig 19 in this scattering diagram there are the 25 and 50 error bounds the correlation coefficient and the scatter index values as in fig 17 the correlation coefficient and the scattering index values show that the proposed regression model is suitable as in the regression model given by eq 7 as an alternative to using the kc number and the diffraction parameter pair in prediction of the relative scour depth the use of the modified ursell parameter was also evaluated similar to the use of kc number by the use of the modified ursell parameter wave properties and pile geometry and also the diffraction effect can be taken into account the modified ursell parameter versus the relative scour depths are plotted in fig 20 the data in the presented study the data of the sumer et al 1992 study and the results of the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study were used together as in fig 18 see fig 21 from fig 20 it is understood that the results of slender piles and large piles are almost scattered on the same line that is with a single empirical expression the relative scour depth for both slender and large piles can be expressed for this purpose eq 9 was derived by considering all the experimental results in the presented study the slender pile results in the study of sumer et al 1992 and the large pile results in the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study 9 s d 0 75 1 e 0 015 u r p 0 6 u r p 10 5 in fig the experimental s d data versus predicted s d values by eq 9 are plotted statistical parameters point out that the estimation based on the modified ursell parameter is also suitable and gives reliable results like the previous ones when the relative scour depth values depending on the diffraction parameter fig 18 are plotted with non logarithmic scales in both axes the graph given below is obtained fig 22 when the graph is examined it is seen that the data are clustered asymptotically in both directions the bi directional asymptotic distribution is seen as s d 0 for d l and s d for d l 0 in the analysis performed with a total of 179 data including the data of this study in which the number of kc varies between 0 3 and 102 and the d l ratio varies between 0 0019 and 0 27 the nominal boundary was defined to observe the wave induced scour around the pile depending on the d l ratio eq 10 defines the relation showing the nominal scour limit depending on the diffraction parameter to observe the scour under the wave effect whether it is a slender or a large pile 10 s d max 0 0082 d l when the data obtained from all three studies were plotted as kc numbers depending on the diffraction parameter the following graph given in fig 23 was obtained in this graph the similar asymptotic distribution was detected as in the graph presented in fig 22 the bi directional asymptotic distribution was seen as kc 0 for d l and kc for d l 0 the limit value here is 0 44 d l which is the maximum value of kc number for ⅐ tanh kh which is the maximum theoretical limit of wave steepness here k is the wave number with a value of 2π l 3 conclusions in the presented study wave induced scour formed around both slender and large marine piles were experimentally investigated within the scope of the presented study unique experiments were carried out under different wave conditions and by using test piles of different diameters between 63 and 950 mm bed material of two different sizes as 0 55 mm and 1 85 mm the surface of the test piles was considered smooth for dimensionless parameters the keulegan carpenter number in the experiments ranged from 0 99 to 16 19 the diffraction parameter from 0 005 to 0 162 the shields parameter from 0 0128 to 0 1117 and finally the modified ursell parameter from 0 94 to 436 14 considering the previous study results in which the findings were evaluated together these ranges are widening even more the results according to the findings obtained within the scope of the study are summarized below under the headings of a conclusions on large piles it was clearly determined that the relative scour depth s d values behave differently beyond the dependence on the kc number this indicates that in addition to the kc number the diffraction parameter d l is also important for the relative scour depth in case of large piles the increase of s d was determined due to the increase in the kc number for the same d l values on the other hand as the kc number gets smaller it has been observed that the effect of d l ratio on the change of s d decreases this situation shows that parallel to the findings in the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study the steady streaming effect grows with both the increase in the kc number and the d l ratio it is clear that in large piles the relative equilibrium scour depth does not exceed s d max 0 1 regardless of the kc number and d l ratio b results regarding slender piles the relative scour depths in the slender piles vary in direct proportion to both the kc number and the modified ursell parameter a new empirical expression was proposed for the estimation of relative scour depth for slender piles as s d 1 3 1 e 0 022 k c 4 k c 4 this empirical expression obtained slightly differs from the relation proposed as a result of sumer et al 1992 study and it was generated with much more experimental data with the proposed new expression the results of the relatively coarse bed material were also taken into consideration as can be seen from the new empirical equation given above for slender piles the relative equilibrium scour depth does not exceed 1 3 of its maximum value and the minimum value is s d min 0 3 for kc 4 in other words the minimum value of the relative equilibrium scour depth that occurs as a result of the vortex mechanism becoming effective on scour is 0 3 c overall results for all slender and large piles since in case of large piles in addition to the kc number another non dimensional parameter must be considered as diffraction parameter new empirical expression was obtained by adding the d l ratio as a second independent variable for the estimation of s d as s d 0 0037 k c 2 3 d l this proposed empirical expression takes into account the wave properties and pile geometry via kc number and the diffraction effect by the d l ratio thus it can be valid for both slender and large piles to estimate the relative scour depths another empirical expression based on the modified ursell parameter that mathematically contains the kc number and the d l ratio as an alternative to the above equation was proposed as s d 0 75 1 e 0 015 u r p 0 6 u r p 10 5 thus with the help of these two equations the estimation of s d can be performed with the help of a single equation without considering pile diameter in the presented empirical expressions the validity range of the kc number is 0 102 and the validity range of urp is 0 100000 d limits obtained in case of wave induced scour the nominal limit value of relative scour depth depending on diffraction parameter can be determined by the expression as s d max 0 0082 d l the observed bi directional asymptotic distribution was seen as s d 0 for d l and s d for d l 0 on the other hand when the maximum value of kc number 0 44 d l for ⅐ tanh kh which is the maximum limit of the wave steepness is drawn on the kc d l graph a boundary is formed by separating the breaking and non breaking waves conducting more experiments in the transient zone with the range of keulegan carpenter number 2 to 6 will be an important step for future studies also measurement of the steady streaming around large piles especially for the case of kc 1 would be a correct step in determining the flow and scour

20386,the equilibrium stage of the scour caused by the wave effect around the marine piles was investigated experimentally for both slender and large piles unlike the experimental studies in the literature some of the experiments were carried out under clear water scour condition since the coarse bed material was used in the present study while the effective parameter on scour for slender piles is only the keulegan carpenter number it is understood that the diffraction parameter is also effective for large piles it has been determined that when the steady streaming structure around a large pile is effective the scour increases with the increase in the keulegan carpenter number and the diffraction parameter for the estimation of the relative equilibrium scour depth around the slender piles the results were evaluated together with the previous experimental study results and a new empirical equations based on the keulegan carpenter number kc 4 was proposed a new empirical correlation is derived which includes the keulegan carpenter number and the diffraction parameter 10 3 d l 3 10 1 for both slender and large piles in addition alternatively a new equation is proposed using the modified ursell parameter u rp 105 the nominal limit of the relative scour depth according to the diffraction parameter was determined as 0 0082 d l 1 keywords wave effect slender and large piles coarser bed material diffraction effect equilibrium scour depth nominal limit of the wave scour 1 introduction marine piles have been used in coastal structures for a long time such piles forming the pier and dock foundations are described as slender piles today offshore wind turbine design and applications are becoming widespread due to the developing technology and the demand for renewable energy offshore wind turbine foundations which are preferred as monopile foundation especially up to 30 m depth are often described as large piles in the case of large piles besides other parameters the diffraction effect is also effective in the flow and scour process when a slender or large pile is located on an erodible seabed scour can take place around the structure due to current wave or both of them marine piles owe their bearing capacity to the friction of lateral surfaces with bed material so it is crucial to predict the depth of scour that occurs around the pile the development of the scour process can be evaluated in two parts the first one is the scour developing period and second is the oscillations around an equilibrium stage the equilibrium stage of scour around a pile due to currents has been widely investigated by the researchers in conjunction with the scour around bridge piers and abutments sumer and fredsoe 2002 on the other hand studies under the wave effect are fewer than those in the steady current condition it is possible to classify these studies in four different categories these are experimental studies with standalone piles as in the presented study experimental studies with differently located pile groups numerical modeling studies and especially in recent years methods such as artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm techniques that were utilized in the prediction of experimental results the studies of wave induced scour around standalone piles and the advanced estimation method studies using the results of these studies as data are examined among the studies carried out with standalone piles in eadie and herbich 1986 the scour around a single pile under the effect of the combination of random wave and current was experimentally investigated 0 1 mm diameter bed material was used in the experiments sumer et al 1992 conducted single pile scour experiments in both narrow and wide wave channels for the bed material with a median grain size of 0 18 mm at the end of the study a relation giving the relative equilibrium scour depth based on the keulegan carpenter number for slender piles is proposed in sumer et al 1993 the cases of wave induced scour around circular and different cross section piles were analyzed experimentally in a comparative manner the studies of sumer and fredsoe 1997 and sumer and fredsoe 2001 are pioneering studies performed with large piles in these studies firstly flow visualization studies were carried out on the fixed bottom and the steady streaming structure around the large piles in small keulegan carpenter numbers was tried to be exposed subsequently scour experiments with 0 2 mm diameter sediment were carried out in carreiras et al 2000 study wave induced scour was investigated for both standalone piles and pile groups in the case of 0 27 mm diameter bed material in the study of faraci et al 2000 the flow structure around the stationary bottom was visualized first by using the hydrogen bubbles technique and then scour experiments were carried out the bed material with a median grain size of 0 54 mm was used in the experiments in prepernau et al 2008 study scour around slender piles under irregular wave effect was experimentally investigated with the help of a large scale physical model in dey et al 2006 study the first single pile scour depths were measured for several different situations in case of 0 2 mm diameter sediment and then the experiments were repeated using two different protection methods in sumer et al 2007 scour around standalone piles was experimentally studied using 0 147 mm diameter sand and 0 06 mm diameter silt bed materials separately in dey et al 2011 study the experimental studies were carried out for the case of very fine grained bed material of a mixture of sand clay in mostafa and agamy 2011 scour around single piles and pile groups was investigated for the combined effect of wave and current by using 0 5 mm diameter bed material in a relatively narrow wave channel in the study of umeda 2011 as a result of the experiments using standalone piles and 0 28 mm diameter sediment a classification of scour based on effecting mechanisms was developed in wengang and fuping 2014 study the scour around a single pile was experimentally investigated by using 0 38 diameter bed material and by creating wave plus current on the same direction and opposite to in sendong et al 2015 study the scour around the standalone pile as a result of the wave effect was investigated scour countermeasure was tested with five different methods and the scour depth reduction rates were given as percentages in the study of xu et al 2019 the bottom scour of piled breakwaters with pile group characteristics was experimentally investigated with the solitary wave tsunami simulation studies using the results of the researches listed above and using different techniques to estimate the relative equilibrium scour depth are relatively more recent in the studies of myrhaug and rue 2003 and myrhaug et al 2009 using the stationary gaussian narrow band random process technique the relative equilibrium scour depth was estimated around both the submarine pipes and the single pile in the study of ayoubloo et al 2010 data mining approach was used to estimate the scour around circular piles for regular wave condition model tree approach was tried in etemad shahisi and ghaemi 2011 to estimate the depth of scour for the wave condition affecting the pile groups in the study of zanke et al 2011 new empirical relations were derived by using the results of previous experimental studies for current and wave conditions a similar study was presented in guven et al 2012 and the gene expression programming technique was used for the estimation of scour values in this study myrhaug and ong 2013 and ong et al 2013 used the stationary gaussian narrow band random process technique to estimate the relative equilibrium scour depth for large piles and slender piles in long crested and short crested random wave conditions webb and matthews 2014 study brings together the previous experimental studies for both large piles and slender piles and proposes a new equation for relative equilibrium scour depth estimation in the homaei and najafzadeh 2020 study scour estimation studies were carried out using the reliability based probabilistic evaluation technique when the existing studies investigating the wave induced scour around the piles are examined it is seen that all of these studies are carried out in live base scour conditions depending on the bed material used furthermore most of these studies were conducted with slender piles the number of studies performed with large piles is extremely limited and therefore this number is not sufficient for parameter estimation in this study the equilibrium scour depth around both slender and large piles was examined experimentally due to the relatively coarse bed material used in the experiments it was ensured that the experiments were carried out under the conditions of clear water scour as well as the live bed in case of large piles the data obtained for the relative equilibrium scour depths increased the number of data in the available literature this enabled the effect of different diffraction parameters to be taken into account the data obtained within the scope of the presented study were evaluated together with the data of sumer et al 1992 and sumer and fredsoe 2001 and derived three new formulas for relative equilibrium scour depth while the first is suitable for slender piles the second and third can be used for both slender and large piles the first formula is based on the keulegan carpenter kc number the second is the modified ursell parameter u rp the third is the kc number and the diffraction parameter respectively 1 1 flow and scour mechanism around marine piles formation of the disturbed flow structure around piles and the developing vortex systems are shown in fig 1 in detail flow structures are periodically displaced depending on the wave crest and wave trough passing over the pile in addition to the flow structure shown in fig 1 for slender piles the diffraction and reflection effects that occur in the case of large piles are also important fig 2 in some sources it is stated that the d l ratio d pile diameter l incident wave length which is called the diffraction parameter must be greater than 0 1 in order to classify piles on a large scale however in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2001 it was seen that piles with a d l ratio greater than 0 06 are also considered large piles in case of waves the relative equilibrium scour depth s d around vertical slender piles can be computed by eq 1 given in the study of sumer et al 1992 1 s d 1 3 1 e 0 03 k c 6 k c 6 where s is the equilibrium scour depth and d is the pile diameter the keulegan carpenter number can be defined as the ratio of the length of the area of the moving fluid particles to the pile diameter and can be expressed by eq 2 2 k c u m t w d where u m is the maximum value of the orbital velocity of fluid particles and t w is the wave period the reason why eq 1 suggested in the study of sumer et al 1992 is valid for the values of the kc number greater than 6 is explained as that the horseshoe vortices around the pile are seen only after this value is exceeded in some other studies in the literature it is stated that horseshoe vortices occur in values less than 6 of the kc number in addition in case of kc 6 where horseshoe vortices are small it is understood that the effect of lee wake vortices on the scour continues in case of wave scour around marine piles penetrated on an erodible sea bed additional non dimensional parameter should be taken into account as shields parameter θ which is used to determine the initiation of the movement of the bed material and can be calculated by eq 3 3 θ u f m 2 g s 1 d 50 where g is the acceleration due to gravity s specific gravity of the sediment and d 50 is the median grain size of bed material the critical value of the shields parameter θ c r is a function of the grain reynolds number re d u f m d 50 ν where ν represents kinematic viscosity when θ θ c r no sediment motion takes place far from the pile and called as clear water scour however in case of θ θ c r the sediment motion occurs over the entire bed and called as live bed scour sumer and fredsoe 2002 the maximum value of the bed friction velocity u f m can be calculated by eq 4 4 u f m f w 2 u m in the study of fredsoe and deigaard 1992 friction coefficient of wave boundary layer flow f w was described as the function of a k b and can be calculated by eq 5 5 f w 0 04 a k b 1 4 a k b 50 f w 0 40 a k b 3 4 a k b 50 where a indicates the amplitude of horizontal component of orbital motion of fluid particle and k b is the bed roughness height and can be taken into account as 2 5 d 50 suggested in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2002 sumer and fredsoe 2001 study is one of the few studies performed for large piles in this study not only the scour mechanism for large piles but also the steady streaming that develops around the piles was investigated in detail in the study 3d steady streaming development around the piles was observed with flow visualization experiments the steady streaming can be seen at velocities nearly up to 20 25 of the maximum undisturbed near bed orbital velocity as shown in sarpkaya 1986 study in values where the kc number is less than 1 1 there is no boundary layer separation around the cylindrical piles and no vortex development is observed especially when the kc number is higher than 1 6 vortex development begins but vortex shedding mechanism starts from kc 7 however asymmetric vortex formation is observed in the wake region within the values of kc between 4 and 7 and this situation disrupts the flow structure and provides the scour development 1 2 experimental set up and equipment in the present study the wave channel in the hydraulics laboratory of the dokuz eylul university was employed to perform wave scour experiments as shown in fig 3 the wave channel has 1 2 m depth 3 6 m width and 33 m length a plunger type wave generator was located on the offshore side of the wave channel the generator allows regular wave generation in different amplitudes and periods an absorber was designed to prevent wave reflection on the onshore side of the channel the test pile was placed in the sand pit at a distance of 26 5 m from the offshore side of the channel as detailed in fig 3 the sand pit was 17 cm deep and was filled with sand at the beginning of the experiment so that the rigid bed of the channel and the sand surface were at the same level after each experiment the sand surface was smoothed and made equal with the channel bottom without any compression details of the measuring equipment installed around the test pile are given in fig 4 time dependent water level changes at two different points were recorded with the help of the uls device and the uss20130 sensors working connected to it wave heights and periods were obtained from these records wavelengths were determined by evaluating the time dependent water level records of two uss20130 sensors with a distance of 4 5 m between them time dependent water particle velocities at the undisturbed bottom level and time dependent scour depths around the pile were measured simultaneously using a uvp device and two 4 mhz sensors connected to it although the main purpose of uvp device and sensors is the derivation of velocity profile it can also be used to measure time dependent scour and deposition details of this method can be found in guney et al 2013 dogan and arisoy 2015 and dogan et al 2018 successfully measured the wave induced scour under submerged pipes laying on an erodible bed with uvp device and 4 mhz sensors in their studies since they are very small cylindrical devices with only 8 mm diameter and 40 mm length the effects of the 4 mhz uvp sensors used on the flow field are negligible some photos from the experiments are shown in fig 5 in large pile experiments ultralab uws miniature echo sounder device and its sensor were used to measure the scour and deposition depths around the pile after the experiment to determine the bottom bathymetry as with uvp and uls this device works with the principle of high frequency sound waves and determines the vertical distances between the sensor tip and the sand surface at the desired point in the test zone in the experiments uniform sand with two different median grain sizes was used to represent the seabed material when the sieve analysis results given in fig 6 are examined the median grain size of the finer material was d 50 0 55 mm and the median grain size of the coarser material was d 50 1 85 mm with geometric standard deviations of σ g d 84 d 16 1 8 and relative specific weight of 2 65 in the experiments cylindrical piles of different diameters were used and the piles were fixed to the concrete bottom under the sand pit fig 5 piles with diameters of d 63 90 110 120 160 200 480 680 and 950 mm were used in the experiments due to the wide range of pile diameters experiments with both slender piles d l 0 04 and large piles d l 0 04 conditions could be carried out the value of 0 04 which is specified as the transition value of the diffraction parameter was determined at the end of the experiments performed as can be seen from the tables given below in the experiments with a d l ratio greater than 0 04 the keulegan carpenter number is less than 4 and there is no vortex evolution and shedding around the pile this means that steady streaming is effective in scour mechanism and piles will now be defined as large piles in all experiments the water depth at still water level was h 55 cm since the motor of the plunger type wave generator is equipped with a speed control device the height and periods of the waves to be produced can be precisely adjusted experimental studies within the scope of the presented study were carried out with eight different wave characteristics the height h and period t w of these waves are respectively 6 cm 5 4 s 9 cm 4 3 s 13 cm 3 6 s 17 cm 3 1 s 20 cm 2 7 s 22 cm 2 3 s 25 cm 2 0 s and 28 cm 1 7 s since the undisturbed orbital velocity of water particles at the bed were measured in the experiments direct measurement results were used for the u m value used in the calculation of the non dimensional parameters given in the previous section table 1 summarizes the characteristic information in the experiments performed examples of two different time dependent scour depth graphs measured in the experiments performed are presented in fig 7 using the time dependent scour depths obtained from the uvp device the time scale parameter and the equilibrium scour depth can be obtained as shown on the graph the duration of each experiment is 60 min thus for high waves with periods of 2 7 3 1 and 3 6 s minimum 1000 individual waves were formed during the experiments in the case of waves with a period of 4 3 and 5 4 s the wave heights were smaller than the others and there were a minimum of 667 individual waves in the experiments the time taken for the scour to reach equilibrium stage namely the time scale was different for each experiment it was observed that the time scale parameter varied between 220 s and 1960 s in the experiments so it is clear that the test duration which was decided in accordance with the studies of sumer et al 1992 sumer et al 1993 sumer and fredsoe 2001 and dey et al 2006 is sufficient to observe the equilibrium stage of scour for all experiments 1 3 slender pile results in table 2 effective non dimensional parameters on the wave scour process around slender piles are given as it is seen from the table the experiments were conducted both in live bed and clear water scour regimes the diffraction parameter varies between 0 0050 and 0 0381 since the obtained diffraction parameter is less than 0 04 it is understood that all experiments were carried out under slender pile conditions one of the non dimensional parameters given in the table is the modified ursell parameter indicated by u rp the modified ursell parameter which can be determined by eq 6 is equal to the product of the ursell number u r and the parameter h d 2 6 u r p u r h d 2 h l 2 h 3 h 2 d 2 h 3 l 2 h 3 d 2 the variation of the relative equilibrium scour depths obtained from the experiments conducted under slender pile conditions versus kc number are plotted in fig 8 data are presented by grouping for different d l ratios and median grain sizes of bed material when the graph is examined it is seen that s d is dependent on the kc number similar dependence is not clear for the diffraction parameter this state will be discussed in the following part of the study a similar graph was obtained by plotting relative equilibrium scour depths versus the modified ursell parameter the data given in fig 9 were grouped for different d l ratios and median grain sizes of bed material since the modified ursell parameter contains both wave characteristics and pile geometry parameters it is a candidate to reflect the kc and d l dependence evaluated in the previous step due to the physical definition and mathematical expression of the modified ursell parameter s d results are spread over a very wide u rp range fig 9 u rp is considered to be a good alternative non dimensional variable especially in large pile situations where the diffraction parameter becomes effective and when slender piles are evaluated together with large piles 1 4 large pile results in table 3 the effective non dimensional parameters on the wave induced scour process around large piles d l 0 04 are given as can be seen from the table only one of the eleven experiments given was carried out under clear water scour conditions and all the others were carried out under the conditions of live bed scour the diffraction parameter varies between 0 0457 and 0 1619 thus it is understood that all 11 experiments given were carried out with large test piles as explained above in the case of slender piles the kc number is effective in the scour mechanism around the pile in the case of large piles the diffraction parameter is also effective besides kc in large pile tests the bottom bathymetry around the pile was determined after the experiments two different samples of bed form from the experiments were given in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively bathymetry graphs clearly show the bed formation occurred around the pile after the experiment fig 12 depicts the relative equilibrium scour depths obtained from the experiments performed in the case of large piles versus the kc numbers as can be seen from the graph the data are grouped for different value ranges of the diffraction parameter when the data between 0 04 d l 0 07 and 0 07 d l 0 17 are examined it is seen that the relationship between s d and kc is quite different for the two groups this finding reveals that the diffraction parameter together with the kc number is effective on the relative scour depths in the case of large piles d l 0 04 relative equilibrium scour depth plot based on modified ursell parameter is shown in fig 13 to set forth both kc and d l impact fig 13 in this figure similar to fig 12 the data are grouped for different d l intervals however when the graphics are compared in the drawing based on the modified ursell number there is no separation due to different d l ratios as in fig 12 and a visible relationship between s d and u rp is detected the reason for this situation can be explained by the fact that the modified ursell number contains the diffraction parameter at this stage it was planned to evaluate the obtained large pile data together with the data from sumer and fredsoe 2001 first data were grouped for different ranges of the d l ratio in order to see the variation easily the s d kc plot was divided into three small plots for the large pile case fig 14 combining the findings obtained within the scope of the study presented for large piles and the results of the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study the s d graphs depending on the d l ratio for different kc numbers were created fig 15 when the graph given in fig 15 is examined it is observed that s d increases depending on the number of kc regardless of the d l parameter however for large piles it is understood that as the kc number decreases the effect of the diffraction parameter on the relative scour depth decreases the result obtained confirms the explanation made with the data of a small number of large piles in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2001 the steady streaming effect grows with both the increase of the kc number and the diffraction effect the d l ratio as stated in the study of sumer and fredsoe 2001 consequently for the same d l ratio it can be said that relative scour depth increases with increasing the kc number similar behavior was observed in the increase in the d l ratio in the same kc numbers 2 results and discussion instead of evaluating the obtained findings alone it was more appropriate to evaluate them together with the experimental findings extracted from the qualified studies undertaken for this purpose with the experimental findings in the study presented for the relative equilibrium scour depth parameter and the findings obtained in the studies of sumer et al 1992 and sumer and fredsoe 2001 were evaluated together fig 16 displays the variation of the equilibrium scour depths depending on the kc numbers in the figure legend the different conditions of all the studies considered are shown with different symbols it can be seen from fig 16 that slender piles and large piles behave differently depending on the keulegan carpenter number in case of large piles it is clear that the results were separated into three different d l ratios when the results of the study presented for slender piles are evaluated together with the results of sumer et al 1992 the relative equilibrium scour depth is defined by 7 s d 1 3 1 e 0 022 k c 4 k c 4 although it is quite similar to eq 1 given in sumer et al 1992 the regression constants in eq 7 are different the proposed equation is valid for 4 and greater values of the kc number in case of kc 4 a pair of asymmetric vortices is formed in rear side of the pile and the following vortex shedding together plays an effective role in the scour mechanism williamson 1985 sumer and fredsoe 2006 the bed material used in the study of sumer et al 1992 was very fine sand with median grain sizes of 0 18 mm and 0 58 mm the use of medium sized sand with median grain size of 0 55 mm and 1 85 mm will provide new results to the literature as a result of working with the relatively coarser bed material the s d values in the presented study in the case of the same kc numbers are somewhat lower than the results of the sumer et al 1992 study the experimental s d values and the s d values obtained according to the empirical relation eq 7 are plotted in fig 17 the figure covers the 25 and 50 error bounds the correlation coefficient and the scattering index values the correlation coefficient and scattering index values obtained show that the regression model proposed are quite suitable the behavior of slender piles and large piles differ greatly in the relative scour depth depending on the kc number fig 16 in the case of slender piles the scour mechanism is dominated by the vortices developing in rear side and vortex shedding which starts as a result of the separation of the boundary layer from the pile surface and the transformation into a shear layer while in the case of a large pile the steady streaming structure created by the reflected and diffracted waves around the pile are effective in other words the diffraction effect comes to the fore in the case of large piles although the kc number contains information about wave properties and pile geometry it is not sufficient to describe the diffraction effect in order to create a single regression equation in the estimation of relative scour depth for both slender and large piles in addition to the kc number a second independent variable was added to the equation of course this independent variable is the non dimensional diffraction parameter the graph fig 18 shows the plotted data including both the slender pile and the large pile results in the presented study the slender pile results in the sumer et al 1992 study and the large pile results in the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study the results obtained from all studies were grouped for different kc numbers and plotted as relative scour depths depending on the diffraction parameter since the diffraction parameter in addition to the kc number in the relative scour depth estimation was taken into the regression expression as an independent variable instead of a single curve a family of curves for constant kc numbers are now shown on the s d d l graph using the presented study data sumer et al 1992 study data and sumer and fredsoe 2001 study data the following empirical expression was derived for both slender piles and large piles 8 s d 0 0037 k c 2 3 d l experimental s d data versus predicted s d values by eq 8 are plotted in fig 19 in this scattering diagram there are the 25 and 50 error bounds the correlation coefficient and the scatter index values as in fig 17 the correlation coefficient and the scattering index values show that the proposed regression model is suitable as in the regression model given by eq 7 as an alternative to using the kc number and the diffraction parameter pair in prediction of the relative scour depth the use of the modified ursell parameter was also evaluated similar to the use of kc number by the use of the modified ursell parameter wave properties and pile geometry and also the diffraction effect can be taken into account the modified ursell parameter versus the relative scour depths are plotted in fig 20 the data in the presented study the data of the sumer et al 1992 study and the results of the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study were used together as in fig 18 see fig 21 from fig 20 it is understood that the results of slender piles and large piles are almost scattered on the same line that is with a single empirical expression the relative scour depth for both slender and large piles can be expressed for this purpose eq 9 was derived by considering all the experimental results in the presented study the slender pile results in the study of sumer et al 1992 and the large pile results in the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study 9 s d 0 75 1 e 0 015 u r p 0 6 u r p 10 5 in fig the experimental s d data versus predicted s d values by eq 9 are plotted statistical parameters point out that the estimation based on the modified ursell parameter is also suitable and gives reliable results like the previous ones when the relative scour depth values depending on the diffraction parameter fig 18 are plotted with non logarithmic scales in both axes the graph given below is obtained fig 22 when the graph is examined it is seen that the data are clustered asymptotically in both directions the bi directional asymptotic distribution is seen as s d 0 for d l and s d for d l 0 in the analysis performed with a total of 179 data including the data of this study in which the number of kc varies between 0 3 and 102 and the d l ratio varies between 0 0019 and 0 27 the nominal boundary was defined to observe the wave induced scour around the pile depending on the d l ratio eq 10 defines the relation showing the nominal scour limit depending on the diffraction parameter to observe the scour under the wave effect whether it is a slender or a large pile 10 s d max 0 0082 d l when the data obtained from all three studies were plotted as kc numbers depending on the diffraction parameter the following graph given in fig 23 was obtained in this graph the similar asymptotic distribution was detected as in the graph presented in fig 22 the bi directional asymptotic distribution was seen as kc 0 for d l and kc for d l 0 the limit value here is 0 44 d l which is the maximum value of kc number for ⅐ tanh kh which is the maximum theoretical limit of wave steepness here k is the wave number with a value of 2π l 3 conclusions in the presented study wave induced scour formed around both slender and large marine piles were experimentally investigated within the scope of the presented study unique experiments were carried out under different wave conditions and by using test piles of different diameters between 63 and 950 mm bed material of two different sizes as 0 55 mm and 1 85 mm the surface of the test piles was considered smooth for dimensionless parameters the keulegan carpenter number in the experiments ranged from 0 99 to 16 19 the diffraction parameter from 0 005 to 0 162 the shields parameter from 0 0128 to 0 1117 and finally the modified ursell parameter from 0 94 to 436 14 considering the previous study results in which the findings were evaluated together these ranges are widening even more the results according to the findings obtained within the scope of the study are summarized below under the headings of a conclusions on large piles it was clearly determined that the relative scour depth s d values behave differently beyond the dependence on the kc number this indicates that in addition to the kc number the diffraction parameter d l is also important for the relative scour depth in case of large piles the increase of s d was determined due to the increase in the kc number for the same d l values on the other hand as the kc number gets smaller it has been observed that the effect of d l ratio on the change of s d decreases this situation shows that parallel to the findings in the sumer and fredsoe 2001 study the steady streaming effect grows with both the increase in the kc number and the d l ratio it is clear that in large piles the relative equilibrium scour depth does not exceed s d max 0 1 regardless of the kc number and d l ratio b results regarding slender piles the relative scour depths in the slender piles vary in direct proportion to both the kc number and the modified ursell parameter a new empirical expression was proposed for the estimation of relative scour depth for slender piles as s d 1 3 1 e 0 022 k c 4 k c 4 this empirical expression obtained slightly differs from the relation proposed as a result of sumer et al 1992 study and it was generated with much more experimental data with the proposed new expression the results of the relatively coarse bed material were also taken into consideration as can be seen from the new empirical equation given above for slender piles the relative equilibrium scour depth does not exceed 1 3 of its maximum value and the minimum value is s d min 0 3 for kc 4 in other words the minimum value of the relative equilibrium scour depth that occurs as a result of the vortex mechanism becoming effective on scour is 0 3 c overall results for all slender and large piles since in case of large piles in addition to the kc number another non dimensional parameter must be considered as diffraction parameter new empirical expression was obtained by adding the d l ratio as a second independent variable for the estimation of s d as s d 0 0037 k c 2 3 d l this proposed empirical expression takes into account the wave properties and pile geometry via kc number and the diffraction effect by the d l ratio thus it can be valid for both slender and large piles to estimate the relative scour depths another empirical expression based on the modified ursell parameter that mathematically contains the kc number and the d l ratio as an alternative to the above equation was proposed as s d 0 75 1 e 0 015 u r p 0 6 u r p 10 5 thus with the help of these two equations the estimation of s d can be performed with the help of a single equation without considering pile diameter in the presented empirical expressions the validity range of the kc number is 0 102 and the validity range of urp is 0 100000 d limits obtained in case of wave induced scour the nominal limit value of relative scour depth depending on diffraction parameter can be determined by the expression as s d max 0 0082 d l the observed bi directional asymptotic distribution was seen as s d 0 for d l and s d for d l 0 on the other hand when the maximum value of kc number 0 44 d l for ⅐ tanh kh which is the maximum limit of the wave steepness is drawn on the kc d l graph a boundary is formed by separating the breaking and non breaking waves conducting more experiments in the transient zone with the range of keulegan carpenter number 2 to 6 will be an important step for future studies also measurement of the steady streaming around large piles especially for the case of kc 1 would be a correct step in determining the flow and scour

20387,tuning of vessel models in real time based on vessel measurements and weather information is of great interest in order to increase the safety and efficiency of marine operations vessel motion signals usually contain high frequency noise for an unbiased model tuning algorithm it is essential to filter the noisy signals in order to identify the power of the wave induced first order vessel response lowpass filters with high accuracy should therefore be applied however it is a challenge to design such a filter since the optimal cutoff frequency can vary with sea states vessel dimensions vessel conditions etc this paper proposes a novel algorithm to adaptively search for the optimal cutoff frequency for a lowpass filter with high accuracy the algorithm is fundamentally based on the facts that the vessel naturally acts as a lowpass filter and the energy from the high frequency components e g signal noise is significantly smaller than that from the wave induced vessel response the algorithm is validated by 500 numerically simulated vessel motion signals with quite high noise levels and also by analysis of several on site full scale vessel motion signals the improvements to the

of vessel center of gravity 1 introduction marine operations are usually designed onshore before they are executed operational limits are determined based on presumed operational scenarios loading conditions etc practically it is common to calculate the wave induced loads and motions based on linear transfer functions named response amplitude operators raos dnvgl st n001 2016 however the applied raos at the design stage may not represent the true vessel conditions during operation in an adequate manner because 1 conservative engineering assumptions are usually made to cover the variation of vessel loading conditions during marine operations e g pipe laying and 2 the onboard vessel loading condition inertia distribution may deviate from the presumed one these limitations could lead to over conservative and inefficient marine operations or even risky operations with increased possibility of accidents therefore a dynamically adaptive tuning of vessel numerical models could continuously help to improve the knowledge on the real time vessel condition and hence increase the efficiency and safety of the marine operations han et al 2021a proposed an algorithm based on bayesian inference to improve the knowledge about these real time vessel conditions and to reduce the model uncertainty quantitatively by using 1 onboard data from sensor systems e g motion reference unit mru and global navigation satellite system gnss 2 wave information such as h s significant wave height t p spectral peak period β w wave direction directional spreading and spectral shape as explained in han et al 2021a tuning of a vessel hydrodynamic model is a multi modal multi dimensional and nonlinear problem the vessel motion measurements are extremely important for many onboard systems e g dynamic positioning dp systems and active heave compensators ahcs a typical mru system uses measurements from an inertial measurement unit imu which consists of accelerometers measuring translational accelerations and gyroscopes measuring rotational velocities it is well recognized that all measurements are inexact but usually they can statistically represent the true value hubbard 2014 the accuracy and precision of the measurements depend on the involved methods processes and instruments imu measurements may contain errors due to misalignment mis scaling constant and slow varying biases gravity related terms and nonlinearities from the gyro torque and accelerometers grewal et al 1991 sensor fusion and signal filtering techniques should therefore be applied to achieve high fidelity motion monitoring reduce sensor noise and avoid measurement drift fossen 2011 filters can be categorized into model free and model based approaches depending on whether a representative model is applied kalman filters and the associated extended methods have been the most popular model based approaches due to their convenient formulation for state estimation and feasibility in relation to time varying systems in the time domain simon 2006 most mru applications use model based advanced kalman filters for the convenient applications of sensor fusion ren et al 2019 proposed motion estimation algorithms by fusing the imu and gnss measurements grewal et al 1991 introduced a dual extended kalman filter for estimating the measurement errors from gyroscopes and accelerometers separately the separated filtering of gyro and accelerometer measurements reduces the number of coefficients to be tuned besides significant amounts of motion estimation algorithms have been developed based on various kalman filters such as unscented kalman filter zhang et al 2005 adaptive kalman filter li and wang 2013 and exogenous kalman filter stovner et al 2018 an alternative type of model based filtering technique is based on the lyapunov stability concept fossen and strand 1999 grip et al 2015 the residual error converges to zero or a bounded region according to online approximation and adaptive updating taking advantage of their simple form model free filter techniques are easier to apply usually one is interested to extract the signals within a certain frequency range by applying a bandpass notch lowpass or highpass filter many different signal filters have been developed and applied in different fields e g butterworth filters butterworth 1930 and kolmogorov filters challa and bar shalom 2000 however the cutoff frequency should be designed and tuned either explicitly or implicitly in the filter models as the first statistically designed filter the wiener filter wiener 1964 can optimally extract the true signal from noise within the frequency domain by designing the filter as a linear time invariant system requiring knowledge about the noise free signal spectrum and the noise spectrum for processing with heave motion measurements godhaven 1998 proposed an adaptive highpass filter where the optimal cutoff frequency was obtained by minimizing the measurement errors which depends on the measured wave condition the selected filter model and filter order the considered error sources etc parametric sensitivity studies of the vessel model tuning algorithm proposed by han et al 2021a showed that the quality of the tuned results highly relies on a reliable filtering of signal noise to identify the vessel motion energy in the wave frequency region assuming that the noise energy is mainly within the high frequency region a lowpass filter should therefore be applied to remove the high frequency components e g noises from the vessel motion signals its optimal cutoff frequency depends on many parameters such as sea state vessel advancing speed vessel heading etc this paper focuses on developing an adaptive algorithm to find the optimal cutoff frequency for the lowpass filter the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the procedures of the proposed model tuning algorithm section 3 describes the basic inputs of the performed analyses and the scope of work to find an algorithm or a function which could calculate the optimal cutoff frequency being the core of this paper section 4 aims to identify the important parameters correlated to the optimal cutoff frequency and explore the properties associated with the signals and the cutoff frequencies consequently a novel algorithm is then proposed in section 4 which can adaptively tune the optimal cutoff frequencies then the proposed algorithm is verified by means of 500 randomly generated time series in addition to several on site vessel motion measurements described in section 5 the influence of the proposed adaptive lowpass filter on the vessel model tuning results is then evaluated conclusions and future work are presented in section 6 2 basic vessel model tuning procedure the considered vessel seakeeping model tuning procedure proposed by han et al 2021a is briefly repeated in this section and illustrated in fig 1 the joint probability distribution of the uncertain vessel parameters φ 1 φ m φ m m 1 2 m after tuning n times based on the proposed tuning procedure can be expressed as p n φ 1 φ 2 φ m the update is based on the provided wave information vessel motion measurements e g at a sensor numbered as j and a prepared rao database which covers all the considered sensors and the whole uncertainty ranges of the considered vessel parameters 1 filter the vessel motion measurements from sensor j x j t in reality the raw motion signal includes noise in the high frequency range a low frequency signal bias and environment induced low frequency motions it is important to filter out such disturbances and to identify the first order wave induced motions 2 calculate the standard deviation std of the filtered signal σ ˆ j by 1a σ ˆ j t 1 n t x ˆ j t x j 2 n t 1 1b x j t 1 n t x ˆ j t n t where x ˆ j t means the estimated time series of the filtered signal for sensor j at the time step t n t is the total number of discrete time steps of the signal and x j is the mean value of the filtered signal 3 calculate the standard deviations of the possible vessel response σ r j based on the corresponding wave

where σ σ r j is the std of σ r j for r 1 2 n r a o the previous study used a screening criterion of α 0 0 05 for a certain sensor j if α j 0 05 then the sensor j will be excluded when updating the parameters ssr basically represents how important the considered vessel parameters are under the current sea state at sensor j 5 calculate the weight factor for each σ r j by 4 w r j 1 σ r j σ ˆ j p where p r is called the power parameter the choice of p value depends on the number of dimensions m for the model tuning the sensitivity and uncertainty range of the considered vessel parameters and the engineering judgment 6 establish the weight matrix w j i e the likelihood function for all possible combinations of vessel parameters in the rao database the weight matrix has the size of i 1 i 2 i m 7 linearly interpolate the weight matrix w j from the size of i 1 i 2 i m variable resolution in the rao database to the size of k 1 k 2 k m variable resolution in the discrete joint probability

no p d f n φ 1 φ m w j where p d f means the probability density function operator means the element wise multiplication of two matrices i e a hadamard product scheick 1997 no is a normalization operator so that the sum of the probabilities in the joint probability distribution remains 1 0 after every tuning the main idea is to transfer the objective of recursively calculating direction dependent vessel motion raos based on vessel motion measurements and wave information to the statistical inference on the vessel model parameters which are direction independent the benefits are 1 the tuned results also indicate the confidence 2 the tuned results can be used to predict the future vessel responses for different sea states and wave directions 3 problem statement early case studies han et al 2021a indicated the key role of signal filtering for unbiased vessel model tuning results both over filtering and under filtering of signal noise could lead to biased tuning results the high frequency components of the motion signal which are mainly due to the signal noise and the local vibrations can be removed by a lowpass filter for the lowpass filter it is essential to find the optimal cutoff frequency which depends on the sea state vessel dimension and vessel condition however the wave spectrum can be represented in terms of a number of parameters such as h s t p β w wave spreading and spectral shape which in reality may not be accurately described by any of the well known wave spectral types e g pierson moskowitz pm jonswap and thorsethaugen therefore it is difficult to find a general function relating the optimal cutoff frequency to the sea state vessel dimensions and vessel condition in addition due to the random nature of signal noises mathematically accurate expression for the function of the optimal cutoff frequency f l p becomes a challenge this paper focuses on finding the optimal lowpass filter cutoff frequency f l p in order to estimate the energy of the true wave induced first order vessel motion as accurately as possible the signals are assumed to have no low frequency components and therefore only a lowpass filter was required for the signal with the ambition of finding relations between sea states and f l p the analysis scope described in section 3 2 is performed all the analyses were based on one selected vessel with several sensor systems as described in section 3 1 3 1 vessel model the numerical studies are based on an offshore supply vessel osv close to its ballast condition han et al 2021a the primary vessel dimensions are summarized in table 1 the vessel reference coordinate system moves steadily at the vessel forward speed as illustrated in fig 2 the positive x axis along the longitudinal symmetric axis points from the stern to the bow x 0 aft the z axis is pointing vertically upwards from the keel z 0 and the y axis is normal to the x z plane where y 0 is at the vessel longitudinal symmetry plane the wave direction β w follows the same coordinate system i e waves at 180 heading propagate along the negative x axis the rao database was established 1 to generate signals for different locations and responses of the vessel and 2 to evaluate the effects of the adaptive lowpass filter on the model tuning performance based on the early sensitivity studies of the hydrodynamic model parameters in relation to the vessel motions of interest han et al 2020 variation of five vessel parameters was considered for the rao database the considered uncertainty ranges are summarized in table 2 the discrete values for each parameter are evenly distributed within its uncertainty range seakeeping analyses were performed by wasim dnv 2018 from the dnv sesam family applying the rankine panel method kring 1994 running analyses through all wave periods in the time domain the outputs can then be transferred to the frequency domain in order to build the raos a rao database was then established by considering all possible combinations of the discrete values for the five vessel parameters heave responses are often of interest for marine operations e g heavy lift therefore heave raos i e displacement velocity and acceleration at three different locations see fig 2 were included in the rao database for each combination of vessel parameters as described in table 3 9 different measured quantities sensors associated with heave response were considered in the model tuning simulations only zero advancing speed was considered for simplicity in order to avoid dealing with the 3 to 1 mapping problem between the absolute wave frequency and encounter frequency for following waves lewandowski 2004 in total 13 wave headings between 0 and 180 with a 15 interval were considered in the rao database for the 9 sensor measurements 3 2 finding the optimal cutoff frequency it is assumed that the high frequency signal errors can be represented by white noise 6 w n n 0 σ n 2 where the variance of the noise σ n 2 is determined by the signal to noise ratio snr 7 s n r σ x 2 σ n 2 where σ x 2 is the variance of the true signal the response signal can be simulated according to the process in fig 3 blocks in blue are the required inputs which together can uniquely determine the output signal the seed number was used to generate both the relative phase φ n for each frequency component ω n and the noise for each time step a massive amount of vessel heave motion signals were generated by varying all the input parameters in fig 3 in order to investigate the relations between inputs and f l p the considered variation of inputs are summarized in table 4 each simulation lasts for 1 h the time series were generated based on the corresponding response spectrum by application

using the python scipy package virtanen et al 2020 was applied to filter each signal by application of many different cutoff frequencies f l p 0 05 2 0 hz the optimal cutoff frequency f l p therefore can be determined by comparing the std of the filtered signal σ ˆ x f l p with the std of the true response time series σ x the study tested 25 cutoff frequencies for each signal i e f l p 0 050 0 053 0 056 0 059 0 063 0 067 0 071 0 077 0 083 0 091 0 10 0 111 0 125 0 143 0 167 0 20 0 25 0 30 0 33 0 40 0 50 0 60 0 75 1 0 1 5 2 0 hz 4 data exploration this section aims to identify the most relevant input parameters for the optimal cutoff frequency f l p and to propose a way to find f l p due to the limited number of discretized frequencies and discretized time steps for a given simulation length based on eq 8 the generated response time series will not contain exactly the same power as the response power spectrum fig 4 indicates that there may be up to about a 2 5 error uncertainty for the studied 1 h response realizations with a limited number of discrete frequencies and time steps this approximately corresponds to a snr of 20 the uncertainty can be reduced by increasing the number of discretized frequencies reducing the time series sampling interval and increasing the duration of the realization the studies did not attempt to reduce this error fig 5 shows the overall distribution of the optimal cutoff frequency f l p together with the 5 25 50 75 and 95 percentile values the optimal cutoff frequencies are well concentrated between 0 15 hz and 0 3 hz however further data exploration has to be performed in order to find any possible relation between f l p and the input parameters quantitatively initial data exploration shows that the optimal cutoff frequency f l p can be influenced by the characteristic spectral period e g t p incoming wave direction β w wave spectral shape the sensor location and noise level snr in addition the significant influence from seed variation is also observed the optimal cutoff frequency value from signals with higher snr less noise seems to be more affected by seed variation note that there were very few cases 0 005 that failed to find an optimal cutoff frequency within the tested range 0 05 2 0 hz mostly due to the effects from seed variation and the limitations in accuracy which are associated with numerical calculations based on discrete frequencies and time steps it only happened for snr 100 plots show that the function f l p t p could be well fitted by a linear function e g f l p a t p b or a bi linear function e g f l p a t p b for all t p t 0 f l p c t p d for all t p t 0 however the fitted parameters e g a b t 0 etc depend on many input parameters such as β w wave spectral shape sensor location vessel condition etc therefore it is difficult to find a clear function for the optimal cutoff frequency directly with respect to the wave and sensor inputs i e f l p t p β w spectral type sensor etc 4 1 standard deviation and zero upcrossing period of filtered signals therefore it is of interest to further investigate details on how the standard deviation std and zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p changes with changing cutoff frequency for example figs 6 and 7 show that 1 the optimal cutoff frequency f l p always stays at or near the turning point of the σ ˆ x f l p curve 2 the optimal cutoff frequency f l p is always on the plateau of the t ˆ z f l p curves but not necessarily at the turning point 3 when a larger f l p applies less noise is filtered out but σ ˆ x f l p increases very slowly with increasing f l p for f l p f l p this means that even though applying larger f l p may lead to biased tuning results it is still much safer to use a slightly larger f l p than a slightly smaller f l p relative to f l p the reason for the existence of the plateau in the t ˆ z f l p curve is the clear distinction between the main frequency regions for the true vessel response versus the signal noise in addition the less the noise level is i e larger snr the flatter and longer the plateau will be this is because less noise will have less influence on the overall signal zero upcrossing period therefore it can be helpful to determine the optimal cutoff frequency based on the characteristics of the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves two parameters are introduced representing the absolute values of the normalized slopes of the t ˆ z f l p and σ ˆ x f l p curves the hat operator ˆ means the filtered results the efficiency of increasing or reducing the cutoff frequency on the change of the filtered signal energy is referred to as θ f l p defined by 12 θ f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 where σ ˆ x f l p i means the filtered signal std by application of the cutoff frequency f l p i the effect of increasing or reducing the cutoff frequency on the change of the zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal is referred to as λ f l p 13 γ f l p i t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i t ˆ z f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 where t ˆ z f l p i means the zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal based on the cutoff frequency of f l p i please note that γ is positive when the slope of the t ˆ z f l p curve is negative when f l p i f l p i 1 0 θ f l p i represents the normalized slope of the σ ˆ x f l p curve at f l p i while γ f l p i represents the opposite value of the normalized slope of the t ˆ z f l p curve at f l p i the true response std is in the following defined as σ x the program tested a limited number of discrete f l p values gradually as described in section 3 2 therefore the optimal frequency is actually found by interpolation between the neighboring frequencies f l p i and f l p i 1 where σ ˆ x f l p i σ x σ ˆ x f l p i 1 for f l p i f l p f l p i 1 due to the mentioned findings of the two curves the distributions of the θ and γ values around the optimal cutoff frequency f l p are of great interest to further investigate and these are therefore defined as follows 14a θ σ ˆ x f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 14b θ 0 σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i 1 f l p i 1 f l p i 14c θ σ ˆ x f l p i 2 σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i 2 f l p i 2 f l p i 1 15a γ t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i t ˆ z f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 15b γ 0 t ˆ z f l p i t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i 1 f l p i 1 f l p i 15c γ t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i 2 t ˆ z f l p i 2 f l p i 2 f l p i 1 note that the values of θ and γ can be influenced by the resolution of the tested f l p values the histograms of the parameters θ θ 0 θ γ γ 0 and γ are shown in figs 8 and 9 because of the large difference between the bin ranges for the parameters e g θ θ 0 and θ the plotted histograms were normalized for the purpose of easier comparison between them the histogram of each variable considered 100 bins and the histogram was normalized so that the height denoted as h of the histogram plot represents the probability density of the parameter denoted as v the bins are evenly distributed so that δ v v m a x v m i n 100 the plotted normalized histogram plots fulfill 16 i 1 100 h i δ v 1 0 it is clear that θ is highly concentrated in a much smaller θ value range as compared with the distributions of θ and θ 0 however γ γ 0 and γ are all distributed around zero with γ having the smallest variance these observations positively support the findings from figs 6 and 7 the statistical percentile values of all these 6 parameters are summarized in table 5 it is also interesting to find that the uncertainty of θ f l p is highly correlated with the snr larger noise leads to larger variation of θ f l p for different signals seed variation from the same response spectrum however this does not conflict with the previous findings that higher noise leads to less variation of f l p for different signals due to seed variation for the same response spectrum the distributions of θ θ 0 θ become even more distinguishable for a certain snr value e g figs 10 and 11 as shown in table 5 and fig 9 the γ values are small and stable near f l p which means that the optimal cutoff is on the plateau of the t ˆ z f l p curve as γ γ 0 γ are similarly distributed the criterion for γ must be relaxed acting as a supplementary rule for the θ criterion 4 2 proposed strategy to find optimal cutoff frequency due to the large slope of the σ ˆ x f l p curve for f l p f l p it is better to filter slightly less noise than risking to filter out too much energy assuming no low frequency motion the proposed strategy to find the optimal lowpass filter cutoff frequency f l p in order to retain only the signals within the wave frequency region is summarized as follows 1 starting from a small cutoff frequency f l p 1 of e g 0 02 hz filter the noisy signal x t and calculate the std and zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal i e σ ˆ x f l p 1 and t ˆ z f l p 1 2 repeat step 1 by gradually increasing the cutoff frequency f l p i i 2 3 calculate σ ˆ f l p i t ˆ z f l p i θ f l p i and γ f l p i for i 2 3 3 then the first cutoff frequency f l p i where both the values of θ f l p i and γ f l p i meet the preset criteria will be considered as the optimal cutoff frequency denoted as f l p it is not necessary to explicitly define the turning point of the σ ˆ x f l p curve when the resolution of the tested f l p is sufficiently fine θ 0 and θ will be very close and practically it does not matter which of these values is selected based on the statistical distribution of θ and γ summarized in table 5 the following criteria are considered as the base case 17a θ f l p 0 05 17b γ f l p 0 9 the θ f l p 0 05 was chosen based on statistical information about θ 0 and θ so that θ meets the criterion for 95 of the cases and more than half of θ 0 meets the criterion the histograms of θ θ 0 θ indicate that the selected criterion is statistically appropriate as the θ and γ criteria are based on statistics of a case study it cannot guarantee that the present procedure will find the optimal cutoff frequency for all signals therefore one supplementary requirement was introduced to ensure returning an optimal cutoff frequency value for signal filtering i e f l p must be within 0 1 0 9 hz i e 18 f l p 0 1 hz if f l p 0 1 hz 0 9 hz if f l p 0 9 hz f l p otherwise where f l p means the identified optimal cutoff frequency based on the main proposed strategy with the criteria in eq 17 the algorithm are also summarized in pseudo code format 5 test of strategy 5 1 simulated signals the proposed strategy was tested for 500 randomly generated vessel motion signals based on randomly selecting the values of the input parameters summarized in table 6 in total 83 values of f l p 0 06 5 13 hz were considered for the lowpass filter as shown in fig 12 the resolution was gradually increased with decreasing f l p especially for f l p 0 1 0 3 hz different values of θ and γ criteria were also tested as summarized in table 7 the parameter κ was defined in order to evaluate the results of the adaptive filtering based on different criteria 19 κ σ ˆ x f l p σ x where σ ˆ x f l p is the filtered signal std at the found optimal cutoff frequency f l p fig 13 shows the distributions of κ from the 500 test cases table 6 for the 4 different sets of criteria table 7 among the results θ 0 05 with γ 0 9 generally leads to the best filtering results with respect to the response std for which the filtered signal stds are concentrated mostly around the true values the distribution of κ for crit2 shows slightly more spreading when using a smaller γ criterion indicating that γ serves to provide a supplementary criterion for the adaptive filtering process results from crit3 with a much higher θ value are the worst with respect to the filtered signal std the distribution is dramatically skewed to the left indicating that many signals were over filtered this is due to a too relaxed θ criterion crit4 is most strict which however did not lead to better filtering results than the base case crit1 it can be seen in fig 13 that there is a notable skewing to the right indicating that the signals may be under filtered 5 2 on site mru measurements it is interesting to test the proposed strategy by application of on site measurements however it is impossible to know the vessel s true on site response due to the inevitable measurement uncertainties hubbard 2014 therefore it was only possible to test whether or not the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves show similar characteristics as described in section 4 1 and to discuss the limitations it is worth mentioning that the vessel motion signals obtained from mru are already filtered through e g application of an extended kalman filter to avoid drift 5 2 1 gunnerus seakeeping and dp tests the mru measurements of the ntnu research vessel gunnerus during seakeeping and dp tests in 2013 steen et al 2016 were considered two test cases were reported one 2 hour dp test casea1 under a sea state with 2 significant peak periods 8 5 s and 13 3 s and one half hour seakeeping test casea2 with 10 4kn speed under a swell dominated sea state the quickly reduced slopes of the σ ˆ x f l p curves were observed for both cases for all mru measurements with respect to heave pitch and roll e g fig 14 because the received mru signals were already filtered the noise level was low as expected in addition gunnerus is a research vessel with a relatively small dimension about 30 m long and accordingly its resonance response periods are relatively small therefore the t ˆ z f l p curves as expected becomes very flat when the cutoff frequency is sufficiently large it is interesting to observe the reduced slopes for the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves within the wave frequency region for heave and pitch measurements e g fig 15 this is because casea2 was a swell dominated sea condition t p 13 5 s with a small wind sea the vessel was mostly excited within a relatively low frequency region while the vessel response resonance was in a relatively high frequency region due to gunnerus small dimensions therefore there was a clear gap with respect to the frequencies of the excited vessel motion by the swell and the wind sea 5 2 2 normand vision the mru measurements caseb1 from normand vision during a lifting operation in 2017 were also tested the operation lasted for a total of 2 hours the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves for the 2 hour pitch and roll responses are shown in figs 16 and 17 the t ˆ z f l p curve for pitch is not smooth near the turning point for roll motion the t ˆ z f l p curve shows an oscillatory behavior with the t ˆ z value converging around 44 s which is larger than the wave periods a closer look at the time series of pitch and roll motions indicates that the unstable behavior of the t ˆ z f l p curves were due to the additional low frequency motion caused by the lift off and landing operations see fig 18 consequently as shown in fig 19 the vessel trim was also changed due to the change of vessel cog during the operation then a highpass filter with cutoff frequency of 0 04 hz was applied to filter out the low frequency motions before applying the adaptive lowpass filter the updated σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves of roll motion are shown in fig 20 compared with fig 17 the t ˆ z f l p curve in fig 20 becomes smoother and converges to a reasonable value 5 3 influence on the model tuning results so far the proposed adaptive lowpass filter has been shown to be stable with respect to variation of sea states vessel conditions and noise levels this section focuses on investigating how much benefit the model tuning can get from the adaptive lowpass filter with the proposed procedure of finding the optimal cutoff frequency in total 200 model tuning cases were run with both the adaptive lowpass filter and a lowpass filter with a fixed cutoff frequency of 1 0 hz each model tuning case used vessel response measurements and wave information from 6 randomly generated sea states the main wave information the parameters applied to generating measurements and the parameters used for model tuning are summarized in table 8 the true vessel condition and the initial probability distributions of the considered vessel model parameters are summarized in table 9 which is different from the considered vessel condition for algorithm development described in section 3 2 and section 4 it is worth mentioning that the important uncertain vessel parameter β 44 representing the ratio between the additional mainly caused by viscous effect and critical roll damping actually varies with sea states han et al 2021b however a constant true value of β 44 was considered for simplicity the considered vessel parameters were tuned simultaneously compared with the model tuning results with a fixed cutoff frequency of 1 0 hz the results show that the adaptive filter approach statistically improved the accuracy with respect to the expected values see fig 21 and reduced the variance of the considered parameters see fig 22 however the improvements of the less sensitive parameters gmt and r 55 were not very significant particularly in terms of the tuned expected values 6 conclusions and future work an algorithm to find the sea state and vessel dependent optimal cutoff frequency for a lowpass filter has been proposed to improve extracting vessel motions in the wave frequency region from the noisy vessel motion measurement signals it is difficult to find and express the explicit relation between the optimal cutoff frequency and the characteristics of the sea state vessel dimensions and vessel condition in addition the environmental uncertainties are difficult to measure quantify and control the proposed algorithm significantly eases these challenges by introducing two parameters θ and γ based on the statistical characteristics of the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves around the optimal cutoff frequencies and these characteristics are not explicitly linked to any sea state or vessel property applying the algorithm to the vessel model tuning process statistically improves the tuning results however to a limited degree for some parameters due to 1 the numerical errors from std calculations of vessel motions based on discrete time series and spectral densities and 2 the fact that the considered parameters e g gmt and r 55 may not be very sensitive to the involved sea states the improvements in relation to tuning of β 44 and xcg are rather significant because they are more sensitive to the considered vessel motions at the involved sea states it has been found important to choose a reasonable set of criteria for θ and γ a relaxed θ criterion can lead to significant signal over filtering while too strict criteria may cause the signal under filtered too strict criteria may also make the algorithm fail to find the optimal cutoff frequency based on the proposed normal procedure even though the capability of extending the algorithm and the preset θ and γ criteria for other vessel conditions and dimensions has not been fully demonstrated all the validation tests described in section 5 used either different vessel conditions i e sections 5 1 and 5 3 or different vessels i e section 5 2 rather than the one used for deriving the algorithm section 4 this tends to support the hypothesis that the proposed adaptive lowpass filter would work for different vessels and vessel conditions section 5 showed that the algorithm is stable and the on site full scale measurements also fulfill the characteristics of the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves as described in section 4 1 the algorithm works because 1 the vessel itself is by nature a lowpass filter of the wave energy therefore the high frequency response normally has much less energy 2 the noise mainly carries energy in the high frequency domain distinguishably outside of the frequency region for the main vessel response sensor misalignment and bias are slowly varying i e with low frequencies 3 signal noise has considerably less energy compared with the true vessel response energy the snr values applied for all presented case studies were higher than 5 the proposed adaptive filter algorithm is believed to be a flexible solution because 1 it does not require to know the weather or vessel conditions 2 it is not directly linked to any specific filter the algorithm uses properties of the standard deviation and zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal which are available for most signal filters even though the present study made use of the fft filter the method can be applied based on any other normal filters of any order as long as the cutoff frequency of that filter model can be explicitly expressed 3 it does not strictly require a stationary condition it has been demonstrated in section 5 2 2 that the σ ˆ f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves for the non stationary signals are similar to the curves for stationary signals e g as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 as discussed in section 4 1 however special attention should be paid to those non stationary conditions which may introduce low frequency components with high energy 4 it is expected to be stable at least for vessels with similar dimensions and displacement more comprehensive analyses should be performed to verify that the proposed adaptive lowpass filter and its preset θ and γ criteria work for other and significantly different vessels and vessel conditions the proposed adaptive lowpass filter requires that the power of the response spectrum should be sufficient in magnitude for frequencies less than the optimal cutoff frequency for a sea state consisting of one wind sea component with a small t p w and one swell component with a large t p s w and with two different directions there might be no wave energy in some periods between t p w and t p s w the proposed method might fail if the search for f l p stops immediately after fulfilling the criteria with respect to θ and λ however this could be solved by continuously checking the θ and γ values with increasing f l p ensuring all the considered f l p values larger than f l p meet the preset θ and γ criteria as well alternatively the algorithm can be modified so that searching f l p starts from the smaller wave spectral peak period e g corresponding to f l p of 1 t p w hz the cases of model tuning considered four uncertain vessel parameters the interpolation and multiplication operators within the 4 dimensional space requires a significant amount of computer memory in reality additional uncertain parameters should be included in the algorithm of model tuning e g vessel heading vessel speed and wave spectrum related parameters such as h s t p β w directional spreading etc as a consequence the methodology could face the common challenge referred to as the curse of dimensionality in connection with discrete bayesian inference gelman et al 2013 modification of the model tuning algorithm should be considered in the future in order to improve the computational efficiency e g by only taking into account the mean vector and covariance matrix of the uncertain vessel parameters han et al 2021c credit authorship contribution

20387,tuning of vessel models in real time based on vessel measurements and weather information is of great interest in order to increase the safety and efficiency of marine operations vessel motion signals usually contain high frequency noise for an unbiased model tuning algorithm it is essential to filter the noisy signals in order to identify the power of the wave induced first order vessel response lowpass filters with high accuracy should therefore be applied however it is a challenge to design such a filter since the optimal cutoff frequency can vary with sea states vessel dimensions vessel conditions etc this paper proposes a novel algorithm to adaptively search for the optimal cutoff frequency for a lowpass filter with high accuracy the algorithm is fundamentally based on the facts that the vessel naturally acts as a lowpass filter and the energy from the high frequency components e g signal noise is significantly smaller than that from the wave induced vessel response the algorithm is validated by 500 numerically simulated vessel motion signals with quite high noise levels and also by analysis of several on site full scale vessel motion signals the improvements to the

applied raos at the design stage may not represent the true vessel conditions during operation in an adequate manner because 1 conservative engineering assumptions are usually made to cover the variation of vessel loading conditions during marine operations e g pipe laying and 2 the onboard vessel loading condition inertia distribution may deviate from the presumed one these limitations could lead to over conservative and inefficient marine operations or even risky operations with increased possibility of accidents therefore a dynamically adaptive tuning of vessel numerical models could continuously help to improve the knowledge on the real time vessel condition and hence increase the efficiency and safety of the marine operations han et al 2021a proposed an algorithm based on bayesian inference to improve the knowledge about these real time vessel conditions and to reduce the model uncertainty quantitatively by using 1 onboard data from sensor systems e g motion reference unit mru and global navigation satellite system gnss 2 wave information such as h s significant wave height t p spectral peak period β w wave direction directional spreading and spectral shape as explained in han et al 2021a tuning of a vessel hydrodynamic model is a multi modal multi dimensional and nonlinear problem the vessel motion measurements are extremely important for many onboard systems e g dynamic positioning dp systems and active heave compensators ahcs a typical mru system uses measurements from an inertial measurement unit imu which consists of accelerometers measuring translational accelerations and gyroscopes measuring rotational velocities it is well recognized that all measurements are inexact but usually they can statistically represent the true value hubbard 2014 the accuracy and precision of the measurements depend on the involved methods processes and instruments imu measurements may contain errors due to misalignment mis scaling constant and slow varying biases gravity related terms and nonlinearities from the gyro torque and accelerometers grewal et al 1991 sensor fusion and signal filtering techniques should therefore be applied to achieve high fidelity motion monitoring reduce sensor noise and avoid measurement drift fossen 2011 filters can be categorized into model free and model based approaches depending on whether a representative model is applied kalman filters and the associated extended methods have been the most popular model based approaches due to their convenient formulation for state estimation and feasibility in relation to time varying systems in the time domain simon 2006 most mru applications use model based advanced kalman filters for the convenient applications of sensor fusion ren et al 2019 proposed motion estimation algorithms by fusing the imu and gnss measurements grewal et al 1991 introduced a dual extended kalman filter for estimating the measurement errors from gyroscopes and accelerometers separately the separated filtering of gyro and accelerometer measurements reduces the number of coefficients to be tuned besides significant amounts of motion estimation algorithms have been developed based on various kalman filters such as unscented kalman filter zhang et al 2005 adaptive kalman filter li and wang 2013 and exogenous kalman filter stovner et al 2018 an alternative type of model based filtering technique is based on the lyapunov stability concept fossen and strand 1999 grip et al 2015 the residual error converges to zero or a bounded region according to online approximation and adaptive updating taking advantage of their simple form model free filter techniques are easier to apply usually one is interested to extract the signals within a certain frequency range by applying a bandpass notch lowpass or highpass filter many different signal filters have been developed and applied in different fields e g butterworth filters butterworth 1930 and kolmogorov filters challa and bar shalom 2000 however the cutoff frequency should be designed and tuned either explicitly or implicitly in the filter models as the first statistically designed filter the wiener filter wiener 1964 can optimally extract the true signal from noise within the frequency domain by designing the filter as a linear time invariant system requiring knowledge about the noise free signal spectrum and the noise spectrum for processing with heave motion measurements godhaven 1998 proposed an adaptive highpass filter where the optimal cutoff frequency was obtained by minimizing the measurement errors which depends on the measured wave condition the selected filter model and filter order the considered error sources etc parametric sensitivity studies of the vessel model tuning algorithm proposed by han et al 2021a showed that the quality of the tuned results highly relies on a reliable filtering of signal noise to identify the vessel motion energy in the wave frequency region assuming that the noise energy is mainly within the high frequency region a lowpass filter should therefore be applied to remove the high frequency components e g noises from the vessel motion signals its optimal cutoff frequency depends on many parameters such as sea state vessel advancing speed vessel heading etc this paper focuses on developing an adaptive algorithm to find the optimal cutoff frequency for the lowpass filter the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the procedures of the proposed model tuning algorithm section 3 describes the basic inputs of the performed analyses and the scope of work to find an algorithm or a function which could calculate the optimal cutoff frequency being the core of this paper section 4 aims to identify the important parameters correlated to the optimal cutoff frequency and explore the properties associated with the signals and the cutoff frequencies consequently a novel algorithm is then proposed in section 4 which can adaptively tune the optimal cutoff frequencies then the proposed algorithm is verified by means of 500 randomly generated time series in addition to several on site vessel motion measurements described in section 5 the influence of the proposed adaptive lowpass filter on the vessel model tuning results is then evaluated conclusions and future work are presented in section 6 2 basic vessel model tuning procedure the considered vessel seakeeping model tuning procedure proposed by han et al 2021a is briefly repeated in this section and illustrated in fig 1 the joint probability distribution of the uncertain vessel parameters φ 1 φ m φ m m 1 2 m after tuning n times based on the proposed tuning procedure can be expressed as p n φ 1 φ 2 φ m the update is based on the provided wave information vessel motion measurements e g at a sensor numbered as j and a prepared rao database which covers all the considered sensors and the whole uncertainty ranges of the considered vessel parameters 1 filter the vessel motion measurements from sensor j x j t in reality the raw motion signal includes noise in the high frequency range a low frequency signal bias and environment induced low frequency motions it is important to filter out such disturbances and to identify the first order wave induced motions 2 calculate the standard deviation std of the filtered signal σ ˆ j by 1a σ ˆ j t 1 n t x ˆ j t x j 2 n t 1 1b x j t 1 n t x ˆ j t n t where x ˆ j t means the estimated time series of the filtered signal for sensor j at the time step t n t is the total number of discrete time steps of the signal and x j is the mean value of the filtered signal 3 calculate the standard deviations of the possible vessel response σ r j based on the corresponding wave spectrum and the candidate rao from the rao database 2a σ r j n 1 n ω s x x r j ω n δ ω 2b s x x r j ω h r j ω β w 2 s ζ ζ ω β w where n ω is the total number of discretized frequencies for the response spectrum s x x r j ω is the spectrum for response x s ζ ζ ω β w is the long crested wave spectrum without considering directional spreading s means single sided power spectrum h r j ω β w represents the rao candidate calculated based on vessel parameter combination r for sensor j each possible combination of the considered vessel parameters i e φ i 1 φ i 2 φ i m is subscripted with number r 1 2 n r a o where n r a o m 1 m i m is the total number of vessel parameter combinations and i m is the number of the discretized values of the considered uncertain vessel parameter φ m the possible response std with the r th combination of parameters for the sensor j is denoted by σ r j 4 screen out insensitive sensor measurements with respect to the considered vessel model parameters for the current sea state a new parameter α j named sensor screening ratio ssr is introduced 3a α j σ σ r j σ ˆ j 3b σ σ r j r 1 n r a o σ r j σ r j 2 n r a o 1 3c σ r j r 1 n r a o σ r j n r a o where σ σ r j is the std of σ r j for r 1 2 n r a o the previous study used a screening criterion of α 0 0 05 for a certain sensor j if α j 0 05 then the sensor j will be excluded when updating the parameters ssr basically represents how important the considered vessel parameters are under the current sea state at sensor j 5 calculate the weight factor for each σ r j by 4 w r j 1 σ r j σ ˆ j p where p r is called the power parameter the choice of p value depends on the number of dimensions m for the model tuning the sensitivity and uncertainty range of the considered vessel parameters and the engineering judgment 6 establish the weight matrix w j i e the likelihood function for all possible combinations of vessel parameters in the rao database the weight matrix has the size of i 1 i 2 i m 7 linearly interpolate the weight matrix w j from the size of i 1 i 2 i m variable resolution in the rao database to the size of k 1 k 2 k m variable resolution in the discrete joint probability distribution model 8 update the joint probability distribution p n 1 φ 1 φ 2 φ m by multiplying the prior discrete joint probability density with the weight matrix w j element wise 5 p d f n 1 φ 1 φ m no p d f n φ 1 φ m w j where p d f means the probability density function operator means the element wise multiplication of two matrices i e a hadamard product scheick 1997 no is a normalization operator so that the sum of the probabilities in the joint probability distribution remains 1 0 after every tuning the main idea is to transfer the objective of recursively calculating direction dependent vessel motion raos based on vessel motion measurements and wave information to the statistical inference on the vessel model parameters which are direction independent the benefits are 1 the tuned results also indicate the confidence 2 the tuned results can be used to predict the future vessel responses for different sea states and wave directions 3 problem statement early case studies han et al 2021a indicated the key role of signal filtering for unbiased vessel model tuning results both over filtering and under filtering of signal noise could lead to biased tuning results the high frequency components of the motion signal which are mainly due to the signal noise and the local vibrations can be removed by a lowpass filter for the lowpass filter it is essential to find the optimal cutoff frequency which depends on the sea state vessel dimension and vessel condition however the wave spectrum can be represented in terms of a number of parameters such as h s t p β w wave spreading and spectral shape which in reality may not be accurately described by any of the well known wave spectral types e g pierson moskowitz pm jonswap and thorsethaugen therefore it is difficult to find a general function relating the optimal cutoff frequency to the sea state vessel dimensions and vessel condition in addition due to the random nature of signal noises mathematically accurate expression for the function of the optimal cutoff frequency f l p becomes a challenge this paper focuses on finding the optimal lowpass filter cutoff frequency f l p in order to estimate the energy of the true wave induced first order vessel motion as accurately as possible the signals are assumed to have no low frequency components and therefore only a lowpass filter was required for the signal with the ambition of finding relations between sea states and f l p the analysis scope described in section 3 2 is performed all the analyses were based on one selected vessel with several sensor systems as described in section 3 1 3 1 vessel model the numerical studies are based on an offshore supply vessel osv close to its ballast condition han et al 2021a the primary vessel dimensions are summarized in table 1 the vessel reference coordinate system moves steadily at the vessel forward speed as illustrated in fig 2 the positive x axis along the longitudinal symmetric axis points from the stern to the bow x 0 aft the z axis is pointing vertically upwards from the keel z 0 and the y axis is normal to the x z plane where y 0 is at the vessel longitudinal symmetry plane the wave direction β w follows the same coordinate system i e waves at 180 heading propagate along the negative x axis the rao database was established 1 to generate signals for different locations and responses of the vessel and 2 to evaluate the effects of the adaptive lowpass filter on the model tuning performance based on the early sensitivity studies of the hydrodynamic model parameters in relation to the vessel motions of interest han et al 2020 variation of five vessel parameters was considered for the rao database the considered uncertainty ranges are summarized in table 2 the discrete values for each parameter are evenly distributed within its uncertainty range seakeeping analyses were performed by wasim dnv 2018 from the dnv sesam family applying the rankine panel method kring 1994 running analyses through all wave periods in the time domain the outputs can then be transferred to the frequency domain in order to build the raos a rao database was then established by considering all possible combinations of the discrete values for the five vessel parameters heave responses are often of interest for marine operations e g heavy lift therefore heave raos i e displacement velocity and acceleration at three different locations see fig 2 were included in the rao database for each combination of vessel parameters as described in table 3 9 different measured quantities sensors associated with heave response were considered in the model tuning simulations only zero advancing speed was considered for simplicity in order to avoid dealing with the 3 to 1 mapping problem between the absolute wave frequency and encounter frequency for following waves lewandowski 2004 in total 13 wave headings between 0 and 180 with a 15 interval were considered in the rao database for the 9 sensor measurements 3 2 finding the optimal cutoff frequency it is assumed that the high frequency signal errors can be represented by white noise 6 w n n 0 σ n 2 where the variance of the noise σ n 2 is determined by the signal to noise ratio snr 7 s n r σ x 2 σ n 2 where σ x 2 is the variance of the true signal the response signal can be simulated according to the process in fig 3 blocks in blue are the required inputs which together can uniquely determine the output signal the seed number was used to generate both the relative phase φ n for each frequency component ω n and the noise for each time step a massive amount of vessel heave motion signals were generated by varying all the input parameters in fig 3 in order to investigate the relations between inputs and f l p the considered variation of inputs are summarized in table 4 each simulation lasts for 1 h the time series were generated based on the corresponding response spectrum by application of the following relationships 8a x t n 1 n ω c n ω n cos ω n t φ n 8b c n ω n 2 s x x ω n δ ω 8c s x x ω h x ω β w 2 s ζ ζ ω β w where φ n 0 2 π is a random phase angle which is continuous and

torsethaugen spectrum can be calculated based on the simplified form described in appendix a 2 in dnvgl rp c205 2017 it is the sum of two jonswap spectra described in eq 10 the simplified formulation of the torsethaugen spectrum s t o r ω is different for the case of sea states dominated by wind seas versus those dominated by swells these are distinguished based on the value of the parameter t f 6

using the python scipy package virtanen et al 2020 was applied to filter each signal by application of many different cutoff frequencies f l p 0 05 2 0 hz the optimal cutoff frequency f l p therefore can be determined by comparing the std of the filtered signal σ ˆ x f l p with the std of the true response time series σ x the study tested 25 cutoff frequencies for each signal i e f l p 0 050 0 053 0 056 0 059 0 063 0 067 0 071 0 077 0 083 0 091 0 10 0 111 0 125 0 143 0 167 0 20 0 25 0 30 0 33 0 40 0 50 0 60 0 75 1 0 1 5 2 0 hz 4 data exploration this section aims to identify the most relevant input parameters for the optimal cutoff frequency f l p and to propose a way to find f l p due to the limited number of discretized frequencies and discretized time steps for a given simulation length based on eq 8 the generated response time series will not contain exactly the same power as the response power spectrum fig 4 indicates that there may be up to about a 2 5 error uncertainty for the studied 1 h response realizations with a limited number of discrete frequencies and time steps this approximately corresponds to a snr of 20 the uncertainty can be reduced by increasing the number of discretized frequencies reducing the time series sampling interval and increasing the duration of the realization the studies did not attempt to reduce this error fig 5 shows the overall distribution of the optimal cutoff frequency f l p together with the 5 25 50 75 and 95 percentile values the optimal cutoff frequencies are well concentrated between 0 15 hz and 0 3 hz however further data exploration has to be performed in order to find any possible relation between f l p and the input parameters quantitatively initial data exploration shows that the optimal cutoff frequency f l p can be influenced by the characteristic spectral period e g t p incoming wave direction β w wave spectral shape the sensor location and noise level snr in addition the significant influence from seed variation is also observed the optimal cutoff frequency value from signals with higher snr less noise seems to be more affected by seed variation note that there were very few cases 0 005 that failed to find an optimal cutoff frequency within the tested range 0 05 2 0 hz mostly due to the effects from seed variation and the limitations in accuracy which are associated with numerical calculations based on discrete frequencies and time steps it only happened for snr 100 plots show that the function f l p t p could be well fitted by a linear function e g f l p a t p b or a bi linear function e g f l p a t p b for all t p t 0 f l p c t p d for all t p t 0 however the fitted parameters e g a b t 0 etc depend on many input parameters such as β w wave spectral shape sensor location vessel condition etc therefore it is difficult to find a clear function for the optimal cutoff frequency directly with respect to the wave and sensor inputs i e f l p t p β w spectral type sensor etc 4 1 standard deviation and zero upcrossing period of filtered signals therefore it is of interest to further investigate details on how the standard deviation std and zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p changes with changing cutoff frequency for example figs 6 and 7 show that 1 the optimal cutoff frequency f l p always stays at or near the turning point of the σ ˆ x f l p curve 2 the optimal cutoff frequency f l p is always on the plateau of the t ˆ z f l p curves but not necessarily at the turning point 3 when a larger f l p applies less noise is filtered out but σ ˆ x f l p increases very slowly with increasing f l p for f l p f l p this means that even though applying larger f l p may lead to biased tuning results it is still much safer to use a slightly larger f l p than a slightly smaller f l p relative to f l p the reason for the existence of the plateau in the t ˆ z f l p curve is the clear distinction between the main frequency regions for the true vessel response versus the signal noise in addition the less the noise level is i e larger snr the flatter and longer the plateau will be this is because less noise will have less influence on the overall signal zero upcrossing period therefore it can be helpful to determine the optimal cutoff frequency based on the characteristics of the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves two parameters are introduced representing the absolute values of the normalized slopes of the t ˆ z f l p and σ ˆ x f l p curves the hat operator ˆ means the filtered results the efficiency of increasing or reducing the cutoff frequency on the change of the filtered signal energy is referred to as θ f l p defined by 12 θ f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 where σ ˆ x f l p i means the filtered signal std by application of the cutoff frequency f l p i the effect of increasing or reducing the cutoff frequency on the change of the zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal is referred to as λ f l p 13 γ f l p i t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i t ˆ z f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 where t ˆ z f l p i means the zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal based on the cutoff frequency of f l p i please note that γ is positive when the slope of the t ˆ z f l p curve is negative when f l p i f l p i 1 0 θ f l p i represents the normalized slope of the σ ˆ x f l p curve at f l p i while γ f l p i represents the opposite value of the normalized slope of the t ˆ z f l p curve at f l p i the true response std is in the following defined as σ x the program tested a limited number of discrete f l p values gradually as described in section 3 2 therefore the optimal frequency is actually found by interpolation between the neighboring frequencies f l p i and f l p i 1 where σ ˆ x f l p i σ x σ ˆ x f l p i 1 for f l p i f l p f l p i 1 due to the mentioned findings of the two curves the distributions of the θ and γ values around the optimal cutoff frequency f l p are of great interest to further investigate and these are therefore defined as follows 14a θ σ ˆ x f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 14b θ 0 σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i σ ˆ x f l p i 1 f l p i 1 f l p i 14c θ σ ˆ x f l p i 2 σ ˆ x f l p i 1 σ ˆ x f l p i 2 f l p i 2 f l p i 1 15a γ t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i t ˆ z f l p i f l p i f l p i 1 15b γ 0 t ˆ z f l p i t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i 1 f l p i 1 f l p i 15c γ t ˆ z f l p i 1 t ˆ z f l p i 2 t ˆ z f l p i 2 f l p i 2 f l p i 1 note that the values of θ and γ can be influenced by the resolution of the tested f l p values the histograms of the parameters θ θ 0 θ γ γ 0 and γ are shown in figs 8 and 9 because of the large difference between the bin ranges for the parameters e g θ θ 0 and θ the plotted histograms were normalized for the purpose of easier comparison between them the histogram of each variable considered 100 bins and the histogram was normalized so that the height denoted as h of the histogram plot represents the probability density of the parameter denoted as v the bins are evenly distributed so that δ v v m a x v m i n 100 the plotted normalized histogram plots fulfill 16 i 1 100 h i δ v 1 0 it is clear that θ is highly concentrated in a much smaller θ value range as compared with the distributions of θ and θ 0 however γ γ 0 and γ are all distributed around zero with γ having the smallest variance these observations positively support the findings from figs 6 and 7 the statistical percentile values of all these 6 parameters are summarized in table 5 it is also interesting to find that the uncertainty of θ f l p is highly correlated with the snr larger noise leads to larger variation of θ f l p for different signals seed variation from the same response spectrum however this does not conflict with the previous findings that higher noise leads to less variation of f l p for different signals due to seed variation for the same response spectrum the distributions of θ θ 0 θ become even more distinguishable for a certain snr value e g figs 10 and 11 as shown in table 5 and fig 9 the γ values are small and stable near f l p which means that the optimal cutoff is on the plateau of the t ˆ z f l p curve as γ γ 0 γ are similarly distributed the criterion for γ must be relaxed acting as a supplementary rule for the θ criterion 4 2 proposed strategy to find optimal cutoff frequency due to the large slope of the σ ˆ x f l p curve for f l p f l p it is better to filter slightly less noise than risking to filter out too much energy assuming no low frequency motion the proposed strategy to find the optimal lowpass filter cutoff frequency f l p in order to retain only the signals within the wave frequency region is summarized as follows 1 starting from a small cutoff frequency f l p 1 of e g 0 02 hz filter the noisy signal x t and calculate the std and zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal i e σ ˆ x f l p 1 and t ˆ z f l p 1 2 repeat step 1 by gradually increasing the cutoff frequency f l p i i 2 3 calculate σ ˆ f l p i t ˆ z f l p i θ f l p i and γ f l p i for i 2 3 3 then the first cutoff frequency f l p i where both the values of θ f l p i and γ f l p i meet the preset criteria will be considered as the optimal cutoff frequency denoted as f l p it is not necessary to explicitly define the turning point of the σ ˆ x f l p curve when the resolution of the tested f l p is sufficiently fine θ 0 and θ will be very close and practically it does not matter which of these values is selected based on the statistical distribution of θ and γ summarized in table 5 the following criteria are considered as the base case 17a θ f l p 0 05 17b γ f l p 0 9 the θ f l p 0 05 was chosen based on statistical information about θ 0 and θ so that θ meets the criterion for 95 of the cases and more than half of θ 0 meets the criterion the histograms of θ θ 0 θ indicate that the selected criterion is statistically appropriate as the θ and γ criteria are based on statistics of a case study it cannot guarantee that the present procedure will find the optimal cutoff frequency for all signals therefore one supplementary requirement was introduced to ensure returning an optimal cutoff frequency value for signal filtering i e f l p must be within 0 1 0 9 hz i e 18 f l p 0 1 hz if f l p 0 1 hz 0 9 hz if f l p 0 9 hz f l p otherwise where f l p means the identified optimal cutoff frequency based on the main proposed strategy with the criteria in eq 17 the algorithm are also summarized in pseudo code format 5 test of strategy 5 1 simulated signals the proposed strategy was tested for 500 randomly generated vessel motion signals based on randomly selecting the values of the input parameters summarized in table 6 in total 83 values of f l p 0 06 5 13 hz were considered for the lowpass filter as shown in fig 12 the resolution was gradually increased with decreasing f l p especially for f l p 0 1 0 3 hz different values of θ and γ criteria were also tested as summarized in table 7 the parameter κ was defined in order to evaluate the results of the adaptive filtering based on different criteria 19 κ σ ˆ x f l p σ x where σ ˆ x f l p is the filtered signal std at the found optimal cutoff frequency f l p fig 13 shows the distributions of κ from the 500 test cases table 6 for the 4 different sets of criteria table 7 among the results θ 0 05 with γ 0 9 generally leads to the best filtering results with respect to the response std for which the filtered signal stds are concentrated mostly around the true values the distribution of κ for crit2 shows slightly more spreading when using a smaller γ criterion indicating that γ serves to provide a supplementary criterion for the adaptive filtering process results from crit3 with a much higher θ value are the worst with respect to the filtered signal std the distribution is dramatically skewed to the left indicating that many signals were over filtered this is due to a too relaxed θ criterion crit4 is most strict which however did not lead to better filtering results than the base case crit1 it can be seen in fig 13 that there is a notable skewing to the right indicating that the signals may be under filtered 5 2 on site mru measurements it is interesting to test the proposed strategy by application of on site measurements however it is impossible to know the vessel s true on site response due to the inevitable measurement uncertainties hubbard 2014 therefore it was only possible to test whether or not the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves show similar characteristics as described in section 4 1 and to discuss the limitations it is worth mentioning that the vessel motion signals obtained from mru are already filtered through e g application of an extended kalman filter to avoid drift 5 2 1 gunnerus seakeeping and dp tests the mru measurements of the ntnu research vessel gunnerus during seakeeping and dp tests in 2013 steen et al 2016 were considered two test cases were reported one 2 hour dp test casea1 under a sea state with 2 significant peak periods 8 5 s and 13 3 s and one half hour seakeeping test casea2 with 10 4kn speed under a swell dominated sea state the quickly reduced slopes of the σ ˆ x f l p curves were observed for both cases for all mru measurements with respect to heave pitch and roll e g fig 14 because the received mru signals were already filtered the noise level was low as expected in addition gunnerus is a research vessel with a relatively small dimension about 30 m long and accordingly its resonance response periods are relatively small therefore the t ˆ z f l p curves as expected becomes very flat when the cutoff frequency is sufficiently large it is interesting to observe the reduced slopes for the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves within the wave frequency region for heave and pitch measurements e g fig 15 this is because casea2 was a swell dominated sea condition t p 13 5 s with a small wind sea the vessel was mostly excited within a relatively low frequency region while the vessel response resonance was in a relatively high frequency region due to gunnerus small dimensions therefore there was a clear gap with respect to the frequencies of the excited vessel motion by the swell and the wind sea 5 2 2 normand vision the mru measurements caseb1 from normand vision during a lifting operation in 2017 were also tested the operation lasted for a total of 2 hours the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves for the 2 hour pitch and roll responses are shown in figs 16 and 17 the t ˆ z f l p curve for pitch is not smooth near the turning point for roll motion the t ˆ z f l p curve shows an oscillatory behavior with the t ˆ z value converging around 44 s which is larger than the wave periods a closer look at the time series of pitch and roll motions indicates that the unstable behavior of the t ˆ z f l p curves were due to the additional low frequency motion caused by the lift off and landing operations see fig 18 consequently as shown in fig 19 the vessel trim was also changed due to the change of vessel cog during the operation then a highpass filter with cutoff frequency of 0 04 hz was applied to filter out the low frequency motions before applying the adaptive lowpass filter the updated σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves of roll motion are shown in fig 20 compared with fig 17 the t ˆ z f l p curve in fig 20 becomes smoother and converges to a reasonable value 5 3 influence on the model tuning results so far the proposed adaptive lowpass filter has been shown to be stable with respect to variation of sea states vessel conditions and noise levels this section focuses on investigating how much benefit the model tuning can get from the adaptive lowpass filter with the proposed procedure of finding the optimal cutoff frequency in total 200 model tuning cases were run with both the adaptive lowpass filter and a lowpass filter with a fixed cutoff frequency of 1 0 hz each model tuning case used vessel response measurements and wave information from 6 randomly generated sea states the main wave information the parameters applied to generating measurements and the parameters used for model tuning are summarized in table 8 the true vessel condition and the initial probability distributions of the considered vessel model parameters are summarized in table 9 which is different from the considered vessel condition for algorithm development described in section 3 2 and section 4 it is worth mentioning that the important uncertain vessel parameter β 44 representing the ratio between the additional mainly caused by viscous effect and critical roll damping actually varies with sea states han et al 2021b however a constant true value of β 44 was considered for simplicity the considered vessel parameters were tuned simultaneously compared with the model tuning results with a fixed cutoff frequency of 1 0 hz the results show that the adaptive filter approach statistically improved the accuracy with respect to the expected values see fig 21 and reduced the variance of the considered parameters see fig 22 however the improvements of the less sensitive parameters gmt and r 55 were not very significant particularly in terms of the tuned expected values 6 conclusions and future work an algorithm to find the sea state and vessel dependent optimal cutoff frequency for a lowpass filter has been proposed to improve extracting vessel motions in the wave frequency region from the noisy vessel motion measurement signals it is difficult to find and express the explicit relation between the optimal cutoff frequency and the characteristics of the sea state vessel dimensions and vessel condition in addition the environmental uncertainties are difficult to measure quantify and control the proposed algorithm significantly eases these challenges by introducing two parameters θ and γ based on the statistical characteristics of the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves around the optimal cutoff frequencies and these characteristics are not explicitly linked to any sea state or vessel property applying the algorithm to the vessel model tuning process statistically improves the tuning results however to a limited degree for some parameters due to 1 the numerical errors from std calculations of vessel motions based on discrete time series and spectral densities and 2 the fact that the considered parameters e g gmt and r 55 may not be very sensitive to the involved sea states the improvements in relation to tuning of β 44 and xcg are rather significant because they are more sensitive to the considered vessel motions at the involved sea states it has been found important to choose a reasonable set of criteria for θ and γ a relaxed θ criterion can lead to significant signal over filtering while too strict criteria may cause the signal under filtered too strict criteria may also make the algorithm fail to find the optimal cutoff frequency based on the proposed normal procedure even though the capability of extending the algorithm and the preset θ and γ criteria for other vessel conditions and dimensions has not been fully demonstrated all the validation tests described in section 5 used either different vessel conditions i e sections 5 1 and 5 3 or different vessels i e section 5 2 rather than the one used for deriving the algorithm section 4 this tends to support the hypothesis that the proposed adaptive lowpass filter would work for different vessels and vessel conditions section 5 showed that the algorithm is stable and the on site full scale measurements also fulfill the characteristics of the σ ˆ x f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves as described in section 4 1 the algorithm works because 1 the vessel itself is by nature a lowpass filter of the wave energy therefore the high frequency response normally has much less energy 2 the noise mainly carries energy in the high frequency domain distinguishably outside of the frequency region for the main vessel response sensor misalignment and bias are slowly varying i e with low frequencies 3 signal noise has considerably less energy compared with the true vessel response energy the snr values applied for all presented case studies were higher than 5 the proposed adaptive filter algorithm is believed to be a flexible solution because 1 it does not require to know the weather or vessel conditions 2 it is not directly linked to any specific filter the algorithm uses properties of the standard deviation and zero upcrossing period of the filtered signal which are available for most signal filters even though the present study made use of the fft filter the method can be applied based on any other normal filters of any order as long as the cutoff frequency of that filter model can be explicitly expressed 3 it does not strictly require a stationary condition it has been demonstrated in section 5 2 2 that the σ ˆ f l p and t ˆ z f l p curves for the non stationary signals are similar to the curves for stationary signals e g as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 as discussed in section 4 1 however special attention should be paid to those non stationary conditions which may introduce low frequency components with high energy 4 it is expected to be stable at least for vessels with similar dimensions and displacement more comprehensive analyses should be performed to verify that the proposed adaptive lowpass filter and its preset θ and γ criteria work for other and significantly different vessels and vessel conditions the proposed adaptive lowpass filter requires that the power of the response spectrum should be sufficient in magnitude for frequencies less than the optimal cutoff frequency for a sea state consisting of one wind sea component with a small t p w and one swell component with a large t p s w and with two different directions there might be no wave energy in some periods between t p w and t p s w the proposed method might fail if the search for f l p stops immediately after fulfilling the criteria with respect to θ and λ however this could be solved by continuously checking the θ and γ values with increasing f l p ensuring all the considered f l p values larger than f l p meet the preset θ and γ criteria as well alternatively the algorithm can be modified so that searching f l p starts from the smaller wave spectral peak period e g corresponding to f l p of 1 t p w hz the cases of model tuning considered four uncertain vessel parameters the interpolation and multiplication operators within the 4 dimensional space requires a significant amount of computer memory in reality additional uncertain parameters should be included in the algorithm of model tuning e g vessel heading vessel speed and wave spectrum related parameters such as h s t p β w directional spreading etc as a consequence the methodology could face the common challenge referred to as the curse of dimensionality in connection with discrete bayesian inference gelman et al 2013 modification of the model tuning algorithm should be considered in the future in order to improve the computational efficiency e g by only taking into account the mean vector and covariance matrix of the uncertain vessel parameters han et al 2021c credit authorship contribution

20388,experimental tests on corroded tubular tt joints with and without carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp reinforcement were conducted the failure process load displacement curves and observed failure modes of the tested specimens under axial brace compression were obtained and discussed experimental results indicate that the bearing capacity and stiffness of the corroded tubular tt joints strengthened with six layers of cfrp were improved efficiently the improvement in the static strength was mainly produced by the constraint of cfrp to the chord deformation at the brace chord intersection thereafter finite element analysis on 80 models were conducted to investigate the influence of the number of cfrp laminates corrosion depth and corrosion length on the static strengths of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints with local corrosion parametric study showed that i more layers of cfrp laminates increase both stiffness and ultimate capacity ii the contribution of each layer of cfrp laminates on the bearing capacity reduces gradually with the increase of the number of cfrp laminates or corrosion depth iii after a certain length of cfrp the effect of cfrp length becomes

essential role in the stability of those structures owning to long term corrosion by seawater and servicing environment of offshore platforms irreversible corrosion deterioration at tubular joints can be observed commonly during the inspection of offshore as presented in fig 1 which was taken from an expired offshore platform in bohai sea of china corrosion causes severe deterioration on the offshore platforms therefore it is necessary to improve the resistance of the tubular joints against corrosion defects through a suitable strengthening technique recently researchers conducted extensive investigations to improve the corroded structure s durability by delimiting the effect of corrosion external components were generally employed by many techniques to strengthen the joints in service ding et al 2018 singh et al 2020 yang et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 the mechanical behaviors of tubular joints reinforced with collar plate such as static strength choo et al 2004a 2004b nassiraei et al 2016a 2016b shao 2016 fire resistance gao et al 2015 mohamed et al 2018 nassiraei et al 2018 and hysteretic performance shao et al 2011 have been investigated comprehensively however using steel components to strengthen tubular joints has some deficiencies such as welding residual stresses high self weight low structural endurance and ugly appearance to overcome such deficiencies an alternative method is introduced by strengthening the high stress affected zone of the tubular joints with carbon fiber reinforced polymers cfrp using cfrp to strengthen structures has been a more attractive option because of its advantages such as low cost lightweight corrosion resistance high strength high modulus of elasticity convenient construction flexible operation and short repairing time in the past cfrp was mainly used to strengthen concrete structures in civil engineering in the last two decades cfrp was adopted to strengthen the steel structures zhao and zhang 2007 improving its fatigue behavior alemdar et al 2014 ghanbari ghazijahani et al 2015 kaan et al 2012 wang et al 2016 buckling behavior gao et al 2013 shaat and fam 2006 crushing behavior bambach 2010 impact resistance narmashiri and mehramiz 2016 and static strength fawzia et al 2007 haedir et al 2009 imran et al 2018 jiao and zhao 2004 subsequently some researchers studied using cfrp in strengthening defected steel components such as corroded steel tubes elchalakani 2016 and notch embedded steel cylinders kabir and nazari 2012 all the above studies indicated that cfrp strengthening improves the performance of steel components efficiently for concrete filled steel tubular members cfrp has also been proved to be efficient in enhancing its load carrying capacity dong et al 2013 park and choi 2013 tao et al 2007b wang et al 2017 bending capacity sundarraja and prabhu 2014 wang and shao 2015 zhang et al 2012 cyclic behavior han et al 2010 and impact resistance wang et al 2015 the behavior of fire damaged concrete filled tubular members strengthened with cfrp laminates was also investigated lenwari et al 2016 tao et al 2007a aguilera and fam 2013a 2013b used bonded frp plates to prevent the web buckling of the rectangular t joints the static strengths of circular tubular t k joints strengthened with cfrp were also experimentally and numerically investigated fu et al 2016 lesani et al 2013 2014 prashob et al 2017 khayatazad et al 2017 studied the fatigue performance of tubular x joints strengthened with un bonded cfrp laminates based on the reduction of hot spot stress at the weld toe all the above mentioned studies showed a favorable improvement in the behavior of tubular joints strengthened with cfrp however no relative report on the behavior of corroded tubular joints strengthened by cfrp was found in the literature herein experimental and numerical analysis on the demeanor of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints with initial corrosion defect were carried out in order to provide an assessment on the effectiveness of cfrp strengthening for corroded tubular tt joints two corroded specimens were experimentally tested one was un strengthened and the other was reinforced by six layers of cfrp the experimental tests were followed by numerical analysis on 80 finite element models to study the effects of three main parameters namely corrosion depth corrosion length and the number of cfrp laminates on the ultimate strength and chord ovalization of the corroded tubular tt joints finally a new design formula is proposed on the base of regression analysis 2 experimental test 2 1 specimens geometry two corroded tubular tt joints with circular hollow section including an un strengthened specimen tt 1 and a cfrp strengthened specimen tt 1 c were designed and fabricated the detailed dimensions of the tested specimens given in fig 2 are tabulated in table 1 since the brace to chord intersection of tubular joints is the region with the highest stress gradient corrosion in such region affects the mechanical behavior of tubular joints most seriously in view of this fact a corrosion defect was fabricated around the brace chord intersection by decreasing the chord wall thickness a local uniform corrosion was simulated by machining off partial wall thickness from the outer surface circumference of chord as illustrated in fig 3 whose length l cc width and thickness are 520 mm and 0 3 mm respectively in the current study the grinding method was chosen to fabricate an artificial uniform corrosion instead of the accelerated corrosion method this assumption was based on the physical definition of steel corrosion due to environmental conditions in addition the corrosive effect fabricated by the grinding method is relatively conservative compared with the natural one there are several standards which support this assumption such as kiefner and vieth 1989 and the american society of mechanical engineers asme b31g report 1991 in the asme b31g report 1991 the remaining strength of the corroded tubes is assessed by assuming a consistent depth and length of the corrosion area accordingly the corrosion area of the corroded tubes is calculated by assuming the configuration of the corroded defect is parabolic for short corrosion and rectangular for long corrosion in addition the decision to manufacture the experimental specimens with such a method was based on many previous researchers who followed the same approach benjamin et al 2016 elchalakani et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yeom et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 for example elchalakani et al 2017 employed a grinding process to reduce the steel thickness benjamin et al 2016 used spark erosion to fabricate the uniformly corroded defects with smooth edges and wu et al 2018 also used a milling machine to manufacture uniformly corroded defects besides such a method could accurately simulate the fully corroded joints i e the vicinity of the braces to chord intersection is fully corroded including part of the brace and part of the chord such as the one presented in fig 1 which is the worst case prior to conducting the experimental test on the specimens numerical studies were conducted on corroded tubular tt joints with and without cfrp the pre design results indicated that the brace thickness has a minor effect on the static behavior of the tubular joint thus no corrosion was fabricated on the brace surface at the brace chord intersection in the specimens used for the experimental investigation 2 2 surface preparation and cfrp wrapping in order to facilitate the right bonding conditions between corroded steel surface and cfrp laminates surface preparation should be performed before cfrp application in the bond region of tubular joints the cfrp reinforced joint was prepared in line with the guidelines suggested by fu et al 2016 the outer surface of the bond region of the tubular joint was sandblasted to eliminate rust resulting in a slightly abraded surface for improved adhesion in addition the welding slag near the intersection areas was cleaned by a surface grinder then the bonding area was further washed with acetone finally the cfrp laminates were placed on the bonded region of tt 1 c joint the wrapping of the cfrp laminates on the bonded region for various angles is illustrated in fig 4 fig 5 shows the wrapping and bonding of the cfrp laminates on the joint in tt 1 c specimen six layers of cfrp laminate with a thickness of 0 16 mm each were placed on the designed bonded region the wrapping orientation of each layer along the bonded region of the chord were set as 0 0 45 45 90 and 90 respectively in contrast the cfrp laminates were placed at 90 and 0 alternately along the strengthened region of the braces to provide more reliable reinforcement a length of l ccfrp 1200 mm on the chord which is longer than the corrosion length and a length of l bcfrp 300 mm on the brace were confined by six layers of cfrp laminates table 2 tabulates the number thickness and orientation of the cfrp laminates used for strengthening the cfrp strengthened joint tt c 1 where the parameter n cfrp is the number of cfrp laminates used to strengthen the joint fig 6 displays the corroded tubular joint geometrical measurements in which tables 1 and 2 abbreviations are described 2 3 material properties a total of six coupon specimens were cut out from the same circular tube used to fabricate the joint three from the brace tube and three from the chord tube the tensile coupon samples were crafted following the standard test criteria of the chinese code gb t700 2006 2006 the detailed dimensions of the coupon specimens are presented in fig 7 the mechanical properties of the steel tubes brace and chord were obtained from the uniaxial tensile test for the coupons including the elastic modulus e yield stress σ y ultimate stress σ u and elongation e and are tabulated in table 3 the mechanical properties of the cfrp laminate used to strengthen the specimen tt 1 c are listed in table 4 cfrp has different properties in two orthogonal directions namely primary and secondary directions σ tp σ cp and e p are the tensile strength the compressive strength and the elastic modulus respectively of the cfrp laminates in the primary direction σ ts σ cs and e s are the tensile strength the compressive strength and the elastic modulus respectively of the cfrp laminates in the secondary direction the shear strength τ cfrp and poisson s ratio μ are also provided in table 4 2 4 loading scheme for both specimens of tt 1 and tt 1 c one end the right end of the chord was fixed to the test rig frame through bolts and the other end the left end was simply supported on the steel beam of loading frame which can be regarded as a pin end the end of the horizontally placed brace was also simply supported on a supporter as shown in fig 8 axial compression load was applied at the end of the vertically placed brace and data acquisition system connected to the actuator was employed to monitor the load data automatically during the loading process 3 test results and discussion 3 1 failure mode the failure modes of the un reinforced and the corresponding cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints are illustrated in fig 9 a and b respectively for the un reinforced specimen tt 1 a local concave deformation was observed around the weld toe of the compressed brace therefore local plasticity on the chord surface was the final failure mode of specimen tt 1 for the cfrp strengthened specimen tt 1 c a crisp sound was heard at 122 kn during the loading process and a local slight fracture of cfrp on the chord surface far away from the horizontally supported brace as marked in fig 9 b was observed the failure mode of the cfrp strengthened specimen was also a local concave deformation on the chord surface around the intersection however such concave deformation was reduced dramatically after cfrp strengthening as shown in fig 10 the horizontal axis in fig 10 denotes the distance to the joint crown along the top surface of the chord the crown is the location with a zero value and the vertical axis denotes the local concave deformation of the chord surface before the local plasticity of the chord surface occurs the cfrp laminates sustains high percentage of the applied load the ultimate bearing capacity of the specimens tt 1 and tt 1 c observed from the experimental test were 110 kn and 143 kn respectively compared with corroded specimen un strengthened it was found that the load carrying capacity of the cfrp strengthened tubular tt joint was increased by 30 thus a larger bearing capacity can be achieved by increasing the number of cfrp laminates as declared numerically in section 4 3 2 load displacement curve from the experimental results it was concluded that the peak load was not reached for the tested tubular tt joints within the displacement measuring range these results are consistent with several experimental and numerical studies conducted previously on cfrp strengthened tubular joints several techniques were introduced for tubular joints in the literature that could determine the ultimate strength of tubular joint which does not show distinct peaks on their load displacement curves lu et al 1994 suggested that the ultimate bearing capacity can be achieved when the local deformation of the chord reached 3 of its diameter it also named as the joint ovalization in contrast moffat et al 2001 recommended the twice elastic slope method to determine the tubular joints bearing capacity fig 11 represents the use of the twice elastic slope method to distract the ultimate strength from the load displacement curves in which θ is the slope of the load deformation curve at the elastic stage and ϕ is a function of θ as presented in eq 1 eq 1 ϕ tan 1 2 tan θ the load displacement curves of the two tested specimens tt 1 and tt 1 c are plotted in fig 12 the applied load at the vertical brace end was monitored automatically by the data acquisition system connected to the actuator i e the load displacement curves in fig 12 refer to the displacement at the vertical brace end thus the twice elastic slope method was chosen to determine the ultimate strength of the tested specimens as shown in fig 12 after strengthening with cfrp the tubular tt joint had a higher ultimate load and improved stiffness in the linear stage the chord flexural deflection was reduced and the load carrying capacity was improved with a satisfactory magnitude the tt joint specimen strengthened with cfrp achieved an improvement of 30 in the ultimate load theoretically the load carrying capacity of the tubular joints is proportional to f y t c 2 where f y is the yield stress of the chord member and t c is the wall thickness of chord based on this assumption the decrease of the load carrying capacity for the tubular tt joint with initial corrosion can be estimated approximately accordingly the load carrying capacity of the corresponding tubular tt joint without corrosion defect is calculated as following 5 4 7 2 110 124 5 kn assuming identical material properties of the steel according to this estimate after the chord wall loses about 6 of its original thickness due to corrosion 115 of the load carrying capacity 143 124 5 100 115 of the uncorroded tt joint was achieved by strengthening the joint with six layers of cfrp 4 finite element analysis 4 1 finite element fe modelling to further investigate the strengthening efficiency of cfrp to tubular tt joints with initial corrosion several finite element fe models were established a reference point was set in the center of the endplate and coupled with the endplate to ensure that the axial compressive load applied on the reference point can be transmitted to the brace endplate uniformly the axial compressive load was implemented by introducing vertical downward displacement at the assigned reference point to avert the impact of the boundary condition on the strength of tubular joints the chord length is recommended to be greater than 12 times its radius α 2l c d c 12 the value of α was taken as 15 in the following parametric study the vertical brace was allowed only to move downward vertically solid element c3d8r was selected for the mesh in the discretization of a tubular tt joint and shell element s4r was used to generate the mesh of the cfrp laminates the element size at the brace to chord intersection was smaller in view of the high stress gradient in this region a coarse mesh was adopted to minimize the computing time in the rest of the model the mesh convergence study was conducted to determine the appropriate mesh size in the vicinity of the brace to chord intersection specimens with various element sizes around the intersection of brace and chord mesh size of t c 3 t c 2 t c and 2t c were built and analyzed as shown in fig 13 the influence of element size on analysis result can be ignored after the element size at the vicinity of the brace to chord intersection is reduced to t c along the surface of the tubes and is reduced to t c 3 through the thickness of the tubes where t c is the chord thickness in contrast the mesh size of the rest of the model was increased gradually until it reached up to 3 t c to minimize the computing time both geometric parameters of the joints and material nonlinearity were considered in fe simulations based on the actual dimensions of the experimental specimens and the coupon test results respectively to capture the accurate relationship between axial compression and displacement at the vertical brace end the riks technique was employed in the nonlinear analysis the fe model of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joint with initial corrosion is illustrated in fig 14 fig 14 a shows the mesh model of the cfrps laminates fig 14 b shows the mesh model of the corroded steel joint and fig 14 c shows a close view of the transition zone between the un corroded part and the corroded part of the joint the number directions and thickness of the cfrp laminates were defined by creating composite layers as shown in fig 15 assuming that cfrp laminates and the tube could work compatibly and there is no relative slip between cfrp laminates and the outer surface of the pipes based on the above mentioned assumption the outer surfaces of the tubes were bonded together with the inner surface of the cfrp layer by using a tie constraint the ideal elastic plastic model was used to define the stress strain relation of steels for both chord and braces for cfrp it experiences almost no plastic deformation before final fracture failure furthermore the damage of cfrp is gradual i e the fracture failure of cfrp has an accumulative process when the stress reaches a critical value damage occurs locally in cfrp such damage propagates to a broader region with the stress increase cfrp fractures finally at the ultimate stress to reflect such accumulative failure process hashin 1980 presented a principle for considering the continuous damage these principles were used in the fe model to simulate the failure process of cfrp based on the principle proposed by hashin 1980 four failure models for cfrp can occur namely longitudinal tensile failure of fiber longitudinal compressive failure of fiber transverse tensile failure of fiber and transverse compressive failure of fiber the material properties of the cfrp laminates measured from tests were defined for the finite element models 4 2 verifications study to the knowledge of the authors no published report was accessible in the literature on the analysis of the static strength of corroded tubular tt joint strengthened with externally bonded cfrp laminates under axial compression load therefore prior to conducting the parametric study on the corroded tubular tt joint strengthened with bonded cfrp laminates the precision of the fe outcomes in assessing the tubular bearing capacity tt joints were guaranteed by comparing with the experimental results conducted in the current study and by lesani et al 2014 the failure modes and the load displacement curves obtained from fe simulations were compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively the failure mode of the un strengthened specimen tt 1 is illustrated in fig 16 a and b the yielding of the chord surface around the weld toe on the opposite side of the horizontal brace was observed from the fe simulation as shown in fig 16 b such yielding is in accordance with the deformation of corresponding region observed in tested specimen as shown in fig 16 a the failure mode of the tt 1 c was also yielding of the chord surface around the weld toe on the opposite side of the horizontal brace as shown in fig 16 d however the yielding region is much smaller due to the reinforcement of cfrp additionally a local fracture of cfrp in this region was observed in the test as shown in fig 16 c overall the fe simulation accurately predicted the failure modes of both un strengthened and cfrp strengthened corroded tubular tt joints under the condition of axial compression force applied on brace end fig 17 a shows the load displacement curves obtained where ex and fe denote experimental results gained in the current study and the corresponding fe results obtained by the proposed fe models respectively as fig 17 a shows the proposed fe model accurately estimates the load carrying capacity and the stiffness in the linear and elastic stage of the un strengthened joint tt 1 and the cfrp strengthened joint tt 1 c hence the fe model presented in this study can be used reliably for analyzing the failure process of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints with initial corrosion in order to further verify the proposed fe models lesani et al 2014 experimental results on cfrp strengthened tubular t joints were simulated and compared with the results obtained by using the proposed fe simulation method the detailed geometrical dimensions of t joints along with the number of cfrp laminates can be found in lesani et al 2014 as can be seen in fig 17 b the load displacement curve obtained from the current fe models is almost identical with the experimental results presented by lesani et al 2014 therefore the proposed fe model can accurately assess the failure mode and ultimate strength of the cfrp strengthened tubular joint 5 parametric study 5 1 geometries of fe models in this section nonlinear static analysis was carried out to examine the strengthening efficiency of cfrp for the corroded tubular joint under axial compression in total 80 models were generated in the parametric study where the remaining thickness of the corroded chord t cc 0 6t c 0 7 t c 0 8 t c 0 9 t c and 1 0 t c corroded length of the chord l cc 1 0d c 1 5d c 2 0d c and 2 5d c and layers of cfrp laminates n cfrp 0 3 6 and 9 layers were selected as the variable parameters to study their influence on the static strength of the corroded tt joints for more accurate prediction on the ultimate strength of a corroded tubular joint the effect of the brace corrosion was considered in the fe models in contrast the remaining thickness of the corroded brace t bc along the brace corroded length l bc was calculated as t bc t b t c t cc assuming homogeneous corrosion in both chord and braces where t b t bc are the wall thicknesses of brace prior to and after corrosion respectively and t c t cc are the wall thicknesses of chord prior to and after corrosion respectively the brace length was taken as five times of its original diameter d b the length of cfrp bonded on chord and brace indicated as l ccfrp and l bcfrp respectively was assumed as a function of the corroded length i e l ccfrp 1 5 l cc for chord and l bcfrp 1 5 l bc for brace table 5 represents the assumed geometry of the fe models 5 2 fe results and discussions structural repair of offshore steel structural utilising cfrp composites in underwater or marine conditions is a very relevant topic for the industry for this regard 80 fe were established in the current paper aiming to provide a guidance to improve the corroded tubular tt joints durability by delimiting the effect of corrosion therefore the research carried in the current paper is of exceptional quality novel and can be utilised by the offshore industry to great benefit in rehabilitation of corroded offshore platforms fig 18 shows the ultimate strength of the considered 80 cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints in current study as shown in the figure the bearing capacity is improved by increasing the number of cfrp laminates and is reduced by decreasing the t cc t c ratio this result indicating that cfrp laminate not only acts as ani corroded material but also acts as rehabilitation material and confining material as a result the stiffness of the tubular tt joints increased and accordingly the ovalization of the brace to chord intersection decreased it is also observed that the effect of the corrosion length can be ignored if the brace to chord intersection is corroded with lcc dc more details discussion on the influence of each considered parameters are described in the following subsections in addition based on the established fe models a new parametric equation is proposed for estimating the bearing capacity of the corroded tubular tt joints and calculating the number of cfrp layers required to restore the full bearing capacity of the corroded tubular joints 5 2 1 influence of the number of cfrp laminates n cfrp the effect of n cfrp on the chord ovalization and the bearing capacity of uncorroded corroded tubular tt joints is illustrated in fig 19 in which some representative load ovalization curves of corroded uncorroded tubular tt joints are provided as fig 19 shows with the increase of n cfrp the chord ovalization was decreased and the ultimate strength was increased this is because the cfrp laminates act as a constrain at the brace to chord intersection as a result the chord ovalization was reduced i e the joint stiffness was increased in order to further investigate the influence of n cfrp on the bearing capacity under different condition fig 20 presents the influence of n cfrp on the bearing capacity of tubular tt joints with different l cc and t cc t c ratio as can be seen in fig 20 the ultimate strength of the tubular joints increases due to the rise of n cfrp independently of the corrosion depth and the corrosion length the same conclusion also observed by the other scholars in literature such as deng et al 2021 for t joints and fu et al 2016 for k joints concluding that the use of cfrp laminates increases the stiffness of tubular joints to indicate the improvement in the joint stiffness after confining with cfrp the increase of the joint initial stiffness was derived from the load ovalization curve fig 18 a and tabulated in table 6 as presented in table 6 the initial stiffness of the tt joint strengthened with 9 layers of cfrp laminated increases by 31 besides the applied load to obtain ovalization of 3 d c in the same joint was also increased by 26 thus it is evident that the joint stiffness was improved with the increase of the number of cfrp layers the increase of the joint stiffness leads to decrease the ovalization of the chord as discussed in detail in the next paragraph in order to further investigate the impact of cfrp laminates on the chord ovalization the lateral ovalization of the chord diameter at the brace to chord intersection was extracted from the fe results the fe results of the uncorroded tt joints t cc t c 1 and corroded tt joint t cc t c 0 8 were selected to examine the influence of the number of cfrp layer on the chord hoop ovalization as shown in fig 21 the chord hoop stiffnesses increase with the increase of n cfrp subsequently the chord hoop ovalization decreases due to cfrp strengthening in addition the reduction of the joint stiffness during the elastic and plastic stages was noticeable it can also be observed that the more cfrp layers were used the less chord hoop ovalization was observed table 7 represents the enhancement of the ultimate capacity with the rise of n cfrp compared with corroded joints before reinforcement when the uncorroded tt joint was reinforced by nine cfrp layers n cfrp 9 the ultimate capacity was increased by 54 kn however with the same cfrp reinforcement n cfrp 9 the ultimate capacity of the corroded joint with t cc t c 0 6 was raised only by 44 28 kn almost a reduction of 19 in the contribution of cfrp compared with the uncorroded joint therefore it could be concluded that the effectiveness of the cfrp reinforcement on the ultimate capacity of the tubular joint was reduced gradually in the joints with lower values of t cc t c in other words the tubular joints with more corroded depth require more cfrp layers to achieve the same enhancement in the bearing capacity compared with the corresponding joint with shallow corroded depth or uncorroded joint table 8 presents the enhancement of the ultimate capacity due to the cfrp reinforcement in uncorroded t cc t c 1 and corroded t cc t c 0 9 0 8 0 7 0 6 tt joints compared with the ultimate capacity of the corroded joins before reinforcements whereas table 9 shows the contribution of each layer of cfrp laminates in percentage as presented in tables 8 and 9 compared with the unreinforced corroded joint when t c t cc decreases the influence of n cfrp increases this phenomenon is contributed to the reduction of corroded joint ultimate capacity compared with the corresponding uncorroded joint for example the ultimate strength of the uncorroded joint l cc 2d t cc t cc 1 and n cfrp 0 increased 20 from 189 8 to 238 53 kn after reinforcement by six layers of cfrp laminates while the corroded joint ultimate capacity l cc 2d t c t cc 0 7 and n cfrp 0 experienced a growth of 32 from 116 72 kn to 154 02 kn after reinforcement by six layers of cfrp laminates furthermore as shown in table 9 the contribution of each layer of the cfrp laminates on the ultimate strength of the joint reduces by raising the number of cfrp 5 2 2 influence of corrosion depth this section aims to study the influence of corrosion depth the loss of chord wall thickness due to corrosion on the ultimate capacity of the tubular tt joints the influence of corrosion depth on the chord ovalization and ultimate strength of tubular tt joints is investigated in fig 22 and in fig 23 in which some representative curves are provided fig 22 shows the corrosion influence on the chord ovalization at the brace to chord intersection where fig 23 represents the effect of corrosion depth on the ultimate strength it is evident that the chord ovalization decreases with the increase of the corrosion depth besides the ultimate strength of the tt joint decreases gradually with the increase of the corrosion depth this is mainly because of reducing the chord wall thickness at the brace to cord intersection the areas with high stress concentration due to corrosion such a reduction in the chord wall thickness leads to the impairments of the strength and stiffness of joints table 10 shows the reduction of the ultimate strength caused by the increase of the corrosion depth compared with cfrp strengthened uncorroded joints as can be seen in table 10 the bearing capacity loss of joint is increased gradually with the rise of n cfrp for example at t cc t c 0 6 the tt joint with n cfrp 3 and n cfrp 9 lost about 116 92 kn and 125 kn respectively compared with its corresponded uncorroded joint with the same layer of cfrp this is due to the reduction of the contribution of each layer of cfrp laminated in highly corroded joints as observed in the previous section and table 9 thus it can be concluded that each cfrp layer contributes more strength for the joint with higher initial bearing capacity table 11 presents the residual bearing capacity of uncorroded t cc t c 1 and corroded t cc t c 0 9 0 8 0 7 0 6 tubular tt joints compared with the ultimate capacity of the uncorroded joints before reinforcements with cfrp it can be observed that three layers of cfrp laminates sufficiently lead to 97 of the uncorroded tt joint bearing capacity achieved in the case of t cc t c 0 9 in comparison nine layers of cfrp laminates also provide 97 the same ultimate strength of the ultimate capacity of the uncorroded tt joint at t cc t c 0 8 to study the impact of joint corrosion on the chord ovalization the lateral ovalization of the chord diameter at the brace to chord intersection was extracted from the fe results the fe results of the corroded joint without cfrp strengthening n cfrp 0 fig 24 a and with 6 layers cfrp n cfrp 6 fig 24 b were chosen to investigate such influence as shown in fig 24 due to corrosion the chord hoop stiffness decreases and the chord hoop ovalization increases in addition the reduction of the joint stiffness during the elastic range due to corrosion was obvious as concluded in table 6 it can also be observed that the more corroded depth in the tubular joint the larger chord hoop ovalization occurred 5 3 influence of corrosion length l cc the influence of corrosion length on chord ovalization and ultimate strength of corroded tt joints is investigated in this section l cc d c 1 5d c 2d c and 2 5d c as fig 25 shows l cc has a minor effect on the chord ovalization and ultimate strength of tubular tt joint it is worth noting that within the range of the corrosion length considered in this study l cc d c l cc does not influence the ultimate strength stiffness and chord ovalization of the tubular tt joints 6 parametric equation this section aims to establish a new formula for calculating the influence of corrosion and strengthening with cfrp on the ultimate capacity of the chs tt joints three non dimensional variables are considered in the proposed formula namely t cc t c n cfrp and l cc d c as observed in the parametric study the contribution of each cfrp layer reduced with the decrease of t cc t c therefore to consider such influence the hybrid effect of t cc t c and n cfrp is considered in the design model of the parametric equation i e each term considers its correlation with the other terms finally the general format of the proposed formula is represented as multiple exponential products eq 2 eq 2 δ m t cc t c m 1 1 n cfrp m 2 1 l cc d c m 3 100 through several fitting attempts lsqcurvefit function in matlab programing language which could solve nonlinear curve fitting problems in a least squares sense is proved to be the most effective method in calculating the exponent factors m m1 m2 and m3 eq 3 6 eq 3 m 13 2460 ln t cc t c 2 0 0971 ln n cfrp 1 2 0 0318 ln l cc d c 1 2 eq 4 m 1 4 8182 4 4878 ln t cc t c 2 0 0250 ln n cfrp 1 2 eq 5 m 2 0 1786 0 3989 ln t cc t c 2 0 0218 ln n cfrp 1 2 eq 6 m 3 0 1594 0 1388 ln t cc t c 2 0 0046 ln n cfrp 1 2 0 0435 ln l cc d c 1 2 a comparative analysis between the proposed formula eq 2 and the fe results was conducted to assess the accuracy of the proposed formula as shown in fig 26 the predicted results from the proposed formula and the simulation results are almost identical in addition the mean square error mse of the results calculated by eq 7 was almost equal to 1 therefore the suggested formula is thus considered to be accurate eq 7 mse 2 1 i 1 n δ eq δ fe 2 i 1 n δ f e 2 0 9996 the bearing capacity of the corroded tt joint after reinforcement by cfrp laminates f u cor or and cfrp can then be calculated based on the capacity of the unstrengthen uncorroded tt joint f u as follows eq 8 f u cor or and cfrp 1 δ 100 f u currently several standards provide formulas for the bearing capacity calculation of chs tt joint in the chinese code for design of steel structure gb50017 2017 2017 the formula is suggested as eq 9 eq 9 f u 11 51 d c t c 0 2 ψ ao ψ n ψ d t c 2 f where ψ ao ψ n and ψ d are three non dimensional parameters that consider the tubular tt joints geometry and the mechanical properties of the steel used according to the chinese code for design of steel structure ψ ao ψ n and ψ d can be calculated through the following equations eq 10 12 eq 10 ψ ao 1 28 0 64 a 0 d c 1 1 eq 11 ψ n 1 0 3 σ f y 0 3 σ f y 2 eq 12 ψ d 0 069 0 93 d c d b i f d c d b 0 7 2 d c d b 0 68 i f d c d b 0 7 where a0 is the transverse clearance of the two braces d c is the chord diameter d b is the brace diameter and f y is the yield stress of the used steel 7 conclusions experimental and numerical investigation on the strengthening efficiency of cfrp to tubular tt joint with initial corrosion defect were carried out in this study two corroded specimens were experimentally tested the first one without cfrp in contrast the second one was strengthened with six layers of cfrp the experimental tests were followed by numerical analysis on 80 fe models conducted by abaqus to study the effects of corrosion depth corrosion length and the number of cfrp laminates on the ultimate strength of the tt joints finally the experimental and numerical results support the following conclusions 1 cfrp reinforcement minimized the local deformation of the chord surface around the weld toe efficiently i e the chord ovalization at the intersection is restricted and the stiffness of the tt joint is improved 2 cfrp reinforcement reduced the area of the yielding region on the chord surface around the intersection because it produces constraints to the chord local deformation due to such constraint the bearing capacity of the experimentally tested tubular tt joints with initial corrosion is improved by 30 after strengthening with 6 layers of cfrp which is about 115 of the ultimate load of a corresponding un strengthened un corroded tubular tt joint 3 finite element model based on compatibility between cfrp and chord surface provides an accurate prediction of both the failure process and the ultimate load of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints hence cfrp and chord surface can be assumed to work compatibly i e both experienced the same strain level before failure 4 with more layers of cfrp laminate the joint ovalization decreases around the intersection of brace and chord and subsequently the bearing capacity increased 5 with the increase of the corrosion depth lower value of t cc t c the tubular tt joint loses its stiffness and ultimate strength 6 the corrosion length has a neglectable effect on the ovalization and ultimate capacity of tubular tt joints if it is larger than the yielding region around the brace to chord intersection 7 a new design equation is proposed to calculate the ultimate capacity of the cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints containing initial corrosion defect credit authorship contribution statement hazem samih mohamed data curation

20388,experimental tests on corroded tubular tt joints with and without carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp reinforcement were conducted the failure process load displacement curves and observed failure modes of the tested specimens under axial brace compression were obtained and discussed experimental results indicate that the bearing capacity and stiffness of the corroded tubular tt joints strengthened with six layers of cfrp were improved efficiently the improvement in the static strength was mainly produced by the constraint of cfrp to the chord deformation at the brace chord intersection thereafter finite element analysis on 80 models were conducted to investigate the influence of the number of cfrp laminates corrosion depth and corrosion length on the static strengths of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints with local corrosion parametric study showed that i more layers of cfrp laminates increase both stiffness and ultimate capacity ii the contribution of each layer of cfrp laminates on the bearing capacity reduces gradually with the increase of the number of cfrp laminates or corrosion depth iii after a certain length of cfrp the effect of cfrp length becomes

essential role in the stability of those structures owning to long term corrosion by seawater and servicing environment of offshore platforms irreversible corrosion deterioration at tubular joints can be observed commonly during the inspection of offshore as presented in fig 1 which was taken from an expired offshore platform in bohai sea of china corrosion causes severe deterioration on the offshore platforms therefore it is necessary to improve the resistance of the tubular joints against corrosion defects through a suitable strengthening technique recently researchers conducted extensive investigations to improve the corroded structure s durability by delimiting the effect of corrosion external components were generally employed by many techniques to strengthen the joints in service ding et al 2018 singh et al 2020 yang et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 the mechanical behaviors of tubular joints reinforced with collar plate such as static strength choo et al 2004a 2004b nassiraei et al 2016a 2016b shao 2016 fire resistance gao et al 2015 mohamed et al 2018 nassiraei et al 2018 and hysteretic performance shao et al 2011 have been investigated comprehensively however using steel components to strengthen tubular joints has some deficiencies such as welding residual stresses high self weight low structural endurance and ugly appearance to overcome such deficiencies an alternative method is introduced by strengthening the high stress affected zone of the tubular joints with carbon fiber reinforced polymers cfrp using cfrp to strengthen structures has been a more attractive option because of its advantages such as low cost lightweight corrosion resistance high strength high modulus of elasticity convenient construction flexible operation and short repairing time in the past cfrp was mainly used to strengthen concrete structures in civil engineering in the last two decades cfrp was adopted to strengthen the steel structures zhao and zhang 2007 improving its fatigue behavior alemdar et al 2014 ghanbari ghazijahani et al 2015 kaan et al 2012 wang et al 2016 buckling behavior gao et al 2013 shaat and fam 2006 crushing behavior bambach 2010 impact resistance narmashiri and mehramiz 2016 and static strength fawzia et al 2007 haedir et al 2009 imran et al 2018 jiao and zhao 2004 subsequently some researchers studied using cfrp in strengthening defected steel components such as corroded steel tubes elchalakani 2016 and notch embedded steel cylinders kabir and nazari 2012 all the above studies indicated that cfrp strengthening improves the performance of steel components efficiently for concrete filled steel tubular members cfrp has also been proved to be efficient in enhancing its load carrying capacity dong et al 2013 park and choi 2013 tao et al 2007b wang et al 2017 bending capacity sundarraja and prabhu 2014 wang and shao 2015 zhang et al 2012 cyclic behavior han et al 2010 and impact resistance wang et al 2015 the behavior of fire damaged concrete filled tubular members strengthened with cfrp laminates was also investigated lenwari et al 2016 tao et al 2007a aguilera and fam 2013a 2013b used bonded frp plates to prevent the web buckling of the rectangular t joints the static strengths of circular tubular t k joints strengthened with cfrp were also experimentally and numerically investigated fu et al 2016 lesani et al 2013 2014 prashob et al 2017 khayatazad et al 2017 studied the fatigue performance of tubular x joints strengthened with un bonded cfrp laminates based on the reduction of hot spot stress at the weld toe all the above mentioned studies showed a favorable improvement in the behavior of tubular joints strengthened with cfrp however no relative report on the behavior of corroded tubular joints strengthened by cfrp was found in the literature herein experimental and numerical analysis on the demeanor of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints with initial corrosion defect were carried out in order to provide an assessment on the effectiveness of cfrp strengthening for corroded tubular tt joints two corroded specimens were experimentally tested one was un strengthened and the other was reinforced by six layers of cfrp the experimental tests were followed by numerical analysis on 80 finite element models to study the effects of three main parameters namely corrosion depth corrosion length and the number of cfrp laminates on the ultimate strength and chord ovalization of the corroded tubular tt joints finally a new design formula is proposed on the base of regression analysis 2 experimental test 2 1 specimens geometry two corroded tubular tt joints with circular hollow section including an un strengthened specimen tt 1 and a cfrp strengthened specimen tt 1 c were designed and fabricated the detailed dimensions of the tested specimens given in fig 2 are tabulated in table 1 since the brace to chord intersection of tubular joints is the region with the highest stress gradient corrosion in such region affects the mechanical behavior of tubular joints most seriously in view of this fact a corrosion defect was fabricated around the brace chord intersection by decreasing the chord wall thickness a local uniform corrosion was simulated by machining off partial wall thickness from the outer surface circumference of chord as illustrated in fig 3 whose length l cc width and thickness are 520 mm and 0 3 mm respectively in the current study the grinding method was chosen to fabricate an artificial uniform corrosion instead of the accelerated corrosion method this assumption was based on the physical definition of steel corrosion due to environmental conditions in addition the corrosive effect fabricated by the grinding method is relatively conservative compared with the natural one there are several standards which support this assumption such as kiefner and vieth 1989 and the american society of mechanical engineers asme b31g report 1991 in the asme b31g report 1991 the remaining strength of the corroded tubes is assessed by assuming a consistent depth and length of the corrosion area accordingly the corrosion area of the corroded tubes is calculated by assuming the configuration of the corroded defect is parabolic for short corrosion and rectangular for long corrosion in addition the decision to manufacture the experimental specimens with such a method was based on many previous researchers who followed the same approach benjamin et al 2016 elchalakani et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yeom et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 for example elchalakani et al 2017 employed a grinding process to reduce the steel thickness benjamin et al 2016 used spark erosion to fabricate the uniformly corroded defects with smooth edges and wu et al 2018 also used a milling machine to manufacture uniformly corroded defects besides such a method could accurately simulate the fully corroded joints i e the vicinity of the braces to chord intersection is fully corroded including part of the brace and part of the chord such as the one presented in fig 1 which is the worst case prior to conducting the experimental test on the specimens numerical studies were conducted on corroded tubular tt joints with and without cfrp the pre design results indicated that the brace thickness has a minor effect on the static behavior of the tubular joint thus no corrosion was fabricated on the brace surface at the brace chord intersection in the specimens used for the experimental investigation 2 2 surface preparation and cfrp wrapping in order to facilitate the right bonding conditions between corroded steel surface and cfrp laminates surface preparation should be performed before cfrp application in the bond region of tubular joints the cfrp reinforced joint was prepared in line with the guidelines suggested by fu et al 2016 the outer surface of the bond region of the tubular joint was sandblasted to eliminate rust resulting in a slightly abraded surface for improved adhesion in addition the welding slag near the intersection areas was cleaned by a surface grinder then the bonding area was further washed with acetone finally the cfrp laminates were placed on the bonded region of tt 1 c joint the wrapping of the cfrp laminates on the bonded region for various angles is illustrated in fig 4 fig 5 shows the wrapping and bonding of the cfrp laminates on the joint in tt 1 c specimen six layers of cfrp laminate with a thickness of 0 16 mm each were placed on the designed bonded region the wrapping orientation of each layer along the bonded region of the chord were set as 0 0 45 45 90 and 90 respectively in contrast the cfrp laminates were placed at 90 and 0 alternately along the strengthened region of the braces to provide more reliable reinforcement a length of l ccfrp 1200 mm on the chord which is longer than the corrosion length and a length of l bcfrp 300 mm on the brace were confined by six layers of cfrp laminates table 2 tabulates the number thickness and orientation of the cfrp laminates used for strengthening the cfrp strengthened joint tt c 1 where the parameter n cfrp is the number of cfrp laminates used to strengthen the joint fig 6 displays the corroded tubular joint geometrical measurements in which tables 1 and 2 abbreviations are described 2 3 material properties a total of six coupon specimens were cut out from the same circular tube used to fabricate the joint three from the brace tube and three from the chord tube the tensile coupon samples were crafted following the standard test criteria of the chinese code gb t700 2006 2006 the detailed dimensions of the coupon specimens are presented in fig 7 the mechanical properties of the steel tubes brace and chord were obtained from the uniaxial tensile test for the coupons including the elastic modulus e yield stress σ y ultimate stress σ u and elongation e and are tabulated in table 3 the mechanical properties of the cfrp laminate used to strengthen the specimen tt 1 c are listed in table 4 cfrp has different properties in two orthogonal directions namely primary and secondary directions σ tp σ cp and e p are the tensile strength the compressive strength and the elastic modulus respectively of the cfrp laminates in the primary direction σ ts σ cs and e s are the tensile strength the compressive strength and the elastic modulus respectively of the cfrp laminates in the secondary direction the shear strength τ cfrp and poisson s ratio μ are also provided in table 4 2 4 loading scheme for both specimens of tt 1 and tt 1 c one end the right end of the chord was fixed to the test rig frame through bolts and the other end the left end was simply supported on the steel beam of loading frame which can be regarded as a pin end the end of the horizontally placed brace was also simply supported on a supporter as shown in fig 8 axial compression load was applied at the end of the vertically placed brace and data acquisition system connected to the actuator was employed to monitor the load data automatically during the loading process 3 test results and discussion 3 1 failure mode the failure modes of the un reinforced and the corresponding cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints are illustrated in fig 9 a and b respectively for the un reinforced specimen tt 1 a local concave deformation was observed around the weld toe of the compressed brace therefore local plasticity on the chord surface was the final failure mode of specimen tt 1 for the cfrp strengthened specimen tt 1 c a crisp sound was heard at 122 kn during the loading process and a local slight fracture of cfrp on the chord surface far away from the horizontally supported brace as marked in fig 9 b was observed the failure mode of the cfrp strengthened specimen was also a local concave deformation on the chord surface around the intersection however such concave deformation was reduced dramatically after cfrp strengthening as shown in fig 10 the horizontal axis in fig 10 denotes the distance to the joint crown along the top surface of the chord the crown is the location with a zero value and the vertical axis denotes the local concave deformation of the chord surface before the local plasticity of the chord surface occurs the cfrp laminates sustains high percentage of the applied load the ultimate bearing capacity of the specimens tt 1 and tt 1 c observed from the experimental test were 110 kn and 143 kn respectively compared with corroded specimen un strengthened it was found that the load carrying capacity of the cfrp strengthened tubular tt joint was increased by 30 thus a larger bearing capacity can be achieved by increasing the number of cfrp laminates as declared numerically in section 4 3 2 load displacement curve from the experimental results it was concluded that the peak load was not reached for the tested tubular tt joints within the displacement measuring range these results are consistent with several experimental and numerical studies conducted previously on cfrp strengthened tubular joints several techniques were introduced for tubular joints in the literature that could determine the ultimate strength of tubular joint which does not show distinct peaks on their load displacement curves lu et al 1994 suggested that the ultimate bearing capacity can be achieved when the local deformation of the chord reached 3 of its diameter it also named as the joint ovalization in contrast moffat et al 2001 recommended the twice elastic slope method to determine the tubular joints bearing capacity fig 11 represents the use of the twice elastic slope method to distract the ultimate strength from the load displacement curves in which θ is the slope of the load deformation curve at the elastic stage and ϕ is a function of θ as presented in eq 1 eq 1 ϕ tan 1 2 tan θ the load displacement curves of the two tested specimens tt 1 and tt 1 c are plotted in fig 12 the applied load at the vertical brace end was monitored automatically by the data acquisition system connected to the actuator i e the load displacement curves in fig 12 refer to the displacement at the vertical brace end thus the twice elastic slope method was chosen to determine the ultimate strength of the tested specimens as shown in fig 12 after strengthening with cfrp the tubular tt joint had a higher ultimate load and improved stiffness in the linear stage the chord flexural deflection was reduced and the load carrying capacity was improved with a satisfactory magnitude the tt joint specimen strengthened with cfrp achieved an improvement of 30 in the ultimate load theoretically the load carrying capacity of the tubular joints is proportional to f y t c 2 where f y is the yield stress of the chord member and t c is the wall thickness of chord based on this assumption the decrease of the load carrying capacity for the tubular tt joint with initial corrosion can be estimated approximately accordingly the load carrying capacity of the corresponding tubular tt joint without corrosion defect is calculated as following 5 4 7 2 110 124 5 kn assuming identical material properties of the steel according to this estimate after the chord wall loses about 6 of its original thickness due to corrosion 115 of the load carrying capacity 143 124 5 100 115 of the uncorroded tt joint was achieved by strengthening the joint with six layers of cfrp 4 finite element analysis 4 1 finite element fe modelling to further investigate the strengthening efficiency of cfrp to tubular tt joints with initial corrosion several finite element fe models were established a reference point was set in the center of the endplate and coupled with the endplate to ensure that the axial compressive load applied on the reference point can be transmitted to the brace endplate uniformly the axial compressive load was implemented by introducing vertical downward displacement at the assigned reference point to avert the impact of the boundary condition on the strength of tubular joints the chord length is recommended to be greater than 12 times its radius α 2l c d c 12 the value of α was taken as 15 in the following parametric study the vertical brace was allowed only to move downward vertically solid element c3d8r was selected for the mesh in the discretization of a tubular tt joint and shell element s4r was used to generate the mesh of the cfrp laminates the element size at the brace to chord intersection was smaller in view of the high stress gradient in this region a coarse mesh was adopted to minimize the computing time in the rest of the model the mesh convergence study was conducted to determine the appropriate mesh size in the vicinity of the brace to chord intersection specimens with various element sizes around the intersection of brace and chord mesh size of t c 3 t c 2 t c and 2t c were built and analyzed as shown in fig 13 the influence of element size on analysis result can be ignored after the element size at the vicinity of the brace to chord intersection is reduced to t c along the surface of the tubes and is reduced to t c 3 through the thickness of the tubes where t c is the chord thickness in contrast the mesh size of the rest of the model was increased gradually until it reached up to 3 t c to minimize the computing time both geometric parameters of the joints and material nonlinearity were considered in fe simulations based on the actual dimensions of the experimental specimens and the coupon test results respectively to capture the accurate relationship between axial compression and displacement at the vertical brace end the riks technique was employed in the nonlinear analysis the fe model of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joint with initial corrosion is illustrated in fig 14 fig 14 a shows the mesh model of the cfrps laminates fig 14 b shows the mesh model of the corroded steel joint and fig 14 c shows a close view of the transition zone between the un corroded part and the corroded part of the joint the number directions and thickness of the cfrp laminates were defined by creating composite layers as shown in fig 15 assuming that cfrp laminates and the tube could work compatibly and there is no relative slip between cfrp laminates and the outer surface of the pipes based on the above mentioned assumption the outer surfaces of the tubes were bonded together with the inner surface of the cfrp layer by using a tie constraint the ideal elastic plastic model was used to define the stress strain relation of steels for both chord and braces for cfrp it experiences almost no plastic deformation before final fracture failure furthermore the damage of cfrp is gradual i e the fracture failure of cfrp has an accumulative process when the stress reaches a critical value damage occurs locally in cfrp such damage propagates to a broader region with the stress increase cfrp fractures finally at the ultimate stress to reflect such accumulative failure process hashin 1980 presented a principle for considering the continuous damage these principles were used in the fe model to simulate the failure process of cfrp based on the principle proposed by hashin 1980 four failure models for cfrp can occur namely longitudinal tensile failure of fiber longitudinal compressive failure of fiber transverse tensile failure of fiber and transverse compressive failure of fiber the material properties of the cfrp laminates measured from tests were defined for the finite element models 4 2 verifications study to the knowledge of the authors no published report was accessible in the literature on the analysis of the static strength of corroded tubular tt joint strengthened with externally bonded cfrp laminates under axial compression load therefore prior to conducting the parametric study on the corroded tubular tt joint strengthened with bonded cfrp laminates the precision of the fe outcomes in assessing the tubular bearing capacity tt joints were guaranteed by comparing with the experimental results conducted in the current study and by lesani et al 2014 the failure modes and the load displacement curves obtained from fe simulations were compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively the failure mode of the un strengthened specimen tt 1 is illustrated in fig 16 a and b the yielding of the chord surface around the weld toe on the opposite side of the horizontal brace was observed from the fe simulation as shown in fig 16 b such yielding is in accordance with the deformation of corresponding region observed in tested specimen as shown in fig 16 a the failure mode of the tt 1 c was also yielding of the chord surface around the weld toe on the opposite side of the horizontal brace as shown in fig 16 d however the yielding region is much smaller due to the reinforcement of cfrp additionally a local fracture of cfrp in this region was observed in the test as shown in fig 16 c overall the fe simulation accurately predicted the failure modes of both un strengthened and cfrp strengthened corroded tubular tt joints under the condition of axial compression force applied on brace end fig 17 a shows the load displacement curves obtained where ex and fe denote experimental results gained in the current study and the corresponding fe results obtained by the proposed fe models respectively as fig 17 a shows the proposed fe model accurately estimates the load carrying capacity and the stiffness in the linear and elastic stage of the un strengthened joint tt 1 and the cfrp strengthened joint tt 1 c hence the fe model presented in this study can be used reliably for analyzing the failure process of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints with initial corrosion in order to further verify the proposed fe models lesani et al 2014 experimental results on cfrp strengthened tubular t joints were simulated and compared with the results obtained by using the proposed fe simulation method the detailed geometrical dimensions of t joints along with the number of cfrp laminates can be found in lesani et al 2014 as can be seen in fig 17 b the load displacement curve obtained from the current fe models is almost identical with the experimental results presented by lesani et al 2014 therefore the proposed fe model can accurately assess the failure mode and ultimate strength of the cfrp strengthened tubular joint 5 parametric study 5 1 geometries of fe models in this section nonlinear static analysis was carried out to examine the strengthening efficiency of cfrp for the corroded tubular joint under axial compression in total 80 models were generated in the parametric study where the remaining thickness of the corroded chord t cc 0 6t c 0 7 t c 0 8 t c 0 9 t c and 1 0 t c corroded length of the chord l cc 1 0d c 1 5d c 2 0d c and 2 5d c and layers of cfrp laminates n cfrp 0 3 6 and 9 layers were selected as the variable parameters to study their influence on the static strength of the corroded tt joints for more accurate prediction on the ultimate strength of a corroded tubular joint the effect of the brace corrosion was considered in the fe models in contrast the remaining thickness of the corroded brace t bc along the brace corroded length l bc was calculated as t bc t b t c t cc assuming homogeneous corrosion in both chord and braces where t b t bc are the wall thicknesses of brace prior to and after corrosion respectively and t c t cc are the wall thicknesses of chord prior to and after corrosion respectively the brace length was taken as five times of its original diameter d b the length of cfrp bonded on chord and brace indicated as l ccfrp and l bcfrp respectively was assumed as a function of the corroded length i e l ccfrp 1 5 l cc for chord and l bcfrp 1 5 l bc for brace table 5 represents the assumed geometry of the fe models 5 2 fe results and discussions structural repair of offshore steel structural utilising cfrp composites in underwater or marine conditions is a very relevant topic for the industry for this regard 80 fe were established in the current paper aiming to provide a guidance to improve the corroded tubular tt joints durability by delimiting the effect of corrosion therefore the research carried in the current paper is of exceptional quality novel and can be utilised by the offshore industry to great benefit in rehabilitation of corroded offshore platforms fig 18 shows the ultimate strength of the considered 80 cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints in current study as shown in the figure the bearing capacity is improved by increasing the number of cfrp laminates and is reduced by decreasing the t cc t c ratio this result indicating that cfrp laminate not only acts as ani corroded material but also acts as rehabilitation material and confining material as a result the stiffness of the tubular tt joints increased and accordingly the ovalization of the brace to chord intersection decreased it is also observed that the effect of the corrosion length can be ignored if the brace to chord intersection is corroded with lcc dc more details discussion on the influence of each considered parameters are described in the following subsections in addition based on the established fe models a new parametric equation is proposed for estimating the bearing capacity of the corroded tubular tt joints and calculating the number of cfrp layers required to restore the full bearing capacity of the corroded tubular joints 5 2 1 influence of the number of cfrp laminates n cfrp the effect of n cfrp on the chord ovalization and the bearing capacity of uncorroded corroded tubular tt joints is illustrated in fig 19 in which some representative load ovalization curves of corroded uncorroded tubular tt joints are provided as fig 19 shows with the increase of n cfrp the chord ovalization was decreased and the ultimate strength was increased this is because the cfrp laminates act as a constrain at the brace to chord intersection as a result the chord ovalization was reduced i e the joint stiffness was increased in order to further investigate the influence of n cfrp on the bearing capacity under different condition fig 20 presents the influence of n cfrp on the bearing capacity of tubular tt joints with different l cc and t cc t c ratio as can be seen in fig 20 the ultimate strength of the tubular joints increases due to the rise of n cfrp independently of the corrosion depth and the corrosion length the same conclusion also observed by the other scholars in literature such as deng et al 2021 for t joints and fu et al 2016 for k joints concluding that the use of cfrp laminates increases the stiffness of tubular joints to indicate the improvement in the joint stiffness after confining with cfrp the increase of the joint initial stiffness was derived from the load ovalization curve fig 18 a and tabulated in table 6 as presented in table 6 the initial stiffness of the tt joint strengthened with 9 layers of cfrp laminated increases by 31 besides the applied load to obtain ovalization of 3 d c in the same joint was also increased by 26 thus it is evident that the joint stiffness was improved with the increase of the number of cfrp layers the increase of the joint stiffness leads to decrease the ovalization of the chord as discussed in detail in the next paragraph in order to further investigate the impact of cfrp laminates on the chord ovalization the lateral ovalization of the chord diameter at the brace to chord intersection was extracted from the fe results the fe results of the uncorroded tt joints t cc t c 1 and corroded tt joint t cc t c 0 8 were selected to examine the influence of the number of cfrp layer on the chord hoop ovalization as shown in fig 21 the chord hoop stiffnesses increase with the increase of n cfrp subsequently the chord hoop ovalization decreases due to cfrp strengthening in addition the reduction of the joint stiffness during the elastic and plastic stages was noticeable it can also be observed that the more cfrp layers were used the less chord hoop ovalization was observed table 7 represents the enhancement of the ultimate capacity with the rise of n cfrp compared with corroded joints before reinforcement when the uncorroded tt joint was reinforced by nine cfrp layers n cfrp 9 the ultimate capacity was increased by 54 kn however with the same cfrp reinforcement n cfrp 9 the ultimate capacity of the corroded joint with t cc t c 0 6 was raised only by 44 28 kn almost a reduction of 19 in the contribution of cfrp compared with the uncorroded joint therefore it could be concluded that the effectiveness of the cfrp reinforcement on the ultimate capacity of the tubular joint was reduced gradually in the joints with lower values of t cc t c in other words the tubular joints with more corroded depth require more cfrp layers to achieve the same enhancement in the bearing capacity compared with the corresponding joint with shallow corroded depth or uncorroded joint table 8 presents the enhancement of the ultimate capacity due to the cfrp reinforcement in uncorroded t cc t c 1 and corroded t cc t c 0 9 0 8 0 7 0 6 tt joints compared with the ultimate capacity of the corroded joins before reinforcements whereas table 9 shows the contribution of each layer of cfrp laminates in percentage as presented in tables 8 and 9 compared with the unreinforced corroded joint when t c t cc decreases the influence of n cfrp increases this phenomenon is contributed to the reduction of corroded joint ultimate capacity compared with the corresponding uncorroded joint for example the ultimate strength of the uncorroded joint l cc 2d t cc t cc 1 and n cfrp 0 increased 20 from 189 8 to 238 53 kn after reinforcement by six layers of cfrp laminates while the corroded joint ultimate capacity l cc 2d t c t cc 0 7 and n cfrp 0 experienced a growth of 32 from 116 72 kn to 154 02 kn after reinforcement by six layers of cfrp laminates furthermore as shown in table 9 the contribution of each layer of the cfrp laminates on the ultimate strength of the joint reduces by raising the number of cfrp 5 2 2 influence of corrosion depth this section aims to study the influence of corrosion depth the loss of chord wall thickness due to corrosion on the ultimate capacity of the tubular tt joints the influence of corrosion depth on the chord ovalization and ultimate strength of tubular tt joints is investigated in fig 22 and in fig 23 in which some representative curves are provided fig 22 shows the corrosion influence on the chord ovalization at the brace to chord intersection where fig 23 represents the effect of corrosion depth on the ultimate strength it is evident that the chord ovalization decreases with the increase of the corrosion depth besides the ultimate strength of the tt joint decreases gradually with the increase of the corrosion depth this is mainly because of reducing the chord wall thickness at the brace to cord intersection the areas with high stress concentration due to corrosion such a reduction in the chord wall thickness leads to the impairments of the strength and stiffness of joints table 10 shows the reduction of the ultimate strength caused by the increase of the corrosion depth compared with cfrp strengthened uncorroded joints as can be seen in table 10 the bearing capacity loss of joint is increased gradually with the rise of n cfrp for example at t cc t c 0 6 the tt joint with n cfrp 3 and n cfrp 9 lost about 116 92 kn and 125 kn respectively compared with its corresponded uncorroded joint with the same layer of cfrp this is due to the reduction of the contribution of each layer of cfrp laminated in highly corroded joints as observed in the previous section and table 9 thus it can be concluded that each cfrp layer contributes more strength for the joint with higher initial bearing capacity table 11 presents the residual bearing capacity of uncorroded t cc t c 1 and corroded t cc t c 0 9 0 8 0 7 0 6 tubular tt joints compared with the ultimate capacity of the uncorroded joints before reinforcements with cfrp it can be observed that three layers of cfrp laminates sufficiently lead to 97 of the uncorroded tt joint bearing capacity achieved in the case of t cc t c 0 9 in comparison nine layers of cfrp laminates also provide 97 the same ultimate strength of the ultimate capacity of the uncorroded tt joint at t cc t c 0 8 to study the impact of joint corrosion on the chord ovalization the lateral ovalization of the chord diameter at the brace to chord intersection was extracted from the fe results the fe results of the corroded joint without cfrp strengthening n cfrp 0 fig 24 a and with 6 layers cfrp n cfrp 6 fig 24 b were chosen to investigate such influence as shown in fig 24 due to corrosion the chord hoop stiffness decreases and the chord hoop ovalization increases in addition the reduction of the joint stiffness during the elastic range due to corrosion was obvious as concluded in table 6 it can also be observed that the more corroded depth in the tubular joint the larger chord hoop ovalization occurred 5 3 influence of corrosion length l cc the influence of corrosion length on chord ovalization and ultimate strength of corroded tt joints is investigated in this section l cc d c 1 5d c 2d c and 2 5d c as fig 25 shows l cc has a minor effect on the chord ovalization and ultimate strength of tubular tt joint it is worth noting that within the range of the corrosion length considered in this study l cc d c l cc does not influence the ultimate strength stiffness and chord ovalization of the tubular tt joints 6 parametric equation this section aims to establish a new formula for calculating the influence of corrosion and strengthening with cfrp on the ultimate capacity of the chs tt joints three non dimensional variables are considered in the proposed formula namely t cc t c n cfrp and l cc d c as observed in the parametric study the contribution of each cfrp layer reduced with the decrease of t cc t c therefore to consider such influence the hybrid effect of t cc t c and n cfrp is considered in the design model of the parametric equation i e each term considers its correlation with the other terms finally the general format of the proposed formula is represented as multiple exponential products eq 2 eq 2 δ m t cc t c m 1 1 n cfrp m 2 1 l cc d c m 3 100 through several fitting attempts lsqcurvefit function in matlab programing language which could solve nonlinear curve fitting problems in a least squares sense is proved to be the most effective method in calculating the exponent factors m m1 m2 and m3 eq 3 6 eq 3 m 13 2460 ln t cc t c 2 0 0971 ln n cfrp 1 2 0 0318 ln l cc d c 1 2 eq 4 m 1 4 8182 4 4878 ln t cc t c 2 0 0250 ln n cfrp 1 2 eq 5 m 2 0 1786 0 3989 ln t cc t c 2 0 0218 ln n cfrp 1 2 eq 6 m 3 0 1594 0 1388 ln t cc t c 2 0 0046 ln n cfrp 1 2 0 0435 ln l cc d c 1 2 a comparative analysis between the proposed formula eq 2 and the fe results was conducted to assess the accuracy of the proposed formula as shown in fig 26 the predicted results from the proposed formula and the simulation results are almost identical in addition the mean square error mse of the results calculated by eq 7 was almost equal to 1 therefore the suggested formula is thus considered to be accurate eq 7 mse 2 1 i 1 n δ eq δ fe 2 i 1 n δ f e 2 0 9996 the bearing capacity of the corroded tt joint after reinforcement by cfrp laminates f u cor or and cfrp can then be calculated based on the capacity of the unstrengthen uncorroded tt joint f u as follows eq 8 f u cor or and cfrp 1 δ 100 f u currently several standards provide formulas for the bearing capacity calculation of chs tt joint in the chinese code for design of steel structure gb50017 2017 2017 the formula is suggested as eq 9 eq 9 f u 11 51 d c t c 0 2 ψ ao ψ n ψ d t c 2 f where ψ ao ψ n and ψ d are three non dimensional parameters that consider the tubular tt joints geometry and the mechanical properties of the steel used according to the chinese code for design of steel structure ψ ao ψ n and ψ d can be calculated through the following equations eq 10 12 eq 10 ψ ao 1 28 0 64 a 0 d c 1 1 eq 11 ψ n 1 0 3 σ f y 0 3 σ f y 2 eq 12 ψ d 0 069 0 93 d c d b i f d c d b 0 7 2 d c d b 0 68 i f d c d b 0 7 where a0 is the transverse clearance of the two braces d c is the chord diameter d b is the brace diameter and f y is the yield stress of the used steel 7 conclusions experimental and numerical investigation on the strengthening efficiency of cfrp to tubular tt joint with initial corrosion defect were carried out in this study two corroded specimens were experimentally tested the first one without cfrp in contrast the second one was strengthened with six layers of cfrp the experimental tests were followed by numerical analysis on 80 fe models conducted by abaqus to study the effects of corrosion depth corrosion length and the number of cfrp laminates on the ultimate strength of the tt joints finally the experimental and numerical results support the following conclusions 1 cfrp reinforcement minimized the local deformation of the chord surface around the weld toe efficiently i e the chord ovalization at the intersection is restricted and the stiffness of the tt joint is improved 2 cfrp reinforcement reduced the area of the yielding region on the chord surface around the intersection because it produces constraints to the chord local deformation due to such constraint the bearing capacity of the experimentally tested tubular tt joints with initial corrosion is improved by 30 after strengthening with 6 layers of cfrp which is about 115 of the ultimate load of a corresponding un strengthened un corroded tubular tt joint 3 finite element model based on compatibility between cfrp and chord surface provides an accurate prediction of both the failure process and the ultimate load of cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints hence cfrp and chord surface can be assumed to work compatibly i e both experienced the same strain level before failure 4 with more layers of cfrp laminate the joint ovalization decreases around the intersection of brace and chord and subsequently the bearing capacity increased 5 with the increase of the corrosion depth lower value of t cc t c the tubular tt joint loses its stiffness and ultimate strength 6 the corrosion length has a neglectable effect on the ovalization and ultimate capacity of tubular tt joints if it is larger than the yielding region around the brace to chord intersection 7 a new design equation is proposed to calculate the ultimate capacity of the cfrp strengthened tubular tt joints containing initial corrosion defect credit authorship contribution statement hazem samih mohamed data curation

20389,many coastal countries are concerned with sustainable energy generation to meet their current and future energy needs tidal energy is an attractive resource as in stream turbines can generate electricity even at moderate flow velocities however not all coastal areas are equally well suited for tidal energy development the survey of potential locations and their power densities is a crucial step in evaluating the potential cost benefit of tidal energy this research surveys the intensity and distribution of offshore tidal energy along whole coastline of china based on a high resolution numerical simulation with a minimum mesh spacing of 80 m the finite volume community ocean model fvcom has been used to carry out the numerical simulation work since fvcom uses an unstructured mesh it can accurately identify complex coastlines such as those along islands waterways and estuaries the simulation period for this numerical survey is 30 days the accuracy of the simulation results is validated using 8 days in situ measurements obtained at 17 coastal stations in the region of study research results indicate that the total mean tidal energy is 1 19 1014 j along the coastline of china the tidal energy is mainly distributed in the south and southeast of the coastline of china this study also identifies 45 23 and 9 top sites where the averaged tidal energy density is greater than 500 1000 and 1500 w m2 respectively suitable for tidal energy extraction and utilization considering the long development cycle of tidal energy and global climate change this study also investigates the impact of sea level rise slr on tidal energy distribution in the region of study using a 50 year 0 5 m and 100 year 1 0 m slr scenarios it is found that the total mean tidal energy increases by 3 0 and 6 5 for 50 year and 100 year slr scenarios respectively it is believed that the findings drawn from this study could be instructive for future utilization of tidal energy along the coastline of china keywords tidal energy numerical model high resolution sea level rise renewable energy 1 introduction with the continually growing energy demands to support growing economies and populations around the world there is strong interest and future need in developing sustainable solutions for producing the required energy international energy agency predicts that the global economy will grow at an average rate of 3 4 per year and a population growth from 7 8 billion today to over 9 billion in 2040 although global energy needs are estimated to rise more slowly than in the past they will still expand by a substantial 30 between today and 2040 world wind energy report 2017 marine energy has great potential for sustainable development especially in coastal areas where there are many advanced megacities with the deepening of the understanding of the ocean marine resources i e wave wind and tidal energies become the focus of the development of renewable energy among various renewable energies tidal energy is an attractive source of marine renewable energy because of the high predictability of tidal current clarke et al 2006 lewis et al 2015 neill et al 2015 2016 meanwhile lewis et al 2014 and mcnaughton et al 2019 investigated the influences of the temporal variability of tidal energy on the electrical grid system they found that the high predictability and quality of tidal energy can assure that the power generated from marine turbines can be incorporated into conventional grids in high efficiency with a low cost in storing tidal energy can be generally harvested in two main ways namely damming and turbines the first approach is to block a bay with a dam that contains numerous sluices and turbines the seawater enters the bay at spring tide and is released at low tide to drive turbines to generate power therefore this kind of tidal energy generation relying on impoundment are confined to hyper tidal systems one example is the rance tidal power station in brittany france which has a peak output of 240 mw and an average capacity of about 100 mw generating power not only at low tide but also during floods bernstein et al 1997 however this type of tidal energy conversion has significant environmental implications parker 1993 at the same time the construction cost of such power generating facilities is expensive which is not conducive to the sustainable development of coastal zones the research work of kirby and retière 2009 revealed that the increase in the permanent subtidal area has led to changes in the estuarine ecosystem the closure of the rance dam resulted in greater biodiversity increased habitat diversity richer fish species and higher species and population of birds in the estuarine another tidal energy generating method is to install marine turbines at field sites with high flow velocity 1 m s in this method tidal energy can be generated by converting the kinetic energy contained in periodic ebbs into electricity through an array of turbines myers and bahaj 2010 afgan et al 2013 neill et al 2012 compared to the first tidal energy generating approach marine turbines can directly extract the kinetic energy of tidal currents to generate electricity for instance the meygen tidal energy project and nova innovation are now installing some of the world s first pre commercial turbine arrays in caithness county and the shetland islands of scotland uk de dominicis et al 2017 in these projects marine turbines are fixed at the seabed and run at low rotating speed to reduce the environmental impacts liu et al 2011 although the second tidal energy generating method does not require water storage facility the tidal energy cannot be generated in a controlled manner because of the temporal evolution of tidal flow therefore it is necessary to evaluate the temporal variation of tidal current energy recently new marine turbine technologies are emerging douglas et al 2008 such as the open centre turbine openhydro in 2006 seagen marine current turbines in 2008 hs1000 andritz hydro hammerfest in 2012 nova m100 nova innovation in 2016 and ar1500 atlantis resources corp in 2017 de dominicis et al 2017 these new technologies are also fueling the potential interest in harnessing tidal energy in addition marine turbine arrays have become the main form of tidal energy extraction because they are easy to operate and maintain tide is a natural phenomenon occurring in coastal areas it refers to the periodic movement of sea water under the tide generating forces of celestial bodies mainly the moon and the sun usually tidal currents are small in deep waters whereas the tidal current can be considerably accelerated around headlands or through constrictions as a result tidal energy is often not sufficient to support electricity generation economically in most coastal areas tidal energy is most easily extracted in places where there are strong currents between islands near headlands or at the entrance to estuaries garrett and cummins 2004 since not all coastal areas are equally well suited for tidal energy development the survey of potential locations and their tidal energy densities is a crucial step in evaluating the potential cost benefit of tidal energy based on high resolution bathymetry data and computational mesh tang et al 2014a b numerically evaluated the coastal tidal energy density and distribution along the complex coastline of new jersey usa guillou et al 2018 used the tidal current harmonic database to study the temporal and spatial variations of the current energy sources around france chen et al 2013a 2017 evaluated the tidal energy distributions around penghu islands and the golden gate area of taiwan besides mejia olivares et al 2018 studied the distribution of tidal energy in the gulf of california mexico the prerequisite of tidal energy extraction is to investigate the distribution and temporal evolution of tidal energy in the region of study currently numerical modelling and on site measurement are two main assessment methods as to numerical modelling researchers usually apply two or three dimensional hydrodynamic models to evaluate tidal energy at regional scales recently chen and liu 2017 used the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism to study the distribution of tidal energy of the penghu islands in taiwan considering the effects of four slr 0 87m 1 11m 1 40m 1 90m scenarios on the evolution of tidal energy they concluded that slr tends to increase the tidal energy near these islands tang and his colleagues tang et al 2014a b applied the finite volume community ocean model fvcom to carry out the high resolution tidal energy survey along the shoreline of new jersey usa they pointed out that the high resolution simulation can play a significant role in evaluating the intensity and distribution of tidal energy wang and yang 2017 also applied fvcom to evaluate the potential of extracting tidal energy from the small tidal channels in puget bay at the northwestern coast of washington usa their results indicated that smaller channels can only extract relatively less tidal energy than main channels but they are still suitable for tidal energy extraction and will be considered in the future in addition the hydrodynamic models can also be used to analyze the interaction between the tidal flow and the turbine array so as to more accurately evaluate the power generation efficiency of marine turbines goward brown et al 2017 on site measurement mainly employs acoustic doppler current profilers adcp to measure the velocity distribution along the water depth adcp can also determine the tidal current velocity over time for instance tidal energy survey was conducted in the southern and western parts of south korea by measuring tidal current velocity at 264 sites over a 29 day period byun et al 2013 vennell assessed the tidal energy of the new zealand cook straight and the entrance channel to kaipara harbor by measuring the local volume flux and the bottom drag coefficient vennell 2011 although tidal current data can be directly from field measurements the process is time consuming and expensive meanwhile it is difficult to measure tidal current data over a large area with acceptable accuracy and resolution hence it is not cost effective or practical to determine the appropriate locations for the installations of marine turbine arrays through large scale field investigations with the development of computer hardware and numerical methods combined with high resolution coastline and bathymetry data hydrodynamic models have become an important technical means to evaluate the distribution of tidal energy over large wave bodies nevertheless field measurements can provide important validation data for numerical simulations besides before the implementation of engineering practice of tidal energy extraction it is necessary to measure the tidal flow data in the construction area to ensure the smooth implementation of the project therefore the measured data of tidal current are indispensable china is located on the west coast of the pacific ocean with a long coastline and numerous islands so the potential for developing tidal energy is huge most modern metropolises are located on the eastern seaboard where energy demand is high in addition due to the limitations of existing energy infrastructure and natural factors electricity is generally transmitted from the central and western regions to the coastal areas therefore tidal energy as a clean and renewable energy source can alleviate the energy shortage of coastal cities in china to a certain extent however due to the late development of tidal energy technology the exploitation and utilization of tidal energy along the coastline of china has not been extensively studied which is worthy of further investigation liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 so far surveys of tidal power in china have focused on small coastal areas or islands gao et al 2015 chen et al 2007 or carried out only sparse field measurements national bureau of statistics of china 2008 overall tidal energy surveys along the coastline of china have not been carried out in a thorough and detailed way to make up for the shortcomings of previous researches this work uses high resolution numerical simulation method to investigate the distribution of tidal energy in the whole coastal area of china hoping to determine the local coastal regions with good prospects for tidal energy development with the massive emissions of greenhouse gases global warming can lead to sea level rise slr which will affect coastal environmental responses such as storm surges estuary sediments and human economic activities yin et al 2017 as a long term investment project of tidal energy development and utilization it is necessary to consider the impacts of slr tang et al 2014a b chen and liu 2017 idier et al 2017 the work selects 50 years and 100 years as the research periods to study impacts of slr on the intensity and distribution of tidal energy 2 data and model description 2 1 region of study data sources the region of study locates at the western pacific ranging from 15 81 n to 40 96 n and 105 69 e to 133 8 e it composed of four main regions i e bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and south china sea as shown in fig 1 the water depth in the continental shelf area roughly ranges from 2 m to 100 m representing common water depth for tidal energy development numerous islands and narrow water passages are included such as zhoushan islands to resolve the complex coastlines of region of study a set of unstructured mesh consisting of 685 620 triangular elements and 381 607 nodes were generated in consideration of computational efficiency and nearshore terrain features a nested mesh method was adopted to divide the region of study into internal and external regions in mesh generation processes the interior region extends 7 km from the coastline and the mesh resolution along the shoreline is about 80 m the external region uses relatively coarser mesh gradually transitioning from 2 km to open boundaries 50 km away from the coastline as shown in fig 2 in the computation bathymetry data in the deep water region adopts the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 30 arc second 1 km global bathymetric dataset gebco http www gebco net data and products gridded bathymetrydata it was largely generated by combining quality controlled ship depth soundings with interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite derived gravity data in the shallow water region the bathymetry data of the 16 electronic charts of china aviation insurance department is used which has an averaged resolution of 100 m in this paper a smooth transition is made between the bathymetry data from two different sources the observation data published by the national oceanographic information center china nmdc http mds nmdis org cn is applied to verify the computational capability of the numerical model in this study given that marine turbine arrays are to be installed for decades effects of sea level rise slr on the tidal energy have to be assessed the 2014 report released by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc indicated that the combined effects of seawater thermal expansion and glacial recession account for about 75 of global sea level rise ipcc 2014 it is indicated a rate of global sea level rise is 0 18 cm year during 1961 2003 mainly due to melting glaciers it is also noted that a much greater slr occurred during the last 10 years of the study period 1993 2003 about 0 3 cm year peltier 2001 according to the ipcc 5th assessment report a global mean slr of 0 25 m is likely by 2046 2065 regardless of greenhouse gas emission scenario and the likely range for the high emissions scenarios is 50 100 cm by 2100 church et al 2013 some scholars also have studied future slr in some parts of china for the coming decades for example shi et al 2008 considered the settlement of region of study and predicted that the sea level rise in the guangdong province of china in 2030 and 2050 is 30 cm and 50 cm respectively besides the state oceanic administration estimates that the sea level in guangdong will rise by 75 155 cm in the next 30 years state oceanic administration 2016 zhang et al 2004 estimated that the sea level in the region of pearl river estuary of china is to rise by 30 cm by 2030 in this study we consider slr scenarios of 0 5 m and 1 0 m to roughly to represent 50 year and 100 year slr conditions 2 2 model description and calibration the fvcom is a three dimensional 3d community ocean circulation model based on the unstructured finite volume method which originally developed by chen et al 2003 the 3d primitive equations consist of continuity momentum in cartesian coordinate which are given by 1 u t

discretized by the second order upwind scheme and the vertical diffusion is solved implicitly by the central difference method for more details regarding fvcom readers are referred to chen et al 2003 2013b a generalized terrain following coordinate system is adopted in fvcom to capture the complex topography of the seafloor in the vertical direction egbert et al 1995 non overlapping unstructured triangular mesh is used in the horizontal plane fvcom consists of one external mode and one internal mode depth averaged two dimensional 2d governing equations are solved in the external mode and three dimensional 3d governing equations are solved in internal model the turbulence closure is met by adopting the mellor and yamada level 2 5 in this study 7 σ mesh layers are adopted in the vertical direction the results were analyzed based on depth averaged velocity in the computation three open boundaries are considered locating at the south east and northeast of the region of study where the time series of water elevations are imposed to drive the simulation the time series of water elevations imposed at the open boundaries are obtained using the matlab tool tpxo7 2 of the global tidal model of otps which considers 13 tidal components including 8 main components m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 two long periods mf mm and three nonlinearities m4 ms4 and mn4 the dry and wet boundary treatment techniques are applied to account for the fluctuations of water surface elevation in the coastal region the computational capability of fvcom is validated using 8 days in situ observations at 17 stations located along the coastline of china the verification period is from july 5 2018 to july 13 2018 utc 8 and the whole simulation period lasted for a month the longitudes and latitudes of the observation stations are listed in table 1 and their locations are shown in fig 1 comparisons of time series of water surface elevation are shown in fig 3 unfortunately due to a lack of observation data the current speed and corresponding current directions could not be validated mean absolute error mae was used to assess the simulation accuracy which is given by 5 m a e 1 n y y ˆ we calculated the mae for the comparisons of water surface elevation at each of the observation stations the mae for stations zd12 zd17 is in the range of 0 06 0 15 m for zd09 zd11 and zd02 zd07 the mae are in the range of 0 19 0 25 m the mae for stations zd01 and zd08 is relatively large and are 0 46 and 0 58 m respectively the main reasons for these discrepancies are due to the inaccuracy of local bathymetry data and the relatively large tide amplitude at the station sites generally as demonstrated in fig 3 it is seen that the predicted water surface elevations are in good agreement with the corresponding observations the fvcom is capable to accurately reproduce the observed tidal elevations at most locations and is also expected to have the similar accuracy in the rest of study region 3 evaluation of tidal energy in this study tidal energy is assessed using formulas proposed by tang et al 2014a b the kinematic energy e within a flow domain φ can be calculated as 6 e φ 1 2 ρ v 2 d φ where ρ is the density of seawater v is the depth averaged velocity the average kinematic energy e within the computational domain over time period of t can be expressed as 7 e 1 t 0 t φ 1 2 ρ v 2 d φ d t to evaluate the tidal kinematic energy tidal power density p also known as tidal power is defined as 8 p 1 2 ρ v 3 which represents the tidal kinematic energy passing unit cross section area during unit time the averaged power density p over a time period of t at a specified location can be computed as 9 p 1 t 0 t 1 2 ρ v 3 d t in addition the total tidal kinematic energy flux p ˆ can be calculated along a line ϕ at a certain distance from the coastline which can be calculated as 10 p ˆ 1 2 ρ v 3 d ϕ which can be applied to evaluate the total tidal power within a study region the averaged total tidal kinematic energy flux is determined as 11 p 1 t 0 t 1 2 ρ v 3 d ϕ d t 4 results 4 1 assessment of tidal energy and distribution 4 1 1 tidal energy distribution to evaluate the tidal energy distribution in the coastal waters of china the averaged tidal power density during the time period of 29 days is calculated by eq 9 and is plotted in fig 4 the averaged tidal power density ranges from 150 w m2 to 3000 w m2 it is seen that most coastal waters have low tidal power density except some local regions of the yellow sea the east china sea the northern coast of the taiwan strait and the south china sea fig 4a examples are the yalu river estuary fig 4 b xiaochangshan island fig 4c hangzhou bay fig 4f taiwan strait coastal areas of fujian and guangdong province fig 4g h and i qiongzhou strait and beihai area along the coast of guangxi province fig 4j and k obviously regions with relatively high tidal power density value usually locate in the places where many islands or narrow channels exist as tide current approaches at islands or channels from the open sea to coastal region the tidal current velocity is to increase due to the constriction effects from both vertical rising seafloor and horizonal plane islands and channels meanwhile because p is scaled to v 3 a small amount increase in tidal current velocity can cause a large amount increase in tidal power density thus locations with high tidal power density are usually found in the vicinity regions of islands or narrow channels along coastlines tang et al 2014a b 4 1 2 estimate of tidal energy near the coastline the total tidal kinematic energy is calculated using eq 6 for the coastal waters within 3 km from the coastline of china during the time period of july 8th to july 30th 2018 since the tidal kinematic energy is strongly influenced by tidal periodicity the total tidal kinematic energy e varies between 3 99 1013 and 2 57 1014 j for the coastal waters within 3 km reach of the coastline as shown in fig 5 a the averaged total tidal kinematic energy over the selected time period is e 1 19 1014 j furthermore the total kinematic energy flux p ˆ across the boundary 3 km away from the coastline was calculated using eq 10 the time series of p ˆ is plotted in fig 5b which ranges 4 77 107 w to 5 39 108 w the averaged value is p 2 03 108 w 4 1 3 examples of tidal energy variations over a day at two sites july 13 2018 tides are periodic elevation fluctuations of seawater under the action of celestial bodies beyond the well known spring neap tidal cycle that describes the interaction between m2 and s2 there are a number of other harmonic signals within tidal spatial variation china has a long coastline over 18 000 km local differences in semi diurnal and diurnal forcing constituents can result in tidal range spanning from strongly semi diurnal to strongly diurnal the tidal form in the region of study can be typically represented by form ratio f proposed by pond and pickard 1978 as 12 f h k 1 h o 1 h m 2 h s 2 where h represents the amplitudes of tidal elevation f 3 indicates diurnal tides whereas f 0 25 indicates semi diurnal tides the amplitudes of k1 o1 m2 and s2 were obtained by harmonic analysis using t tidal contour of f distribution has been plotted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the diurnal tides in the coastal areas of china are mainly concentrated in the beibu gulf and bohai bay while the semi diurnal tides are mainly concentrated in jiangsu province and the rest of the regions are between these two besides combined with the distribution of tidal energy fig 4 we can see that the f value of the area with tidal energy development potential is within the range of 0 25 0 5 expect the qiongzhou strait fig 4 j and the penghu islands fig 4 k which indicate that the periodic variation of tidal energy and the influence of tidal harmonics on the stability of tidal power generation cannot be ignored since tidal energy can change over time and space to understand the temporal evolutions of tidal energy at specific locations two sites a and b as marked in fig 6 are selected the contours of tidal power density at four different time instances during a day 0 00 a m 8 00 a m 4 00 p m 0 00 p m are plotted in fig 7 to demonstrate the temporal variations of tidal power density at same site as shown in fig 7 the local flow structures at the selected two sites can be greatly influenced by the evolutions of tidal flow at site a tidal power density has greater values in the morning and afternoon fig 7b and c but becomes relatively smaller during the night fig 7a and d however the tidal power density at site b is greater in the morning fig 7f and becomes relatively smaller during other time instances this example shows how tidal energy is highly variable over the course of a day and also over space it is also demonstrating that the temporal evolutions of tidal power density can be dramatically influenced by the local coast profile and bathymetry 4 1 4 top sites with high tidal power density this section demonstrates the top sites with different thresholds for averaged power density at current sea level csl condition for tidal energy harnessing the mean tidal power density p is the key indicator top sites with regard to averaged power density at thresholds 500 1 000 and 1500 w m2 are plotted in fig 8 which corresponds to the current speed of 1 1 26 and 1 44 m s respectively as shown in fig 8 it is seen that the top sites where the tidal power density is greater than 1500 w m2 marked as filled circles in red color are mainly distributed in the guanhe river of jiangsu province zhoushan islands and fuzhou coastal area of fujian province sites with mean tidal power density greater than 1000 w m2 marked as filled circles in blue color are mainly located in southern fujian province parts of eastern guangdong province zhoushan islands and qiongzhou strait etc apparently more sites with averaged tidal energy density greater than 500 w m2 marked as filled circles in yellow color can be observed along the coastline it can be seen that the most of these sites locate in the southwestern eastern and southeastern parts of the coastline of china these regions are believed to have great potentials for tidal energy harnessing however few sites with high tidal power density can be observed in the north of china such as xiaochangshan island 500 w m2 and leiziko 1000 w m2 table 2 lists the potential sites where the mean tidal power density is greater than 500 w m2 finally the total number of top sites for p 500 1000 and 1500 w m2 are 45 23 and 9 respectively it should be noted that the potential sites for tidal energy extraction shown in fig 8 or table 2 only represent the general evaluation of the tidal power density distribution in the region of study since the region of study is divided into discrete grid meshes with certain accuracy in the computation the suitable sites in fig 8 and table 2 for tidal power extractions cannot fully represent the real situations but can serve as a preliminary reference usually marine turbines have a minimum current speed requirement for generating electricity vmin 1 0 m s as is mentioned above fig 8 depicts the potential top sites where the current flow velocity exceeds 1 m s for tidal energy extration however there are many other factors potentially limiting the extraction of tidal energy for instance the local water flow structures will change after the marine turbine installation haverson et al 2018 lewis et al 2017 water depth and the random human factors bridge port terminal carmen et al 2018 in this study as preliminary attempt the potential sites for tidal energy development are only surveyed by applying the numerical modelling approach the tidal stream structure detial of these potential sites should be further anlayzed by field measurements or higher precision numercial simulation 4 2 effects of sea level rise slr 4 2 1 effects of slr on total tidal kinematic energy and flux slr under global warming is an important factor that should be considered in the long term development of tidal kienmatic energy to assess the variations of tidal kienmatic energy of coastal waters under slr the avaerged total kinematic energy and total kinematic energy flux at a cross section 3 km away from the coastline are calcuated under different sea level conditions current sea level csl slr 0 5m 2050 year and slr 1 0m 2100 year as shown in table 3 compared to csl the averaged total kinematic energy increases by 3 and 6 5 at slr 0 5m and slr 1 0m and the averaged total kinematic energy flux increses by 0 5 and 1 0 at slr 0 5m and slr 1 0m respectively this trend can be also observed in the time series of toal kinematic energy flux under different sea level conditions as plotted in fig 9 the results indicate the effect of slr on tidal energy is mainly through changing the characteristics of nearshore tidal flow e g dissipation bottom friction while the process of tidal generation in the depth sea is basically not affected 4 2 2 effects of slr on local tidal current as shown in fig 9 and table 3 the averaged total tidal kinematic energy and total tidal kinematic energy flux are to increase with sea level rise however the development of tidal energy is more concerned with local averaged tidal power density p in this section we select sites a and b as depicted in fig 6 to draw a speed frequency diagram under the different slr scenarios to discuss the effects of slr on local tidal current since the marine turbines have a minimum flow velocity requirement we divided the magnitude of flow speeds into six levels as shown in fig 10 the magnitude of tidal flow velocities is mainly in the range of 1 2 m s but the count for velocity magnitude greater than 2 5 m s are rare for both site a and b as the sea level rises the frequency for low current speed 0 1 5 m s decreases for station a fig 10 a whereas the frequency for high current speed 1 5 3 0 m s increases due to the minimum velocity threshold the slr is only effective at the velocity above the threshold which can t be reflected in the average velocity increase hence the slr not only affects the average velocity of tidal but also affects the structure of velocity size which maybe more crucial for tidal energy extraction 4 2 3 effects of slr on tidal power distribution in this section effects of slr on the distribution of the averaged tidal power density have been analyzed fig 11 shows the averaged power density differences p d i f f between csl and 100 year slr conditions it is observed that the slr doesn t monotonically increase the tidal power density in the whole region the difference of tidal power density ranges from 400w m2 to 900w m2 the averaged tidal power density in some portions of the region of study increase with slr such as yalu river fig 11b sanmen bay fig 11e shacheng river fig 11f and minjiang river fig 11g etc however the averaged tidal power density in the offshore region of yalu river fig 11b region of xiamen fig 11h and leizhou bay fig 11i tends to decrease with slr the effects of slr on the distribution of the averaged tidal power density are very complicated even for same region such as zhoushan islands the tidal power in some portions of the water region tends to increase fig 11c and the rest of region tends to decrease fig 11d in addition the effects of 50 year slr on the distribution of tidal power share similar patterns as 100 year slr as discussed above it is no doubt that if a place wants to develop tidal kinematic energy it should consider the effects of slr during the whole service period of tidal power harnessing facilities 4 2 4 effects of slr on the top sites for tidal energy extraction in this section effects of slr on the distributions of top sites suitable for tidal energy extraction have been discussed similar as section 4 1 5 three averaged power density at thresholds 500 1 000 and 1500 w m2 have been applied to identify the top sites fig 12 show top sites having p 500 w m2 for 50 year slr and 100 year slr respectively furthermore to give a more detailed look at how p values change at individual sites under different slr scenarios we also computed p difference values at these top sites for each slr scenario table 4 table 4 includes the 45 stations that were previously identified table 2 plus 3 newly added stations comparing to the distribution of top sites under csl condition fig 8 slr has limited influences on the distributions of top sites where p 500 w m2 1 for 50 year slr condition only two new sites are added sites 46 and 47 meanwhile the averaged tidal power density at three of the previous sites fell below the 500 w m2 threshold site 1 2 for 100 year slr condition three new sites sites 46 47 and 48 are added and the averaged tidal power density at three of the previous sites fell below the 500 w m2 threshold sites 1 5 and 6 as shown in fig 12 and table 4 it is observed that the magnitude of the averaged tidal power density at each of these top sites value change with slr condition such as site 25 changes from a 1000 w m2 category to a 500 w m2 category and site 35 changes from a 1000 w m2 to a 1500 w m2 category fig 13 shows the variations of the averaged tidal power density at the 48 top sites with different slr scenarios the variations of the averaged tidal power density at each of these top sites have similar patterns for 50 year and 100 year slr scenarios and the maximum increase of tidal power density at the site 34 is 709 4 w m2 under 100 year slr again it is apparent that effects of slr on the tidal power density distribution in the region of study should be evaluated if tidal power generating gear is to be installed 5 discussion in this study a series of high resolution numerical simulations were performed to evaluate and analyze the intensity and distribution of tidal energy along the whole complex coastline of china for the first time potential top sites suitable for tidal energy extraction have been determined including 45 sites with tidal power over 500 w m2 and 23 sites with tidal power greater than 1000 w m2 table 2 these top sites are mainly concentrated in the southeast coastal areas of china as shown in fig 8 besides effects of slr on the intensity and distribution of tidal energy were also analyzed in this paper it is believed that the research results of this study are of guiding significance in the development of tidal energy in china however coastal flows are complex involving wind wind induced circulation wave wave tide misalignment and thermo salt barbaric effect etc factors in addition installations of marine turbine array should have some influences on the coastal environment and the flow phenomenon of tidal flow driving turbine is a kind of typical multiscale and multi physics coastal flow to accurately assess the power conversion of marine turbines doesn t only rely on large scale tidal flow prediction it also relies on the high fidelity simulation for the small scale flow around marine turbine site recently many different types of multiscale and multi physics coastal flow models have been developed dolbow et al 2004 tang et al 2013 2014b qu et al 2016 qu et al 2019a 2019b they have the potential to further improve the accuracy of the assessment of the tidal energy along the coastline besides effects of other important factors i e storm surge and human activities on tidal energy development should be considered in the engineering practice of tidal energy extraction lewis et al 2014 2015 however as a preliminary survey on the intensity and distribution of the tidal energy along the coastline of china we neglect the influences of the above mentioned factors which will be studied in local areas with high potential for tidal energy development in the future in addition harmonic variabilities of coastal tidal current require further attention in evaluating tidal energy lewis et al 2015 neill et al 2012 2014 2012 polagye et al 2013 and the survey of tidal energy also should be combined with local policies power needs and resource reserves to assess their potential for development of coastal region 6 conclusions the paper reviews the current research works on the tidal energy evaluation and extraction and analyzes the china s energy status and future development trends which demonstrate the need for a holistic tidal energy study along the coastlines of china as the first attempt this paper surveys the tidal kinematic energy in the whole coastal waters of china based on a high resolution simulation work with fvcom the results indicate that the total mean tidal kinematic energy in the coastal water of china is about 1 19 1014j and the present study identifies 45 sites having an averaged tidal power density greater than 500 w m2 under current sea level they are mainly distributed in southeastern china such as southeastern coastal areas of guangxi province zhoushan islands hangzhou bay minjiang estuary wenzhou bay xiamen golden bay and yalu river this study also identifies 45 23 and 9 top sites where the averaged tidal power density is greater than 500 1000 and 1500 w m2 respectively suitable for tidal kinematic energy development in addition information for these top sites such as their actual locations and tidal power density has been listed in detail considering the long development cycle of tidal power and global climate change this study also investigates the impact of sea level rise slr on tidal energy distribution in the region of study using a 50 year 0 5 m and 100 year slr 1 0 m scenarios it is found that the total tidal kinematic energy increases by 3 0 and 6 5 respectively however we can t certain how the coastline will change we motive is to increase our understanding of the tidal energy systems and how they respond to perturbations as a preliminary survey of energy resources in the waters of china the results are incomplete but the findings drawn from this study could be instructive for future

20389,many coastal countries are concerned with sustainable energy generation to meet their current and future energy needs tidal energy is an attractive resource as in stream turbines can generate electricity even at moderate flow velocities however not all coastal areas are equally well suited for tidal energy development the survey of potential locations and their power densities is a crucial step in evaluating the potential cost benefit of tidal energy this research surveys the intensity and distribution of offshore tidal energy along whole coastline of china based on a high resolution numerical simulation with a minimum mesh spacing of 80 m the finite volume community ocean model fvcom has been used to carry out the numerical simulation work since fvcom uses an unstructured mesh it can accurately identify complex coastlines such as those along islands waterways and estuaries the simulation period for this numerical survey is 30 days the accuracy of the simulation results is validated using 8 days in situ measurements obtained at 17 coastal stations in the region of study research results indicate that the total mean tidal energy is 1 19 1014 j along the coastline of china the tidal energy is mainly distributed in the south and southeast of the coastline of china this study also identifies 45 23 and 9 top sites where the averaged tidal energy density is greater than 500 1000 and 1500 w m2 respectively suitable for tidal energy extraction and utilization considering the long development cycle of tidal energy and global climate change this study also investigates the impact of sea level rise slr on tidal energy distribution in the region of study using a 50 year 0 5 m and 100 year 1 0 m slr scenarios it is found that the total mean tidal energy increases by 3 0 and 6 5 for 50 year and 100 year slr scenarios respectively it is believed that the findings drawn from this study could be instructive for future utilization of tidal energy along the coastline of china keywords tidal energy numerical model high resolution sea level rise renewable energy 1 introduction with the continually growing energy demands to support growing economies and populations around the world there is strong interest and future need in developing sustainable solutions for producing the required energy international energy agency predicts that the global economy will grow at an average rate of 3 4 per year and a population growth from 7 8 billion today to over 9 billion in 2040 although global energy needs are estimated to rise more slowly than in the past they will still expand by a substantial 30 between today and 2040 world wind energy report 2017 marine energy has great potential for sustainable development especially in coastal areas where there are many advanced megacities with the deepening of the understanding of the ocean marine resources i e wave wind and tidal energies become the focus of the development of renewable energy among various renewable energies tidal energy is an attractive source of marine renewable energy because of the high predictability of tidal current clarke et al 2006 lewis et al 2015 neill et al 2015 2016 meanwhile lewis et al 2014 and mcnaughton et al 2019 investigated the influences of the temporal variability of tidal energy on the electrical grid system they found that the high predictability and quality of tidal energy can assure that the power generated from marine turbines can be incorporated into conventional grids in high efficiency with a low cost in storing tidal energy can be generally harvested in two main ways namely damming and turbines the first approach is to block a bay with a dam that contains numerous sluices and turbines the seawater enters the bay at spring tide and is released at low tide to drive turbines to generate power therefore this kind of tidal energy generation relying on impoundment are confined to hyper tidal systems one example is the rance tidal power station in brittany france which has a peak output of 240 mw and an average capacity of about 100 mw generating power not only at low tide but also during floods bernstein et al 1997 however this type of tidal energy conversion has significant environmental implications parker 1993 at the same time the construction cost of such power generating facilities is expensive which is not conducive to the sustainable development of coastal zones the research work of kirby and retière 2009 revealed that the increase in the permanent subtidal area has led to changes in the estuarine ecosystem the closure of the rance dam resulted in greater biodiversity increased habitat diversity richer fish species and higher species and population of birds in the estuarine another tidal energy generating method is to install marine turbines at field sites with high flow velocity 1 m s in this method tidal energy can be generated by converting the kinetic energy contained in periodic ebbs into electricity through an array of turbines myers and bahaj 2010 afgan et al 2013 neill et al 2012 compared to the first tidal energy generating approach marine turbines can directly extract the kinetic energy of tidal currents to generate electricity for instance the meygen tidal energy project and nova innovation are now installing some of the world s first pre commercial turbine arrays in caithness county and the shetland islands of scotland uk de dominicis et al 2017 in these projects marine turbines are fixed at the seabed and run at low rotating speed to reduce the environmental impacts liu et al 2011 although the second tidal energy generating method does not require water storage facility the tidal energy cannot be generated in a controlled manner because of the temporal evolution of tidal flow therefore it is necessary to evaluate the temporal variation of tidal current energy recently new marine turbine technologies are emerging douglas et al 2008 such as the open centre turbine openhydro in 2006 seagen marine current turbines in 2008 hs1000 andritz hydro hammerfest in 2012 nova m100 nova innovation in 2016 and ar1500 atlantis resources corp in 2017 de dominicis et al 2017 these new technologies are also fueling the potential interest in harnessing tidal energy in addition marine turbine arrays have become the main form of tidal energy extraction because they are easy to operate and maintain tide is a natural phenomenon occurring in coastal areas it refers to the periodic movement of sea water under the tide generating forces of celestial bodies mainly the moon and the sun usually tidal currents are small in deep waters whereas the tidal current can be considerably accelerated around headlands or through constrictions as a result tidal energy is often not sufficient to support electricity generation economically in most coastal areas tidal energy is most easily extracted in places where there are strong currents between islands near headlands or at the entrance to estuaries garrett and cummins 2004 since not all coastal areas are equally well suited for tidal energy development the survey of potential locations and their tidal energy densities is a crucial step in evaluating the potential cost benefit of tidal energy based on high resolution bathymetry data and computational mesh tang et al 2014a b numerically evaluated the coastal tidal energy density and distribution along the complex coastline of new jersey usa guillou et al 2018 used the tidal current harmonic database to study the temporal and spatial variations of the current energy sources around france chen et al 2013a 2017 evaluated the tidal energy distributions around penghu islands and the golden gate area of taiwan besides mejia olivares et al 2018 studied the distribution of tidal energy in the gulf of california mexico the prerequisite of tidal energy extraction is to investigate the distribution and temporal evolution of tidal energy in the region of study currently numerical modelling and on site measurement are two main assessment methods as to numerical modelling researchers usually apply two or three dimensional hydrodynamic models to evaluate tidal energy at regional scales recently chen and liu 2017 used the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism to study the distribution of tidal energy of the penghu islands in taiwan considering the effects of four slr 0 87m 1 11m 1 40m 1 90m scenarios on the evolution of tidal energy they concluded that slr tends to increase the tidal energy near these islands tang and his colleagues tang et al 2014a b applied the finite volume community ocean model fvcom to carry out the high resolution tidal energy survey along the shoreline of new jersey usa they pointed out that the high resolution simulation can play a significant role in evaluating the intensity and distribution of tidal energy wang and yang 2017 also applied fvcom to evaluate the potential of extracting tidal energy from the small tidal channels in puget bay at the northwestern coast of washington usa their results indicated that smaller channels can only extract relatively less tidal energy than main channels but they are still suitable for tidal energy extraction and will be considered in the future in addition the hydrodynamic models can also be used to analyze the interaction between the tidal flow and the turbine array so as to more accurately evaluate the power generation efficiency of marine turbines goward brown et al 2017 on site measurement mainly employs acoustic doppler current profilers adcp to measure the velocity distribution along the water depth adcp can also determine the tidal current velocity over time for instance tidal energy survey was conducted in the southern and western parts of south korea by measuring tidal current velocity at 264 sites over a 29 day period byun et al 2013 vennell assessed the tidal energy of the new zealand cook straight and the entrance channel to kaipara harbor by measuring the local volume flux and the bottom drag coefficient vennell 2011 although tidal current data can be directly from field measurements the process is time consuming and expensive meanwhile it is difficult to measure tidal current data over a large area with acceptable accuracy and resolution hence it is not cost effective or practical to determine the appropriate locations for the installations of marine turbine arrays through large scale field investigations with the development of computer hardware and numerical methods combined with high resolution coastline and bathymetry data hydrodynamic models have become an important technical means to evaluate the distribution of tidal energy over large wave bodies nevertheless field measurements can provide important validation data for numerical simulations besides before the implementation of engineering practice of tidal energy extraction it is necessary to measure the tidal flow data in the construction area to ensure the smooth implementation of the project therefore the measured data of tidal current are indispensable china is located on the west coast of the pacific ocean with a long coastline and numerous islands so the potential for developing tidal energy is huge most modern metropolises are located on the eastern seaboard where energy demand is high in addition due to the limitations of existing energy infrastructure and natural factors electricity is generally transmitted from the central and western regions to the coastal areas therefore tidal energy as a clean and renewable energy source can alleviate the energy shortage of coastal cities in china to a certain extent however due to the late development of tidal energy technology the exploitation and utilization of tidal energy along the coastline of china has not been extensively studied which is worthy of further investigation liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 so far surveys of tidal power in china have focused on small coastal areas or islands gao et al 2015 chen et al 2007 or carried out only sparse field measurements national bureau of statistics of china 2008 overall tidal energy surveys along the coastline of china have not been carried out in a thorough and detailed way to make up for the shortcomings of previous researches this work uses high resolution numerical simulation method to investigate the distribution of tidal energy in the whole coastal area of china hoping to determine the local coastal regions with good prospects for tidal energy development with the massive emissions of greenhouse gases global warming can lead to sea level rise slr which will affect coastal environmental responses such as storm surges estuary sediments and human economic activities yin et al 2017 as a long term investment project of tidal energy development and utilization it is necessary to consider the impacts of slr tang et al 2014a b chen and liu 2017 idier et al 2017 the work selects 50 years and 100 years as the research periods to study impacts of slr on the intensity and distribution of tidal energy 2 data and model description 2 1 region of study data sources the region of study locates at the western pacific ranging from 15 81 n to 40 96 n and 105 69 e to 133 8 e it composed of four main regions i e bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and south china sea as shown in fig 1 the water depth in the continental shelf area roughly ranges from 2 m to 100 m representing common water depth for tidal energy development numerous islands and narrow water passages are included such as zhoushan islands to resolve the complex coastlines of region of study a set of unstructured mesh consisting of 685 620 triangular elements and 381 607 nodes were generated in consideration of computational efficiency and nearshore terrain features a nested mesh method was adopted to divide the region of study into internal and external regions in mesh generation processes the interior region extends 7 km from the coastline and the mesh resolution along the shoreline is about 80 m the external region uses relatively coarser mesh gradually transitioning from 2 km to open boundaries 50 km away from the coastline as shown in fig 2 in the computation bathymetry data in the deep water region adopts the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 30 arc second 1 km global bathymetric dataset gebco http www gebco net data and products gridded bathymetrydata it was largely generated by combining quality controlled ship depth soundings with interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite derived gravity data in the shallow water region the bathymetry data of the 16 electronic charts of china aviation insurance department is used which has an averaged resolution of 100 m in this paper a smooth transition is made between the bathymetry data from two different sources the observation data published by the national oceanographic information center china nmdc http mds nmdis org cn is applied to verify the computational capability of the numerical model in this study given that marine turbine arrays are to be installed for decades effects of sea level rise slr on the tidal energy have to be assessed the 2014 report released by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc indicated that the combined effects of seawater thermal expansion and glacial recession account for about 75 of global sea level rise ipcc 2014 it is indicated a rate of global sea level rise is 0 18 cm year during 1961 2003 mainly due to melting glaciers it is also noted that a much greater slr occurred during the last 10 years of the study period 1993 2003 about 0 3 cm year peltier 2001 according to the ipcc 5th assessment report a global mean slr of 0 25 m is likely by 2046 2065 regardless of greenhouse gas emission scenario and the likely range for the high emissions scenarios is 50 100 cm by 2100 church et al 2013 some scholars also have studied future slr in some parts of china for the coming decades for example shi et al 2008 considered the settlement of region of study and predicted that the sea level rise in the guangdong province of china in 2030 and 2050 is 30 cm and 50 cm respectively besides the state oceanic administration estimates that the sea level in guangdong will rise by 75 155 cm in the next 30 years state oceanic administration 2016 zhang et al 2004 estimated that the sea level in the region of pearl river estuary of china is to rise by 30 cm by 2030 in this study we consider slr scenarios of 0 5 m and 1 0 m to roughly to represent 50 year and 100 year slr conditions 2 2 model description and calibration the fvcom is a three dimensional 3d community ocean circulation model based on the unstructured finite volume method which originally developed by chen et al 2003 the 3d primitive equations consist of continuity momentum in cartesian coordinate which are given by 1 u t u u x v u y w u z f v 1 ρ 0 p x z k m u z f u 2 v t u v x v v y w v z f u 1 ρ 0 p x z k m v z f v 3 w t u w x v w y w w z 1 ρ 0 p z z k m w z f w g 4 u x v y w z 0 where u v and w are the velocity components in x y and z directions respectively p is the total pressure of air and water f is the coriolis parameter ρ 0 is the density g is the gravitational acceleration k m is the vertical viscosity coefficient f u and f v represent the horizontal momentum and f w is the diffusion term of the vertical momentum the model discretizes the integral form of the governing equations with finite volume approach by calculate the cell boundary flux modified fourth order runge kutta time stepping method is applied to integrate the governing equations in time advection terms are discretized by the second order upwind scheme and the vertical diffusion is solved implicitly by the central difference method for more details regarding fvcom readers are referred to chen et al 2003 2013b a generalized terrain following coordinate system is adopted in fvcom to capture the complex topography of the seafloor in the vertical direction egbert et al 1995 non overlapping unstructured triangular mesh is used in the horizontal plane fvcom consists of one external mode and one internal mode depth averaged two dimensional 2d governing equations are solved in the external mode and three dimensional 3d governing equations are solved in internal model the turbulence closure is met by adopting the mellor and yamada level 2 5 in this study 7 σ mesh layers are adopted in the vertical direction the results were analyzed based on depth averaged velocity in the computation three open boundaries are considered locating at the south east and northeast of the region of study where the time series of water elevations are imposed to drive the simulation the time series of water elevations imposed at the open boundaries are obtained using the matlab tool tpxo7 2 of the global tidal model of otps which considers 13 tidal components including 8 main components m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 two long periods mf mm and three nonlinearities m4 ms4 and mn4 the dry and wet boundary treatment techniques are applied to account for the fluctuations of water surface elevation in the coastal region the computational capability of fvcom is validated using 8 days in situ observations at 17 stations located along the coastline of china the verification period is from july 5 2018 to july 13 2018 utc 8 and the whole simulation period lasted for a month the longitudes and latitudes of the observation stations are listed in table 1 and their locations are shown in fig 1 comparisons of time series of water surface elevation are shown in fig 3 unfortunately due to a lack of observation data the current speed and corresponding current directions could not be validated mean absolute error mae was used to assess the simulation accuracy which is given by 5 m a e 1 n y y ˆ we calculated the mae for the comparisons of water surface elevation at each of the observation stations the mae for stations zd12 zd17 is in the range of 0 06 0 15 m for zd09 zd11 and zd02 zd07 the mae are in the range of 0 19 0 25 m the mae for stations zd01 and zd08 is relatively large and are 0 46 and 0 58 m respectively the main reasons for these discrepancies are due to the inaccuracy of local bathymetry data and the relatively large tide amplitude at the station sites generally as demonstrated in fig 3 it is seen that the predicted water surface elevations are in good agreement with the corresponding observations the fvcom is capable to accurately reproduce the observed tidal elevations at most locations and is also expected to have the similar accuracy in the rest of study region 3 evaluation of tidal energy in this study tidal energy is assessed using formulas proposed by tang et al 2014a b the kinematic energy e within a flow domain φ can be calculated as 6 e φ 1 2 ρ v 2 d φ where ρ is the density of seawater v is the depth averaged velocity the average kinematic energy e within the computational domain over time period of t can be expressed as 7 e 1 t 0 t φ 1 2 ρ v 2 d φ d t to evaluate the tidal kinematic energy tidal power density p also known as tidal power is defined as 8 p 1 2 ρ v 3 which represents the tidal kinematic energy passing unit cross section area during unit time the averaged power density p over a time period of t at a specified location can be computed as 9 p 1 t 0 t 1 2 ρ v 3 d t in addition the total tidal kinematic energy flux p ˆ can be calculated along a line ϕ at a certain distance from the coastline which can be calculated as 10 p ˆ 1 2 ρ v 3 d ϕ which can be applied to evaluate the total tidal power within a study region the averaged total tidal kinematic energy flux is determined as 11 p 1 t 0 t 1 2 ρ v 3 d ϕ d t 4 results 4 1 assessment of tidal energy and distribution 4 1 1 tidal energy distribution to evaluate the tidal energy distribution in the coastal waters of china the averaged tidal power density during the time period of 29 days is calculated by eq 9 and is plotted in fig 4 the averaged tidal power density ranges from 150 w m2 to 3000 w m2 it is seen that most coastal waters have low tidal power density except some local regions of the yellow sea the east china sea the northern coast of the taiwan strait and the south china sea fig 4a examples are the yalu river estuary fig 4 b xiaochangshan island fig 4c hangzhou bay fig 4f taiwan strait coastal areas of fujian and guangdong province fig 4g h and i qiongzhou strait and beihai area along the coast of guangxi province fig 4j and k obviously regions with relatively high tidal power density value usually locate in the places where many islands or narrow channels exist as tide current approaches at islands or channels from the open sea to coastal region the tidal current velocity is to increase due to the constriction effects from both vertical rising seafloor and horizonal plane islands and channels meanwhile because p is scaled to v 3 a small amount increase in tidal current velocity can cause a large amount increase in tidal power density thus locations with high tidal power density are usually found in the vicinity regions of islands or narrow channels along coastlines tang et al 2014a b 4 1 2 estimate of tidal energy near the coastline the total tidal kinematic energy is calculated using eq 6 for the coastal waters within 3 km from the coastline of china during the time period of july 8th to july 30th 2018 since the tidal kinematic energy is strongly influenced by tidal periodicity the total tidal kinematic energy e varies between 3 99 1013 and 2 57 1014 j for the coastal waters within 3 km reach of the coastline as shown in fig 5 a the averaged total tidal kinematic energy over the selected time period is e 1 19 1014 j furthermore the total kinematic energy flux p ˆ across the boundary 3 km away from the coastline was calculated using eq 10 the time series of p ˆ is plotted in fig 5b which ranges 4 77 107 w to 5 39 108 w the averaged value is p 2 03 108 w 4 1 3 examples of tidal energy variations over a day at two sites july 13 2018 tides are periodic elevation fluctuations of seawater under the action of celestial bodies beyond the well known spring neap tidal cycle that describes the interaction between m2 and s2 there are a number of other harmonic signals within tidal spatial variation china has a long coastline over 18 000 km local differences in semi diurnal and diurnal forcing constituents can result in tidal range spanning from strongly semi diurnal to strongly diurnal the tidal form in the region of study can be typically represented by form ratio f proposed by pond and pickard 1978 as 12 f h k 1 h o 1 h m 2 h s 2 where h represents the amplitudes of tidal elevation f 3 indicates diurnal tides whereas f 0 25 indicates semi diurnal tides the amplitudes of k1 o1 m2 and s2 were obtained by harmonic analysis using t tidal contour of f distribution has been plotted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the diurnal tides in the coastal areas of china are mainly concentrated in the beibu gulf and bohai bay while the semi diurnal tides are mainly concentrated in jiangsu province and the rest of the regions are between these two besides combined with the distribution of tidal energy fig 4 we can see that the f value of the area with tidal energy development potential is within the range of 0 25 0 5 expect the qiongzhou strait fig 4 j and the penghu islands fig 4 k which indicate that the periodic variation of tidal energy and the influence of tidal harmonics on the stability of tidal power generation cannot be ignored since tidal energy can change over time and space to understand the temporal evolutions of tidal energy at specific locations two sites a and b as marked in fig 6 are selected the contours of tidal power density at four different time instances during a day 0 00 a m 8 00 a m 4 00 p m 0 00 p m are plotted in fig 7 to demonstrate the temporal variations of tidal power density at same site as shown in fig 7 the local flow structures at the selected two sites can be greatly influenced by the evolutions of tidal flow at site a tidal power density has greater values in the morning and afternoon fig 7b and c but becomes relatively smaller during the night fig 7a and d however the tidal power density at site b is greater in the morning fig 7f and becomes relatively smaller during other time instances this example shows how tidal energy is highly variable over the course of a day and also over space it is also demonstrating that the temporal evolutions of tidal power density can be dramatically influenced by the local coast profile and bathymetry 4 1 4 top sites with high tidal power density this section demonstrates the top sites with different thresholds for averaged power density at current sea level csl condition for tidal energy harnessing the mean tidal power density p is the key indicator top sites with regard to averaged power density at thresholds 500 1 000 and 1500 w m2 are plotted in fig 8 which corresponds to the current speed of 1 1 26 and 1 44 m s respectively as shown in fig 8 it is seen that the top sites where the tidal power density is greater than 1500 w m2 marked as filled circles in red color are mainly distributed in the guanhe river of jiangsu province zhoushan islands and fuzhou coastal area of fujian province sites with mean tidal power density greater than 1000 w m2 marked as filled circles in blue color are mainly located in southern fujian province parts of eastern guangdong province zhoushan islands and qiongzhou strait etc apparently more sites with averaged tidal energy density greater than 500 w m2 marked as filled circles in yellow color can be observed along the coastline it can be seen that the most of these sites locate in the southwestern eastern and southeastern parts of the coastline of china these regions are believed to have great potentials for tidal energy harnessing however few sites with high tidal power density can be observed in the north of china such as xiaochangshan island 500 w m2 and leiziko 1000 w m2 table 2 lists the potential sites where the mean tidal power density is greater than 500 w m2 finally the total number of top sites for p 500 1000 and 1500 w m2 are 45 23 and 9 respectively it should be noted that the potential sites for tidal energy extraction shown in fig 8 or table 2 only represent the general evaluation of the tidal power density distribution in the region of study since the region of study is divided into discrete grid meshes with certain accuracy in the computation the suitable sites in fig 8 and table 2 for tidal power extractions cannot fully represent the real situations but can serve as a preliminary reference usually marine turbines have a minimum current speed requirement for generating electricity vmin 1 0 m s as is mentioned above fig 8 depicts the potential top sites where the current flow velocity exceeds 1 m s for tidal energy extration however there are many other factors potentially limiting the extraction of tidal energy for instance the local water flow structures will change after the marine turbine installation haverson et al 2018 lewis et al 2017 water depth and the random human factors bridge port terminal carmen et al 2018 in this study as preliminary attempt the potential sites for tidal energy development are only surveyed by applying the numerical modelling approach the tidal stream structure detial of these potential sites should be further anlayzed by field measurements or higher precision numercial simulation 4 2 effects of sea level rise slr 4 2 1 effects of slr on total tidal kinematic energy and flux slr under global warming is an important factor that should be considered in the long term development of tidal kienmatic energy to assess the variations of tidal kienmatic energy of coastal waters under slr the avaerged total kinematic energy and total kinematic energy flux at a cross section 3 km away from the coastline are calcuated under different sea level conditions current sea level csl slr 0 5m 2050 year and slr 1 0m 2100 year as shown in table 3 compared to csl the averaged total kinematic energy increases by 3 and 6 5 at slr 0 5m and slr 1 0m and the averaged total kinematic energy flux increses by 0 5 and 1 0 at slr 0 5m and slr 1 0m respectively this trend can be also observed in the time series of toal kinematic energy flux under different sea level conditions as plotted in fig 9 the results indicate the effect of slr on tidal energy is mainly through changing the characteristics of nearshore tidal flow e g dissipation bottom friction while the process of tidal generation in the depth sea is basically not affected 4 2 2 effects of slr on local tidal current as shown in fig 9 and table 3 the averaged total tidal kinematic energy and total tidal kinematic energy flux are to increase with sea level rise however the development of tidal energy is more concerned with local averaged tidal power density p in this section we select sites a and b as depicted in fig 6 to draw a speed frequency diagram under the different slr scenarios to discuss the effects of slr on local tidal current since the marine turbines have a minimum flow velocity requirement we divided the magnitude of flow speeds into six levels as shown in fig 10 the magnitude of tidal flow velocities is mainly in the range of 1 2 m s but the count for velocity magnitude greater than 2 5 m s are rare for both site a and b as the sea level rises the frequency for low current speed 0 1 5 m s decreases for station a fig 10 a whereas the frequency for high current speed 1 5 3 0 m s increases due to the minimum velocity threshold the slr is only effective at the velocity above the threshold which can t be reflected in the average velocity increase hence the slr not only affects the average velocity of tidal but also affects the structure of velocity size which maybe more crucial for tidal energy extraction 4 2 3 effects of slr on tidal power distribution in this section effects of slr on the distribution of the averaged tidal power density have been analyzed fig 11 shows the averaged power density differences p d i f f between csl and 100 year slr conditions it is observed that the slr doesn t monotonically increase the tidal power density in the whole region the difference of tidal power density ranges from 400w m2 to 900w m2 the averaged tidal power density in some portions of the region of study increase with slr such as yalu river fig 11b sanmen bay fig 11e shacheng river fig 11f and minjiang river fig 11g etc however the averaged tidal power density in the offshore region of yalu river fig 11b region of xiamen fig 11h and leizhou bay fig 11i tends to decrease with slr the effects of slr on the distribution of the averaged tidal power density are very complicated even for same region such as zhoushan islands the tidal power in some portions of the water region tends to increase fig 11c and the rest of region tends to decrease fig 11d in addition the effects of 50 year slr on the distribution of tidal power share similar patterns as 100 year slr as discussed above it is no doubt that if a place wants to develop tidal kinematic energy it should consider the effects of slr during the whole service period of tidal power harnessing facilities 4 2 4 effects of slr on the top sites for tidal energy extraction in this section effects of slr on the distributions of top sites suitable for tidal energy extraction have been discussed similar as section 4 1 5 three averaged power density at thresholds 500 1 000 and 1500 w m2 have been applied to identify the top sites fig 12 show top sites having p 500 w m2 for 50 year slr and 100 year slr respectively furthermore to give a more detailed look at how p values change at individual sites under different slr scenarios we also computed p difference values at these top sites for each slr scenario table 4 table 4 includes the 45 stations that were previously identified table 2 plus 3 newly added stations comparing to the distribution of top sites under csl condition fig 8 slr has limited influences on the distributions of top sites where p 500 w m2 1 for 50 year slr condition only two new sites are added sites 46 and 47 meanwhile the averaged tidal power density at three of the previous sites fell below the 500 w m2 threshold site 1 2 for 100 year slr condition three new sites sites 46 47 and 48 are added and the averaged tidal power density at three of the previous sites fell below the 500 w m2 threshold sites 1 5 and 6 as shown in fig 12 and table 4 it is observed that the magnitude of the averaged tidal power density at each of these top sites value change with slr condition such as site 25 changes from a 1000 w m2 category to a 500 w m2 category and site 35 changes from a 1000 w m2 to a 1500 w m2 category fig 13 shows the variations of the averaged tidal power density at the 48 top sites with different slr scenarios the variations of the averaged tidal power density at each of these top sites have similar patterns for 50 year and 100 year slr scenarios and the maximum increase of tidal power density at the site 34 is 709 4 w m2 under 100 year slr again it is apparent that effects of slr on the tidal power density distribution in the region of study should be evaluated if tidal power generating gear is to be installed 5 discussion in this study a series of high resolution numerical simulations were performed to evaluate and analyze the intensity and distribution of tidal energy along the whole complex coastline of china for the first time potential top sites suitable for tidal energy extraction have been determined including 45 sites with tidal power over 500 w m2 and 23 sites with tidal power greater than 1000 w m2 table 2 these top sites are mainly concentrated in the southeast coastal areas of china as shown in fig 8 besides effects of slr on the intensity and distribution of tidal energy were also analyzed in this paper it is believed that the research results of this study are of guiding significance in the development of tidal energy in china however coastal flows are complex involving wind wind induced circulation wave wave tide misalignment and thermo salt barbaric effect etc factors in addition installations of marine turbine array should have some influences on the coastal environment and the flow phenomenon of tidal flow driving turbine is a kind of typical multiscale and multi physics coastal flow to accurately assess the power conversion of marine turbines doesn t only rely on large scale tidal flow prediction it also relies on the high fidelity simulation for the small scale flow around marine turbine site recently many different types of multiscale and multi physics coastal flow models have been developed dolbow et al 2004 tang et al 2013 2014b qu et al 2016 qu et al 2019a 2019b they have the potential to further improve the accuracy of the assessment of the tidal energy along the coastline besides effects of other important factors i e storm surge and human activities on tidal energy development should be considered in the engineering practice of tidal energy extraction lewis et al 2014 2015 however as a preliminary survey on the intensity and distribution of the tidal energy along the coastline of china we neglect the influences of the above mentioned factors which will be studied in local areas with high potential for tidal energy development in the future in addition harmonic variabilities of coastal tidal current require further attention in evaluating tidal energy lewis et al 2015 neill et al 2012 2014 2012 polagye et al 2013 and the survey of tidal energy also should be combined with local policies power needs and resource reserves to assess their potential for development of coastal region 6 conclusions the paper reviews the current research works on the tidal energy evaluation and extraction and analyzes the china s energy status and future development trends which demonstrate the need for a holistic tidal energy study along the coastlines of china as the first attempt this paper surveys the tidal kinematic energy in the whole coastal waters of china based on a high resolution simulation work with fvcom the results indicate that the total mean tidal kinematic energy in the coastal water of china is about 1 19 1014j and the present study identifies 45 sites having an averaged tidal power density greater than 500 w m2 under current sea level they are mainly distributed in southeastern china such as southeastern coastal areas of guangxi province zhoushan islands hangzhou bay minjiang estuary wenzhou bay xiamen golden bay and yalu river this study also identifies 45 23 and 9 top sites where the averaged tidal power density is greater than 500 1000 and 1500 w m2 respectively suitable for tidal kinematic energy development in addition information for these top sites such as their actual locations and tidal power density has been listed in detail considering the long development cycle of tidal power and global climate change this study also investigates the impact of sea level rise slr on tidal energy distribution in the region of study using a 50 year 0 5 m and 100 year slr 1 0 m scenarios it is found that the total tidal kinematic energy increases by 3 0 and 6 5 respectively however we can t certain how the coastline will change we motive is to increase our understanding of the tidal energy systems and how they respond to perturbations as a preliminary survey of energy resources in the waters of china the results are incomplete but the findings drawn from this study could be instructive for future utilization of tidal energy in china credit authorship contribution statement c b jiang resources funding acquisition writing review editing y t kang methodology software validation writing original
