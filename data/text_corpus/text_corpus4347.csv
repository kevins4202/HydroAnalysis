21735,a series of 1 g model tests was performed to investigate the effect of loading rate on the vertical pullout capacity of offshore bucket foundations in sand the bucket model had a length to diameter ratio of 1 0 loading rates varied from 0 004 n s to 2 05 n s the pullout load increased with bucket displacement and loading rate the loading rate of 0 004 n s induced drained conditions with negligible suction pressure and high skin resistance increasing the loading rate induced high suction pressures inside the bucket the bucket pullout capacity increased with bucket displacement and loading rate suction pressure increased with bucket displacement and loading rate and contributed considerably to the pullout capacity the bucket resistance to pullout load increased with the increase in loading rate equations were proposed to evaluate the drained and undrained pullout capacities of the bucket keywords bucket foundation pullout capacity drainage condition loading rate 1 g model tests 1 introduction bucket foundations are widely used in many offshore structures such as foundations of offshore wind turbines masts and mooring applications bucket foundations are preferred because of their low cost easy and rapid installation and minimal damage to the marine ecosystem in the past decades numerous studies have been conducted on bucket foundations subjected to various forms of loading and ground media hung and kim 2012 foglia et al 2013 2014 cox et al 2014 hung et al 2018 compared with other foundation solutions bucket foundations are multipurpose the installation procedure of bucket foundations involves self weight penetration followed by application of suction to continue the penetration as discussed by houlsby and byrne 2005 the advent and geotechnical aspects of bucket foundations were discussed in detail in tjelta 1994 bye et al 1995 and tjelta 2001 bucket foundations are a suitable alternative for anchoring offshore structures bai and jin 2015 offshore structures can be anchored directly at the seabed bottom fixed in shallow waters or indirectly by deep sea tension cables for direct anchorage at the seabed bucket foundations are connected to the bottom of jackets or tripod structures and penetrated to deep ground depths as illustrated by wu et al 2019 the impact of wind and wave loads induces large moments on the bucket causing it to pull out of the sea bed soil kelly et al 2004 it has been reported that the stability of tripod bucket foundations is mainly governed by the pullout capacity of the upward bucket kim et al 2014 skau and jostad 2014 for mooring applications lines or pretensioned tendons are extended to connect the floating structures with the embedded buckets as in the case of tension leg structures kasuya et al 2017 mccarron 2011 the action of wind and wave loads induces large buoyant and dynamic forces that affect the floating structure ultimately pulling out the bucket schneider and senders 2010 therefore understanding the pullout capacity of buckets is important the pullout capacity of the bucket has been investigated by several studies and findings reveal that such capacity is considerably affected by the drainage condition of the soil deng and carter 2002 iskander et al 2002 and bucket geometry kakasoltani et al 2011 the drainage condition such as drained partially drained or undrained changes depending on factors such as loading rate soil permeability and seepage nielsen et al 2015 asakereh and kamali 2018 conducted fe analyses and investigated the effects of soil cohesion relative density and young s modulus of soil on the pullout capacity the pullout capacity was found to increase with the increase of soil cohesion relative density and young s modulus of soil equations were proposed to evaluate the pullout capacity considering the above soil parameters thieken et al 2014 performed a series of numerical analyses on buckets l d 1 0 d 12 m varying loading rates between 0 001 and 1000 mm s the suction heave and capacity of the bucket were found to increase with the loading rate slow loading rates induced drained failure whereas higher loading rates induced undrained failure characterized by the uplift of the soil plug hung et al 2017 conducted 1 g model tests on buckets l d 1 0 and 0 5 d 150 mm and observed that pullout capacities were higher in saturated sand compared with dry sand the reason for this finding is that suction developed inside buckets in saturated sand that increased the pullout resistance equations were proposed to evaluate the pullout capacity of buckets with and without suction sawicki et al 2016 proposed that the pullout capacity can be estimated by summing up the submerged weight of the bucket soil plug suction force inside the bucket and the inner and outer skin resistance of the bucket the pullout capacity is also affected by dilatancy drainage characteristics of soil and period of loading in the long term pullout loads cause a decrease in mean effective stress thereby lowering the skin resistance along with the bucket bye et al 1995 in the short term high loading rates induce large magnitudes of suction and effective stress that increases skin resistance byrne 2000 the maximum tensile load and suction pressure can be estimated by applying equations proposed by houlsby et al 2005 that account for fast loading research has also revealed that increasing bucket embedment depth at constant diameter increases the resistance to bucket pullout wang et al 2019 by contrast increasing the bucket diameter at constant embedment depth decreases the pullout resistance patel and singh 2019 the effect of load inclination angle on the pullout capacity was investigated by rao et al 2006 for anchors in marine clays load inclination angles varied between 0 horizontal load and 90 vertical load least pullout resistances were shown when the pullout load was applied vertically indicating a critical loading direction and common case in deep sea suction bucket anchors only a few studies have been conducted on the effect of drainage condition on pullout capacity and how to evaluate pullout capacity requires further investigation the evaluation of the static pullout capacity of buckets can be applied to the design of foundations for floating structures el gharbawy and olson 1998 and structures founded on monopod tripod and tetrapod buckets under cyclic loading hung et al 2017 tran et al 2017 therefore the present study conducted a series of 1 g tests to investigate the effect of drainage condition on the static pullout capacity of buckets pullout loads were applied to a bucket with l d 1 0 slow 0 004 n s to fast 2 05 n s loading rates were implemented to vary the drainage condition of the soil the results could be applied to the preliminary design of suction buckets subjected to pullout forces 2 model tests 2 1 bucket foundation model and test program this study considered a prototype bucket with d 15 m l 15 m skirt thickness 33 mm and a rigid reinforced lid the model bucket had d 150 mm l 150 mm and skirt and lid thicknesses of 1 and 5 mm respectively the dimensions of the model bucket were obtained by applying a length scale of 1 100 to the prototype bucket wood 2004 the bucket model was fabricated with a skirt thickness of 1 mm because the applied length scale of 1 100 resulted in a skirt thickness of 0 33 mm which was extremely thin to fabricate however the 1 mm thickness of the skirt induces only a 0 8 reduction of the contact area between the bucket and soil compared with the 0 033 mm thickness therefore the thickness change has a limited effect on the pullout capacity of the bucket in addition the ratio of skirt thickness to bucket diameter in the study is 0 007 and the range of 0 005 0 008 is generally applied by previous studies e g hung et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2013 foglia et al 2013 nielsen et al 2017 fig 1 shows the structure of the bucket model applied in the study a similar model bucket was observed to work efficiently in the study of hung et al 2017 the bucket material was aluminum with a young s modulus of elasticity e 70 gpa the bucket was ventilated with three holes on the lid an internally threaded socket was fabricated on the bucket lid to receive an externally threaded plug on the closed end of the plug a hole was provided for attaching the loading wire the test program investigated the effects of various loading rates on the static pullout capacity of the bucket with l d 1 0 the loading regime comprised five loading rates applied to the bucket varying between 0 004 and 2 05 n s the following sections present the discussion on the change in loading rate and its effect on the pullout capacity of the bucket the approximate values of pullout capacities of the bucket under fully drained partially drained and fully undrained conditions were estimated 2 2 test setup fig 2 shows an assembly of the equipment used to conduct the tests the equipment consisted of two pulleys fixed to an overhead rigid steel beam a steel loading wire with a diameter of 1 mm a high level water supply tank a control valve a lightweight cylindrical loading container a load cell two linear variable differential transformers a pore water pressure transducer and a circular soil box the pore water pressure transducer and load cell were calibrated before the start of each test the pulley system was used to enhance smooth movement of the loading wire during the loading process the steel loading wire connected the bucket to the loading container a pullout load was applied to the bucket through this wire the water supply tank was filled with a sufficient quantity of water to load the bucket the control valve with a gauge attached controlled the quantity of water flow into the loading container the circular soil box contained the model ground the instrumentation incorporated a data logger and labview program the data logger was used to measure and collect data the labview computer program was used to establish and visualize the test requirements the operation sequence of the test equipment can be described as follows the control valve was initially set to pass a uniform rate of flow into the loading container the flow rate was carefully adjusted to match the required loading rate a uniform stream of water was smoothly discharged at the bottom of the loading container as flow into the loading container increased the tension load in the wire also increased translating into a pullout load on the bucket lid this pullout load increased with the increase in the volume of water in the container the tensile load in the wire pullout load was measured by the load cell attached between the loading wire and the suspended container during pullout loading the changes in pore water pressure inside the bucket were recorded by the pore water pressure transducer attached on the bucket lid the preliminary tests conducted showed that suction force was largest below the bucket lid the suction force increased with the increase in pullout load the pore water pressure transducer was fitted in the hole drilled through the bucket lid to capture this phenomenon this assembly captured the suction pressures developed during the bucket pullout process because the pore water pressure transducer moved along with the bucket 2 3 model ground preparation and test setup the aluminum circular soil box used in this study was 5 mm thick and internally measured 600 mm in diameter by 450 mm in depth a similar soil box was used by hung et al 2017 who recommended it suitable for performing tests after a series of finite element analyses the ground used was silica sand with the particle size distribution and material properties shown in fig 3 and table 1 respectively the ground was initially saturated for a period of 48 h water pluviation was then conducted on saturated sand particles this procedure involved the stacking of astm sieve no 40 over the soil box followed by filling the soil box with water to a height of 445 mm the bottom 50 mm of the sieve was submerged in water saturated sand was washed over the submerged sieve which caused the particles to disperse and settle inside the soil box with a uniform velocity vaid and negussey 1988 the above process was continued until the required ground depth of 300 mm was achieved the water pluviation method resulted in a relatively uniform ground fig 4 γ s a t at 17 3 kn m3 was obtained by testing soil samples from small aluminum tins embedded in the ground at soil depths of 50 150 and 300 mm at the time of ground preparation the relative density of the ground was computed for each model ground prepared and was found to be 28 a 650 mm diameter by 10 mm thick circular acryl template with a 156 mm diameter central hole was fabricated to centrally position the bucket the template was designed to cover the entire top of the circular soil box and placed in such a way that its outer edge matched the top edge of the circular soil box with the use of a guide beam the bucket was carefully positioned through the central hole to touch the ground surface the guide beam was similar to the one in hung et al 2017 weights were incrementally added over the vertical guide to slowly penetrate the bucket into the ground penetration was completed when the bottom face of the lid touched the ground surface which was observed through the opened drainage hole during installation the holes on the lid of the bucket were kept opened to pass out air and water entrapped inside the bucket after installation a pore water pressure transducer was fitted in one hole the remaining two holes were plugged before commencing the test the bucket was installed with an average velocity of 0 0625 mm s which was sufficiently small to prevent excess pore water pressures from building up inside the bucket guo et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 pullout capacity according to pullout rate fig 5 illustrates the typical deformed shape of the soil surface according to the pullout rate at the rate of 0 008 n s no deformation occurred on the soil surface fig 5a however at the rate of 0 66 n s the soil surrounding the bucket sank the average deformed width x in fig 5b became wider with the increase in loading rate and was expressed as a ratio of the bucket diameter x d the ratio x d varied as 0 0 30 0 47 and 0 67 for the loading rates of 0 008 0 08 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively the water head above the ground surface was lowered to zero and the bucket was carefully removed to determine the reason for the deformation of the soil surrounding the bucket fig 6 a and b respectively show the diagrams of the deformed soil and the extracted soil cap at 2 05 n s the volume of the trapped soil increased with the increase in the pullout rate this result showed that the soil inside the bucket moved upward together with the pullout of the bucket and a fast pullout rate caused a large force that trapped the inside soil fig 7 shows the pullout load displacement curves of the bucket the pullout load increased with the pullout rate the pullout load at 25 mm increased approximately four times from 22 49 n at 0 004 n s to 82 22 n at 2 05 n s the reason for the increasing pullout load with the loading rate was the suction pressure development inside the bucket fig 8 shows the measured suction pressure below the lid of the bucket the suction pressure increased with the increase in displacement and loading rate fig 9 shows the suction force inside the bucket on the basis of the loading rate the suction force was nearly zero at a loading rate of 0 004 n s and the trend line of the suction force indicates that a slight increase in suction force occurs above the loading rate of 2 05 n s therefore the loading rates of 0 004 and 2 05 n s were considered to have induced drained and undrained conditions respectively fig 10 shows the variation in pullout resistance v f s with bucket displacement for loading rates of 0 004 2 05 n s v is the pullout load applied to the bucket and f s is the suction force developed beneath the bucket lid the pullout resistance varied according to the loading rate for small loading rates of 0 004 and 0 008 n s the bucket resistance to pullout rapidly increased to some maximum value approximately 22 1 n with no high displacement of the bucket the pullout resistance decreased beyond the maximum value thereby causing large bucket displacements this decrease was more pronounced in the loading rate of 0 008 n s than that in 0 004 n s this result was supported by the finding of thicken et al 2014 that at slow loading rates the gap between the bucket lid and the entrapped soil increases with bucket displacement such that the seepage flow inside the bucket is sufficient to dissipate the suction developed inside the bucket consequently the bucket pulls out without the trapped soil at a loading rate of 0 08 n s the bucket resistance to pullout first increased rapidly to approximately 20 n without bucket displacement and then gently increased to a peak value of approximately 21 n during a bucket displacement of 1 13 mm beyond the peak value the resistance to pullout decreased which led to large bucket displacements the trends for the variation in pullout resistance with bucket displacement in 0 08 and 0 008 n s were almost similar pullout rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s exhibited similar trends with the pullout resistance of the bucket initially increasing rapidly to maximum values of 17 6 and 20 3 n s respectively without the bucket undergoing considerable displacement the pullout resistance continued to increase with the increase in bucket displacement but at a low rate until a maximum value was reached maximum values of pullout resistances approximated to 24 and 28 7 n for loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively these values were reached at bucket displacements of 15 4 and 19 5 mm for loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively beyond the maximum value the pullout resistance decreased with the increase in bucket displacement at a fast rate at loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s the bucket pulled out with the trapped soil a similar observation was reported by thicken et al 2014 for large loading rates the suction pressures developed inside the bucket limited the expansion of the gap between the bucket lid and the entrapped soil hence limiting seepage flow into the bucket table 2 presents a summary of test results for the pullout capacities and suction pressure developed inside the bucket at various loading rates the pullout capacity of the bucket v 0 was determined by applying the tangent intersection method fig 11 this method determines the capacity as the load at the intersection point of two tangent lines fitted at the beginning and the latter parts of the curve graham et al 1982 mansur and kaufman 1956 samtani and nowatzki 2006 hung et al 2018 compared with other conventional methods this approach is most suitable to estimate yield loads villalobos 2006 during a severe storm with current and wave loading the first stage of bucket pullout characterizes the pullout capacity rao et al 1997 sawicki et al 2016 therefore bucket displacements between 0 and 30 mm were considered to avoid overestimation of the pullout capacities the bucket displacement at v 0 was applied to corresponding curves in fig 8 to estimate the suction pressure developed at pullout capacity the suction pressure in fig 8 was multiplied by the cross sectional area of the bucket to get the suction force f s shown in fig 12 the effect of the suction force was addressed by v 0 f s0 which slightly increased with the loading rate the suction force increased nonlinearly with the loading rate and constituted the largest portion of the bucket pullout capacity for loading rates greater than 0 18 n s for example the value varied as 57 and 62 of the pullout capacity for loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively 3 2 evaluation of drained and undrained pullout capacities 3 2 1 drained pullout capacity vd the suction pressure changed according to the drainage condition inside the bucket fig 13 shows the forces acting on the bucket during drained pullout loading under the drained condition the suction pressure was so small that its effect on the pullout capacity was negligible the fully drained pullout capacity of the bucket equaled the total friction along the bucket wall interface rahman et al 2001 under the undrained condition no dissipation of the suction pressure occurred between the drained and undrained conditions i e partially drained condition the pullout capacity of the bucket increased with the increase in suction pressure das 1986 and byrne 2000 suggested eqs 1 and 2 to evaluate the pullout capacity of the bucket v 0 as follows 1 v 0 r s outer r s inner f s 0 w b 2 r s outer r s inner γ l 2 k tan δ π d l where r s outer is the frictional resistance between the outer face of the skirt and the soil r s inner is the frictional resistance between the inner surface of the skirt and the inside soil f s0 is the suction force inside the bucket γ is the effective unit weight of soil k is the lateral earth pressure coefficient and δ is the friction angle between the soil and the skirt wall w b 7 61 n is the submerged weight of the bucket the drained and undrained pullout capacities were determined from the test results table 3 das and shin 1992 conducted laboratory model testing of metal piles and discussed the relevancy of the soil pile interface angle on uplift capacity hung et al 2017 found that the suction pressure inside a bucket exerts a crucial effect on the pullout capacity of the bucket the drained pullout capacity was determined from the test results and eqs 1 and 2 as respectively suggested by das 1986 and byrne 2000 were used to evaluate the pullout capacity of the bucket the drained pullout capacity v d was defined as the v 0 value at a loading rate of 0 004 n s which had the smallest suction pressure as shown in figs 7 and 8 the pullout capacity v d was approximately equal to 22 1 n the drained pullout capacity v d equaled v 0 in eq 1 because suction pressure f s 0 k tan δ was evaluated by integrating v d 22 1 n into eq 1 as discussed by houlsby and byrne 2005 and hung et al 2017 k tan δ could not be separated k tan δ 0 182 was obtained to match v d of 22 1 n in eq 1 in fig 12 v 0 f s0 showed a minimal increasing trend with the loading rate under partially drained conditions the skin friction outside the bucket increased with the increase in loading rate whereas the skin friction inside the bucket decreased this variation in skin frictions made it difficult to separately quantify the skirt resistances for the inner and outer faces of the bucket the increase in skin resistance with increasing loading rate was due to the fact that the outer face of the bucket skirt was subjected to downward seepage gradients whereas the inner face was acted on by upward seepage gradients outer seepage gradients increased the effective stress of the soil whereas inner gradients decreased the effective stress at a slow loading rate 0 004 n s the seepage flow inside the bucket was insufficient to degrade the skin resistance along the inner face of the bucket skirt loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s induced large seepage gradients along the outer face of the bucket which increased effective stress and friction resistance along the outer skirt 3 2 2 undrained pullout capacity vu fig 14 theoretically illustrates the equilibrium of forces acting on the bucket during pullout loading if the suction pressure developed inside the bucket is sufficient to hold the soil plug during the bucket pullout the submerged weight of the soil plug is added to the weight of the bucket as a dead load and internal skin resistance disappears because the effective stress of the soil converges to zero albert et al 1989 the outer skin resistance increases due to the seepage force caused by the suction pressure under the bucket the high transient tensile capacity of the bucket in saturated sand is developed under the appropriate loading conditions during pullout loading bye et al 1995 byrne 2000 byrne and houlsby 2004 kelly et al 2003 therefore the pullout capacity under the undrained condition can be estimated by considering the equilibrium of force as follows 3 v u w b w s r s outer f tensile f seepage where w s is the submerged weight of the soil plug and can be calculated by the difference between the top and bottom suctions of the bucket f s top f s bottom f tensile is the transient tensile capacity that occurs under the bucket and it has the same force as f s bottom f seepage indicates the increase in external skin resistance due to the increase in effective stress by downward seepage iskander et al 2002 houlsby and byrne 2005 hung et al 2017 and can be evaluated as follows 4 f seepage i γ w l 2 k tan δ π d l where i is the hydraulic gradient for the undrained condition the suction pressure inside the bucket is assumed to be sufficient to lift all the entrapped soil and f tensile f s bottom is estimated to be 29 0 n f seepage can be estimated as 11 8 n from the back calculation and i corresponding to f seepage is estimated to be 1 26 3 2 3 undrained pullout capacity vu simplified approach a comparison of the drained and undrained conditions shows that the pullout capacity under drained condition is affected only by the skin friction therefore the pullout capacity can be easily predicted if the weight of the bucket and β ktanδ are known estimation of the pullout capacity under undrained condition is complex and sometimes requires many input parameters v u can be obtained theoretically using eq 3 but this equation is difficult to apply to the field for the reasons already mentioned hence the purpose of this section is to propose a simplified approach to estimating the pullout capacity of the bucket even if we do not have any parameters for suction for a simplified approach the following two assumptions are made 1 the maximum f tensile is limited to γ w l a which is the buoyancy on the bucket bottom 2 the increase in r s outer due to seepage force is the same as the decrease in r s inner on the first assumption f tensile is zero for the initial state without bucket displacement and then increases with loading rate and bucket displacement the effective unit weight of soil in the bucket increases as f tensile increases and reaches the saturated unit weight of soil when f tensile is equal to the buoyancy acting on the bucket bottom although f tensile increases with bucket displacement the results of this study revealed that the bucket displacement for the ultimate state of the pullout was less than 10 of the bucket diameter and that f tensile was similar to buoyancy on the bucket bottom in this displacement range byrne and houlsby 2002 also noted that the displacement required to generate the maximum tensile capacity was approximately 5 10 of the bucket diameter from a conservative point of view when f tensile reaches the buoyancy at the bucket bottom it is regarded as the ultimate pullout limit state for bucket foundations on the second assumption the generation of seepage force due to the pullout leads to r s inner decrease and r s outer increase however the variation of the two r s differs and estimating them quantitatively is difficult because they have different constraints nevertheless the magnitudes of the increase and decrease in the two r s can be expected to be similar because the seepage flow occurs from the outside to the inside bucket when the bucket filled with soil is considered as one body the vertical water pressure acting on the body is also considered as shown in fig 15 v u w b w soil r s γ w h a γ w h a γ w l a f tensile 5 v u w b w soil r s γ w l a f tensile where h is the water level from the top of the bucket and l is the height of the bucket the water pressure at the bottom of the bucket is γ w h l a the ultimate pullout limit state f t e n s i l e is supposed to be equal to γ w l a and the ultimate pullout capacity is estimated as follows 6 v u w b w soil r s where r s r s outer f seepage f seepage is assumed to be equal to r s inner and the final equation for estimating v u is as follows 7 v u w b w soil r s inner r s outer table 3 shows the comparison between the test and the estimated results the estimated pullout capacity for the drained condition was the same as the test result because ktanδ used in eq 1 was back calculated from the test results for v u under undrained condition eq 7 predicted v u 68 9 n which was smaller than that obtained by the hyperbolic curve method for experimental results one of the reasons for this result is that the conservative value was applied by assuming f seepage is equal to r s inner and a difference of approximately 5 n is found nevertheless v u by simplified approach is comparable to v u 75 n obtained by the hyperbolic curve method the pullout test was performed only on relatively loose sand conditions in this study however the change in the relative density of the soil affects the permeability of the soil and skin resistance of the inner and outer faces of the bucket skirt asakereh and kamali 2018 as the relative density increases r s and unit weight of the soil increase and permeability decreases low permeability results in relatively high suction pressure specifically at a slow loading rate this finding means that the pullout capacity based on the loading rate quickly converges to v u than that of low relative density however the permeability of the soil will not have a significant effect on the magnitude of v u and the v u can be increased by increasing r s and w soil therefore the effect of relative density can be reflected by evaluating r s and w soil that correspond to relative density in the proposed model 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of loading rate on the static vertical pullout bearing capacity of a bucket foundation in sand a series of 1 g model tests was conducted on the model bucket with l d 1 0 the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the pullout capacity of the bucket increased with the increase in loading rate 2 the suction force increased nonlinearly with the loading rate and constituted the largest portion of the bucket pullout capacity 3 the bucket showed higher resistances to pullout at larger loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s compared with slower loading rates 0 004 n s the higher pullout resistance was due to the increase in effective stress outside the bucket effective stresses increased because of the downward seepage gradients induced by suction force beneath the bucket the increase in effective stress was due to downward seepage gradients along the external face of the bucket 4 the deformation of the soil outside the bucket increased with the increase in the loading rate soil deformations outside the bucket were inconsiderable at slow loading rates 0 004 n s compared with those at large loading rates 0 66 and 2 05 n s 5 estimating the pullout capacity of the bucket by applying the theoretical approach is complicated and results obtained may be unrealistic the drained pullout capacity of the bucket can be reliably estimated by applying the proposed equation which considers the outer and inner skin frictions along the outer and inner faces of the bucket skirt the submerged weight of the bucket and the suction inside the bucket f s 0 0 6 a theoretical equation was proposed to estimate the undrained pullout capacity of the bucket in this equation v u is calculated as the sum of the submerged weights of the bucket and trapped soil the outer skirt friction resistance the tensile force beneath the bucket and the seepage force outside the bucket 7 in practice estimating the pullout capacity of buckets under the undrained condition is a difficult task due to complexities associated with the estimation of parameters therefore a simplified approach to estimating the ultimate pullout capacity considering only the weights of the buckets and the entrapped soil as well as the inner and outer skirt resistances of the buckets was proposed credit authorship contribution statement ssenyondo vicent conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis writing original draft

21735,a series of 1 g model tests was performed to investigate the effect of loading rate on the vertical pullout capacity of offshore bucket foundations in sand the bucket model had a length to diameter ratio of 1 0 loading rates varied from 0 004 n s to 2 05 n s the pullout load increased with bucket displacement and loading rate the loading rate of 0 004 n s induced drained conditions with negligible suction pressure and high skin resistance increasing the loading rate induced high suction pressures inside the bucket the bucket pullout capacity increased with bucket displacement and

forms of loading and ground media hung and kim 2012 foglia et al 2013 2014 cox et al 2014 hung et al 2018 compared with other foundation solutions bucket foundations are multipurpose the installation procedure of bucket foundations involves self weight penetration followed by application of suction to continue the penetration as discussed by houlsby and byrne 2005 the advent and geotechnical aspects of bucket foundations were discussed in detail in tjelta 1994 bye et al 1995 and tjelta 2001 bucket foundations are a suitable alternative for anchoring offshore structures bai and jin 2015 offshore structures can be anchored directly at the seabed bottom fixed in shallow waters or indirectly by deep sea tension cables for direct anchorage at the seabed bucket foundations are connected to the bottom of jackets or tripod structures and penetrated to deep ground depths as illustrated by wu et al 2019 the impact of wind and wave loads induces large moments on the bucket causing it to pull out of the sea bed soil kelly et al 2004 it has been reported that the stability of tripod bucket foundations is mainly governed by the pullout capacity of the upward bucket kim et al 2014 skau

2017 mccarron 2011 the action of wind and wave loads induces large buoyant and dynamic forces that affect the floating structure ultimately pulling out the bucket schneider and senders 2010 therefore understanding the pullout capacity of buckets is important the pullout capacity of the bucket has been investigated by several studies and findings reveal that such capacity is considerably affected

depending on factors such as loading rate soil permeability and seepage nielsen et al 2015 asakereh and kamali 2018 conducted fe analyses and investigated the effects of soil cohesion relative density

to evaluate the pullout capacity considering the above soil parameters thieken et al 2014 performed a series of numerical analyses on buckets l d 1 0 d 12 m varying loading rates between 0 001 and 1000 mm s the suction heave and capacity of the bucket were found to increase with the loading rate slow loading rates induced drained failure whereas higher loading rates induced undrained failure characterized by the uplift of the soil plug hung et al 2017 conducted 1 g model tests on buckets l d 1 0 and 0 5 d 150 mm and observed that pullout capacities were higher in saturated sand compared with dry sand the reason for this finding is that suction developed inside buckets in saturated sand that increased the pullout resistance equations were proposed to evaluate the pullout capacity of buckets with and without suction sawicki et al 2016 proposed that the pullout capacity can be estimated by summing up the submerged weight of the bucket soil plug suction force inside the bucket and the inner and outer skin resistance of the bucket the pullout capacity is also affected by dilatancy drainage characteristics of soil and period of loading in the long term pullout loads cause a decrease in mean effective stress thereby lowering the skin resistance along with the bucket bye et al 1995 in the short term high loading rates induce large magnitudes of suction and effective stress that increases skin resistance byrne 2000 the maximum tensile load and suction pressure can be estimated by applying equations proposed by houlsby et al 2005 that account for fast loading research has also revealed that increasing bucket embedment depth at constant diameter increases the resistance to bucket pullout wang et al 2019 by contrast increasing the bucket diameter at constant embedment depth decreases the pullout resistance patel and singh 2019 the effect of load inclination angle on the pullout capacity was investigated by rao et al 2006 for anchors in marine clays load inclination angles varied between 0 horizontal load and 90 vertical load least pullout resistances were shown when the pullout load was applied vertically indicating a critical loading direction and common case in deep sea suction bucket anchors only a few studies have been conducted on the effect of drainage condition on pullout capacity and how to evaluate pullout capacity requires further investigation the evaluation of the static pullout capacity of buckets can be applied to the design of foundations for floating structures el gharbawy and olson 1998 and structures founded on monopod tripod and tetrapod buckets under cyclic loading hung et al 2017 tran et al 2017 therefore the present study conducted a series of 1 g tests to investigate the effect of drainage condition on the static pullout capacity of buckets pullout loads were applied to a bucket with l d 1 0 slow 0 004 n s to fast 2 05 n s loading rates were implemented to vary the drainage condition of the soil the results could be applied to the preliminary design of suction buckets subjected to pullout forces 2 model tests 2 1 bucket foundation model and test program this study considered a prototype bucket with d 15 m l 15 m skirt thickness 33 mm and a rigid reinforced lid the model bucket had d 150 mm l 150 mm and skirt and lid thicknesses of 1 and 5 mm respectively the dimensions of the model bucket were obtained by applying a length scale of 1 100 to the prototype bucket wood 2004 the bucket model was fabricated with a skirt thickness of 1 mm because the applied length scale of 1 100 resulted in a skirt thickness of 0 33 mm which was extremely thin to fabricate however the 1 mm thickness of the skirt induces only a 0 8 reduction of the contact area between the bucket and soil compared with the 0 033 mm thickness therefore the thickness change has a limited effect on the pullout capacity of the bucket in addition the ratio of skirt thickness to bucket diameter in the study is 0 007 and the range of 0 005 0 008 is generally applied by previous studies e g hung et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2013 foglia et al 2013 nielsen et al 2017 fig 1 shows the structure of the bucket model applied in the study a similar model bucket was observed to work efficiently in the study of hung et al 2017 the bucket material was aluminum with a young s modulus of elasticity e 70 gpa the bucket was ventilated with three holes on the lid an internally threaded socket was fabricated on the bucket lid to receive an externally threaded plug on the closed end of the plug a hole was provided for attaching the loading wire the test program investigated the effects of various loading rates on the static pullout capacity of the bucket with l d 1 0 the loading regime comprised five loading rates applied to the bucket varying between 0 004 and 2 05 n s the following sections present the discussion on the change in loading rate and its effect on the pullout capacity of the bucket the approximate values of pullout capacities of the bucket under fully drained partially drained and fully undrained conditions were estimated 2 2 test setup fig 2 shows an assembly of the equipment used to conduct the tests the equipment consisted of two pulleys fixed to an overhead rigid steel beam a steel loading wire with a diameter of 1 mm a high level water supply tank a control valve a lightweight cylindrical loading container a load cell two linear variable differential transformers a pore water pressure transducer and a circular soil box the pore water pressure transducer and load cell were calibrated before the start of each test the pulley system was used to enhance smooth movement of the loading wire during the loading process the steel loading wire connected the bucket to the loading container a pullout load was applied to the bucket through this wire the water supply tank was filled with a sufficient quantity of water to load the bucket the control valve with a gauge attached controlled the quantity of water flow into the loading container the circular soil box contained the model ground the instrumentation incorporated a data logger and labview program the data logger was used to measure and collect data the labview computer program was used to establish and visualize the test requirements the operation sequence of the test equipment can be described as follows the control valve was initially set to pass a uniform rate of flow into the loading container the flow rate was carefully adjusted to match the required loading rate a uniform stream of water was smoothly discharged at the bottom of the loading container as flow into the loading container increased the tension load in the wire also increased translating into a pullout load on the bucket lid this pullout load increased with the increase in the volume of water in the container the tensile load in the wire pullout load was measured by the load cell attached between the loading wire and the suspended container during pullout loading the changes in pore water pressure inside the bucket were recorded by the pore water pressure transducer attached on the bucket lid the preliminary tests conducted showed that suction force was largest below the bucket lid the suction force increased with the increase in pullout load the pore water pressure transducer was fitted in the hole drilled through the bucket lid to capture this phenomenon this assembly captured the suction pressures developed during the bucket pullout process because the pore water pressure transducer moved along with the bucket 2 3 model ground preparation and test setup the aluminum circular soil box used in this study was 5 mm thick and internally measured 600 mm in diameter by 450 mm in depth a similar soil box was used by hung et al 2017 who recommended it suitable for performing tests after a series of finite element analyses the ground used was silica sand with the particle size distribution and material properties shown in fig 3 and table 1 respectively the ground was initially saturated for a period of 48 h water pluviation was then conducted on saturated sand particles this procedure involved the stacking of astm sieve no 40 over the soil box followed by filling the soil box with water to a height of 445 mm the bottom 50 mm of the sieve was submerged in water saturated sand was washed over the submerged sieve which caused the particles to disperse and settle inside the soil box with a uniform velocity vaid and negussey 1988 the above process was continued until the required ground depth of 300 mm was achieved the water pluviation method resulted in a relatively uniform ground fig 4 γ s a t at 17 3 kn m3 was obtained by testing soil samples from small aluminum tins embedded in the ground at soil depths of 50 150 and 300 mm at the time of ground preparation the relative density of the ground was computed for each model ground prepared and was found to be 28 a 650 mm diameter by 10 mm thick circular acryl template with a 156 mm diameter central hole was fabricated to centrally position the bucket the template was designed to cover the entire top of the circular soil box and placed in such a way that its outer edge matched the top edge of the circular soil box with the use of a guide beam the bucket was carefully positioned through the central hole to touch the ground surface the guide beam was similar to the one in hung et al 2017 weights were incrementally added over the vertical guide to slowly penetrate the bucket into the ground penetration was completed when the bottom face of the lid touched the ground surface which was observed through the opened drainage hole during installation the holes on the lid of the bucket were kept opened to pass out air and water entrapped inside the bucket after installation a pore water pressure transducer was fitted in one hole the remaining two holes were plugged before commencing the test the bucket was installed with an average velocity of 0 0625 mm s which was sufficiently small to prevent excess pore water pressures from building up inside the bucket guo et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 pullout capacity according to pullout rate fig 5 illustrates the typical deformed shape of the soil surface according to the pullout rate at the rate of 0 008 n s no deformation occurred on the soil surface fig 5a however at the rate of 0 66 n s the soil surrounding the bucket sank the average deformed width x in fig 5b became wider with the increase in loading rate and was expressed as a ratio of the bucket diameter x d the ratio x d varied as 0 0 30 0 47 and 0 67 for the loading rates of 0 008 0 08 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively the water head above the ground surface was lowered to zero and the bucket was carefully removed to determine the reason for the deformation of the soil surrounding the bucket fig 6 a and b respectively show the diagrams of the deformed soil and the extracted soil cap at 2 05 n s the volume of the trapped soil increased with the increase in the pullout rate this result showed that the soil inside the bucket moved upward together with the pullout of the bucket and a fast pullout rate caused a large force that trapped the inside soil fig 7 shows the pullout load displacement curves of the bucket the pullout load increased with the pullout rate the pullout load at 25 mm increased approximately four times from 22 49 n at 0 004 n s to 82 22 n at 2 05 n s the reason for the increasing pullout load with the loading rate was the suction pressure development inside the bucket fig 8 shows the measured suction pressure below the lid of the bucket the suction pressure increased with the increase in displacement and loading rate fig 9 shows the suction force inside the bucket on the basis of the loading rate the suction force was nearly zero at a loading rate of 0 004 n s and the trend line of the suction force indicates that a slight increase in suction force occurs above the loading rate of 2 05 n s therefore the loading rates of 0 004 and 2 05 n s were considered to have induced drained and undrained conditions respectively fig 10 shows the variation in pullout resistance v f s with bucket displacement for loading rates of 0 004 2 05 n s v is the pullout load applied to the bucket and f s is the suction force developed beneath the bucket lid the pullout resistance varied according to the loading rate for small loading rates of 0 004 and 0 008 n s the bucket resistance to pullout rapidly increased to some maximum value approximately 22 1 n with no high displacement of the bucket the pullout resistance decreased beyond the maximum value thereby causing large bucket displacements this decrease was more pronounced in the loading rate of 0 008 n s than that in 0 004 n s this result was supported by the finding of thicken et al 2014 that at slow loading rates the gap between the bucket lid and the entrapped soil increases with bucket displacement such that the seepage flow inside the bucket is sufficient to dissipate the suction developed inside the bucket consequently the bucket pulls out without the trapped soil at a loading rate of 0 08 n s the bucket resistance to pullout first increased rapidly to approximately 20 n without bucket displacement and then gently increased to a peak value of approximately 21 n during a bucket displacement of 1 13 mm beyond the peak value the resistance to pullout decreased which led to large bucket displacements the trends for the variation in pullout resistance with bucket displacement in 0 08 and 0 008 n s were almost similar pullout rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s exhibited similar trends with the pullout resistance of the bucket initially increasing rapidly to maximum values of 17 6 and 20 3 n s respectively without the bucket undergoing considerable displacement the pullout resistance continued to increase with the increase in bucket displacement but at a low rate until a maximum value was reached maximum values of pullout resistances approximated to 24 and 28 7 n for loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively these values were reached at bucket displacements of 15 4 and 19 5 mm for loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively beyond the maximum value the pullout resistance decreased with the increase in bucket displacement at a fast rate at loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s the bucket pulled out with the trapped soil a similar observation was reported by thicken et al 2014 for large loading rates the suction pressures developed inside the bucket limited the expansion of the gap between the bucket lid and the entrapped soil hence limiting seepage flow into the bucket table 2 presents a summary of test results for the pullout capacities and suction pressure developed inside the bucket at various loading rates the pullout capacity of the bucket v 0 was determined by applying the tangent intersection method fig 11 this method determines the capacity as the load at the intersection point of two tangent lines fitted at the beginning and the latter parts of the curve graham et al 1982 mansur and kaufman 1956 samtani and nowatzki 2006 hung et al 2018 compared with other conventional methods this approach is most suitable to estimate yield loads villalobos 2006 during a severe storm with current and wave loading the first stage of bucket pullout characterizes the pullout capacity rao et al 1997 sawicki et al 2016 therefore bucket displacements between 0 and 30 mm were considered to avoid overestimation of the pullout capacities the bucket displacement at v 0 was applied to corresponding curves in fig 8 to estimate the suction pressure developed at pullout capacity the suction pressure in fig 8 was multiplied by the cross sectional area of the bucket to get the suction force f s shown in fig 12 the effect of the suction force was addressed by v 0 f s0 which slightly increased with the loading rate the suction force increased nonlinearly with the loading rate and constituted the largest portion of the bucket pullout capacity for loading rates greater than 0 18 n s for example the value varied as 57 and 62 of the pullout capacity for loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s respectively 3 2 evaluation of drained and undrained pullout capacities 3 2 1 drained pullout capacity vd the suction pressure changed according to the drainage condition inside the bucket fig 13 shows the forces acting on the bucket during drained pullout loading under the drained condition the suction pressure was so small that its effect on the pullout capacity was negligible the fully drained pullout capacity of the bucket equaled the total friction along the bucket wall interface rahman et al 2001 under the undrained condition no dissipation of the suction pressure occurred between the drained and undrained conditions i e partially drained condition the pullout capacity of the bucket increased with the increase in suction pressure das 1986 and byrne 2000 suggested eqs 1 and 2 to evaluate the pullout capacity of the bucket v 0 as follows 1 v 0 r s outer r s inner f s 0 w b 2 r s outer r s inner γ l 2 k tan δ π d l where r s outer is the frictional resistance between the outer face of the skirt and the soil r s inner is the frictional resistance between the inner surface of the skirt and the inside soil f s0 is the suction force inside the bucket γ is the effective unit weight of soil k is the lateral earth pressure coefficient and δ is the friction angle between the soil and the skirt wall w b 7 61 n is the submerged weight of the bucket the drained and undrained pullout capacities were determined from the test results table 3 das and shin 1992 conducted laboratory model testing of metal piles and discussed the relevancy of the soil pile interface angle on uplift capacity hung et al 2017 found that the suction pressure inside a bucket exerts a crucial effect on the pullout capacity of the bucket the drained pullout capacity was determined from the test results and eqs 1 and 2 as respectively suggested by das 1986 and byrne 2000 were used to evaluate the pullout capacity of the bucket the drained pullout capacity v d was defined as the v 0 value at a loading rate of 0 004 n s which had the smallest suction pressure as shown in figs 7 and 8 the pullout capacity v d was approximately equal to 22 1 n the drained pullout capacity v d equaled v 0 in eq 1 because suction pressure f s 0 k tan δ was evaluated by integrating v d 22 1 n into eq 1 as discussed by houlsby and byrne 2005 and hung et al 2017 k tan δ could not be separated k tan δ 0 182 was obtained to match v d of 22 1 n in eq 1 in fig 12 v 0 f s0 showed a minimal increasing trend with the loading rate under partially drained conditions the skin friction outside the bucket increased with the increase in loading rate whereas the skin friction inside the bucket decreased this variation in skin frictions made it difficult to separately quantify the skirt resistances for the inner and outer faces of the bucket the increase in skin resistance with increasing loading rate was due to the fact that the outer face of the bucket skirt was subjected to downward seepage gradients whereas the inner face was acted on by upward seepage gradients outer seepage gradients increased the effective stress of the soil whereas inner gradients decreased the effective stress at a slow loading rate 0 004 n s the seepage flow inside the bucket was insufficient to degrade the skin resistance along the inner face of the bucket skirt loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s induced large seepage gradients along the outer face of the bucket which increased effective stress and friction resistance along the outer skirt 3 2 2 undrained pullout capacity vu fig 14 theoretically illustrates the equilibrium of forces acting on the bucket during pullout loading if the suction pressure developed inside the bucket is sufficient to hold the soil plug during the bucket pullout the submerged weight of the soil plug is added to the weight of the bucket as a dead load and internal skin resistance disappears because the effective stress of the soil converges to zero albert et al 1989 the outer skin resistance increases due to the seepage force caused by the suction pressure under the bucket the high transient tensile capacity of the bucket in saturated sand is developed under the appropriate loading conditions during pullout loading bye et al 1995 byrne 2000 byrne and houlsby 2004 kelly et al 2003 therefore the pullout capacity under the undrained condition can be estimated by considering the equilibrium of force as follows 3 v u w b w s r s outer f tensile f seepage where w s is the submerged weight of the soil plug and can be calculated by the difference between the top and bottom suctions of the bucket f s top f s bottom f tensile is the transient tensile capacity that occurs under the bucket and it has the same force as f s bottom f seepage indicates the increase in external skin resistance due to the increase in effective stress by downward seepage iskander et al 2002 houlsby and byrne 2005 hung et al 2017 and can be evaluated as follows 4 f seepage i γ w l 2 k tan δ π d l where i is the hydraulic gradient for the undrained condition the suction pressure inside the bucket is assumed to be sufficient to lift all the entrapped soil and f tensile f s bottom is estimated to be 29 0 n f seepage can be estimated as 11 8 n from the back calculation and i corresponding to f seepage is estimated to be 1 26 3 2 3 undrained pullout capacity vu simplified approach a comparison of the drained and undrained conditions shows that the pullout capacity under drained condition is affected only by the skin friction therefore the pullout capacity can be easily predicted if the weight of the bucket and β ktanδ are known estimation of the pullout capacity under undrained condition is complex and sometimes requires many input parameters v u can be obtained theoretically using eq 3 but this equation is difficult to apply to the field for the reasons already mentioned hence the purpose of this section is to propose a simplified approach to estimating the pullout capacity of the bucket even if we do not have any parameters for suction for a simplified approach the following two assumptions are made 1 the maximum f tensile is limited to γ w l a which is the buoyancy on the bucket bottom 2 the increase in r s outer due to seepage force is the same as the decrease in r s inner on the first assumption f tensile is zero for the initial state without bucket displacement and then increases with loading rate and bucket displacement the effective unit weight of soil in the bucket increases as f tensile increases and reaches the saturated unit weight of soil when f tensile is equal to the buoyancy acting on the bucket bottom although f tensile increases with bucket displacement the results of this study revealed that the bucket displacement for the ultimate state of the pullout was less than 10 of the bucket diameter and that f tensile was similar to buoyancy on the bucket bottom in this displacement range byrne and houlsby 2002 also noted that the displacement required to generate the maximum tensile capacity was approximately 5 10 of the bucket diameter from a conservative point of view when f tensile reaches the buoyancy at the bucket bottom it is regarded as the ultimate pullout limit state for bucket foundations on the second assumption the generation of seepage force due to the pullout leads to r s inner decrease and r s outer increase however the variation of the two r s differs and estimating them quantitatively is difficult because they have different constraints nevertheless the magnitudes of the increase and decrease in the two r s can be expected to be similar because the seepage flow occurs from the outside to the inside bucket when the bucket filled with soil is considered as one body the vertical water pressure acting on the body is also considered as shown in fig 15 v u w b w soil r s γ w h a γ w h a γ w l a f tensile 5 v u w b w soil r s γ w l a f tensile where h is the water level from the top of the bucket and l is the height of the bucket the water pressure at the bottom of the bucket is γ w h l a the ultimate pullout limit state f t e n s i l e is supposed to be equal to γ w l a and the ultimate pullout capacity is estimated as follows 6 v u w b w soil r s where r s r s outer f seepage f seepage is assumed to be equal to r s inner and the final equation for estimating v u is as follows 7 v u w b w soil r s inner r s outer table 3 shows the comparison between the test and the estimated results the estimated pullout capacity for the drained condition was the same as the test result because ktanδ used in eq 1 was back calculated from the test results for v u under undrained condition eq 7 predicted v u 68 9 n which was smaller than that obtained by the hyperbolic curve method for experimental results one of the reasons for this result is that the conservative value was applied by assuming f seepage is equal to r s inner and a difference of approximately 5 n is found nevertheless v u by simplified approach is comparable to v u 75 n obtained by the hyperbolic curve method the pullout test was performed only on relatively loose sand conditions in this study however the change in the relative density of the soil affects the permeability of the soil and skin resistance of the inner and outer faces of the bucket skirt asakereh and kamali 2018 as the relative density increases r s and unit weight of the soil increase and permeability decreases low permeability results in relatively high suction pressure specifically at a slow loading rate this finding means that the pullout capacity based on the loading rate quickly converges to v u than that of low relative density however the permeability of the soil will not have a significant effect on the magnitude of v u and the v u can be increased by increasing r s and w soil therefore the effect of relative density can be reflected by evaluating r s and w soil that correspond to relative density in the proposed model 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of loading rate on the static vertical pullout bearing capacity of a bucket foundation in sand a series of 1 g model tests was conducted on the model bucket with l d 1 0 the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the pullout capacity of the bucket increased with the increase in loading rate 2 the suction force increased nonlinearly with the loading rate and constituted the largest portion of the bucket pullout capacity 3 the bucket showed higher resistances to pullout at larger loading rates of 0 66 and 2 05 n s compared with slower loading rates 0 004 n s the higher pullout resistance was due to the increase in effective stress outside the bucket effective stresses increased because of the downward seepage gradients induced by suction force beneath the bucket the increase in effective stress was due to downward seepage gradients along the external face of the bucket 4 the deformation of the soil outside the bucket increased with the increase in the loading rate soil deformations outside the bucket were inconsiderable at slow loading rates 0 004 n s compared with those at large loading rates 0 66 and 2 05 n s 5 estimating the pullout capacity of the bucket by applying the theoretical approach is complicated and results obtained may be unrealistic the drained pullout capacity of the bucket can be reliably estimated by applying the proposed equation which considers the outer and inner skin frictions along the outer and inner faces of the bucket skirt the submerged weight of the bucket and the suction inside the bucket f s 0 0 6 a theoretical equation was proposed to estimate the undrained pullout capacity of the bucket in this equation v u is calculated as the sum of the submerged weights of the bucket and trapped soil the outer skirt friction resistance the tensile force beneath the bucket and the seepage force outside the bucket 7 in practice estimating the pullout capacity of buckets under the undrained condition is a difficult task due to complexities associated with the estimation of parameters therefore a simplified approach to estimating the ultimate pullout capacity considering only the weights of the buckets and the entrapped soil as well as the inner and outer skirt resistances of the buckets was proposed credit authorship contribution statement ssenyondo vicent conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis writing original draft

21736,the vortex induced motion vim of semi submersible is gaining increasing attention from both industry and academia with the recent development of deep draft semi submersible platforms field measurements of semi submersibles reveal that the vim responses are typically found to be smaller than those observed in model tests the possible factors causing the vim response reduction in the field measurements include reynolds number wave effects mass ratios and external damping from mooring lines the objective of this study is to investigate the mooring induced damping effects on vim the finite analytic navier stokes fans code is integrated with an in house six degree of freedom dof motion solver and an in house nonlinear finite element fem code mooring3d for the coupled cfd fem analysis of the vim of a moored semi submersible the large eddy simulation les turbulence model is used to provide accurate estimation of hydrodynamic loading simulations are performed for the 1 70 model of the platform under varying reduced velocities full scale mooring systems with different water depths and mooring line numbers are designed to represent different levels of mooring damping effects the simulated vim response is compared with the experiments the study reveals that mooring induced damping is a critical factor contributing to the vim response reduction in the field keywords large eddy simulation les deep draft semi submersible vortex induced motion vim mooring damping coupled cfd mooring analysis 1 introduction the vim of semi submersible offshore platforms becomes a crucial issue as the development of deep draft semi submersible is gaining increasing popularity for the offshore oil and gas production at present the model tests have been the industry recognized method for estimating the vim response of semi submersibles waals et al 2007 conducted experiments on vim of semi submersible floaters in this model test two soft springs were used to provide the horizontal restoring force to model the mooring system of the floater however recent studies performed by irani et al 2015 ma et al 2013 andrijken and leverette 2009 indicate that the vim response in the field is much less than as observed in the model tests for example ma et al 2013 pointed out that amplitudes of vim in the field appear much smaller than the observation in model tests with a reduction ratio of as much as 50 the approach of only using standard model test information leads to the overly conservative estimation of vim amplitudes consequently the strength check and vim fatigue life design of mooring lines and risers are affected with significant impact on costs the differences between field measurements and model test observations are likely due to different mass ratios wave effects in the field reynolds number appurtenance structures and external damping induced by mooring lines and risers koop and wilde 2016 demonstrated that changing the mass ratio of the floater has a small influence on the vim response also the effect of unsteady current on the vim response is minimal with regard to wave damping effects on vim the experiments revealed that vim response under inline or transverse waves is smaller than that without waves and depends on wave heading and wave height in accordance with hong et al 2008 and goncalves et al 2013 the vim response shows a significant reduction or even disappears in large waves 100 year or hurricane waves according to martin and rijken 2012 and koop and wilde 2016 the reduction in vim response is negligible in small waves as found in operational seas during loop current events the waves are small or absent therefore damping effects associated with waves in operational sea states are not the main reason for the considerable reduction of vim response as observed in the field regarding effects of appurtenance structures koop and wilde 2016 indicates that the small appurtenance structures are commonly omitted in vim model tests for multicolumn semi submersibles rijken et al 2011 proves that the effect of the appurtenance appears to have only minimal effects on the vim response the appurtenance includes riser porches riser guards fairleads anodes caissons etc an increased modeling detail of appurtenance does not significantly change the vim response hence the appurtenance structures are not the reason causing considerable reduction of vim response in the field in terms of the effects of reynolds number chen and chen 2016 used the finite analytic navier stokes fans cfd method for the simulation of semi submersible vim response in both model scale and prototype scale and compared their numerical results with existing model tests the simulation results revealed that the computed flow fields and vim amplitudes in model and full scales are quite similar and the predicted vim amplitudes are close to those obtained from the model tests the research verified the validity of scaling law and indicated that the reynolds number is not the factor leading to the vim response reduction in the field turing to the effects of external damping provided by mooring system and risers koop et al 2016 included the external damping in the cfd calculations and demonstrated that the damping effect of mooring system is an important factor for the observed difference between model tests and field measurements however mooring damping levels are dependent on the number of mooring lines water depth wd mooring configuration etc and how vim amplitude reduction responds to different damping levels is unknown in this study full scale mooring systems with different mooring line numbers and different wds are designed and simulated for the consideration of different damping levels the models obtained by the mooring3d code are then integrated with the fans code to achieve the coupled cfd mooring analysis of the semi submersible vim the vim amplitudes with different mooring system are compared to the simulated amplitudes of the damping free cases and the amplitudes obtained in model tests the correlation between the reduction ratio in the vim response and damping levels is also investigated in a recent study be huang and chen 2019 coupled cfd mooring analysis was performed for a deep draft semi submersible to examine the damping effect for 8 point and 16 point mooring systems at three different depths of 1000 m 1750 m and 2500 m respectively the simulation results clearly demonstrated that the mooring induced damping effect is probably the primary cause of the reduction of vim motion response in deep water conditions however the study of huang and chen 2019 was confined to one single reduced velocity vr of 8 77 which may not be representative of typical flow regimes encountered in the field in the present study more in depth studies are performed for a wider range of reduced velocities from 7 to 15 to cover the lock in and post lock in conditions in addition a sensitivity study of how drag coefficients of mooring lines affect the vim response are also performed 2 numerical method and set up 2 1 methodology the fans numerical method of chen et al 1990 and pontaza et al 2005 is employed to solve the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equation a multi block overset grid approach is utilized to accommodate the complex flow and relative motion between the semi submersible hull wake and background grid blocks in this study large eddy simulation les with smagorinsky model is used to model the sub grid scale turbulence the les turbulence model had been shown to provide accurate predictions of vortex induced vibrations viv of deep water risers in uniform and shear currents huang et al 2010 2012 as well as vortex and wake induced vibrations wiv of dual risers in tandem and side by side arrangements chen et al 2013 the in house mooring3d code is a cable dynamic analysis program based on a nonlinear fem theory the theory was originally established by garrett 1982 to solve inextensible line problems and the original version of cable3d code was developed cable3d was then further developed by ma and webster 1994 to analyze rods with small elongations and sea bottom effects chen 2002 modified the original cable3d code by introducing large elongation elements without bending stiffness and verified that the modified mooring model is more robust and reliable mooring3d is an in house mooring analysis code originally developed by gu 2017 basedon the same theory of improved cable3d chen 2002 the integration of mooring3d with fans for the coupled cfd mooring analysis of a calm buoy was achieved by gu et al 2019 yet this coupling code considers only horizontal motion in in line and transverse directions in this study the mooring3d was further modified and developed and integrated with a six dof motion solver program the mooring3d and the 6 dof motion solver were then coupled with fans for the simulation of the coupled cfd mooring analysis of a semi submersible platform with semi taut chain polyester rope chain mooring system the cfd simulation of semi submersible is performed in dimensionless form reynolds number in model scale is used for the semi submersible hull and the mooring system is modeled in prototype scale chen and chen 2016 verified that the vim dimensionless amplitudes of model scale and full scale simulation manifest only minor differences in scale effects so it is reasonable to use the same drag and lift coefficients for the model and prototype platforms the model scale motion can represent the full scale motion based on the validity of scaling law regardless of the difference in reynolds number fig 1 shows the interactive coupling procedures and data transfer between the cfd motion solver and mooring3d modules in each time step as illustrated in fig 1 the real time dimensionless translation and rotation displacement calculated by the motion solver is transferred to cfd module based on the updated real time floater position the fans code updates the flow field and calculates the dimensionless hydrodynamic forces on the model scale floater then the cfd module returns the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads to the motion solver the updated dimensionless floater position obtained by the motion solver is also converted to full scale displacements of the fairleads which are the input of the mooring3d module as indicated by the bottom blue arrow in fig 1 the mooring3d updates the mooring configuration and calculates the full scale dynamic tension and moment with respect to the center of gravity cog the updated overall mooring tension and moment are transferred back to dimensionless form and are returned to the motion solver by combining dimensionless mooring loads calculated by mooring3d and dimensionless hydrodynamic loads calculated by fans the acceleration velocity and displacement of the floater are calculated by the 6 deg motion solver the floater position is updated and the simulation proceeds to the next time step the calculated dimensionless translation and rotation displacement are again transferred to fans and mooring3d for hydrodynamic and mooring load estimation of the next time step respectively 2 2 semi submersible model and grid system the deep draft semi submersible of four square columns and four pontoons used by waals et al 2007 is selected major dimensions are given by waals et al 2007 fig 2 a shows the 3d model of the semi submersible since the free surface effect is negligible in the vim study of in line direction and transverse direction only the submerged part of the floater is modeled fig 2 b illustrates the dimensions of the submerged semi submersible in a side view sketch where height of the submerged column h is 24 5 m and column width l is 14 m the column aspect ratio h l is therefore 1 75 and is a major factor in vim response the semi submersible length and width are not provided and are estimated to be 70 m by chen and chen 2015 the mass of the prototype semi submersible is 44 000 tons the model tests were conducted in 1 70 scale therefore simulations are performed for the 1 70 model fig 3 a demonstrates the grid structure around the semi submersible structured multi block overset grids are used the characteristic length of the full scale model is set as the column width l 14 m and the characteristic length of the model scale model is set as l 0 2 m the four pontoons are covered by one block with 258 31 52 boundary fitted grid each of the four columns is surrounded by one block which has the dimensions of 162 50 31 to allow for data communication eight small blocks are used for connection between the major blocks around columns and pontoons in total 1 57 million grid points in thirteen blocks are used for the platform the characteristic velocity v is set as 1 m s in full scale and 0 119523 1 70 m s in model scale the characteristic time is acquired by dividing l with v and is 14 s and 1 6733 s for prototype and model scale respectively table 1 summarizes the characteristic parameters for both prototype scale and model scale in accordance with simulations performed by chen and chen 2016 the corner rounding effects of columns play a significant role in vim sway amplitudes the columns were sharp cornered in waals et al 2007 however the geometry details of how sharp the corners are in the model test are not available the sharp corners are also considered for the columns in the studies by chen and chen 2016 and this study and the associated diagonal column width is approximated to be d 1 385 l 19 385 m fig 3 b demonstrates the simulation domain with the range of 10 x l 28 16 y l 16 and 11 z l 0 to resolve the near field flows a fine grid basin is designed with the range of 10 x l 28 6 32 y l 6 32 and 3 1 z l 0 the coordinate system origin is at the center of the cut plane of the semi submersible at water surface grid spacing in the x and y directions increases considerably in the far field ocean far away from the basin these stationary background grids are divided into four blocks and add another 0 62 million grid points overall the simulation system has 2 19 million grid points in 17 blocks the sensitivity studies on time step and mesh density were performed by chen and chen 2016 the mesh density adopted in this study is proved to be suitable the time step size is selected as 0 05 dimensionless time which is the same as time step used by chen and chen 2016 the 0 05 dimensionless time is equivalent to 0 7 s for the prototype mooring line simulation and 0 0837 s for the model scale hull simulation which are obtained by multiplying 0 05 with the corresponding characteristic time specified in table 1 the initial position of the floater motion center is at x 0 and y 0 coincident with the coordinate system origin the current speed is determined based on the target reduced velocities the reduced velocity is defined by v r ut y d where u is the current speed t y is the natural period of the transverse sway motion and d is the projected width of the columns normal to the inflow which is the diagonal column width according to simulations achieved by chen and chen 2016 the sway natural period is 203 s when d is 19 385 m therefore the input current velocities can be determined by the known reduced velocities and the reynolds numbers are determined based on the current velocities and the characteristics length in this study reduced velocities of 7 8 9 10 and 15 are selected for the vim simulation to facilitate the comparison of the present simulation results with those obtained by chen and chen 2016 and model tests covering both the lock in and post lock in situations in accordance with koop and wilde 2016 the highest sway response is typically found for the current heading from 30 to 45 with respect to the column face thus 45 is selected to be the current heading which is shown in fig 3 b symmetry condition is imposed for the free surface z 0 plane on the free surface neumann boundary condition is set for velocity in x and y directions pressure and turbulence as free surface s vertical motion is not considered the velocity in z direction is given by the dirichlet boundary condition the same situation works for the bottom surface of the entire fluid domain on which the vertical velocity is zero inlet boundary condition with prescribed current speed is applied to the x l 10 leftmost plane for the rightmost outlet boundary plane of x l 28 neumann conditions for velocity components and linear extrapolation for pressure are used as the current moves continuously across the downstream boundary for the boundaries at y l 16 and 16 the velocity in y direction is set to have dirichlet boundary condition while other parameters are defined with neumann boundary condition the wall clock time for each time step of computation is about 12 14 s 2 3 mooring systems with different damping detailed mooring information is not available in the experiments performed by waals et al 2007 however both surge and sway natural periods were provided in the experiments chen and chen 2015 estimated the associated mooring stiffness by adjusting the mooring stiffness to match the natural periods of the semi submersible model in waal s experiments the stiffness in surge direction k x is approximately 236 000 n m and the stiffness in sway direction k y is approximately 92 600 n m the identical surge and sway mooring stiffness is used in this study at first springs with the target stiffness k x and k y but without any damping effects are modeled to simulate the scenario of model tests in which soft springs are used to provide horizontal restoring force the simulated vim sway amplitudes with damping free springs are to be compared to the model tests by waals et al 2007 model tests by xu et al 2012 and the cfd simulation by chen and chen 2016 prototype mooring systems at different wds are then designed and established in the mooring3d version decoupled from fans after validation by comparing to orcaflex models the mooring3d models are integrated with fans code to achieve the coupled cfd fem analysis semi submersible platforms are mostly deployed in deep water or ultra deep water fields semi taut chain polyester rope chain mooing system is commonly used for the station keeping of the semi submersible platform three wds are selected for all of the cases with different reduced velocities including 2500 m 1750 m and 1000 m additionally for the wd of 2500 m besides the conventional configuration of 16 mooring lines another mooring system with 8 mooring lines is designed for comparison for each mooring configuration mooring lengths are adjusted in the decoupled mooring3d version to match the surge and sway mooring stiffness adopted by waals et al 2007 regarding the 16 point chain polyester rope chain system the system has sixteen mooring lines the fairlead angle is about 45 for each mooring line each mooring line has three sections including studless grade r4s platform chain polyester rope studless grade r4s anchor chain and mooring connectors between them the 16 point system is composed of four bundles with each bundle located at each corner with the azimuth of 0 90 180 and 270 each bundle comprises of four mooring lines with 4 separation between adjacent lines within the same bundle group the static configurations of all mooring systems are established by both orcaflex and mooring3d fig 4 a displays the static configuration of the 16 point mooring system when the wd is 2500 m turning to the 8 point mooring system the system is also composed of four bundles with the angular spacing of 90 yet each bundle includes only two mooring lines the configuration of the 8 point mooring system under the wd of 2500 m is specified in fig 4 b it can be seen that the mooring lines are almost taut for both 16 point and 8 point system the touch down sections lying on the seabed are relatively short and the seabed induced friction is negligible line composition and properties of the 2500 m wd 16 point mooring system are presented in table 2 as an example to design 16 point mooring systems of 1000 m wd and 1750 m wd only lengths of chain and rope section are adjusted to make the mooring stiffness equal to target surge and sway stiffness of 236 000 n m and 92 600 n m all other line properties as listed in table 2 remain identical the drag coefficients are determined based on the reynolds number around the mooring lines and the sensitivity study of the drag coefficients will be discussed in section 3 2 2 in terms of the 8 point mooring system at 2500 m wd an equivalent mooring line is formed by combining two adjacent mooring lines within each bundle of the 16 point system to obtain an equivalent 8 point system the young s modulus remains the same but the unit weight is doubled the corresponding cross sectional area increases by 2 and the outer diameter increases by 2 the current not only exerts drag loads on the semi submersible hull but also exerts drag loading on the mooring system for simplicity a shear current profile extending from sea surface to the depth of 750 m is assumed in mooring3d to model current applied on the mooring system the surface current magnitude is determined based on the target reduced velocities the current velocity decreases linearly from surface current velocity to zero at the 750 m wd as wd increases in the field current velocity normally decreases as depth increases therefore linear shear current is assumed for simplification mooring system stiffness is one of the crucial parameters that determine the in line surge offset and the cross flow vim transverse response the mooring system stiffness curves in both in line and cross flow directions are generated in orcaflex and mooring3d the resultant stiffness curves are compared to the target stiffness of k x and k y 236 000 n m and 92 600 n m respectively fig 5 and fig 6 display the comparison between simulated mooring stiffness and target stiffness in 2500 m wd and 1750 m wd respectively three stiffness curves almost overlap with each other in case of 1000 m wd fig 7 shows the comparison of the mooring stiffness in surge and sway both orcaflex and mooring3d models show that the surge stiffness increases by about 5 10 compared to the target stiffness 236 000 n m when offset exceeds 6 m the nonlinearity of the surge stiffness will affect the surge natural periods at large offsets but exerts little impact on the transverse motion in terms of the transverse direction the sway mooring stiffness curves obtained by both mooring3d and orcaflex still overlap with the target stiffness of 92 600 n m fig 8 shows the mooring stiffness comparison in terms of the 8 point mooring system at 2500 m wd the stiffness curve comparison validates the mooring3d models by comparison to orcaflex models 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated results with ideal damping free mooring system dimensionless quantities are used in the fans code fig 9 displays the simulated normalized surge and sway motion histories with ideal damping free mooring system modeled as single springs when the reduced velocity vr is 7 8 9 10 and 15 for all of the five reduced velocities the left plots show the surge motion time histories and the right plots show the sway motion time histories the dimensionless x and y time histories in these figures are additionally normalized by dividing diagonal column width d as vr increases the normalized surge offset increases from approximately 0 2 vr 7 to approximately 0 68 vr 15 the sway amplitudes are to be compared with model test results obtained by waals et al 2007 and by xu et al 2012 and are to be discussed in this section the average sway periods under each reduced velocity are extracted and are summarized in table 3 below it is observed that as vr increases the average period decreases the average period when vr is 7 is very close to the sway natural period of 203 s as provided by chen and chen 2016 this indicates the phenomenon of lock in the sway natural period of the semi submersible is dominated by the vortex shedding frequency when frequency of vortex shedding matches the resonance frequency of the floating system the floater can begin to resonate vibrating with harmonic oscillations driven by the energy of the flow the vortex shedding period and the associated sway period is locked in to the sway natural period of the system therefore the sway period 202 s when vr is 7 is very close to the sway natural period 203s in terms of other reduced velocities the period result matches well with the general trend as indicated by the equation of strouhal number st f l u where f is the vortex shedding frequency u is the current velocity and l is the characteristic length which can be relating to body dimension or motion amplitude the vortex shedding period decreases with increasing current velocity to compare with model test results obtained by waals et al 2007 and by xu et al 2012 y in fig 9 should be normalized by dividing d to represent the average motion responses the nominal amplitude is used and defined as 2 σ y where σ y is the standard deviation of y t to minimize errors caused by somewhat shorter numerical simulations the statistical analysis includes data only after the response motions are stabilized table 3 shows that the average sway periods decrease as reduced velocity increases hence longer duration of 4200s is considered for vr of 7 8 and 9 and shorter duration of 2800s is used for vr of 10 and 15 the stabilized transverse motion time histories of all reduced velocities include sufficient cycles to extract the nominal amplitudes fig 10 shows the comparison of the experimental nominal sway amplitudes by waals et al 2007 and by xu et al 2012 simulated sway amplitudes by chen and chen 2016 with d 1 385 l and sway amplitudes of the simulation in this study at vr 7 8 9 10 and 15 the comparison in fig 10 shows that the simulated nominal transverse amplitudes by this coupled analysis generally agree well with the cfd simulations by chen and chen 2016 reduced velocities of 7 and 8 represent lock in range and reduced velocity of 15 represents the post lock in range reduced velocities of 9 and 10 indicate the transitional range between lock in and post lock in and corresponding simulations are performed the results at reduced velocities of 7 8 and 15 are in close proximity with the previous cfd results simulations with vr of 9 and 10 were not performed by chen and chen 2016 however the results of this coupled analysis still generally agree well with the regression line since the dimensions of the semi submersible adopted in both studies are identical but mesh density is different the comparison also verifies that the results are not sensitive to the mesh density selected and that the mesh density adopted in this study is sufficient for vim modeling waals et al 2007 pointed out that small differences in the geometry might cause different motion responses on one hand the increased draft in semi submersible is responsible for the pronounced vim therefore the column aspect ratio h l is a major factor in motion responses on the other hand the roundness of the column corners can also affect the flow pattern and the associated motion responses the column aspect ratio h l 1 75 adopted in this study is identical to what is used by waals et al 2007 how the corner is rounded in the model test is unknown to us therefore the corner rounding is approximated as d 1 385 l the semi submersible in xu et al 2012 had a smaller aspect ratio of h l 1 45 but the corners were more rounded with d 1 2485 l corresponding model tests at vr 7 and vr 8 were also performed by waals et al 2007 and xu et al 2012 at vr 7 the simulated transverse motion response of the coupled analysis for the sharp cornered geometry d 1 385 l is about 15 smaller than the waals et al 2007 measurement at vr 8 the result by coupled analysis lies in between the results of two model tests while a narrow lock in range was revealed in waals et al 2007 the cfd simulation results of both this study and the study by chen and chen 2016 show broader lock in ranges more in accordance with those of xu et al 2012 chen and chen 2016 also performed cfd simulations with more rounded corners with d 1 283 l and with aspect ratio of 1 75 the simulations agree well with measurements by xu et al 2012 and manifest larger transverse amplitudes than simulations with d 1 385 l and tests by waals et al 2007 demonstrating that the rounding in the column corner is a substantial factor in semi submersible vim responses the difference in how column corners are rounded may cause discrepancies between cfd simulations and model tests more details in terms of validation of cfd simulation can be found in the study by chen and chen 2016 3 2 vim amplitude versus mooring systems at various wds 3 2 1 motion comparison details of simulation results for vim cases with 16 point mooring systems at different wds are investigated in this section the current loadings are identical to the simulation case with damping free springs and the corresponding reduced velocities are 7 8 9 10 and 15 fig 11 presents the comparison of transverse sway motion histories and motion trajectories of simulation cases with 16 point mooring systems of different wds at the selected reduced velocities for all of the five reduced velocities of 7 8 9 10 and 15 the left plots show the sway motion comparison and the right plots show the trajectory comparison generally for all reduced velocities the sway amplitudes at 2500 m wd are smaller than sway amplitudes at 1750 m wd and 1000 m wd the motion histories at three wds all have smaller sway amplitudes than those of simulation with damping free springs it is also evident that the surge offset of all three cases with mooring systems are higher than that of the damping free case and the increase in offset is due to the current drag load acting on mooring lines in addition to the hydrodynamic loads on the floater it is also observed that the horizontal in line offset increases as wd gets larger the same tendency is observed in a comparison model in orcaflex a constant horizontal current load in surge direction is applied on the semi submersible hull the same current profile extended to 750 m wd is applied on all three mooring systems the resultant offsets are summarized in table 4 the summary reflects that under the same horizontal load on the hull but without any currents acting on the mooring lines the in line offsets are all around 4 9 m and are almost identical after current load is applied to the mooring systems the horizontal offset increases as a result and the growth in offset increases as wd increases one possible reason is that the length of fairlead chain sections is longer for mooring lines placed in deeper areas and the drag coefficient of chain is higher than that of polyester rope the longer platform chain at large wd induces the rise in overall drag loads leading to the rise in in line offset as the water depth increases for most of reduced velocities the surge offsets with mooring systems are higher than that of the damping free case and the horizontal surge offset increases as wd increases however there is an exception to the surge offset at 1000 m wd when vr 15 the offset at 1000 m wd when vr 15 appears smaller than that of the damping free case this is due to the slight increase in surge stiffness of 1000 m wd mooring system when offset is larger than 5 m as indicated in the left plot of fig 7 the average horizontal offset when vr 15 is approximately 12 5 m far more than 5 m where the averaging surge mooring stiffness at 1000 m wd is larger than the target surge stiffness 236 000 n m as 236 000 n m is still adopted by the damping free case the resultant horizontal surge offset subjected to stiffer in line mooring stiffness at 1000 m wd when vr 15 appears smaller than that of the damping free case however though surge mooring stiffness deviates from the target stiffness at large offset the sway stiffness and the resultant transverse motion are not affected at 1000 m wd according to the discussion in section 2 3 the following discussion verifies that the nominal sway amplitudes with 1000 m wd mooring system is larger than that with mooring systems under greater water depths to achieve a clearer comparison of sway amplitudes between different wds nominal sway amplitudes are extracted from the motion histories through statistical analysis fig 12 illustrates a more straightforward comparison that how the nominal sway amplitudes vary with water depth generally the nominal sway amplitude manifests a decreasing tendency as water depth increases and as reduced velocity increases the reduction should be attributed to the damping effects induced by mooring system brown and mavrakos et al 1999 concluded that mooring system damping is caused by line hydrodynamic drag line internal forces and seabed interaction brown and mavrakos et al 1999 also indicated that the dominating mooring line damping component is caused by hydrodynamic drag and the contributions from the internal structural damping of the mooring line can be ignored in terms of seabed friction the touch down sections of taut chain polyester rope chain mooring lines are short thus friction effects from the seabed are negligible the drag forces on the mooring lines cause the main damping effects as water depth becomes larger the mooring line overall length increases as a result leading to the rise in the total drag area and the associated drag forces the increasing water depth contributes to the increasing mooring damping effects and consequently reduces the vim sway amplitudes at vr 7 the reduction of vim nominal sway amplitudes from damping free condition to 1000 m wd is about 40 and the reduction of vim nominal sway amplitudes from damping free condition to 2500 m wd is about 46 at vr 8 the reduction ratios for 1000 m wd and 2500 m wd are 35 and 44 respectively at vr 9 the reduction ratios for two wds are 39 and 50 respectively at vr 10 the reduction ratios for two wds are 40 and 51 respectively at vr 15 the reduction ratios for two wds are 35 and 46 respectively the observed amplitude reduction demonstrates that mooring damping effects are the major cause of the phenomenon that vim amplitudes obtained in field measurements are much smaller than what are measured from model tests the reduction ratio of as high as 50 demonstrated by ma et al 2013 agrees well with the reduction range obtained in this study how much the vim response is reduced strongly depends on the magnitude of damping effects that can be provided by the mooring system in summary although the mooring system could increase the overall damping effects resulting in the reduction of the transverse motion by around 40 50 the in line offset increases as wd and current drag load increase though the reduction in transverse motion amplitudes can diminish the vim fatigue damage for mooring lines and risers and increase their design lives the increase in in line offset gives rise to higher tension in the upstream mooring lines and risers a comprehensive study is necessary while evaluating the impact of mooring damping on the vim fatigue of associated mooring lines and risers 3 2 2 sensitivity study of drag coefficient the drag coefficient of 2 2 for chain sections and 1 0 for polyester rope which are adopted in this study are less conservative approaches in contrast to industry standard per industry standards more conservative factors are employed for instance in abs guide for position mooring systems or the dnv offshore standard dnv os e301 the drag coefficients of chain and polyester rope are taken as 2 4 and 1 6 respectively in the examples in api rp 2sk the drag coefficients of chain and rope is recommended to be 2 2 and 1 2 the marine growth or corroded surfaces of mooring chains may additionally lead to increasing chain surface roughness and consequently the rise in drag loading the estimated chain drag coefficient 2 2 in this study is a little smaller than 2 4 however the chain length is much shorter than rope therefore its impact is less significant the estimated rope drag coefficient 1 0 is determined based on the flow regime around the mooring lines and the approximation of initial surface roughness and is smaller than 1 6 it is expected that the vim nominal sway amplitude reduction is sensitive to the mooring drag coefficients to perform the sensitivity study on drag coefficients the coefficients of 2 4 and 1 6 of chains and ropes recommended by abs and dnv are applied to the 16 point mooring system at 2500 m wd the simulation is replicated at vr 9 and the results of the sensitivity study are displayed in fig 13 with the compliance of industry standards the vim reduction appears more considerable the reduction of nominal sway amplitudes at vr 9 from damping free case reaches as high as 62 more than 50 demonstrated by ma et al 2013 however the conservative estimation of mooring line drag coefficients by industry aims at conservative analysis of mooring line tension and maximum offset the over estimation is too conservative in terms of coupled vim analysis and drag coefficients of 2 2 and 1 0 are sufficient for the investigation of mooring damping effects on vim it is also noted that the varying drag loading can exert impact on the average sway periods the sway period is dominated by the vortex shedding period the time history comparison in fig 13 indicates that the increasing mooring drag effects lead to a slight increase in vortex shedding period and the resultant transverse motion period the damping free case period is 182 3s the periods of 2500 m wd cases with smaller drag coefficients and with industry standard coefficients are 185 7s and 186 5s respectively the increase is around 2 as discussed in section 3 1 the vortex shedding period can be determined by strouhal number which is an empirical parameter based on oscillation amplitude current velocity floater geometry reynolds number etc the determination of strouhal number of deep draft semi submersible remains unresolved and how damping affects vortex shedding period by changing motion characteristics and vortex structure interaction requires further research efforts and investigation 3 2 3 vorticity contour analysis snapshots of the vorticity contours are captured on z l 0 5 and z l 2 which are at the middle of the column and at the pontoon respectively the snapshots are taken at selected simulation cases when the transverse motion is fully developed the vorticity is normalized by the characteristic length and velocity described earlier fig 14 shows the comparison of vorticity contour scenarios for the 2500 m wd between vr 7 and vr 15 fig 14 a shows the z vorticity on the two horizontal planes when vr 7 and fig 14 b shows the corresponding plots when vr 15 fig 15 a shows the z vorticity at two elevations of the damping free case when vr 9 in which the sway amplitudes are the largest at this reduced velocity and fig 15 b shows the z vorticity on the two planes for the moored case at 2500 m wd in which the sway amplitudes are the smallest when vr 9 vr of 7 represents the lock in condition vr of 15 represents the post lock in condition and vr of 9 represents the transitional range between the two all these vorticity contours show a lot of violent swirls an indication of large transverse motions fig 14 reveals that as current velocity increases the vorticity contours appear in longer and wider stretches and the case of vr 15 manifests the longest and widest vortex stretches fig 15 indicates that the difference between vorticity contours of the damping free case and the 2500 m wd case is not conspicuous in terms of flow pattern and vorticity strength figs 14 and 15 indicate that the general pattern of vorticity contours and vorticity strengths are more dominated by the current velocity than by the transverse amplitude in all simulation cases the vortices shed from the three upstream columns have little interaction with each other while the rear column is in the wake of the leading one and strongly affected by the vortices shed from it 3 3 vim amplitude versus mooring line number comparison is also performed between the sway motion histories of the semi submersible with 16 point mooring system and those with 8 point mooring system at wd of 2500 m to further prove that drag forces acting on the mooring lines are the main components of mooring damping effects though mooring lines of the 8 point system has the equivalent diameter 2 times that of the 16 point system the total drag area of the 8 point system is still reduced due to the reduction of mooring line numbers theoretically the vim sway responses of the 8 point mooring system should be larger than that of the 16 point mooring system fig 16 presents the comparison at 2500 m wd at vr 7 and demonstrates that sway amplitudes with 16 point mooring system tend to be smaller than those with 8 point mooring system for all reduced velocities considered the nominal sway amplitudes are extracted from motion histories and are presented in fig 17 the nominal sway amplitudes of simulation cases for vr 7 8 9 10 and 15 show amplitude reduction of 23 22 19 21 and 17 from 8 point mooring system to 16 point mooring system respectively 4 conclusions the 6 dof motion solver and the mooring3d in house program are integrated with the fans code for the time domain coupled cfd mooring simulation of vim of a deep draft semi submersible moored by a semi taut chain polyester rope chain mooring system at first the simulation cases with ideal damping free springs are conducted when the reduced velocity is 7 8 9 10 or 15 and the motion responses generally agree very well with previous cfd simulations and the selected model tests mooring systems which are stationed at wds of 2500 m 1750 m and 1000 m are then designed to represent various damping levels for the investigation of the mooring induced damping effects the simulation results demonstrate that the in line horizontal offset increases considering the drag loads applied on the mooring system the nominal transverse motion amplitudes show reduction which ranges from 40 to 50 with comparison to the damping free simulation cases since the mooring induced damping effects are attributed to the drag forces on the mooring lines the vim amplitude reduction is sensitive to the selection of mooring line drag coefficients also motion histories of simulation cases with 16 point mooring system and 8 point mooring system are compared indicating that the 8 point mooring system simulation cases manifest larger sway amplitudes the simulation results reveal that the mooring induced damping effects represent a dominant contribution to the reduction in vim transverse motion amplitudes in both lock in range and post lock in range the phenomenon that field measurements of vim response in the loop current events with operational sea states is found to be smaller than model tests is probably caused by the damping effects from mooring system further investigation is recommended to assess the effects of mooring induced damping on semi submersible vim for both model scale and prototype scale the coupled model of fans codes and the in house mooring3d program proves to be a powerful tool for

21736,the vortex induced motion vim of semi submersible is gaining increasing attention from both industry and academia with the recent development of deep draft semi submersible platforms field measurements of semi submersibles reveal that the vim responses are typically found to be smaller than those observed in model tests the possible factors causing the vim response reduction in the field measurements include reynolds number wave effects mass ratios and external damping from mooring lines the objective of this study is to investigate the mooring induced damping effects on vim the

large eddy simulation les deep draft semi submersible vortex induced motion vim mooring damping coupled cfd mooring analysis 1 introduction the vim of semi submersible offshore platforms becomes a crucial issue as the development of deep draft semi submersible is gaining increasing popularity for the offshore oil and gas production at present the model tests have been the industry recognized method for estimating the vim response of semi submersibles waals et al 2007 conducted experiments on vim of semi submersible floaters in this model test two soft springs were used to provide the horizontal restoring force to model the mooring system of the floater however recent studies performed by irani et al 2015 ma et al 2013 andrijken and leverette 2009 indicate that the vim response in the field is much less than as observed in the model tests for example ma et al 2013 pointed out that amplitudes of vim in the field appear much smaller than the observation in model tests with a reduction ratio of as much as 50 the approach of only using standard model test information leads to the overly conservative estimation of vim amplitudes consequently the strength check and vim fatigue life design of mooring lines and risers are affected with significant impact on costs the differences between field measurements and model test observations are likely due to different mass ratios wave effects in the field reynolds number appurtenance structures and external damping induced by mooring lines and risers koop and wilde 2016 demonstrated that changing the mass ratio of the floater has a small influence on the vim response also the effect of unsteady current on the vim response is minimal with regard to wave damping effects on vim the experiments revealed that vim response under inline or transverse waves is smaller than that without waves and depends on wave heading and wave height in accordance with hong et al 2008 and goncalves et al 2013 the vim response shows a significant reduction or even disappears in large waves 100 year or hurricane waves according to martin and rijken 2012 and koop and wilde 2016 the reduction in vim response is negligible in small waves as found in operational seas during loop current events the waves are small or absent therefore damping effects associated with waves in operational sea states are not the main reason for the considerable reduction of vim response as observed in the field regarding effects of appurtenance structures koop and wilde 2016 indicates that the small appurtenance structures are commonly omitted in vim model tests for multicolumn semi submersibles rijken et al 2011 proves that the effect of the appurtenance appears to have only minimal effects on the vim response the appurtenance includes riser porches riser guards fairleads anodes caissons etc an increased modeling detail of appurtenance does not significantly change the vim response hence the appurtenance structures are not the reason causing considerable reduction of vim response in the field in terms of the effects of reynolds number chen and chen 2016 used the finite analytic navier stokes fans cfd method for the simulation of semi submersible vim response in both model scale and prototype scale and compared their numerical results with existing model tests the simulation results revealed that the computed flow fields and vim amplitudes in model and full scales are quite similar and the predicted vim amplitudes are close to those obtained from the model tests the research verified the validity of scaling law and indicated that the reynolds number is not the factor leading to the vim response reduction in the field turing to the effects of external damping provided by mooring system and risers koop et al 2016 included the external damping in the cfd calculations and demonstrated that the damping effect of mooring system is an important factor for the observed difference between model tests and field measurements however mooring damping levels are dependent on the number of mooring lines water depth wd mooring configuration etc and how vim amplitude reduction responds to different damping levels is unknown in this study full scale mooring systems with different mooring line numbers and different wds are designed and simulated for the consideration of different damping levels the models obtained by the mooring3d code are then integrated with the fans code to achieve the coupled cfd mooring analysis of the semi submersible vim the vim amplitudes with different mooring system are compared to the simulated amplitudes of the damping free cases and the amplitudes obtained in model tests the correlation between the reduction ratio in the vim response and damping levels is also investigated in a recent study be huang and chen 2019 coupled cfd mooring analysis was performed for a deep draft semi submersible to examine the damping effect for 8 point and 16 point mooring systems at three different depths of 1000 m 1750 m and 2500 m respectively the simulation results clearly demonstrated that the mooring induced damping effect is probably the primary cause of the reduction of vim motion response in deep water conditions however the study of huang and chen 2019 was confined to one single reduced velocity vr of 8 77 which may not be representative of typical flow regimes encountered in the field in the present study more in depth studies are performed for a wider range of reduced velocities from 7 to 15 to cover the lock in and post lock in conditions in addition a sensitivity study of how drag coefficients of mooring lines affect the vim response are also performed 2 numerical method and set up 2 1 methodology the fans numerical method of chen et al 1990 and pontaza et al 2005 is employed to solve the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equation a multi block overset grid approach is utilized to accommodate the complex flow and relative motion between the semi submersible hull wake and background grid blocks in this study large eddy simulation les with smagorinsky model is used to model the sub grid scale turbulence the les turbulence model had been shown to provide accurate predictions of vortex induced vibrations viv of deep water risers in uniform and shear currents huang et al 2010 2012 as well as vortex and wake induced vibrations wiv of dual risers in tandem and side by side arrangements chen et al 2013 the in house mooring3d code is a cable dynamic analysis program based on a nonlinear fem theory the theory was originally established by garrett 1982 to solve inextensible line problems and the original version of cable3d code was developed cable3d was then further developed by ma and webster 1994 to analyze rods with small elongations and sea bottom effects chen 2002 modified the original cable3d code by introducing large elongation elements without bending stiffness and verified that the modified mooring model is more robust and reliable mooring3d is an in house mooring analysis code originally developed by gu 2017 basedon the same theory of improved cable3d chen 2002 the integration of mooring3d with fans for the coupled cfd mooring analysis of a calm buoy was achieved by gu et al 2019 yet this coupling code considers only horizontal motion in in line and transverse directions in this study the mooring3d was further modified and developed and integrated with a six dof motion solver program the mooring3d and the 6 dof motion solver were then coupled with fans for the simulation of the coupled cfd mooring analysis of a semi submersible platform with semi taut chain polyester rope chain mooring system the cfd simulation of semi submersible is performed in dimensionless form reynolds number in model scale is used for the semi submersible hull and the mooring system is modeled in prototype scale chen and chen 2016 verified that the vim dimensionless amplitudes of model scale and full scale simulation manifest only minor differences in scale effects so it is reasonable to use the same drag and lift coefficients for the model and prototype platforms the model scale motion can represent the full scale motion based on the validity of scaling law regardless of the difference in reynolds number fig 1 shows the interactive coupling procedures and data transfer between the cfd motion solver and mooring3d modules in each time step as illustrated in fig 1 the real time dimensionless translation and rotation displacement calculated by the motion solver is transferred to cfd module based on the updated real time floater position the fans code updates the flow field and calculates the dimensionless hydrodynamic forces on the model scale floater then the cfd module returns the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads to the motion solver the updated dimensionless floater position obtained by the motion solver is also converted to full scale displacements of the fairleads which are the input of the mooring3d module as indicated by the bottom blue arrow in fig 1 the mooring3d updates the mooring configuration and calculates the full scale dynamic tension and moment with respect to the center of gravity cog the updated overall mooring tension and moment are transferred back to dimensionless form and are returned to the motion solver by combining dimensionless mooring loads calculated by mooring3d and dimensionless hydrodynamic loads calculated by fans the acceleration velocity and displacement of the floater are calculated by the 6 deg motion solver the floater position is updated and the simulation proceeds to the next time step the calculated dimensionless translation and rotation displacement are again transferred to fans and mooring3d for hydrodynamic and mooring load estimation of the next time step respectively 2 2 semi submersible model and grid system the deep draft semi submersible of four square columns and four pontoons used by waals et al 2007 is selected major dimensions are given by waals et al 2007 fig 2 a shows the 3d model of the semi submersible since the free surface effect is negligible in the vim study of in line direction and transverse direction only the submerged part of the floater is modeled fig 2 b illustrates the dimensions of the submerged semi submersible in a side view sketch where height of the submerged column h is 24 5 m and column width l is 14 m the column aspect ratio h l is therefore 1 75 and is a major factor in vim response the semi submersible length and width are not provided and are estimated to be 70 m by chen and chen 2015 the mass of the prototype semi submersible is 44 000 tons the model tests were conducted in 1 70 scale therefore simulations are performed for the 1 70 model fig 3 a demonstrates the grid structure around the semi submersible structured multi block overset grids are used the characteristic length of the full scale model is set as the column width l 14 m and the characteristic length of the model scale model is set as l 0 2 m the four pontoons are covered by one block with 258 31 52 boundary fitted grid each of the four columns is surrounded by one block which has the dimensions of 162 50 31 to allow for data communication eight small blocks are used for connection between the major blocks around columns and pontoons in total 1 57 million grid points in thirteen blocks are used for the platform the characteristic velocity v is set as 1 m s in full scale and 0 119523 1 70 m s in model scale the characteristic time is acquired by dividing l with v and is 14 s and 1 6733 s for prototype and model scale respectively table 1 summarizes the characteristic parameters for both prototype scale and model scale in accordance with simulations performed by chen and chen 2016 the corner rounding effects of columns play a significant role in vim sway amplitudes the columns were sharp cornered in waals et al 2007 however the geometry details of how sharp the corners are in the model test are not available the sharp corners are also considered for the columns in the studies by chen and chen 2016 and this study and the associated diagonal column width is approximated to be d 1 385 l 19 385 m fig 3 b demonstrates the simulation domain with the range of 10 x l 28 16 y l 16 and 11 z l 0 to resolve the near field flows a fine grid basin is designed with the range of 10 x l 28 6 32 y l 6 32 and 3 1 z l 0 the coordinate system origin is at the center of the cut plane of the semi submersible at water surface grid spacing in the x and y directions increases considerably in the far field ocean far away from the basin these stationary background grids are divided into four blocks and add another 0 62 million grid points overall the simulation system has 2 19 million grid points in 17 blocks the sensitivity studies on time step and mesh density were performed by chen and chen 2016 the mesh density adopted in this study is proved to be suitable the time step size is selected as 0 05 dimensionless time which is the same as time step used by chen and chen 2016 the 0 05 dimensionless time is equivalent to 0 7 s for the prototype mooring line simulation and 0 0837 s for the model scale hull simulation which are obtained by multiplying 0 05 with the corresponding characteristic time specified in table 1 the initial position of the floater motion center is at x 0 and y 0 coincident with the coordinate system origin the current speed is determined based on the target reduced velocities the reduced velocity is defined by v r ut y d where u is the current speed t y is the natural period of the transverse sway motion and d is the projected width of the columns normal to the inflow which is the diagonal column width according to simulations achieved by chen and chen 2016 the sway natural period is 203 s when d is 19 385 m therefore the input current velocities can be determined by the known reduced velocities and the reynolds numbers are determined based on the current velocities and the characteristics length in this study reduced velocities of 7 8 9 10 and 15 are selected for the vim simulation to facilitate the comparison of the present simulation results with those obtained by chen and chen 2016 and model tests covering both the lock in and post lock in situations in accordance with koop and wilde 2016 the highest sway response is typically found for the current heading from 30 to 45 with respect to the column face thus 45 is selected to be the current heading which is shown in fig 3 b symmetry condition is imposed for the free surface z 0 plane on the free surface neumann boundary condition is set for velocity in x and y directions pressure and turbulence as free surface s vertical motion is not considered the velocity in z direction is given by the dirichlet boundary condition the same situation works for the bottom surface of the entire fluid domain on which the vertical velocity is zero inlet boundary condition with prescribed current speed is applied to the x l 10 leftmost plane for the rightmost outlet boundary plane of x l 28 neumann conditions for velocity components and linear extrapolation for pressure are used as the current moves continuously across the downstream boundary for the boundaries at y l 16 and 16 the velocity in y direction is set to have dirichlet boundary condition while other parameters are defined with neumann boundary condition the wall clock time for each time step of computation is about 12 14 s 2 3 mooring systems with different damping detailed mooring information is not available in the experiments performed by waals et al 2007 however both surge and sway natural periods were provided in the experiments chen and chen 2015 estimated the associated mooring stiffness by adjusting the mooring stiffness to match the natural periods of the semi submersible model in waal s experiments the stiffness in surge direction k x is approximately 236 000 n m and the stiffness in sway direction k y is approximately 92 600 n m the identical surge and sway mooring stiffness is used in this study at first springs with the target stiffness k x and k y but without any damping effects are modeled to simulate the scenario of model tests in which soft springs are used to provide horizontal restoring force the simulated vim sway amplitudes with damping free springs are to be compared to the model tests by waals et al 2007 model tests by xu et al 2012 and the cfd simulation by chen and chen 2016 prototype mooring systems at different wds are then designed and established in the mooring3d version decoupled from fans after validation by comparing to orcaflex models the mooring3d models are integrated with fans code to achieve the coupled cfd fem analysis semi submersible platforms are mostly deployed in deep water or ultra deep water fields semi taut chain polyester rope chain mooing system is commonly used for the station keeping of the semi submersible platform three wds are selected for all of the cases with different reduced velocities including 2500 m 1750 m and 1000 m additionally for the wd of 2500 m besides the conventional configuration of 16 mooring lines another mooring system with 8 mooring lines is designed for comparison for each mooring configuration mooring lengths are adjusted in the decoupled mooring3d version to match the surge and sway mooring stiffness adopted by waals et al 2007 regarding the 16 point chain polyester rope chain system the system has sixteen mooring lines the fairlead angle is about 45 for each mooring line each mooring line has three sections including studless grade r4s platform chain polyester rope studless grade r4s anchor chain and mooring connectors between them the 16 point system is composed of four bundles with each bundle located at each corner with the azimuth of 0 90 180 and 270 each bundle comprises of four mooring lines with 4 separation between adjacent lines within the same bundle group the static configurations of all mooring systems are established by both orcaflex and mooring3d fig 4 a displays the static configuration of the 16 point mooring system when the wd is 2500 m turning to the 8 point mooring system the system is also composed of four bundles with the angular spacing of 90 yet each bundle includes only two mooring lines the configuration of the 8 point mooring system under the wd of 2500 m is specified in fig 4 b it can be seen that the mooring lines are almost taut for both 16 point and 8 point system the touch down sections lying on the seabed are relatively short and the seabed induced friction is negligible line composition and properties of the 2500 m wd 16 point mooring system are presented in table 2 as an example to design 16 point mooring systems of 1000 m wd and 1750 m wd only lengths of chain and rope section are adjusted to make the mooring stiffness equal to target surge and sway stiffness of 236 000 n m and 92 600 n m all other line properties as listed in table 2 remain identical the drag coefficients are determined based on the reynolds number around the mooring lines and the sensitivity study of the drag coefficients will be discussed in section 3 2 2 in terms of the 8 point mooring system at 2500 m wd an equivalent mooring line is formed by combining two adjacent mooring lines within each bundle of the 16 point system to obtain an equivalent 8 point system the young s modulus remains the same but the unit weight is doubled the corresponding cross sectional area increases by 2 and the outer diameter increases by 2 the current not only exerts drag loads on the semi submersible hull but also exerts drag loading on the mooring system for simplicity a shear current profile extending from sea surface to the depth of 750 m is assumed in mooring3d to model current applied on the mooring system the surface current magnitude is determined based on the target reduced velocities the current velocity decreases linearly from surface current velocity to zero at the 750 m wd as wd increases in the field current velocity normally decreases as depth increases therefore linear shear current is assumed for simplification mooring system stiffness is one of the crucial parameters that determine the in line surge offset and the cross flow vim transverse response the mooring system stiffness curves in both in line and cross flow directions are generated in orcaflex and mooring3d the resultant stiffness curves are compared to the target stiffness of k x and k y 236 000 n m and 92 600 n m respectively fig 5 and fig 6 display the comparison between simulated mooring stiffness and target stiffness in 2500 m wd and 1750 m wd respectively three stiffness curves almost overlap with each other in case of 1000 m wd fig 7 shows the comparison of the mooring stiffness in surge and sway both orcaflex and mooring3d models show that the surge stiffness increases by about 5 10 compared to the target stiffness 236 000 n m when offset exceeds 6 m the nonlinearity of the surge stiffness will affect the surge natural periods at large offsets but exerts little impact on the transverse motion in terms of the transverse direction the sway mooring stiffness curves obtained by both mooring3d and orcaflex still overlap with the target stiffness of 92 600 n m fig 8 shows the mooring stiffness comparison in terms of the 8 point mooring system at 2500 m wd the stiffness curve comparison validates the mooring3d models by comparison to orcaflex models 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated results with ideal damping free mooring system dimensionless quantities are used in the fans code fig 9 displays the simulated normalized surge and sway motion histories with ideal damping free mooring system modeled as single springs when the reduced velocity vr is 7 8 9 10 and 15 for all of the five reduced velocities the left plots show the surge motion time histories and the right plots show the sway motion time histories the dimensionless x and y time histories in these figures are additionally normalized by dividing diagonal column width d as vr increases the normalized surge offset increases from approximately 0 2 vr 7 to approximately 0 68 vr 15 the sway amplitudes are to be compared with model test results obtained by waals et al 2007 and by xu et al 2012 and are to be discussed in this section the average sway periods under each reduced velocity are extracted and are summarized in table 3 below it is observed that as vr increases the average period decreases the average period when vr is 7 is very close to the sway natural period of 203 s as provided by chen and chen 2016 this indicates the phenomenon of lock in the sway natural period of the semi submersible is dominated by the vortex shedding frequency when frequency of vortex shedding matches the resonance frequency of the floating system the floater can begin to resonate vibrating with harmonic oscillations driven by the energy of the flow the vortex shedding period and the associated sway period is locked in to the sway natural period of the system therefore the sway period 202 s when vr is 7 is very close to the sway natural period 203s in terms of other reduced velocities the period result matches well with the general trend as indicated by the equation of strouhal number st f l u where f is the vortex shedding frequency u is the current velocity and l is the characteristic length which can be relating to body dimension or motion amplitude the vortex shedding period decreases with increasing current velocity to compare with model test results obtained by waals et al 2007 and by xu et al 2012 y in fig 9 should be normalized by dividing d to represent the average motion responses the nominal amplitude is used and defined as 2 σ y where σ y is the standard deviation of y t to minimize errors caused by somewhat shorter numerical simulations the statistical analysis includes data only after the response motions are stabilized table 3 shows that the average sway periods decrease as reduced velocity increases hence longer duration of 4200s is considered for vr of 7 8 and 9 and shorter duration of 2800s is used for vr of 10 and 15 the stabilized transverse motion time histories of all reduced velocities include sufficient cycles to extract the nominal amplitudes fig 10 shows the comparison of the experimental nominal sway amplitudes by waals et al 2007 and by xu et al 2012 simulated sway amplitudes by chen and chen 2016 with d 1 385 l and sway amplitudes of the simulation in this study at vr 7 8 9 10 and 15 the comparison in fig 10 shows that the simulated nominal transverse amplitudes by this coupled analysis generally agree well with the cfd simulations by chen and chen 2016 reduced velocities of 7 and 8 represent lock in range and reduced velocity of 15 represents the post lock in range reduced velocities of 9 and 10 indicate the transitional range between lock in and post lock in and corresponding simulations are performed the results at reduced velocities of 7 8 and 15 are in close proximity with the previous cfd results simulations with vr of 9 and 10 were not performed by chen and chen 2016 however the results of this coupled analysis still generally agree well with the regression line since the dimensions of the semi submersible adopted in both studies are identical but mesh density is different the comparison also verifies that the results are not sensitive to the mesh density selected and that the mesh density adopted in this study is sufficient for vim modeling waals et al 2007 pointed out that small differences in the geometry might cause different motion responses on one hand the increased draft in semi submersible is responsible for the pronounced vim therefore the column aspect ratio h l is a major factor in motion responses on the other hand the roundness of the column corners can also affect the flow pattern and the associated motion responses the column aspect ratio h l 1 75 adopted in this study is identical to what is used by waals et al 2007 how the corner is rounded in the model test is unknown to us therefore the corner rounding is approximated as d 1 385 l the semi submersible in xu et al 2012 had a smaller aspect ratio of h l 1 45 but the corners were more rounded with d 1 2485 l corresponding model tests at vr 7 and vr 8 were also performed by waals et al 2007 and xu et al 2012 at vr 7 the simulated transverse motion response of the coupled analysis for the sharp cornered geometry d 1 385 l is about 15 smaller than the waals et al 2007 measurement at vr 8 the result by coupled analysis lies in between the results of two model tests while a narrow lock in range was revealed in waals et al 2007 the cfd simulation results of both this study and the study by chen and chen 2016 show broader lock in ranges more in accordance with those of xu et al 2012 chen and chen 2016 also performed cfd simulations with more rounded corners with d 1 283 l and with aspect ratio of 1 75 the simulations agree well with measurements by xu et al 2012 and manifest larger transverse amplitudes than simulations with d 1 385 l and tests by waals et al 2007 demonstrating that the rounding in the column corner is a substantial factor in semi submersible vim responses the difference in how column corners are rounded may cause discrepancies between cfd simulations and model tests more details in terms of validation of cfd simulation can be found in the study by chen and chen 2016 3 2 vim amplitude versus mooring systems at various wds 3 2 1 motion comparison details of simulation results for vim cases with 16 point mooring systems at different wds are investigated in this section the current loadings are identical to the simulation case with damping free springs and the corresponding reduced velocities are 7 8 9 10 and 15 fig 11 presents the comparison of transverse sway motion histories and motion trajectories of simulation cases with 16 point mooring systems of different wds at the selected reduced velocities for all of the five reduced velocities of 7 8 9 10 and 15 the left plots show the sway motion comparison and the right plots show the trajectory comparison generally for all reduced velocities the sway amplitudes at 2500 m wd are smaller than sway amplitudes at 1750 m wd and 1000 m wd the motion histories at three wds all have smaller sway amplitudes than those of simulation with damping free springs it is also evident that the surge offset of all three cases with mooring systems are higher than that of the damping free case and the increase in offset is due to the current drag load acting on mooring lines in addition to the hydrodynamic loads on the floater it is also observed that the horizontal in line offset increases as wd gets larger the same tendency is observed in a comparison model in orcaflex a constant horizontal current load in surge direction is applied on the semi submersible hull the same current profile extended to 750 m wd is applied on all three mooring systems the resultant offsets are summarized in table 4 the summary reflects that under the same horizontal load on the hull but without any currents acting on the mooring lines the in line offsets are all around 4 9 m and are almost identical after current load is applied to the mooring systems the horizontal offset increases as a result and the growth in offset increases as wd increases one possible reason is that the length of fairlead chain sections is longer for mooring lines placed in deeper areas and the drag coefficient of chain is higher than that of polyester rope the longer platform chain at large wd induces the rise in overall drag loads leading to the rise in in line offset as the water depth increases for most of reduced velocities the surge offsets with mooring systems are higher than that of the damping free case and the horizontal surge offset increases as wd increases however there is an exception to the surge offset at 1000 m wd when vr 15 the offset at 1000 m wd when vr 15 appears smaller than that of the damping free case this is due to the slight increase in surge stiffness of 1000 m wd mooring system when offset is larger than 5 m as indicated in the left plot of fig 7 the average horizontal offset when vr 15 is approximately 12 5 m far more than 5 m where the averaging surge mooring stiffness at 1000 m wd is larger than the target surge stiffness 236 000 n m as 236 000 n m is still adopted by the damping free case the resultant horizontal surge offset subjected to stiffer in line mooring stiffness at 1000 m wd when vr 15 appears smaller than that of the damping free case however though surge mooring stiffness deviates from the target stiffness at large offset the sway stiffness and the resultant transverse motion are not affected at 1000 m wd according to the discussion in section 2 3 the following discussion verifies that the nominal sway amplitudes with 1000 m wd mooring system is larger than that with mooring systems under greater water depths to achieve a clearer comparison of sway amplitudes between different wds nominal sway amplitudes are extracted from the motion histories through statistical analysis fig 12 illustrates a more straightforward comparison that how the nominal sway amplitudes vary with water depth generally the nominal sway amplitude manifests a decreasing tendency as water depth increases and as reduced velocity increases the reduction should be attributed to the damping effects induced by mooring system brown and mavrakos et al 1999 concluded that mooring system damping is caused by line hydrodynamic drag line internal forces and seabed interaction brown and mavrakos et al 1999 also indicated that the dominating mooring line damping component is caused by hydrodynamic drag and the contributions from the internal structural damping of the mooring line can be ignored in terms of seabed friction the touch down sections of taut chain polyester rope chain mooring lines are short thus friction effects from the seabed are negligible the drag forces on the mooring lines cause the main damping effects as water depth becomes larger the mooring line overall length increases as a result leading to the rise in the total drag area and the associated drag forces the increasing water depth contributes to the increasing mooring damping effects and consequently reduces the vim sway amplitudes at vr 7 the reduction of vim nominal sway amplitudes from damping free condition to 1000 m wd is about 40 and the reduction of vim nominal sway amplitudes from damping free condition to 2500 m wd is about 46 at vr 8 the reduction ratios for 1000 m wd and 2500 m wd are 35 and 44 respectively at vr 9 the reduction ratios for two wds are 39 and 50 respectively at vr 10 the reduction ratios for two wds are 40 and 51 respectively at vr 15 the reduction ratios for two wds are 35 and 46 respectively the observed amplitude reduction demonstrates that mooring damping effects are the major cause of the phenomenon that vim amplitudes obtained in field measurements are much smaller than what are measured from model tests the reduction ratio of as high as 50 demonstrated by ma et al 2013 agrees well with the reduction range obtained in this study how much the vim response is reduced strongly depends on the magnitude of damping effects that can be provided by the mooring system in summary although the mooring system could increase the overall damping effects resulting in the reduction of the transverse motion by around 40 50 the in line offset increases as wd and current drag load increase though the reduction in transverse motion amplitudes can diminish the vim fatigue damage for mooring lines and risers and increase their design lives the increase in in line offset gives rise to higher tension in the upstream mooring lines and risers a comprehensive study is necessary while evaluating the impact of mooring damping on the vim fatigue of associated mooring lines and risers 3 2 2 sensitivity study of drag coefficient the drag coefficient of 2 2 for chain sections and 1 0 for polyester rope which are adopted in this study are less conservative approaches in contrast to industry standard per industry standards more conservative factors are employed for instance in abs guide for position mooring systems or the dnv offshore standard dnv os e301 the drag coefficients of chain and polyester rope are taken as 2 4 and 1 6 respectively in the examples in api rp 2sk the drag coefficients of chain and rope is recommended to be 2 2 and 1 2 the marine growth or corroded surfaces of mooring chains may additionally lead to increasing chain surface roughness and consequently the rise in drag loading the estimated chain drag coefficient 2 2 in this study is a little smaller than 2 4 however the chain length is much shorter than rope therefore its impact is less significant the estimated rope drag coefficient 1 0 is determined based on the flow regime around the mooring lines and the approximation of initial surface roughness and is smaller than 1 6 it is expected that the vim nominal sway amplitude reduction is sensitive to the mooring drag coefficients to perform the sensitivity study on drag coefficients the coefficients of 2 4 and 1 6 of chains and ropes recommended by abs and dnv are applied to the 16 point mooring system at 2500 m wd the simulation is replicated at vr 9 and the results of the sensitivity study are displayed in fig 13 with the compliance of industry standards the vim reduction appears more considerable the reduction of nominal sway amplitudes at vr 9 from damping free case reaches as high as 62 more than 50 demonstrated by ma et al 2013 however the conservative estimation of mooring line drag coefficients by industry aims at conservative analysis of mooring line tension and maximum offset the over estimation is too conservative in terms of coupled vim analysis and drag coefficients of 2 2 and 1 0 are sufficient for the investigation of mooring damping effects on vim it is also noted that the varying drag loading can exert impact on the average sway periods the sway period is dominated by the vortex shedding period the time history comparison in fig 13 indicates that the increasing mooring drag effects lead to a slight increase in vortex shedding period and the resultant transverse motion period the damping free case period is 182 3s the periods of 2500 m wd cases with smaller drag coefficients and with industry standard coefficients are 185 7s and 186 5s respectively the increase is around 2 as discussed in section 3 1 the vortex shedding period can be determined by strouhal number which is an empirical parameter based on oscillation amplitude current velocity floater geometry reynolds number etc the determination of strouhal number of deep draft semi submersible remains unresolved and how damping affects vortex shedding period by changing motion characteristics and vortex structure interaction requires further research efforts and investigation 3 2 3 vorticity contour analysis snapshots of the vorticity contours are captured on z l 0 5 and z l 2 which are at the middle of the column and at the pontoon respectively the snapshots are taken at selected simulation cases when the transverse motion is fully developed the vorticity is normalized by the characteristic length and velocity described earlier fig 14 shows the comparison of vorticity contour scenarios for the 2500 m wd between vr 7 and vr 15 fig 14 a shows the z vorticity on the two horizontal planes when vr 7 and fig 14 b shows the corresponding plots when vr 15 fig 15 a shows the z vorticity at two elevations of the damping free case when vr 9 in which the sway amplitudes are the largest at this reduced velocity and fig 15 b shows the z vorticity on the two planes for the moored case at 2500 m wd in which the sway amplitudes are the smallest when vr 9 vr of 7 represents the lock in condition vr of 15 represents the post lock in condition and vr of 9 represents the transitional range between the two all these vorticity contours show a lot of violent swirls an indication of large transverse motions fig 14 reveals that as current velocity increases the vorticity contours appear in longer and wider stretches and the case of vr 15 manifests the longest and widest vortex stretches fig 15 indicates that the difference between vorticity contours of the damping free case and the 2500 m wd case is not conspicuous in terms of flow pattern and vorticity strength figs 14 and 15 indicate that the general pattern of vorticity contours and vorticity strengths are more dominated by the current velocity than by the transverse amplitude in all simulation cases the vortices shed from the three upstream columns have little interaction with each other while the rear column is in the wake of the leading one and strongly affected by the vortices shed from it 3 3 vim amplitude versus mooring line number comparison is also performed between the sway motion histories of the semi submersible with 16 point mooring system and those with 8 point mooring system at wd of 2500 m to further prove that drag forces acting on the mooring lines are the main components of mooring damping effects though mooring lines of the 8 point system has the equivalent diameter 2 times that of the 16 point system the total drag area of the 8 point system is still reduced due to the reduction of mooring line numbers theoretically the vim sway responses of the 8 point mooring system should be larger than that of the 16 point mooring system fig 16 presents the comparison at 2500 m wd at vr 7 and demonstrates that sway amplitudes with 16 point mooring system tend to be smaller than those with 8 point mooring system for all reduced velocities considered the nominal sway amplitudes are extracted from motion histories and are presented in fig 17 the nominal sway amplitudes of simulation cases for vr 7 8 9 10 and 15 show amplitude reduction of 23 22 19 21 and 17 from 8 point mooring system to 16 point mooring system respectively 4 conclusions the 6 dof motion solver and the mooring3d in house program are integrated with the fans code for the time domain coupled cfd mooring simulation of vim of a deep draft semi submersible moored by a semi taut chain polyester rope chain mooring system at first the simulation cases with ideal damping free springs are conducted when the reduced velocity is 7 8 9 10 or 15 and the motion responses generally agree very well with previous cfd simulations and the selected model tests mooring systems which are stationed at wds of 2500 m 1750 m and 1000 m are then designed to represent various damping levels for the investigation of the mooring induced damping effects the simulation results demonstrate that the in line horizontal offset increases considering the drag loads applied on the mooring system the nominal transverse motion amplitudes show reduction which ranges from 40 to 50 with comparison to the damping free simulation cases since the mooring induced damping effects are attributed to the drag forces on the mooring lines the vim amplitude reduction is sensitive to the selection of mooring line drag coefficients also motion histories of simulation cases with 16 point mooring system and 8 point mooring system are compared indicating that the 8 point mooring system simulation cases manifest larger sway amplitudes the simulation results reveal that the mooring induced damping effects represent a dominant contribution to the reduction in vim transverse motion amplitudes in both lock in range and post lock in range the phenomenon that field measurements of vim response in the loop current events with operational sea states is found to be smaller than model tests is probably caused by the damping effects from mooring system further investigation is recommended to assess the effects of mooring induced damping on semi submersible vim for both model scale and prototype scale the coupled model of fans codes and the in house mooring3d program proves to be a powerful tool for the study of complex fluid structure interaction coupled with mooring system credit authorship contribution statement han huang conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

21737,structural improvement can extend the lifespan and improve the safety of the structure in this study the pushover analysis was used to investigate the effects of changes in the legs slope of the fixed jacket platforms used in 12 19 20 and 21 phases of the south pars gas field these platforms have an asymmetrical geometry with two vertical legs and two 1 8 slope legs for improved configurations alternative geometries were modeled in which all legs had a slope of 1 5 1 8 or 1 20 gravity and environmental loads were defined in the form of 16 load combinations under operating and storm condition the results showed a general improvement in the safety factor and behavior of the platforms altering the 1 8 unsymmetrical geometry with 1 20 symmetrical geometry led to a 40 improvement in the safety factor of spd12 b platform where failure takes place in braces and a 30 increase in the safety factor of spd20 and spd21 where failure happens in both legs and braces while failure starts in the deck jacket connection section no significant changes were observed in the safety factor of spd19 a among the studied alternative geometries the one with a leg slope of 1 20 indicated the best improvement keywords fixed platform pushover analysis jacket configuration leg slope safety factor 1 introduction fixed offshore platforms are among the simplest and most practical marine structures these structures are used to accommodate the facilities and equipment needed for temporary or permanent operations in marine environments offshore platforms have to be carefully designed and deployed according to the intended applications and operating environments nowadays about 10 000 offshore platforms that are in operation across the world which about 90 of them are fixed jacket platforms these platforms are categorized according to the type of operation in groups such as wellhead platforms production platforms residential platforms and flare platforms etc any efforts made to identify and analyze the weaknesses in fixed offshore platforms and offer suggestions to improve their performances can contribute to the safety and cost effectiveness of these structures in a study by hartnett and mitchell 2000 the finite element method was used to analyze the effects of leg spacing on the response of offshore structures this study found that the analysis of the response of the real platform to wave loads gives much more accurate estimates than the spectral response of an equivalent truss system analyses show that it necessary to model the full three dimensional effects of wave forces on offshore jacket platforms to accurately calculate response characteristics by performing complete three dimensional analysis it is also possible to design platforms so that the leg spacing can be specified to reduce structural vibrations in a ph d thesis entitled assessment of existing offshore structures for life extension ersdal studied four marine structures in the north sea via probabilistic failure formulations he also considered the impact of inspections and maintenance conducted at different time intervals in four inspection scenarios defined for this purpose this research reported that with proper structural configuration and periodic inspections and maintenance it would be possible to use the platforms beyond their initial design life according to this research platforms exhibit an acceptable strength against failure for about 30 years after installation while they show a significantly increased risk of failure after this age ersdal 2005 a study by ronalds et al investigated the relationship between platform topology deck weight and structural reliability under the storm overload after analyzing the relationship between platform configuration and reliability through a comparison between the collapse behavior of the simple jacket jack up and monopod topologies under storm loading in moderately shallow waters it was proven that the reliability highly depends on structural configuration this study also reported that in some cases the allowable stress design approach provides better reliability evaluations than the load and resistance design factor approach ronalds et al 2007 in his master s thesis karimi studied the weaknesses of some offshore platforms in the south pars gas field this study was performed by utilizing in situ analysis and nonlinear static methods with the models developed in sacs software the results showed that the dominant patterns of failure for the studied platforms were topside toppling and large deformation the safety factors obtained for these platforms were in the range of 2 4 karimi et al 2016 in another study karimi et al also analyzed the weaknesses of a platform in the south pars gas field they defined multiple scenarios for damages inflicted on platform legs and braces and thus computed the safety factors of the damaged structure accordingly the results showed that the damages to the upper level members of the platform has the greatest impact on structural reliability as it can reduce the safety factor by three quarters relative to the undamaged state karimi et al 2017 sandal et al 2018 proposed a method for integrated design of jackets using numerical optimization they found leg distance have a significant influence on structural behavior of the offshore wind turbine structure their results show that an integrated design approach is valuable in the conceptual design phase jalbi and bhattacharya 2019 studied size and spacing of jacket which supports offshore wind turbines they develop formulations for obtaining foundation sizes and spacing for square base symmetrical equilateral triangle or asymmetrical isosceles triangle configurations to achieve this they used finite element analysis and to show the application of the formulation an example is solved they also conclude that asymmetrical arrangements require larger foundations than symmetrical arrangements tian et al 2019 used a topology optimization method to design an offshore platform jacket structure they assume the whole design space as design variable and their goal was to maximize the structural stiffness also they set constraints based on multi criteria design assessment according to standard requirements includes stress deformation and design variable constraints to assess the resulted configuration the results are compared with the original platform for static and dynamic performance and ultimate carrying capacity compares show that the global mass of optimized structure reduce as 13 7 and significant enhancement in ultimate carrying capacity under the same loads 2 nonlinear static analysis the quantity direction and the point of application of the loads applied to a structure could change over time under such dynamic conditions there will be no unique solution for the analysis as it is the case in the static condition and the behavior of the structure deformation internal forces and stress will also be time dependent the three most important environmental forces in design and analysis of marine structures are those produced by waves wind and sea current the basis of marine structures analytical modeling is the transformation of physical conditions governing the behavior of these structures under these forces into mathematical relationships one of the most important relationships is the force displacement equation as long as the relationship between stress and strain is linear the differential equation of motion can be expressed linearly and easily solved however there are certain states for which it would be a mistake to rely exclusively on linear models in general structures exhibit nonlinear behavior when the material does not conform to hooke s law and also after experiencing large deformations the core idea of the nonlinear failure analysis is to define a process whereby the behavior of structures in the failure phase can be accurately simulated nonlinear static analysis method known as the pushover can serve as a powerful tool for assessing structural vulnerabilities this method involves predicting the performance of a structure in multiple risk scenarios by applying the forces or the corresponding deformations to the structural model and checking the safety criteria in this method the load is increased constantly until observing yielding or failure in structural members in this regard it should be noted that the ductility and load redistribution properties of a structure may allow it to remain within safety limits despite failure in some of its components soreide 1985 the differential equation governing the response of a multiple degree of freedom system is 1 m u c u f m 1 u g where m is the mass matrix c is the damping matrix f is the force vector for the floors and u g is the gravitational acceleration assuming the vector ø as the time independent component of the displacement vector u ø ut where ut is the displacement of the highest floor eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 2 m ø u t c ø u t f m 1 u g with the following definition for the reference displacement u in a single degree of freedom system nonlinear static analysis of the multiple degree of freedom system can be obtained based on the properties of the single degree of freedom system 3 u t m t m 1 u t the results obtained from the analysis of multiple degree of freedom system include the base shear vb and the target displacement ut which can be used to obtain force displacement or structural capacity diagram this diagram illustrates the platform behavior after the elastic region thus providing valuable information about structural responses themelis 2008 3 modeling and pre analysis the fixed platforms in the south pars gas field have been designed with an asymmetrical geometry i e vertical legs on the side of the risers and inclined legs on the other side the platforms studied in this work are south pars dome s phase 12 beta platform spd12 b south pars dome s phase 19 alpha platform spd19 a south pars dome s phase 20 platform spd20 and south pars dome s phase 21 platform spd21 in the persian gulf the models of these platforms are displayed in fig 1 the jacket structure is modeled with all its primary members like legs horizontal framing and vertical bracings etc the leg cans are modeled for the leg joints at the framing levels the mudmat secondary members are also modeled as shown in fig 1 the modeled platforms are quadrilateral in plan with 60 inch diameter legs two of which are vertical row 2 with the other two row 1 inclined at a slope of 1 8 construction of offshore structures mainly is a complicated and time consuming procedure which requires skilled personnel and special equipment the vertical legs make the assembly faster and easier also in installation and drilling procedure operations such as pile driving or well drilling may be easier when legs have lower slopes in addition to the models of the existing structures three alternative models are also developed for the purpose of assessing the effects of geometric symmetry and leg slope on the safety factor of these structures in these three models vertical legs are replaced by inclined legs with a slope of 1 8 1 5 or 1 20 hence a total of four models are created for each platform the general characteristics of these platforms are provided in table 1 the load combinations applied to the platform models comprises structural loads live and dead and environmental loads which include wave loads wind load and current load the details of these loads are provided in tables 2 and 3 the load combinations constructed by the wave and current loads are defined at eight angles with 45 degree differences moreover each platform is subjected to load combinations in the operating and storm mode environmental forces respectively with a return period of 1 and 100 year ioce 2012 load of other equipment such as anodes marine grows boat landings fenders cranes and also considered in loading procedure load combinations applied in 0 1 increments until failure happens in every step displacements internal loads stresses base shear and overturning moment are calculated the safety factor is equal to ratio of design load to ultimate load which platform may carry in software analysis this factor is equal to the last load increment before failure is occurred horizontal displacement of each level is limited to 1 200 of its elevation above the seabed level ioce 2007 ioce 2011 ioce 2012 the analysis is performed according to api rp 2a wsd 2014 members and joints are checks based on unity check uc ratio between the actual stress and allowable stress of the member if the uc criterion exceeds 1 0 failure occurs in the member ioce 2012 also based of aisc 2017 the maximum horizontal drifts are should limited by h 200 ratio where h is the level height from the seabed given the possibility of large deformations the geometry and materials are considered to behave nonlinearly and the connections are also checked for failure the analyses are performed in the bentley sacs 5 6 software using the nonlinear static method pushover method the computer model geometry of platforms includes the member eccentricities and offsets and all thickened cans and subsections are modeled design parameters for checks have been incorporated in the model construction of offshore structures mainly is a complicated and time consuming procedure which requires skilled contractors and workers spatial equipment based on experienced methods a vertical row in all south pars platforms is seen the verticality of this row as the first row in assembly procedure makes the assembly much easier on another hand generally in fixed offshore platform risers are vertical therefore a vertical row of the jackets on the side of the risers makes the drilling easier also some operations such as boat landing and pile driving are easier while legs have smaller batters 3 1 pre analysis modal analysis and foundation analysis in a previous analysis performed by karimi et al 2016 on the failure behavior of the same platforms they found that the platforms behave differently during failure this difference can be classified into three categories total collapse topside toppling and large deformation the aforementioned analysis showed that spd12 b spd19 a and spd21 will fail as a result of respectively large deformation topside toppling and the failure of braces due to a combination of both conditions table 4 shows the results of modal and foundation analyses for the most critical storm mode load combination the foundation analysis proves that it is reasonable to ignore these displacements and define the jacket seabed boundary conditions as rigid connections also the modal analysis shows that the first period of the structure is less than 3 s so the dynamic resonance does not need to be considering karimi et al 2017 4 results and discussion as mentioned earlier the existing platforms have an asymmetrical geometry the alternative geometries considered in this work are all symmetrical with all four legs having a slope of 1 8 1 5 and 1 20 in the following the results obtained for the original and altered geometries are compared with each other overall there are 16 outputs for each model which pertain to the behavior of the platform under operational and storm loads from eight different directions 4 1 spd19 a the safety factor of spd19 a platform in its existing condition karimi et al 2016 and the defined alternative geometries are provided in table 5 these results indicate that the symmetrization of this platform has no significant effect on safety factor the investigations performed by karimi et al 2016 indicate that the failure in spd19 a starts with the failure in deck jacket connection above a1 and b1 legs fig 2 a the graphical results obtained for the symmetrized model with a leg slope of 1 20 show the same failure pattern in the symmetric structure fig 2 b figure 3 illustrates the internal forces of spd19 a platform in its existing form and after symmetrization with a leg slope of 1 20 this figure demonstrates no notable change in the internal forces of a1 b1 a2 and b2 connections after symmetrization which inturn explains the lack of change in the safety factor 4 2 spd12 b the safety factors of spd12 b platform in its existing configuration karimi et al 2016 and after symmetrization with leg slopes of 1 5 1 8 and 1 20 are presented in table 6 as indicated in the table there is no significant difference between the safety factors of the asymmetric model existing structure and the model symmetrized with a leg slope of 1 5 however the safety factors of the other two symmetrized models particularly the one with a leg slope of 1 20 has significantly increased thus it can be concluded that for spd12 b platform using a symmetric geometry with a leg slope of 1 20 instead of the existing geometry will result in higher safety factors according to karimi et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 a the existing spd12 b platform will fail due to the failure in its upper level braces buckling the graphical results illustrated in fig 4 b show that symmetrizing the geometry of this platform does not change its failure pattern failure still begins with the failure of braces in the upper level based on the definition for euler buckling the critical buckling load is inversely proportional to member length squared pcr 1 l2 so even small changes in member length have a significant influence on buckling load for example in the spd12 b platform the outer diameter and thickness of upper span braces of 15 25 m length are in the range 61 66 cm and 1 27 2 54 cm respectively which results in slendernesses of between 75 and 125 in this configuration when legs slope change to 1 20 the brace length reduces some 10 compared with the initial length which results in about 20 improvement in critical buckling load fig 5 displays the internal forces in the legs of spd12 b platform in its existing form and after summarization with a leg slope of 1 20 as this figure shows the internal forces of a2 and b2 vertical legs are greater than those of the inclined legs according to fig 5 summarization improves the distribution of loads over the four legs and reduces the internal load of a2 and b2 the increased lateral load bearing capacity of the platform after symmetrization with a leg slope of 1 20 has reduced the internal force of the braces thereby leading to an improved safety factor for example as shown in figs 6 and 7 replacing the vertical legs with inclined legs with a slope of 1 20 has reduced the axial force in the first failed brace compressive brace of row a at the upper level fig 8 shows lateral load deck lateral displacement curves of spd12 b for 0 90 180 and 270 operational loading directions as seen in these diagrams the horizontal drift of platform decreases due to summarization the slope of curves are decreased due to decrement of leg slope 4 3 spd20 and spd21 the safety factors of spd20 and spd21 platforms in their existing form karimi et al 2016 and after symmetrization are presented in tables 7 and 8 results show no significant increase in the safety factors of platforms with the leg slope of 1 5 or 1 8 among the symmetrized geometries the one with the leg slope of 1 20 shows the significant increase in the safety factor the study conducted by karimi et al 2016 showed that in both spd20 and spd21 platforms failure starts in b1 leg and its connected braces fig 9 a and fig 11 a the same pattern is also observed in spd20 and spd21 models that are symmetrized with a leg slope of 1 20 fig 9 b and fig 11 b fig 10 and fig 12 display the internal forces of the braces attached to the critical leg b1 in both spd20 and spd21 platforms these diagrams show that as in spd12 b the change in a2 and b2 legs from vertical to inclined has increased their lateral load bearing capacity thus reducing the portion of the lateral load that is transferred to braces comparing the internal forces in the braces attached to b1 leg in spd20 and spd21 platforms in their existing configuration and symmetrized model with a leg slope of 1 20 shows a significant decrease in the internal force of the row b braces which in turn has increased the load bearing capacity of the leg to which this brace is connected the internal force diagram of b1 leg is plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 these diagrams illustrate the importance of the failure in the braces attached to this leg such that when these two braces fail the leg immediately follows them and the platform collapses soon after as shown in the diagram the summarization has delayed the failure of the braces attached to the critical leg ultimately leading to increased load bearing capacity and improved platform s safety factor fig 15 shows the lateral load deck displacement curves of spd20 for 0 90 180 and 270 operational loading directions the horizontal drift of platform has smaller decreases due to summarization compare to spd12 b spd12 b platform has 80 cm but spd20 have 20 cm deck displacement in failure stage this condition also indicate that the failure of spd20 is occurs due to gravitational loads and not environmental load that generate large deformations which finally result in failure of legs 5 conclusion in this paper the safety factors of four offshore platforms in their existing asymmetrical form with two vertical legs and two inclined legs with a slope of 1 8 are compared with the safety factors of the same platforms if they were symmetrical with leg slopes of 1 5 1 8 or 1 20 from the investigation of safety factors and failure patterns in the models with original and altered geometries the following results are concluded in the platforms in which the failure is caused by the failure in deck jacket connection topside toppling due to deck overloading changing the slope of the legs do not change the loading pattern and thus bring about no significant effect on the safety factor in the platforms where the failure appears exclusively from braces failure large lateral deformation failure pattern changing the slope of the legs to 1 20 reduces the internal force of the braces results to significant increase in the safety factor in this condition due to loading direction increments up to 40 are seen in safety factor whereas in the platforms where the failure is caused by the failures in both leg and braces a combination of the above modes changing the slope of the legs to 1 20 reduces the internal force of the braces but not the internal force of the legs the combinations of these effects lead to almost 30 improvement in the safety factor among the symmetrization scenarios investigated in this study the one that involves changing the slope of all legs to 1 20 leads to the best

this factor is equal to the last load increment before failure is occurred horizontal displacement of each level is limited to 1 200 of its elevation above the seabed level ioce 2007 ioce 2011 ioce 2012 the analysis is performed according to api rp 2a wsd 2014 members and joints are checks based on unity check uc ratio between the actual stress and allowable stress of the member if the uc criterion exceeds 1 0 failure occurs in the member ioce 2012 also based of aisc 2017 the maximum horizontal drifts are should limited by h 200 ratio where h is the level height from the seabed given the possibility of large deformations the geometry and materials are considered to behave nonlinearly and the connections are also checked for failure the analyses are performed in the bentley sacs 5 6 software using the nonlinear static method pushover method the computer model geometry of platforms includes the member eccentricities and offsets and all thickened cans and subsections are modeled design parameters for checks have been incorporated in the model construction of offshore structures mainly is a complicated and time consuming procedure which requires skilled contractors and workers spatial equipment based on experienced methods a vertical row in all south pars platforms is seen the verticality of this row as the first row in assembly procedure makes the assembly much easier on another hand generally in fixed offshore platform risers are vertical therefore a vertical row of the jackets on the side of the risers makes the drilling easier also some operations such as boat landing and pile driving are easier while legs have smaller batters 3 1 pre analysis modal analysis and foundation analysis in a previous analysis performed by karimi et al 2016 on the failure behavior of the same platforms they found that the platforms behave differently during failure this difference can be classified into three categories total collapse topside toppling and large deformation the aforementioned analysis showed that spd12 b spd19 a and spd21 will fail as a result of respectively large deformation topside toppling and the failure of braces due to a combination of both conditions table 4 shows the results of modal and foundation analyses for the most critical storm mode load combination the foundation analysis proves that it is reasonable to ignore these displacements and define the jacket seabed boundary conditions as rigid connections also the modal analysis shows that the first period of the structure is less than 3 s so the dynamic resonance does not need to be considering karimi et al 2017 4 results and discussion as mentioned earlier the existing platforms have an asymmetrical geometry the alternative geometries considered in this work are all symmetrical with all four legs having a slope of 1 8 1 5 and 1 20 in the following the results obtained for the original and altered geometries are compared with each other overall there are 16 outputs for each model which pertain to the behavior of the platform under operational and storm loads from eight different directions 4 1 spd19 a the safety factor of spd19 a platform in its existing condition karimi et al 2016 and the defined alternative geometries are provided in table 5 these results indicate that the symmetrization of this platform has no significant effect on safety factor the investigations performed by karimi et al 2016 indicate that the failure in spd19 a starts with the failure in deck jacket connection above a1 and b1 legs fig 2 a the graphical results obtained for the symmetrized model with a leg slope of 1 20 show the same failure pattern in the symmetric structure fig 2 b figure 3 illustrates the internal forces of spd19 a platform in its existing form and after symmetrization with a leg slope of 1 20 this figure demonstrates no notable change in the internal forces of a1 b1 a2 and b2 connections after symmetrization which inturn explains the lack of change in the safety factor 4 2 spd12 b the safety factors of spd12 b platform in its existing configuration karimi et al 2016 and after symmetrization with leg slopes of 1 5 1 8 and 1 20 are presented in table 6 as indicated in the table there is no significant difference between the safety factors of the asymmetric model existing structure and the model symmetrized with a leg slope of 1 5 however the safety factors of the other two symmetrized models particularly the one with a leg slope of 1 20 has significantly increased thus it can be concluded that for spd12 b platform using a symmetric geometry with a leg slope of 1 20 instead of the existing geometry will result in higher safety factors according to karimi et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 a the existing spd12 b platform will fail due to the failure in its upper level braces buckling the graphical results illustrated in fig 4 b show that symmetrizing the geometry of this platform does not change its failure pattern failure still begins with the failure of braces in the upper level based on the definition for euler buckling the critical buckling load is inversely proportional to member length squared pcr 1 l2 so even small changes in member length have a significant influence on buckling load for example in the spd12 b platform the outer diameter and thickness of upper span braces of 15 25 m length are in the range 61 66 cm and 1 27 2 54 cm respectively which results in slendernesses of between 75 and 125 in this configuration when legs slope change to 1 20 the brace length reduces some 10 compared with the initial length which results in about 20 improvement in critical buckling load fig 5 displays the internal forces in the legs of spd12 b platform in its existing form and after summarization with a leg slope of 1 20 as this figure shows the internal forces of a2 and b2 vertical legs are greater than those of the inclined legs according to fig 5 summarization improves the distribution of loads over the four legs and reduces the internal load of a2 and b2 the increased lateral load bearing capacity of the platform after symmetrization with a leg slope of 1 20 has reduced the internal force of the braces thereby leading to an improved safety factor for example as shown in figs 6 and 7 replacing the vertical legs with inclined legs with a slope of 1 20 has reduced the axial force in the first failed brace compressive brace of row a at the upper level fig 8 shows lateral load deck lateral displacement curves of spd12 b for 0 90 180 and 270 operational loading directions as seen in these diagrams the horizontal drift of platform decreases due to summarization the slope of curves are decreased due to decrement of leg slope 4 3 spd20 and spd21 the safety factors of spd20 and spd21 platforms in their existing form karimi et al 2016 and after symmetrization are presented in tables 7 and 8 results show no significant increase in the safety factors of platforms with the leg slope of 1 5 or 1 8 among the symmetrized geometries the one with the leg slope of 1 20 shows the significant increase in the safety factor the study conducted by karimi et al 2016 showed that in both spd20 and spd21 platforms failure starts in b1 leg and its connected braces fig 9 a and fig 11 a the same pattern is also observed in spd20 and spd21 models that are symmetrized with a leg slope of 1 20 fig 9 b and fig 11 b fig 10 and fig 12 display the internal forces of the braces attached to the critical leg b1 in both spd20 and spd21 platforms these diagrams show that as in spd12 b the change in a2 and b2 legs from vertical to inclined has increased their lateral load bearing capacity thus reducing the portion of the lateral load that is transferred to braces comparing the internal forces in the braces attached to b1 leg in spd20 and spd21 platforms in their existing configuration and symmetrized model with a leg slope of 1 20 shows a significant decrease in the internal force of the row b braces which in turn has increased the load bearing capacity of the leg to which this brace is connected the internal force diagram of b1 leg is plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 these diagrams illustrate the importance of the failure in the braces attached to this leg such that when these two braces fail the leg immediately follows them and the platform collapses soon after as shown in the diagram the summarization has delayed the failure of the braces attached to the critical leg ultimately leading to increased load bearing capacity and improved platform s safety factor fig 15 shows the lateral load deck displacement curves of spd20 for 0 90 180 and 270 operational loading directions the horizontal drift of platform has smaller decreases due to summarization compare to spd12 b spd12 b platform has 80 cm but spd20 have 20 cm deck displacement in failure stage this condition also indicate that the failure of spd20 is occurs due to gravitational loads and not environmental load that generate large deformations which finally result in failure of legs 5 conclusion in this paper the safety factors of four offshore platforms in their existing asymmetrical form with two vertical legs and two inclined legs with a slope of 1 8 are compared with the safety factors of the same platforms if they were symmetrical with leg slopes of 1 5 1 8 or 1 20 from the investigation of safety factors and failure patterns in the models with original and altered geometries the following results are concluded in the platforms in which the failure is caused by the failure in deck jacket connection topside toppling due to deck overloading changing the slope of the legs do not change the loading pattern and thus bring about no significant effect on the safety factor in the platforms where the failure appears exclusively from braces failure large lateral deformation failure pattern changing the slope of the legs to 1 20 reduces the internal force of the braces results to significant increase in the safety factor in this condition due to loading direction increments up to 40 are seen in safety factor whereas in the platforms where the failure is caused by the failures in both leg and braces a combination of the above modes changing the slope of the legs to 1 20 reduces the internal force of the braces but not the internal force of the legs the combinations of these effects lead to almost 30 improvement in the safety factor among the symmetrization scenarios investigated in this study the one that involves changing the slope of all legs to 1 20 leads to the best improvement in the safety factor of the platforms authorship statement hamid moradi substantial contribution to conception and design substantial contribution to acquisition of data substantial

21738,a new methodology is proposed for generating multiple focused waves within a relatively short time this can improve the efficiency of the hydrodynamic testing of coastal and offshore structures under extreme wave conditions with strong nonlinearity and randomness such as in extreme wave impact testing of vessels and offshore platforms in this study two methods for generating periodic focused waves were proposed based on a first order wavemaker theory and schäffer s second order wavemaker theory periodic focused waves were generated in a wave flume with an intermediate water depth with different peak frequencies wave amplitudes frequency bands frequency resolutions and nominal periods using the first order and second order wavemaker theories the test results demonstrate that both first order and second order wavemaker methods can produce repetitive focused wave groups within a short time period however the second order wavemaker method can reduce the influence of second order free harmonics the frequency band and resolution only slightly influence the envelope of the focused wave group for the newwave type focused waves in the present study it is possible to generate periodic focused waves with any equivalent or different time intervals but the interactions between different focused wave groups should be examined to determine an optimal nominal period keywords extreme wave periodic focused wave first order wavemaker theory second order wavemaker theory higher order harmonics wave flume 1 introduction during the past several decades numerous extreme waves alternatively referred to as rogue waves or freak waves have been reported in the ocean nikolkina and didenkulova 2011 and coastal zones chien et al 2002 the unpredictable and sudden appearance of giant waves seriously threatens the safety of offshore and coastal structures to design reliable and economic coastal and offshore structures it is essential for scientists and engineers to consider the effects of extreme wave action on structures laboratory experiments are an important approach for investigating wave loading action on coastal or offshore structures in which the reproduction of the grouped waves is of fundamental interest although there are no robust theoretical models for extreme waves dysthe et al 2008 kharif and pelinovsky 2003 it is believed that dispersive focusing is one of the main causes of the rare occurrence of rogue waves in normal sea states christou and ewans 2014 in a laboratory setting several methods have been proposed for the generation of extreme waves chaplin 1996 the most frequently used approach is the focused wave approach in which the crest of a series of harmonics is gathered at a predefined location simultaneously by utilizing the dispersion characteristics of the water waves to date the dispersive focusing method has been successfully implemented in both physical experiments rapp and melville 1990 and numerical simulations ning et al 2009 linear wavemaker theory is a fundamental approach for the generation of focused waves in the laboratory the breaking of waves in deep water was investigated using focused waves in combination with this approach rapp and melville 1990 in that study the influence of the wave generation parameter on a wave packet with a constant wave amplitude spectrum was discussed the kinematics of the focused wave were another important issue regarding this type of extreme wave and they were experimentally investigated in a laboratory baldock et al 1996 borthwick et al 2006 and compared with theoretical solutions baldock and swan 1994 1996 based on a random wave spectrum a newwave model was proposed for reproducing extreme ocean waves tromans et al 1991 this model was widely used in the coastal and ocean engineering field to study extreme wave actions bai and taylor 2007 westphalen et al 2012 whittaker et al 2016 2017 2018 based on the first order wavemaker theory the mismatches between the water particle kinematics and wavemaker velocity could generate spurious free harmonics in a wave flume the spurious higher order waves could lead to downshifts of the spatial and temporal focus location baldock and swan 1996 ning et al 2008 and the redistribution of energy phillips 1960 especially for a narrow banded spectrum the nonlinearity of the focused wave group fwg increases with the increase of the wave amplitude and reduces with the increase of the bandwidth baldock et al 1996 to obtain better focused waves at a predefined location iteration should be utilized for example chaplin et al 1997 proposed an iteration method for generating focused waves by repeatedly adjusting the control signal of a wavemaker with a measured elevation similar attempts were also performed by do et al 2004 to generate precise gaussian type fwgs and by fernández et al 2013 to focus a series of linear wave components the free sub and super harmonics of natural waves and irregular waves generated in the laboratory have been previously addressed by researchers such as mansard et al 1988 and barthel et al 1983 based on analytical investigations of the sub and super harmonics the water waves generated based on the linear wave theory can be corrected to the second order arena 2005 barthel et al 1983 sand and mansard 1986 schäffer 1996 similarly a second order wavemaker theory has also been applied to generate focused waves in different test environments orszaghova et al 2014 sriram et al 2015 whittaker et al 2017 and numerical models higuera et al 2015 westphalen et al 2012 it was determined that the second order wavemaker theory could remove most of the contamination resulting from sub harmonics whittaker et al 2017 two types of higher order harmonics have been observed when first order wavemaker theory is used to generate focused waves in a laboratory setting one is a bound wave that is a phase locked harmonic to the wave group and does not satisfy the dispersion relation the other is a spurious higher order wave that propagates freely in the wave flume the higher order harmonics could influence the wave profile and increase the nonlinearity of the fwg to solve this problem the second order wave theory was introduced to obtain more precise wave profiles arena 2005 baldock and swan 1996 baldock et al 1996 using a phase decomposition methodology the linear part of the surface elevation of focused waves was separated from the measured elevations and used for the iteration process buldakov et al 2017 stagonas et al 2018 vyzikas et al 2018 discussed the evolution of free and bound waves during dispersive focusing and discovered that the influences of the third and fourth order harmonics were considerable for unidirectional steep focused waves in addition the groupiness of wave trains has been comprehensively studied medina and hudspeth 1990 group induced bounded long waves and spurious waves were investigated by barthel et al 1983 and zaman et al 2010 respectively based on the second order wave generation method the higher harmonics in the irregular waves were successfully generated and investigated in the wave flume sand and mansard 1986 following the successful generation of focused waves using a phase speed method numerous studies have been conducted to investigate extreme wave breaking rapp and melville 1990 propagation baldock and swan 1996 and the interaction of waves with structures such as horizontal gao et al 2016 or vertical cylinders li et al 2014 decks cheng et al 2017 floating boxes zhao and hu 2012 floating productions storage and offloading vessels fpso mai et al 2016 and semisubmersibles banks and abdussamie 2017 it has been demonstrated that focused waves are efficient incident waves for the study of extreme wave action on structures the wave structure interaction process exhibits strong nonlinearity and uncertainty and requires repetition to eliminate experimental random error for example li et al 2014 repeated experimental tests to reduce random errors and improve the experimental accuracy in the study of focused wave impact on a column a similar procedure was applied by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 to study the solitary wave action on bridge decks the shortcoming of this approach is that it takes a long time to wait for the water in the flume to calm down the alternative approach is to generate multiple focused waves in one single wave trial a focused wave is periodical if a constant frequency resolution is employed during wave generation thus one can obtain multiple focused waves with a proper frequency resolution high frequency resolution is suggested for generating waves to improve the representation of the waves ittc 2017 however this makes the time interval between two neighboring focused wave crests very long and inefficient for repeated laboratory testing inspired by the superposition model widely used to generate transient waves cassidy et al 2001 hu et al 2014 kriebel and alsina 2000 pei et al 2007 buldakov 2013 proposed a method to generate multiple tsunami like waves in a short time it was demonstrated that six tsunami like waves with durations of 128 s could be repetitively generated in a trial with this notable exception there have been limited studies on this issue reported in the published literature this paper presents a new methodology for the generation of multiple focused waves within a relatively short time in a wave flume in this study two methods for generating periodic focused waves pfws are presented based on first order and second order wavemaker theories this report is organized into six sections the methodology used to generate the pfws is presented in section 2 the experimental validation is discussed and presented in sections 3 and 4 based on the test results the influence of the wavemaker parameters on a wave profile is discussed in section 5 finally the main conclusions of this study are summarized 2 methodology 2 1 first order problem of the periodic focused wave pfw for the first order problem the wave elevation of a single focused wave sfw at a specified focusing location x b and time t b can be expressed in a complex form as a special case of an irregular wave dean and dalrymple 1991 1 η s f w 1 x t n 1 n η n 1 n 1 n 1 2 a n e i 2 π f n t k n x c c where i is the imaginary unit a n k n and f n are the complex amplitude wave number and wave frequency of the n th harmonic wave in the total n components respectively and c c denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding term the wavenumber k n is related to the wave frequency f n that satisfies the linear dispersion equation of 2 π f n 2 g k n tanh k n d the complex amplitude in eq 1 can be written as follows 2 a n a n e i φ n where a n is the wave amplitude and φ n is the initial phase related to the focusing location and focusing time with the superposition of the harmonic waves the crest focused wave cfw and trough focused wave tfw can be respectively obtained with the initial phase given as follows 3 φ n k n x b 2 π f n t b cfw k n x b 2 π f n t b π tfw according to the newwave type focused wave model tromans et al 1991 the wave amplitude can be expressed as follows 4 a n a max s f n δ f n n 1 n s f n δ f n where δ f n is the frequency step a max is the target amplitude of the focused crest at the focusing location and is theoretically equal to the sum of the amplitudes of all of the wave components and s f n is the target power spectrum in this study the modified joint north sea wave observation project spectrum goda 1999 is adopted for the following analysis once the input parameters are determined by setting the position of the wavemaker at x 0 the first order paddle position for the sfw which complies with the wave spectrum consisting of a total of n wave components can be expressed as follows 5 x s f w 1 1 2 n 1 n i a n c n e i ω n t c c where c n is the biésel transfer function between the paddle motion and the wave elevation with the frequency band f min f max the focused wave appears periodically with a period of t 1 δ f f max f min n for a constant δ f indicating that the same focused wave would be obtained in every period generally a small δf is preferred in a laboratory setting to generate a well controlled focused wave that effectively matches the wave spectrum however the returning period of a focused wave is very long for a focused wave with a small frequency step it can be observed from the sfw 1 in fig 1 that the wave motion between two neighboring focused crests is approximately zero over a long period of time it can be expected that more focused wave events can be generated during this time the schematic diagram for the assembly process of a pfw is shown in fig 1 by simultaneously generating several focused waves with different focusing times a pfw with a relatively small return period can be obtained as follows 6 η p f w 1 x t j 1 m f 1 2 n 1 n a n j e i 2 π f n t k n x c c the pfw can be further explained as the total of the m f single focused waves at different focus times t b j with initial phase φ n j and the amplitude a n j generated in the wave flume simultaneously in the process the nominal period t pf of the pfw can be set as any preferred value by adjusting t b j the wave paddle motion required to generate the pfw can also be obtained as follows 7 x p f w 1 j 1 m f 1 2 n 1 n i a n j c n e i 2 π f n t c c 2 2 second order problem of the pfw the first order wavemaker theory of common focused waves has been well developed and successfully applied to both wave flumes chaplin 1996 and wave basins rapp and melville 1990 nevertheless the importance of second order waves has also been reported in several recent works orszaghova et al 2014 sriram et al 2015 whittaker et al 2017 indicating that second order spurious free waves could affect the target wave profile s of focused waves as a result the second order wavemaker theory was also adopted in this study to generate the pfws following schäffer s second order wavemaker theory schäffer 1996 the wave elevation and paddle motion as corrected to the second order are given as follows 8 η ε η 1 ε 2 η 2 9 x 0 ε x 0 1 ε 2 x 0 2 where η 1 x 0 1 and η 2 x 0 2 are the first and second order wave elevation and paddle motion respectively and ε is a small parameter of the order of x 0 d d is the water depth the second order wave elevation shown in eq 8 can be separated into three contributions as follows barthel et al 1983 10 η 2 η 21 η 22 η 23 where η 21 denotes the bound waves that result from the interactions between linear wave components η 22 denotes the free waves generated from the mismatching of the wave paddle movement and the bound waves and η 23 denotes the wave motion generated by the second order wave paddle motion x 0 2 and is used to eliminate the spurious free waves η 22 the wave elevations η 21 and η 22 generated by the wave components with frequencies f n and f m can be calculated as follows 11 η n m 21 1 2 g n m a n a m e i ω n t k n x ω m t k m x c c 12 η n m 22 1 2 a n a m d c p 22 e i ω n ω m t k p x c c where g is the transfer function of the progressive part of the second order bound wave superscript denotes a complex operation defined as either the conjugation for sub harmonics or zero for super harmonics c p 22 is a coefficient related to the vertical eigenfunction and k p is the solution of the following dispersion equation 13 ω n ω m 2 g k p tanh k p d considering the influence of the second order harmonics the wave profile of the pfw generated using the linear wavemaker theory can be theoretically calculated as follows 14 η p f w 1 s t x t j 1 m f n 1 n η n 1 n 1 n m n n η n m 21 η n m 22 n 1 n m n 1 n η n m 21 η n m 22 to eliminate the spurious free waves η 22 a second order paddle motion x 2 is introduced as follows 15 x n m 2 1 2 i f a n a m d e i ω n ω m t c c where f is the second order transfer function related to the super and sub harmonic terms additional details regarding the second order wavemaker theory can be found in schäffer 1996 schäffer 1996 derived a second order wavemaker method for unidirectional irregular waves and subsequently extended the approach to the generation of directional irregular waves schäffer and steenberg 2003 this method can be adopted to generate focused waves by replacing the original random initial phase with the initial phase φ n of the focused waves as represented by eq 3 thus the paddle motion of a second order sfw can be expressed as follows 16 x s f w 2 n d n 1 n x 1 n 1 n m n n x n m 2 n 1 n m n 1 n x n m 2 the paddle motion of the second order pfw can also be calculated by summing the paddle motions of these sfws at different focusing times using this method the wave profile of the second order pfw is obtained as follows 17 η p f w 2 n d x t j 1 m f n 1 n η n 1 n 1 n m n n η n m 21 n 1 n m n 1 n η n m 21 2 3 iteration of the initial phase and amplitude from eq 16 it can also be determined that only the interactions of the wave components in the temporal domain are considered during the generation of the second order pfw using the proposed method a downshift of the focusing location relative to the target location could appear owing to the absence of the interactions of wave components in the spatial domain in the theoretical calculation to ensure that all wave components arrive in phase at the predefined location a self correcting method fernández et al 2014 alternatively referred to as the phase amplitude iteration method deng et al 2016 has been proposed for achieving a focused crest at a constant spatial location this iteration method consists of three steps 1 calculating the paddle motion of the wavemaker for the target wave profile using linear wavemaker theory 2 performing a trial with the theoretical paddle motion followed by correction of the input initial phase and wave amplitude with reference to the target and measured wave elevation and 3 repeating step 2 until the difference is acceptable in this study the same method is also used to eliminate the downshift of the focusing location of the pfw the phase angle and amplitude of the wave components are corrected as follows 18 φ n n e w φ n o l d φ n t a r g e t φ n m e a s u r e d 19 a n n e w a n o l d a n t a r g e t a n m e a s u e d the flowchart for the generation of the pfw is shown in fig 2 3 experimental setup to verify the proposed method an experiment was conducted at the laboratory of coastal engineering at harbin engineering university in china a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 3 the experiment was conducted in a wave flume that was 30 m long 0 8 m wide and 1 0 m deep a piston type wavemaker was used to generate water waves at the opposite side a sloping beach with multi layers of inclined perforated plates was employed to eliminate reflections of the waves during testing the control signal of the paddle motion was determined according to the proposed method the actual wave motion was measured using two potentiometric position transducers each with a resolution of 0 01 mm simultaneously a total of 13 wave gauges each with a resolution of 0 6 mm i e smaller than 0 5 of the maximum target wave amplitude were arranged along the wave flume to measure the evolution process of the wave furthermore a vectrino acoustic velocimeter with a submergence depth of 50 mm was also set to record the velocity at the focusing location of the focused wave the test plan contained four basic cases with two different peak frequencies of 0 6 hz and 0 8 hz and wave amplitudes of 60 0 mm and 110 0 mm respectively the frequency band frequency resolution and nominal period used in the test plan are listed in table 1 for each trial the first and second order waves were all tested for comparison 4 experiment results 4 1 iteration of the single focused wave based on the previous experiments of researchers sriram et al 2015 it has been widely observed that there is a deviation between the target and the actual focusing location irrespective of whether using a first or second order wavemaker method therefore iteration was implemented to obtain a focused wave at a fixed focusing location in this study the sfw was first tested to obtain the input parameters of the wave paddle motion which were also utilized for the generation of the pfws to compare the generated results for the sfw and pfws the linear elevation η t calculated using eq 1 with the target wave spectrum was used as the target wave profile for evaluating the elevations of the measured wave according to the flowchart shown in fig 2 the phase angle and amplitude can be either iterated in the same step or only one of them can be iterated in a single iteration step the authors determined that the application of phase and amplitude iteration together does not facilitate an easy convergence to the target a max owing to the oscillation between different iteration steps the reason for this phenomenon is that the small amplitude of some low or high frequency components leads to over corrections in the next step it is better to perform the phase and amplitude correction in different iteration steps as utilized by deng et al 2016 for deterministic freak wave generation in the present study only the phase correction was adopted to reproduce the pfws the amplitude correction could be easily performed after completion of the phase correction the effect of viscous damping on the spectral change can be estimated by the eddy viscosity parameter ν e as shown in table 1 the eddy viscosity parameter was calculated based on the local wave profile near the focusing location hasan et al 2019 which provided a quantitative reference for the amplitude correction by applying linear wavemaker theory the iterated cfw and tfw were sequentially generated in the wave flume as an example the iterated results for the case w06 110 with a frequency band of 0 5 f p 3 0 f p and δ f 0 01 hz for the first order wavemaker theory are shown in fig 4 it should be mentioned that the time series of the wave elevation in this figure is slightly shifted to make the main crest appear at t 30 s in fig 4 a the blue line represents the measured elevations whereas the grey line represents the calculated profile η 1 st which is equal to the summation of the linear elevation η 1 and the second order wave components η 21 and η 22 the value of η 1 st was calculated using a measured wave spectrum obtained via a fast fourier transform and was intended to show how well the measured elevation could be re calculated this is useful for future numerical simulations the correlation coefficient between the measured elevations and the target linear profile η t at the focused location were used to quantify the wave elevation during iteration as follows 20 r η a η b cov η a η b cov η a η a cov η b η b where η a and η b represent the two wave elevation series at issue and cov is the covariance from fig 4 a it can be seen that the measured wave elevation at the focused location is in good agreement with η t with r 0 9530 however a slightly asymmetric phenomenon is observed when the leading crest ahead of the main crest is higher than the following crests using phase correction the measured wave profile is continuously improved so that the r value changes from 0 9530 in the first step to 0 9595 in the fifth step over correction appears further in the iteration process with the phase correction fig 4 b shows the wave amplitude spectra of the focused wave however the wave amplitude spectra only show a slight change during the iteration process as amplitude correction was not performed 4 2 first order pfw based on the iteration results for the focused wave the paddle motion of the corresponding pfw can be obtained using the method proposed in this study fig 5 a shows a general case of input paddle motion and the corresponding elevation of the pfw with t p 20 s based on the linear wavemaker methods with the given frequency resolution δ f 0 01 hz the focused wave generated via the traditional method reappears after 100 s however using the proposed method the focused wave was repeated five times for the pfw with a nominal period of 20 s as shown in fig 5 a the first order paddle motion of the pfw is periodic with a returning period of 20 s fig 5 b shows that the effects of the bound sub and super harmonics affect the local wave profile near the focusing time this phenomenon also appeared in the test results for the sfw as previously discussed the higher order spurious free harmonics especially the spurious free super harmonics that lag the main fwg may influence the following wave group if a shorter nominal period t p is selected the pfw for the case w08 60 with frequency step 0 01 hz frequency band 0 5 f p 3 0 f p and nominal period t p 10 s was generated in the wave flume based on the first order wavemaker theory fig 6 shows the measured elevation of the pfw generated with the iterated parameters at different iteration steps based on first order wavemaker theory the correlation coefficient between the measured and linear target wave profile increases from 0 9818 to 0 9882 with the introduction of iteration then decreases to 0 9845 with one more iteration indicating that the pfw achieves the best performance after three iteration steps 4 3 second order pfw from applying the second order wavemaker theory the iterated results of the sfw for the case w06 110 are shown in fig 7 the correlation coefficient between the measured elevation and η t in the first iteration step is 0 9690 the neighboring waves before and after the main crest arrive earlier and later than the calculated values respectively the mismatch can be improved with additional iterations the correlation coefficient has the best performance of 0 9764 after three iteration steps as shown in fig 7 a the corresponding amplitude spectrum is shown in fig 7 b to obtain a direct understanding of the second order wavemaker theory fig 8 shows a typical paddle motion and the measured elevation at the focusing location for the same case i e w06 110 it is evident that a slow varying paddle motion x 2 and a small amplitude oscillation x 2 are added the term x 2 is used to suppress the spurious free sub harmonics wave elevation η 22 whereas the x 2 term is used to eliminate the spurious free super harmonics wave elevation η 22 fig 8 b shows the wave elevation at the focusing location at the third iteration step superior symmetry can be obtained by using the second order wavemaker theory as compared with linear wave generation it can be observed from fig 8 c that the second order wavemaker theory results in better agreement with target wave spectrum and effective suppression of the spurious free sub harmonics according to the iterated input parameters of the spw the pfw for the case w08 60 with a frequency step 0 01 hz frequency band 0 5 f p 3 0 f p and nominal period 10 s was generated in a wave flume based on the second order wavemaker theory the input paddle motion and the measured elevation at the focusing location are shown in fig 9 to clearly show the measured elevation only the first one intermediate and the last fwg are shown in fig 9 b it is seen from fig 9 a that the second order paddle motion of the pfw is not periodic owing to x 2 the pfws generated via the second order wavemaker theory are quite repeatable and agree well with the target linear profile with r 0 9863 to further investigate the repeatability the wave elevation of the pfw shown in fig 9 is cut into several time intervals from t b j 5 s to t b j 5 s and a total of 11 fwgs numbered as fwg1 11 are superimposed and shown in fig 10 it can be observed that the measured wave elevation based on the first and second order wavemaker theories could achieve quite satisfactory repeatability although some difference exists between fwg1 and fwg11 this difference results from the interactions between adjacent fwgs e g the waves before the main crest of fwg2 are influenced by the waves after the main crest of fwg1 whereas this does not occur for fwg1 in addition the spurious free super harmonics waves of the anterior fwg could affect the wave profile of the following fwg for linear wave generation from comparing figs 4 and 7 it can be concluded that the second order wavemaker theory can achieve better agreement with the target linear profile in fewer iteration steps as shown in fig 8 b and fig 8 c the second order wavemaker theory can effectively reduce the influence of spurious free sub harmonics and obtain better reproduction of the target wave spectrum as well as the symmetry of the wave profile of the fwg the second order wavemaker theory is recommended for the study of wave run up or overtopping orszaghova et al 2014 as it can cancel the spurious free long wave which is a source of contamination in experiments on wave structure interactions for offshore structures 5 discussion several parameters influence the pfw in the following section the effects of the frequency band frequency resolution and the nominal period on the wave profile of the pfw are discussed fig 11 shows the wave elevations of the sfw and the pfw measured in the wave flume with different frequency bands based on the linear wavemaker theory the longuet higgins spectral width parameter ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 1 2 was employed to describe the spectral bandwidth where m r represents the rth spectral moment it is evident from fig 11 a that a small ν value in the sfw induced a wave profile with a higher crest but a lower trough in fact the spectral width significantly affects the shape of the envelopes of the wave groups as can be observed from fig 11 a this phenomenon was more obvious in the experiment of rapp and melville 1990 in which a constant amplitude e g as shown in eq 4 rather than the wave spectrum was used to study wave breaking in deep water fig 11 b shows the influence of ν on the elevations of the pfws it can be seen that four pfws exhibit good consistency in comparison with the sfw a slight oscillation can be found for the maximum crest and decreases with an increase of the frequency band furthermore the best repeatability of the main crest is obtained at ν 0 126 as observed from the superimposed elevation of the pfws hence it is suggested that a frequency band of 0 5 3 0 f p is preferred for generating pfws within the capacity of the wavemaker fig 12 shows the measured spws with frequency resolutions of 0 1 0 05 0 02 and 0 01 hz respectively it is evident that a large frequency resolution slightly increases the wave crests but results in lower troughs this means that a high frequency resolution could shape the upper wave group envelope similar to the frequency band the frequency resolution could also affect the envelope of the pfw groups which presents the possibility of designing desired wave packets to achieve a specific purpose for hydrodynamic experiments in a wave flume the linear profile and second order profiles are all contained in the measured elevations of the cfw η c f w η 1 η 21 η 22 and tfw η t f w η 1 η 21 η 22 it should be noted that the progressive terms as well as the evanescent modes are all included in both the first and second order bound and spurious free waves however only the progressive parts are considered in this study as the wave profile at the focusing location which is far from the wavemaker is rarely influenced by the evanescent modes fig 13 shows the measured wave elevation and corresponding amplitude spectrum for the η c f w η t f w the combination η c f w η t f w 2 and η c f w η t f w 2 of the sfw case w06 110 the item η c f w η t f w 2 represents the even high order harmonics in the measured fwg whereas the η c f w η t f w 2 is the summation of the linear part and odd high order harmonics as shown in fig 13 a and b there are no evident differences between the measured and calculated wave profiles for both η c f w and η t f w suggesting that the measured elevation can be reasonably re calculated according to second order wave theory from the time series of η c f w η t f w 2 three different regions can be observed water set up appears during 23 28 s water set down coupling with an oscillation of the surface of the water occurs during 28 33 s and water surface oscillation occurs during 36 42 s the three different regions are related to the spurious free sub harmonics η 21 bound sub harmonics and super harmonics η 21 η 21 and the spurious free super harmonics η 22 respectively the theoretical second order harmonics were also calculated and are shown in fig 13 c the bound sub harmonics η 21 and super harmonics η 21 which do not satisfy the dispersion relationship travel at the same speed as the linear components and reach the maximum trough and crest at the focusing time respectively the bound sub harmonics result in a decrease of the mean water level similar to the water set down the second order spurious free wave only influences the local profile of the leading waves and the tail of the fwg the spurious free sub harmonics can be treated as a solitary wave that can be eliminated by a long period of slow motion in a wavemaker similar to an invert solitary wave paddle displacement sriram et al 2015 the spurious free super harmonics have limited influence on the profile of the fwg because they lag the fwg however this could change the profile of the following fwg in the pfw as shown in fig 5 b for a small nominal period t p fig 13 e and f show the amplitude spectrum of the measured η c f w and η t f w respectively it can be observed that the amplitude spectrum of both the η c f w and η t f w agree well with the target spectrum except for difference at approximately 0 7 hz as described in eq 6 the returning period nominal period t pf of the pfw can be predefined according to requirements however the high order harmonics of the fwgs may influence the local profiles of the wave packet fig 14 a and b show the wave trains of pfws with different nominal period 10 s and 15 s respectively it is evident that the measured wave profiles all match well with the calculated profiles for the two trials with different nominal periods the correlation coefficient between the measured and calculated profiles is larger than 0 98 for all wave trials further tests show that the best agreement is achieved when the nominal periods are 20 s and 40 s this optimal time interval can be determined by ensuring that the spurious free super harmonics waves of the anterior fwg are out of the following fwgs based on theoretical calculations of wave elevation before wave generation it can be observed that a slight oscillation exists in the main crest of the trials with nominal periods of 15 s the high order sub and super harmonics in the elevations of the pfws with different nominal periods are shown in fig 14 c and d it is clear that there are two parts in the η p f c η p f t 2 the first is the bound sub and super harmonics which only exist near the focused crests and the rest is the spurious free sub and super harmonics as shown in fig 14 c and d the bound sub and super harmonics are stable and do not significantly change during the generation of the pfws as also shown in fig 14 c and d the calculated wave profiles of the high order sub and super harmonics agree well with the measured elevation in the initial stage of the pfw however an evident difference between the calculated and measured wave profiles of the high order sub and super harmonics can be observed in the later stages of the pfw similar to the results of the sfw two different types of wave groups appear in the even order wave profiles η p c f w η p t f w 2 in which η p c f w stands for the elevation of the periodic cfw whereas η p t f w represents the elevation of the periodic tfw one is the local disturbance in the vicinity of the focusing time contributed by the combination of the second order bound waves η 21 and η 21 this part of the wave group is quite stable along the entire elevation of the pfw the other is the water oscillation between the neighboring focusing times as induced by the spurious free super harmonics waves η 22 with a low pass filter the sub harmonics and the super harmonics in the can be separated from the measured even order wave profiles fig 15 a and b show the separated results of the high order sub and super harmonics in the sfw and pfw respectively as shown in figs 14 c and fig 15 b the amplitude of the high order harmonics initially increases and then remains at 6 0 mm at approximately 10 of the maximum amplitude a max along the elevation of the pfw it can also be observed that the free spurious super harmonics of each wave group would influence the wave profile of the following wave groups and the influence could accumulate along with the generation of the pfw taking the bound super harmonics of the first fwg in the pfw as a reference the free spurious super harmonics in the pfw can be extracted indicated by the red line in fig 15 b the influence of the free spurious super harmonics waves can be quantitatively evaluated for the wave trail shown in fig 14 a the maximum amplitude of the spurious free super harmonics is approximately 6 5 of the target maximum amplitude of the pfws furthermore the amplitude spectrums of the sfw and one single fwg in the pfw are shown in fig 15 c few differences can be observed between the amplitude spectrums of those two fwgs fig 15 d shows the amplitude spectrums of the high order sub and super harmonics in the sfw it can be observed that the sub and super harmonics are effectively separated the ratio of the wave energy held by the spurious free super harmonics and the linear harmonics is approximately 0 0055 which means the effect of the spurious free super harmonics is limited during the generation of the focused waves 6 conclusion in this study two methods for generating the pfws were presented based on first order and second order wavemaker theories the latter was utilized to eliminate the spurious free sub and super harmonics laboratory tests were conducted in a wave flume to validate the proposed method the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 pfws can be generated in a wave flume using the linear or second order wavemaker theories and an iteration technique however the bound sub and super harmonics could sharp the main crest and broaden the neighboring troughs the spurious free super harmonics have a limited effect on the fwg because they lag behind the main crest the wave profiles of pfws measured at the focusing location can be precisely re calculated by considering the high order harmonics superimposition of fwgs in a pfw shows that the wave profile is quite repetitive 2 using the second order wavemaker theory a better agreement with the theoretical target profile was obtained in fewer iteration steps the water set up generated by the spurious free sub harmonics was effectively suppressed by the second order wavemaker theory making it easy to achieve better symmetry in regards to focusing time together with the study conducted by orszaghova et al 2014 the second order wavemaker theory is recommended for the application of a pfw in the wave structure interactions e g run up or overtopping are being considered 3 the effects of the frequency band resolution and nominal period on the wave profile were investigated the frequency band and resolution changed the envelope of the fwg and slightly influenced the repeatability of the fwgs this effect was minimized with the increase of the frequency band of the target spectrum as the spurious free super harmonics of the fwg lagged behind the main wave group this increased the importance of the time intervals between the fwgs for the generation of the pfw the appropriate time interval can be determined according to theoretically calculated wave elevation before wave generation nominal periods of 20 40 and 10 s could be used as the optimal intervals for case w08 60 as determined based on the experimental results credit authorship contribution statement qinghe fang methodology investigation

21738,a new methodology is proposed for generating multiple focused waves within a relatively short time this can improve the efficiency of the hydrodynamic testing of coastal and offshore structures under extreme wave conditions with strong nonlinearity and randomness such as in extreme wave impact testing of vessels and offshore platforms in this study two methods for generating periodic focused waves were proposed based on a first order wavemaker theory and schäffer s second order wavemaker theory periodic focused waves were generated in a wave flume with an intermediate water depth with different peak frequencies wave amplitudes frequency bands frequency resolutions and nominal periods using the first order and second order wavemaker theories the test results demonstrate that both first order and second order wavemaker methods can produce repetitive focused wave groups within a short time period however the second order wavemaker method can reduce the influence of second order free harmonics the frequency band and resolution only slightly influence the envelope of the focused wave group for the newwave type focused waves in the present study it is possible to generate periodic focused waves with any equivalent or different time intervals but the interactions between different focused wave groups should be examined to determine an optimal nominal period keywords extreme wave periodic focused wave first order wavemaker theory second order wavemaker theory higher order harmonics wave flume 1 introduction during the past several decades numerous extreme waves alternatively referred to as rogue waves or freak waves have been reported in the ocean nikolkina and didenkulova 2011 and coastal zones chien et al 2002 the unpredictable and sudden appearance of giant waves seriously threatens the safety of offshore and coastal structures to design reliable and economic coastal and offshore structures it is essential for scientists and engineers to consider the effects of extreme wave action on structures laboratory experiments are an important approach for investigating wave loading action on coastal or offshore structures in which the reproduction of the grouped waves is of fundamental interest although there are no robust theoretical models for extreme waves dysthe et al 2008 kharif and pelinovsky 2003 it is believed that dispersive focusing is one of the main causes of the rare occurrence of rogue waves in normal sea states christou and ewans 2014 in a laboratory setting several methods have been proposed for the generation of extreme waves chaplin 1996 the most frequently used approach is the focused wave approach in which the crest of a series of harmonics is gathered at a predefined location simultaneously by utilizing the dispersion characteristics of the water waves to date the dispersive focusing method has been successfully implemented in both physical experiments rapp and melville 1990 and numerical simulations ning et al 2009 linear wavemaker theory is a fundamental approach for the generation of focused waves in the laboratory the breaking of waves in deep water was investigated using focused waves in combination with this approach rapp and melville 1990 in that study the influence of the wave generation parameter on a wave packet with a constant wave amplitude spectrum was discussed the kinematics of the focused wave were another important issue regarding this type of extreme wave and they were experimentally investigated in a laboratory baldock et al 1996 borthwick et al 2006 and compared with theoretical solutions baldock and swan 1994 1996 based on a random wave spectrum a newwave model was proposed for reproducing extreme ocean waves tromans et al 1991 this model was widely used in the coastal and ocean engineering field to study extreme wave actions bai and taylor 2007 westphalen et al 2012 whittaker et al 2016 2017 2018 based on the first order wavemaker theory the mismatches between the water particle kinematics and wavemaker velocity could generate spurious free harmonics in a wave flume the spurious higher order waves could lead to downshifts of the spatial and temporal focus location baldock and swan 1996 ning et al 2008 and the redistribution of energy phillips 1960 especially for a narrow banded spectrum the nonlinearity of the focused wave group fwg increases with the increase of the wave amplitude and reduces with the increase of the bandwidth baldock et al 1996 to obtain better focused waves at a predefined location iteration should be utilized for example chaplin et al 1997 proposed an iteration method for generating focused waves by repeatedly adjusting the control signal of a wavemaker with a measured elevation similar attempts were also performed by do et al 2004 to generate precise gaussian type fwgs and by fernández et al 2013 to focus a series of linear wave components the free sub and super harmonics of natural waves and irregular waves generated in the laboratory have been previously addressed by researchers such as mansard et al 1988 and barthel et al 1983 based on analytical investigations of the sub and super harmonics the water waves generated based on the linear wave theory can be corrected to the second order arena 2005 barthel et al 1983 sand and mansard 1986 schäffer 1996 similarly a second order wavemaker theory has also been applied to generate focused waves in different test environments orszaghova et al 2014 sriram et al 2015 whittaker et al 2017 and numerical models higuera et al 2015 westphalen et al 2012 it was determined that the second order wavemaker theory could remove most of the contamination resulting from sub harmonics whittaker et al 2017 two types of higher order harmonics have been observed when first order wavemaker theory is used to generate focused waves in a laboratory setting one is a bound wave that is a phase locked harmonic to the wave group and does not satisfy the dispersion relation the other is a spurious higher order wave that propagates freely in the wave flume the higher order harmonics could influence the wave profile and increase the nonlinearity of the fwg to solve this problem the second order wave theory was introduced to obtain more precise wave profiles arena 2005 baldock and swan 1996 baldock et al 1996 using a phase decomposition methodology the linear part of the surface elevation of focused waves was separated from the measured elevations and used for the iteration process buldakov et al 2017 stagonas et al 2018 vyzikas et al 2018 discussed the evolution of free and bound waves during dispersive focusing and discovered that the influences of the third and fourth order harmonics were considerable for unidirectional steep focused waves in addition the groupiness of wave trains has been comprehensively studied medina and hudspeth 1990 group induced bounded long waves and spurious waves were investigated by barthel et al 1983 and zaman et al 2010 respectively based on the second order wave generation method the higher harmonics in the irregular waves were successfully generated and investigated in the wave flume sand and mansard 1986 following the successful generation of focused waves using a phase speed method numerous studies have been conducted to investigate extreme wave breaking rapp and melville 1990 propagation baldock and swan 1996 and the interaction of waves with structures such as horizontal gao et al 2016 or vertical cylinders li et al 2014 decks cheng et al 2017 floating boxes zhao and hu 2012 floating productions storage and offloading vessels fpso mai et al 2016 and semisubmersibles banks and abdussamie 2017 it has been demonstrated that focused waves are efficient incident waves for the study of extreme wave action on structures the wave structure interaction process exhibits strong nonlinearity and uncertainty and requires repetition to eliminate experimental random error for example li et al 2014 repeated experimental tests to reduce random errors and improve the experimental accuracy in the study of focused wave impact on a column a similar procedure was applied by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 to study the solitary wave action on bridge decks the shortcoming of this approach is that it takes a long time to wait for the water in the flume to calm down the alternative approach is to generate multiple focused waves in one single wave trial a focused wave is periodical if a constant frequency resolution is employed during wave generation thus one can obtain multiple focused waves with a proper frequency resolution high frequency resolution is suggested for generating waves to improve the representation of the waves ittc 2017 however this makes the time interval between two neighboring focused wave crests very long and inefficient for repeated laboratory testing inspired by the superposition model widely used to generate transient waves cassidy et al 2001 hu et al 2014 kriebel and alsina 2000 pei et al 2007 buldakov 2013 proposed a method to generate multiple tsunami like waves in a short time it was demonstrated that six tsunami like waves with durations of 128 s could be repetitively generated in a trial with this notable exception there have been limited studies on this issue reported in the published literature this paper presents a new methodology for the generation of multiple focused waves within a relatively short time in a wave flume in this study two methods for generating periodic focused waves pfws are presented based on first order and second order wavemaker theories this report is organized into six sections the methodology used to generate the pfws is presented in section 2 the experimental validation is discussed and presented in sections 3 and 4 based on the test results the influence of the wavemaker parameters on a wave profile is discussed in section 5 finally the main conclusions of this study are summarized 2 methodology 2 1 first order problem of the periodic focused wave pfw for the first order problem the wave elevation of a single focused wave sfw at a specified focusing location x b and time t b can be expressed in a complex form as a special case of an irregular wave dean and dalrymple 1991 1 η s f w 1 x t n 1 n η n 1 n 1 n 1 2 a n e i 2 π f n t k n x c c where i is the imaginary unit a n k n and f n are the complex amplitude wave number and wave frequency of the n th harmonic wave in the total n components respectively and c c denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding term the wavenumber k n is related to the wave frequency f n that satisfies the linear dispersion equation of 2 π f n 2 g k n tanh k n d the complex amplitude in eq 1 can be written as follows 2 a n a n e i φ n where a n is the wave amplitude and φ n is the initial phase related to the focusing location and focusing time with the superposition of the harmonic waves the crest focused wave cfw and trough focused wave tfw can be respectively obtained with the initial phase given as follows 3 φ n k n x b 2 π f n t b cfw k n x b 2 π f n t b π tfw according to the newwave type focused wave model tromans et al 1991 the wave amplitude can be expressed as follows 4 a n a max s f n δ f n n 1 n s f n δ f n where δ f n is the frequency step a max is the target amplitude of the focused crest at the focusing location and is theoretically equal to the sum of the amplitudes of all of the wave components and s f n is the target power spectrum in this study the modified joint north sea wave observation project spectrum goda 1999 is adopted for the following analysis once the input parameters are determined by setting the position of the wavemaker at x 0 the first order paddle position for the sfw which complies with the wave spectrum consisting of a total of n wave components can be expressed as follows 5 x s f w 1 1 2 n 1 n i a n c n e i ω n t c c where c n is the biésel transfer function between the paddle motion and the wave elevation with the frequency band f min f max the focused wave appears periodically with a period of t 1 δ f f max f min n for a constant δ f indicating that the same focused wave would be obtained in every period generally a small δf is preferred in a laboratory setting to generate a well controlled focused wave that effectively matches the wave spectrum however the returning period of a focused wave is very long for a focused wave with a small frequency step it can be observed from the sfw 1 in fig 1 that the wave motion between two neighboring focused crests is approximately zero over a long period of time it can be expected that more focused wave events can be generated during this time the schematic diagram for the assembly process of a pfw is shown in fig 1 by simultaneously generating several focused waves with different focusing times a pfw with a relatively small return period can be obtained as follows 6 η p f w 1 x t j 1 m f 1 2 n 1 n a n j e i 2 π f n t k n x c c the pfw can be further explained as the total of the m f single focused waves at different focus times t b j with initial phase φ n j and the amplitude a n j generated in the wave flume simultaneously in the process the nominal period t pf of the pfw can be set as any preferred value by adjusting t b j the wave paddle motion required to generate the pfw can also be obtained as follows 7 x p f w 1 j 1 m f 1 2 n 1 n i a n j c n e i 2 π f n t c c 2 2 second order problem of the pfw the first order wavemaker theory of common focused waves has been well developed and successfully applied to both wave flumes chaplin 1996 and wave basins rapp and melville 1990 nevertheless the importance of second order waves has also been reported in several recent works orszaghova et al 2014 sriram et al 2015 whittaker et al 2017 indicating that second order spurious free waves could affect the target wave profile s of focused waves as a result the second order wavemaker theory was also adopted in this study to generate the pfws following schäffer s second order wavemaker theory schäffer 1996 the wave elevation and paddle motion as corrected to the second order are given as follows 8 η ε η 1 ε 2 η 2 9 x 0 ε x 0 1 ε 2 x 0 2 where η 1 x 0 1 and η 2 x 0 2 are the first and second order wave elevation and paddle motion respectively and ε is a small parameter of the order of x 0 d d is the water depth the second order wave elevation shown in eq 8 can be separated into three contributions as follows barthel et al 1983 10 η 2 η 21 η 22 η 23 where η 21 denotes the bound waves that result from the interactions between linear wave components η 22 denotes the free waves generated from the mismatching of the wave paddle movement and the bound waves and η 23 denotes the wave motion generated by the second order wave paddle motion x 0 2 and is used to eliminate the spurious free waves η 22 the wave elevations η 21 and η 22 generated by the wave components with frequencies f n and f m can be calculated as follows 11 η n m 21 1 2 g n m a n a m e i ω n t k n x ω m t k m x c c 12 η n m 22 1 2 a n a m d c p 22 e i ω n ω m t k p x c c where g is the transfer function of the progressive part of the second order bound wave superscript denotes a complex operation defined as either the conjugation for sub harmonics or zero for super harmonics c p 22 is a coefficient related to the vertical eigenfunction and k p is the solution of the following dispersion equation 13 ω n ω m 2 g k p tanh k p d considering the influence of the second order harmonics the wave profile of the pfw generated using the linear wavemaker theory can be theoretically calculated as follows 14 η p f w 1 s t x t j 1 m f n 1 n η n 1 n 1 n m n n η n m 21 η n m 22 n 1 n m n 1 n η n m 21 η n m 22 to eliminate the spurious free waves η 22 a second order paddle motion x 2 is introduced as follows 15 x n m 2 1 2 i f a n a m d e i ω n ω m t c c where f is the second order transfer function related to the super and sub harmonic terms additional details regarding the second order wavemaker theory can be found in schäffer 1996 schäffer 1996 derived a second order wavemaker method for unidirectional irregular waves and subsequently extended the approach to the generation of directional irregular waves schäffer and steenberg 2003 this method can be adopted to generate focused waves by replacing the original random initial phase with the initial phase φ n of the focused waves as represented by eq 3 thus the paddle motion of a second order sfw can be expressed as follows 16 x s f w 2 n d n 1 n x 1 n 1 n m n n x n m 2 n 1 n m n 1 n x n m 2 the paddle motion of the second order pfw can also be calculated by summing the paddle motions of these sfws at different focusing times using this method the wave profile of the second order pfw is obtained as follows 17 η p f w 2 n d x t j 1 m f n 1 n η n 1 n 1 n m n n η n m 21 n 1 n m n 1 n η n m 21 2 3 iteration of the initial phase and amplitude from eq 16 it can also be determined that only the interactions of the wave components in the temporal domain are considered during the generation of the second order pfw using the proposed method a downshift of the focusing location relative to the target location could appear owing to the absence of the interactions of wave components in the spatial domain in the theoretical calculation to ensure that all wave components arrive in phase at the predefined location a self correcting method fernández et al 2014 alternatively referred to as the phase amplitude iteration method deng et al 2016 has been proposed for achieving a focused crest at a constant spatial location this iteration method consists of three steps 1 calculating the paddle motion of the wavemaker for the target wave profile using linear wavemaker theory 2 performing a trial with the theoretical paddle motion followed by correction of the input initial phase and wave amplitude with reference to the target and measured wave elevation and 3 repeating step 2 until the difference is acceptable in this study the same method is also used to eliminate the downshift of the focusing location of the pfw the phase angle and amplitude of the wave components are corrected as follows 18 φ n n e w φ n o l d φ n t a r g e t φ n m e a s u r e d 19 a n n e w a n o l d a n t a r g e t a n m e a s u e d the flowchart for the generation of the pfw is shown in fig 2 3 experimental setup to verify the proposed method an experiment was conducted at the laboratory of coastal engineering at harbin engineering university in china a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 3 the experiment was conducted in a wave flume that was 30 m long 0 8 m wide and 1 0 m deep a piston type wavemaker was used to generate water waves at the opposite side a sloping beach with multi layers of inclined perforated plates was employed to eliminate reflections of the waves during testing the control signal of the paddle motion was determined according to the proposed method the actual wave motion was measured using two potentiometric position transducers each with a resolution of 0 01 mm simultaneously a total of 13 wave gauges each with a resolution of 0 6 mm i e smaller than 0 5 of the maximum target wave amplitude were arranged along the wave flume to measure the evolution process of the wave furthermore a vectrino acoustic velocimeter with a submergence depth of 50 mm was also set to record the velocity at the focusing location of the focused wave the test plan contained four basic cases with two different peak frequencies of 0 6 hz and 0 8 hz and wave amplitudes of 60 0 mm and 110 0 mm respectively the frequency band frequency resolution and nominal period used in the test plan are listed in table 1 for each trial the first and second order waves were all tested for comparison 4 experiment results 4 1 iteration of the single focused wave based on the previous experiments of researchers sriram et al 2015 it has been widely observed that there is a deviation between the target and the actual focusing location irrespective of whether using a first or second order wavemaker method therefore iteration was implemented to obtain a focused wave at a fixed focusing location in this study the sfw was first tested to obtain the input parameters of the wave paddle motion which were also utilized for the generation of the pfws to compare the generated results for the sfw and pfws the linear elevation η t calculated using eq 1 with the target wave spectrum was used as the target wave profile for evaluating the elevations of the measured wave according to the flowchart shown in fig 2 the phase angle and amplitude can be either iterated in the same step or only one of them can be iterated in a single iteration step the authors determined that the application of phase and amplitude iteration together does not facilitate an easy convergence to the target a max owing to the oscillation between different iteration steps the reason for this phenomenon is that the small amplitude of some low or high frequency components leads to over corrections in the next step it is better to perform the phase and amplitude correction in different iteration steps as utilized by deng et al 2016 for deterministic freak wave generation in the present study only the phase correction was adopted to reproduce the pfws the amplitude correction could be easily performed after completion of the phase correction the effect of viscous damping on the spectral change can be estimated by the eddy viscosity parameter ν e as shown in table 1 the eddy viscosity parameter was calculated based on the local wave profile near the focusing location hasan et al 2019 which provided a quantitative reference for the amplitude correction by applying linear wavemaker theory the iterated cfw and tfw were sequentially generated in the wave flume as an example the iterated results for the case w06 110 with a frequency band of 0 5 f p 3 0 f p and δ f 0 01 hz for the first order wavemaker theory are shown in fig 4 it should be mentioned that the time series of the wave elevation in this figure is slightly shifted to make the main crest appear at t 30 s in fig 4 a the blue line represents the measured elevations whereas the grey line represents the calculated profile η 1 st which is equal to the summation of the linear elevation η 1 and the second order wave components η 21 and η 22 the value of η 1 st was calculated using a measured wave spectrum obtained via a fast fourier transform and was intended to show how well the measured elevation could be re calculated this is useful for future numerical simulations the correlation coefficient between the measured elevations and the target linear profile η t at the focused location were used to quantify the wave elevation during iteration as follows 20 r η a η b cov η a η b cov η a η a cov η b η b where η a and η b represent the two wave elevation series at issue and cov is the covariance from fig 4 a it can be seen that the measured wave elevation at the focused location is in good agreement with η t with r 0 9530 however a slightly asymmetric phenomenon is observed when the leading crest ahead of the main crest is higher than the following crests using phase correction the measured wave profile is continuously improved so that the r value changes from 0 9530 in the first step to 0 9595 in the fifth step over correction appears further in the iteration process with the phase correction fig 4 b shows the wave amplitude spectra of the focused wave however the wave amplitude spectra only show a slight change during the iteration process as amplitude correction was not performed 4 2 first order pfw based on the iteration results for the focused wave the paddle motion of the corresponding pfw can be obtained using the method proposed in this study fig 5 a shows a general case of input paddle motion and the corresponding elevation of the pfw with t p 20 s based on the linear wavemaker methods with the given frequency resolution δ f 0 01 hz the focused wave generated via the traditional method reappears after 100 s however using the proposed method the focused wave was repeated five times for the pfw with a nominal period of 20 s as shown in fig 5 a the first order paddle motion of the pfw is periodic with a returning period of 20 s fig 5 b shows that the effects of the bound sub and super harmonics affect the local wave profile near the focusing time this phenomenon also appeared in the test results for the sfw as previously discussed the higher order spurious free harmonics especially the spurious free super harmonics that lag the main fwg may influence the following wave group if a shorter nominal period t p is selected the pfw for the case w08 60 with frequency step 0 01 hz frequency band 0 5 f p 3 0 f p and nominal period t p 10 s was generated in the wave flume based on the first order wavemaker theory fig 6 shows the measured elevation of the pfw generated with the iterated parameters at different iteration steps based on first order wavemaker theory the correlation coefficient between the measured and linear target wave profile increases from 0 9818 to 0 9882 with the introduction of iteration then decreases to 0 9845 with one more iteration indicating that the pfw achieves the best performance after three iteration steps 4 3 second order pfw from applying the second order wavemaker theory the iterated results of the sfw for the case w06 110 are shown in fig 7 the correlation coefficient between the measured elevation and η t in the first iteration step is 0 9690 the neighboring waves before and after the main crest arrive earlier and later than the calculated values respectively the mismatch can be improved with additional iterations the correlation coefficient has the best performance of 0 9764 after three iteration steps as shown in fig 7 a the corresponding amplitude spectrum is shown in fig 7 b to obtain a direct understanding of the second order wavemaker theory fig 8 shows a typical paddle motion and the measured elevation at the focusing location for the same case i e w06 110 it is evident that a slow varying paddle motion x 2 and a small amplitude oscillation x 2 are added the term x 2 is used to suppress the spurious free sub harmonics wave elevation η 22 whereas the x 2 term is used to eliminate the spurious free super harmonics wave elevation η 22 fig 8 b shows the wave elevation at the focusing location at the third iteration step superior symmetry can be obtained by using the second order wavemaker theory as compared with linear wave generation it can be observed from fig 8 c that the second order wavemaker theory results in better agreement with target wave spectrum and effective suppression of the spurious free sub harmonics according to the iterated input parameters of the spw the pfw for the case w08 60 with a frequency step 0 01 hz frequency band 0 5 f p 3 0 f p and nominal period 10 s was generated in a wave flume based on the second order wavemaker theory the input paddle motion and the measured elevation at the focusing location are shown in fig 9 to clearly show the measured elevation only the first one intermediate and the last fwg are shown in fig 9 b it is seen from fig 9 a that the second order paddle motion of the pfw is not periodic owing to x 2 the pfws generated via the second order wavemaker theory are quite repeatable and agree well with the target linear profile with r 0 9863 to further investigate the repeatability the wave elevation of the pfw shown in fig 9 is cut into several time intervals from t b j 5 s to t b j 5 s and a total of 11 fwgs numbered as fwg1 11 are superimposed and shown in fig 10 it can be observed that the measured wave elevation based on the first and second order wavemaker theories could achieve quite satisfactory repeatability although some difference exists between fwg1 and fwg11 this difference results from the interactions between adjacent fwgs e g the waves before the main crest of fwg2 are influenced by the waves after the main crest of fwg1 whereas this does not occur for fwg1 in addition the spurious free super harmonics waves of the anterior fwg could affect the wave profile of the following fwg for linear wave generation from comparing figs 4 and 7 it can be concluded that the second order wavemaker theory can achieve better agreement with the target linear profile in fewer iteration steps as shown in fig 8 b and fig 8 c the second order wavemaker theory can effectively reduce the influence of spurious free sub harmonics and obtain better reproduction of the target wave spectrum as well as the symmetry of the wave profile of the fwg the second order wavemaker theory is recommended for the study of wave run up or overtopping orszaghova et al 2014 as it can cancel the spurious free long wave which is a source of contamination in experiments on wave structure interactions for offshore structures 5 discussion several parameters influence the pfw in the following section the effects of the frequency band frequency resolution and the nominal period on the wave profile of the pfw are discussed fig 11 shows the wave elevations of the sfw and the pfw measured in the wave flume with different frequency bands based on the linear wavemaker theory the longuet higgins spectral width parameter ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 1 2 was employed to describe the spectral bandwidth where m r represents the rth spectral moment it is evident from fig 11 a that a small ν value in the sfw induced a wave profile with a higher crest but a lower trough in fact the spectral width significantly affects the shape of the envelopes of the wave groups as can be observed from fig 11 a this phenomenon was more obvious in the experiment of rapp and melville 1990 in which a constant amplitude e g as shown in eq 4 rather than the wave spectrum was used to study wave breaking in deep water fig 11 b shows the influence of ν on the elevations of the pfws it can be seen that four pfws exhibit good consistency in comparison with the sfw a slight oscillation can be found for the maximum crest and decreases with an increase of the frequency band furthermore the best repeatability of the main crest is obtained at ν 0 126 as observed from the superimposed elevation of the pfws hence it is suggested that a frequency band of 0 5 3 0 f p is preferred for generating pfws within the capacity of the wavemaker fig 12 shows the measured spws with frequency resolutions of 0 1 0 05 0 02 and 0 01 hz respectively it is evident that a large frequency resolution slightly increases the wave crests but results in lower troughs this means that a high frequency resolution could shape the upper wave group envelope similar to the frequency band the frequency resolution could also affect the envelope of the pfw groups which presents the possibility of designing desired wave packets to achieve a specific purpose for hydrodynamic experiments in a wave flume the linear profile and second order profiles are all contained in the measured elevations of the cfw η c f w η 1 η 21 η 22 and tfw η t f w η 1 η 21 η 22 it should be noted that the progressive terms as well as the evanescent modes are all included in both the first and second order bound and spurious free waves however only the progressive parts are considered in this study as the wave profile at the focusing location which is far from the wavemaker is rarely influenced by the evanescent modes fig 13 shows the measured wave elevation and corresponding amplitude spectrum for the η c f w η t f w the combination η c f w η t f w 2 and η c f w η t f w 2 of the sfw case w06 110 the item η c f w η t f w 2 represents the even high order harmonics in the measured fwg whereas the η c f w η t f w 2 is the summation of the linear part and odd high order harmonics as shown in fig 13 a and b there are no evident differences between the measured and calculated wave profiles for both η c f w and η t f w suggesting that the measured elevation can be reasonably re calculated according to second order wave theory from the time series of η c f w η t f w 2 three different regions can be observed water set up appears during 23 28 s water set down coupling with an oscillation of the surface of the water occurs during 28 33 s and water surface oscillation occurs during 36 42 s the three different regions are related to the spurious free sub harmonics η 21 bound sub harmonics and super harmonics η 21 η 21 and the spurious free super harmonics η 22 respectively the theoretical second order harmonics were also calculated and are shown in fig 13 c the bound sub harmonics η 21 and super harmonics η 21 which do not satisfy the dispersion relationship travel at the same speed as the linear components and reach the maximum trough and crest at the focusing time respectively the bound sub harmonics result in a decrease of the mean water level similar to the water set down the second order spurious free wave only influences the local profile of the leading waves and the tail of the fwg the spurious free sub harmonics can be treated as a solitary wave that can be eliminated by a long period of slow motion in a wavemaker similar to an invert solitary wave paddle displacement sriram et al 2015 the spurious free super harmonics have limited influence on the profile of the fwg because they lag the fwg however this could change the profile of the following fwg in the pfw as shown in fig 5 b for a small nominal period t p fig 13 e and f show the amplitude spectrum of the measured η c f w and η t f w respectively it can be observed that the amplitude spectrum of both the η c f w and η t f w agree well with the target spectrum except for difference at approximately 0 7 hz as described in eq 6 the returning period nominal period t pf of the pfw can be predefined according to requirements however the high order harmonics of the fwgs may influence the local profiles of the wave packet fig 14 a and b show the wave trains of pfws with different nominal period 10 s and 15 s respectively it is evident that the measured wave profiles all match well with the calculated profiles for the two trials with different nominal periods the correlation coefficient between the measured and calculated profiles is larger than 0 98 for all wave trials further tests show that the best agreement is achieved when the nominal periods are 20 s and 40 s this optimal time interval can be determined by ensuring that the spurious free super harmonics waves of the anterior fwg are out of the following fwgs based on theoretical calculations of wave elevation before wave generation it can be observed that a slight oscillation exists in the main crest of the trials with nominal periods of 15 s the high order sub and super harmonics in the elevations of the pfws with different nominal periods are shown in fig 14 c and d it is clear that there are two parts in the η p f c η p f t 2 the first is the bound sub and super harmonics which only exist near the focused crests and the rest is the spurious free sub and super harmonics as shown in fig 14 c and d the bound sub and super harmonics are stable and do not significantly change during the generation of the pfws as also shown in fig 14 c and d the calculated wave profiles of the high order sub and super harmonics agree well with the measured elevation in the initial stage of the pfw however an evident difference between the calculated and measured wave profiles of the high order sub and super harmonics can be observed in the later stages of the pfw similar to the results of the sfw two different types of wave groups appear in the even order wave profiles η p c f w η p t f w 2 in which η p c f w stands for the elevation of the periodic cfw whereas η p t f w represents the elevation of the periodic tfw one is the local disturbance in the vicinity of the focusing time contributed by the combination of the second order bound waves η 21 and η 21 this part of the wave group is quite stable along the entire elevation of the pfw the other is the water oscillation between the neighboring focusing times as induced by the spurious free super harmonics waves η 22 with a low pass filter the sub harmonics and the super harmonics in the can be separated from the measured even order wave profiles fig 15 a and b show the separated results of the high order sub and super harmonics in the sfw and pfw respectively as shown in figs 14 c and fig 15 b the amplitude of the high order harmonics initially increases and then remains at 6 0 mm at approximately 10 of the maximum amplitude a max along the elevation of the pfw it can also be observed that the free spurious super harmonics of each wave group would influence the wave profile of the following wave groups and the influence could accumulate along with the generation of the pfw taking the bound super harmonics of the first fwg in the pfw as a reference the free spurious super harmonics in the pfw can be extracted indicated by the red line in fig 15 b the influence of the free spurious super harmonics waves can be quantitatively evaluated for the wave trail shown in fig 14 a the maximum amplitude of the spurious free super harmonics is approximately 6 5 of the target maximum amplitude of the pfws furthermore the amplitude spectrums of the sfw and one single fwg in the pfw are shown in fig 15 c few differences can be observed between the amplitude spectrums of those two fwgs fig 15 d shows the amplitude spectrums of the high order sub and super harmonics in the sfw it can be observed that the sub and super harmonics are effectively separated the ratio of the wave energy held by the spurious free super harmonics and the linear harmonics is approximately 0 0055 which means the effect of the spurious free super harmonics is limited during the generation of the focused waves 6 conclusion in this study two methods for generating the pfws were presented based on first order and second order wavemaker theories the latter was utilized to eliminate the spurious free sub and super harmonics laboratory tests were conducted in a wave flume to validate the proposed method the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 pfws can be generated in a wave flume using the linear or second order wavemaker theories and an iteration technique however the bound sub and super harmonics could sharp the main crest and broaden the neighboring troughs the spurious free super harmonics have a limited effect on the fwg because they lag behind the main crest the wave profiles of pfws measured at the focusing location can be precisely re calculated by considering the high order harmonics superimposition of fwgs in a pfw shows that the wave profile is quite repetitive 2 using the second order wavemaker theory a better agreement with the theoretical target profile was obtained in fewer iteration steps the water set up generated by the spurious free sub harmonics was effectively suppressed by the second order wavemaker theory making it easy to achieve better symmetry in regards to focusing time together with the study conducted by orszaghova et al 2014 the second order wavemaker theory is recommended for the application of a pfw in the wave structure interactions e g run up or overtopping are being considered 3 the effects of the frequency band resolution and nominal period on the wave profile were investigated the frequency band and resolution changed the envelope of the fwg and slightly influenced the repeatability of the fwgs this effect was minimized with the increase of the frequency band of the target spectrum as the spurious free super harmonics of the fwg lagged behind the main wave group this increased the importance of the time intervals between the fwgs for the generation of the pfw the appropriate time interval can be determined according to theoretically calculated wave elevation before wave generation nominal periods of 20 40 and 10 s could be used as the optimal intervals for case w08 60 as determined based on the experimental results credit authorship contribution statement qinghe fang methodology investigation

21739,computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling is a powerful tool to analyze complex hydrodynamics problems like flow around bluff bodies and their interactions including flow separation and reattachments where analytical formulas are not applicable nor reliable nevertheless a relevant limitation on the systematic adoption of automated cfd workflows for a given typology of problems is still present in this work the results of an automatic and web based application named lincosim specifically designed to perform automatic cfd modelling of planing hulls are presented the tool uses only open source software and deploys high performances computing infrastructures to take advantage of well established yet innovative technological bricks a detailed comparison for planing hull hydrodynamics analyses is performed in an automated fashion on a systematic series of four planing hulls previously studied experimentally over a wide range of froude numbers the numerical outcomes and the systematic series trends of total resistance sinkage dynamic trim and wetted surface area are compared with the measured experimental results this paper shows that today cfd automated workflows can be used to study planing hull hydrodynamics highlighting the fact that several innovative aspects involved in lincosim could have a strong impact on the way cfd tools are adopted in modern marine industrial design keywords lincosim planing hull hydrodynamics computational fluid dynamics cfd experimental fluid dynamics efd openfoam high performance computing hpc 1 introduction thanks to the evolving technologies in numerical libraries and hardware computational power the possibility of achieving high quality computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling for complex hydrodynamics problems not only at the research level but also during ordinary day by day industrial product design is today a matter of fact nevertheless the standard way of using cfd applications remains somehow linked to an old style single user approach in which also routine and repetitive activities involved in a standardized cfd model development process are performed ex novo each time adopting a well established workflow automation paradigm based on a priori knowledge of the physics involved in the solution of the specific problem many time consuming tasks can be avoided moreover there are several limiting factors on a wider diffusion of 3d computational models to perform virtual towing tank data acquiring related also to software licensing and hardware infrastructure costs as a result due to the necessary human time required to perform such activities and to the limitation driven by technical costs there is a limitation on the effective number of cfd models analyzed in the preliminary hull design phase as confirmed by reichel and minchev 2014 small design offices seldom rely on cfd and only a fraction of the world s fleet uses cfd generated trim optimization databases to save fuel in daily operations furthermore for complex hydrodynamic phenomena including sharp flow separation at the chine dry transom at design speed relatively high running trim and large pressure gradients at the stagnation line as for planing hulls correct numerical setup for reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations requires experienced users therefore the use of simple empirical methods like savitsky 1964 or ones based on regression analysis or artificial neural network ann is still a very common design practice as stated in dumortier et al 2019 in that work the authors monitored for 11 months a sample of 35 sar military boats plascoa 1650 tested in real conditions in the arcachon bay and compared with the power prediction tool ppt based on savitsky theory with some modifications for the aerodynamic drag determination the average of the differences for speed under 9 knots is 0 24 while in the whole speed range the differences are included in a more widespread range 13 63 22 3 a more comprehensive work by radojcic 2019 presents a detailed overview of the latest experimental data and available regression analysis based methods for planing hull resistance and propulsion prediction highlighting the limits of applicability of each systematic series or relative regression formula starting from the works of caponnetto 2001 and brizzolara and serra 2007 and accordingly to more recent ones see broglia and durante 2017 stern et al 2015 brizzolara and vernengo 2016 broglia and durante 2017 sukas et al 2017 khazaee et al 2019 judge et al 2020 niazmand bilandi et al 2020 he et al 2019 huang et al 2019 it has been shown and accepted that cfd is potentially a powerful tool to provide a robust and accurate virtualized measurement technique for planing hull problems as for the experimental fluid dynamics efd approaches when cfd is used to reproduce the experiment the limited evaluation of the key hull parameters impact on the knowledge of the hydrodynamic performances in the early design stage can bring a final sub optimal design involving unexpected power engine consumption or undesired high trim angles at a given velocity condition as underlined in gatin et al 2019 automation in a naval design application is of interest for cfd to effectively contribute to the shipping industry on a larger scale the example of automation of the entire process has been proposed for kriso container ship kcs jbc car carrier and naval ship dtmb 5512 leaving cfd specific parameters away from the user and reducing the need of highly skilled cfd engineer nevertheless there is not yet to our knowledge a vertical application that includes the automation of the overall cfd workflow allowing for interactive navigation of inputs and outputs taking advantage of web technologies high performance computing hpc servers and open source libraries except for lincosim as we already presented in salvadore and ponzini 2019 the lincosim web application is part of the lincoln project see lincoln consortium see lincoln consortium 2020 and is a vertical solution that includes a complete cfd rans computational workflow using a fully open source based software stack providing the possibility to transparently take advantage of state of the art hpc facilities in some way lincosim embodies the philosophy of workflow as a service wfaas as presented in several works korambath et al 2016 haocheng et al 2011 zill et al 2013 for different fields of application in other words lincosim is a platform which fully automatizes the complex workflow of hydrodynamic simulation allowing a user designer to perform and manage state of the art 3d rans cfd studies without the necessity of having cfd software competences nor having hpc skills to execute codes in feasible computing times the evaluation of such a transversal tool requires the necessity of defining and ranking a set of very different parameters related to a very different field of

lincoln project have been described in salvadore et al 2019 in appendix a the main details about the platform implementation are given for sake of completeness the remaining points are still open and are the objective of the present paper concerning point c the application of the automated cfd solver applied to the case of bare planing hulls analysis is presented in detail a systematic series made of four planing hulls previously experimentally studied begovic and bertorello 2012 has been selected analyzing the hydrodynamic outcomes of two degrees of freedom dof solver available in lincosim spanning the same froude number range as performed during the experimental campaign concerning point d to have a complete understanding of the computational performances and costs of lincosim for a given reference case hull at a given velocity value we analyzed the best parallel performances achievable by the existing hpc platform considering three different types of solver setup by playing with the number of degree of freedom from zero to two the forthcoming of the paper is as follows in section materials and methods the reference experimental dataset and the automatic computational workflow are presented results section contains the workflow numerical outcomes compared to the experimental measures and the application time to result and costs the discussion section provides a deep qualitative comparison between efd and cfd data analyzing the possible interplay between towing tank outcomes and numerical ones by including possible limitations of the overall approach the conclusions section provide a well rounded closure of the paper considering possible new perspectives for naval architects and designers appendix a is dedicated to the description of technical details of the web application appendix b contains the verification analysis of the cfd model and the mesh sensitivity analysis of the proposed meshing procedure appendix c is dedicated to the technical details of the computational costs of the possible variations on the number of degrees of freedom used by the solver and of the scalability performances of the solver 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental reference dataset during the last decade much research efforts have been invested in the understanding of possible strategies useful to obtain resistance reduction for achieving the highest speed of fast planing hulls new systematic series of planing hull models have been tested experimentally in calm water in metcalf and faul 2005 and kowalyshyn and metcalf 2006 begovic and bertorello 2012 begovic et al 2013 kim et al 2013 de luca and pensa 2012 de luca and pensa 2017 also stepped hulls have been tested by taunton et al 2010 garland 2011 white et al 2012 lee et al 2014 de marco et al 2017 najafi et al 2019 furthermore some applications of the interceptors mansoori et al 2017 zou et al 2019 spray rails seo et al 2016 molchanov et al 2019 tunnels yousefi et al 2014 or forced ventilation on the bottom as in cucinotta et al 2017 and yang et al 2019 have been revisited both experimentally and numerically as a possible improvement of hydrodynamic performances all new experimental data provides improved quality of measured data due to better instrumentations known uncertainty and contemporary hull form design assuring better references for the designers as well as for the validation of numerical tools among them for the lincosim application validation the experimental data from the begovic and bertorello 2012 are chosen in the systematic series the only parameter is a longitudinal variation of the deadrise angle for four models all models have the same deadrise angle of 17 at 0 25l from the stern in fig 1 the hulls body plans are shown one model has the constant deadrise angle all along the length so called monohedral model mono and the three other have a linear variation of the deadrise angle along the model length obtaining only linear inclination of the chine line wi i 1 2 3 the peculiarity of the models is the transparent bottom that enables the photographing of the wetted surface during the experimental campaign and allows for advanced analysis in post processing as shown in the forthcoming of the paper tests in calm water have been performed in the range of froude numbers fr from 0 266 to 1 73 to perform meaningful cfd analysis also some relevant information of each hull studied in the series is necessary these sets of values as measured during the experimental campaign are reported in table 1 2 2 cfd modelling and automation the cfd workflow for ship hydrodynamics problems is made of four main elements schematically shown in fig 2 a pre processing the geometry description of the hull hull cad and the fluid dynamics conditions at which the hull has to be tested are used to define the computational grid in terms of extension and cells size cfd model setup the proper fluid properties initial and boundary conditions and rigid body dynamics constants are defined according to user inputs this stage defines also what kind of physics has to be solved and how in other words the model setup is the element of the workflow that defines what kind of experiment we want to virtualize in hull hydrodynamics studies there are three main types of tests that can be performed for calm waters conditions so called captive or zero degrees of freedom runs 0 dof or free sink runs 1 dof or free sink and trim runs 2 dof cfd model computing the cfd model is resolved using a desktop pc and or distributed parallel computers depending on mesh model size and desired time to solution post processing the cfd outcomes are processed to get an arbitrary set of key parameter indices kpi values tables plots and diagrams that are necessary to support a ranking of the hull performances and eventually support decision making designer s activity standardization and parametrization of the user s inputs are the two main bricks of the lincosim way of working in fig 2 b we represented the technical steps involved in the three main automated blocks that are domain definition and meshing cfd modelling and equation solving data processing and visualization from fig 2 c it is possible to understand how complex the solutions path can be and how within each intermediate step a set of necessary tests are made before the workflow can be considered eligible to evolve from one step to the next one this set of tests is synthesized into a single python function named evolve py containing a set of rules identified by the authors and based on their experience these rules are adopted to discern positive step completion sufficient to evolve to the next step from negative ones related to an early workflow stop with information reporting to the end user about the issue occurred the presence of this function is necessary due to the numbers of possible causes that can prevent the computational workflow to end with success on top of this list we have meshing issues the meshing step is by far the most critical step of the workflow since from this step depends most of our workflow success for this reason as discussed in the next sections of the paper and in appendix b we designed the meshing procedure to ensure the most robust outcome as possible in lincosim the computational back end of all these four workflow steps are designed using only open source libraries more precisely the cfd undergoing engine is developed using the openfoam toolbox version 6 0 see weller et al 1998 openfoam is a state of the art open source toolbox that enables to solve the 3d navier stokes equation including dynamic mesh motion n dof n 0 1 2 in a cost effective way the solution of hull hydrodynamics involves the solving procedure of a set of differential equations for a full 3d domain the incompressible navier stokes for two phases air water with interface tracking and capturing and the rigid body dynamics of the hull in equilibrium under the effect of gravity hull mass hydrodynamic forces drag lift and moment must be solved to get information about the hull hydrodynamics values proper numerical schemes and solver setup of all these equations are already included and available for direct usage in the openfoam as the standard solver in our automated workflow a fixed numerical solver setup for all our computations was kept as standard in particular the standard interdymfoam rans solver equipped with komegasst turbulence model see menter 1994 was used and wall functions selecting very standard boundary conditions for the numerical patches are defined in table 2 for the rigid body dynamics solver we used the newmark solver selecting the velocity integration coefficient equal to 0 5 and the position integration coefficient equal to 0 25 therefore in lincosim the cfd modelling parametrization refers only to the domain definition the meshing procedure the rigid body dynamics settings the turbulence and the initial conditions definition in this way a sort of standardized setup is available for a given type of numerical experiment able to scale up and down with the hull size and adjust other parameters with hull hydrodynamics working conditions more in detail the user input used to automate the preprocessing step is the cad geometry input file the water temperature the hull velocity the estimated wave height on the hull and the free surface position the hull length lx defines the computational domain extension parametrization as shown in fig 3 the computational domain meshing is performed by parametrizing a well defined successive refinement procedure as given by the openfoam developers see cfd direct ltd 2020 for marine hydrodynamics problems see also ponzini and penza 2015 starting from the overall domain extension a set of nested successive box refinements together with a free surface refinement region and with further hull surface refinements are performed taking advantage of the free surface input value the dimension of the reference external mesh region cell is defined to match a target mesh cell size on the hull surface necessary to well describe the physical boundary layer region the boundary layer region is instead defined taking into account water temperature and hull velocity information using the ittc international towing tank conference formula for boundary layer thickness evaluation see ittc 2015 the number of mesh layers to be used to discretize the desired boundary layer thickness is adjusted automatically to reach a target yplus value while in theory see menter et al 1994 menter 1994 the optimal average yplus value should be set between 30 and 300 accordingly to the type of wall functions used we found that using our solver setup we would be able to obtain better results using a dynamic value of yplus linking its value to the froude number as shown in fig 4 in practice while setting up the meshing strategy for w3 hull the wall function performances have been tested for each froude number and compared against the experimental data as shown in fig 4 a during this set of tests all the meshing parameters were kept constant except for the yplus value we tested four meshes three with fixed yplus for all froude numbers with values of 30 50 and 150 and one with a dynamic yplus value changing with the froude number as shown in fig 4 b from the plots in fig 4 a it can be noticed that the variation of the drag differences with respect to the efd values are quite limited in the displacing and fully planing regions while they are becoming more prominent in the semi planing region using this meshing approach we were able to obtain a robust and general meshing strategy obtaining a reasonable number of cells size the final resulting mesh for a reference case hull with an average yplus value of 100 and a cell mesh size on the hull of about 0 05 m counts about 1 5 million cells for the semi hull and it is shown in fig 5 in appendix b table b1 for sake of completeness verification and validation set of data is given for two hulls mono and w3 at two different froude numbers using three meshes with a mesh cell length reduction factor of 1 4 moreover to show the robustness of our meshing strategy in table b2 also the sensitivity analysis to changes on the background cell mesh size keeping the yplus value fixed on the same set of hulls at the same froude numbers is reported using five different meshes coherently with the wall functions specification as shown in table b2 fixing the value of the yplus and the number of layer used to discretize the physical boundary layer thickness there is a very low difference in terms of quantitative integral fluid dynamics values in adopting a finer or coarser mesh cell size at the far field position we selected to adopt a background mesh cell size that will ensure an average mesh size between 1 5 and 1 75 million cells for the half hull being this final mesh size coherent to a reasonable time to result at a given degree of parallelism as shown in table c2 finally the cfd model setup parametrization is performed using the input that defines the rigid body dynamics constants using inertia mass and cog position input values the water rheological properties using water temperature input value the initial conditions values and the time step value using hull velocity free surface position inputs values by means of standard engineering formulas see ittc 2015 for the turbulence values a standard approach setting all the model parameters omega k and nut corresponding to a very low value of inlet turbulent intensity according to the towing tank experiment conditions has been adopted concerning the time step selection after testing the two options adaptive and fixed time step strategy we noticed that for sake of robustness the latter option was preferable and we designed therefore lincosim with fixed time step option to ensure courant number below one we perform an a priori analysis of the input we estimate and set a value of the integration time step to have courant at 0 5 at the end of the simulation we verify that the average value of the courant number along the simulation is not exceeding 1 0 in order to enable automatic stopping of the simulation a standardized criterion that ends the simulation when hull forces and or rigid body dynamics parameters are stabilized within a certain time window depending on the number of the degrees of freedom of the selected solver has been adopted in particular for the 0 dof solver the vertical and the axial forces components have been monitored while for the 1 dof and 2 dof solver the rigid body dynamics vertical and rotational velocity components have been controlled once the automatic stopping criteria arrested the simulation the post processing step is also automatically performed on the resulting final condition at the very end of the overall workflow a complete set of data of the hull at the final position is sampled for post processing including 3d hull pressure distribution 3d water and hull air water interface description 1d forces and momentum time history 1d rigid body dynamics time history final mesh distribution on three different orthogonal planes moreover data at the final equilibrium status of the hull need to be processed in order to extract relevant kpi for the designer user that will be therefore available for further analysis and data navigation thanks to the openfoam function objects data saving using the vtk file format is straightforward to perform and it has been implemented in lincosim the numerical data processing procedure for all the data is performed using python programming language see python software foundation 2020 oliphant 2006 langtangen 2009 and dedicated modules such as numpy see oliphant 2006 and vtk see schroeder et al 2006 in fig 6 a sample of some of the kpi available interactive panels from the lincosim gui is shown 3 results in order to evaluate lincosim results quality a set of analyses performed using the experimental data of the systematic series of bare planing hulls described in section 2 1 is given in particular we evaluated in this section of the paper as outcomes of main interest concerning the cfd workflow accuracy the comparison of main hydrodynamics quantities forces sink dynamic trim wetted surface area as calculated by cfd and measured by efd for the four hulls analyzing the whole froude range the comparison of derived hydrodynamics quantities such as the analysis of the pressure area stagnation and whisker spray area angles as calculated by cfd and measured by efd for the four hulls analyzing the available froude numbers in appendix c for the sake of completeness and as outcomes of secondary interest the n dof solvers comparison using two hulls mono and w3 at two velocity conditions 2 3 and 6 32 m s we compared the main hydrodynamics quantities forces sink dynamic trim differences by changing the number of degrees of freedom of the solver from zero to two the computational costs using two hulls mono and w3 at two velocity conditions 2 3 and 6 32 m s and the three solvers configurations we analyzed the time to results the scalability efficiency and the computational costs are instead analyzed using a single hull model mono at a single velocity condition 6 32 m s 3 1 solver accuracy main hydrodynamics quantities in order to evaluate solver accuracy main hydrodynamics quantities such as total drag sink dynamic trim and wetted surface area as calculated by cfd and measured by efd for the four hulls analyzing the whole froude range analyzed in begovic and bertorello 2012 have been compared the plots shown in fig 7 give the comparison for each hull of numerically calculated and the respective measured values including the experimental uncertainty bandwidth when available using the froude number value as the x axis the plots of the selected quantity for all four hulls together using the froude number as x axis and highlighting the three hydrodynamics behaviours experienced by the hull displacing semi planing and planing are reported in fig 8 3 2 solver accuracy derived hydrodynamics quantities in addition to the analysis of the directly measured values presented in the previous section we also analyzed a set of derived quantities such as the stagnation line angle αsl and whisker spray area angle αws these values are obtainable from experimental data by performing additional post processing of the acquired reference images during the experimental session as explained in begovic and bertorello 2012 in this paper the procedure used for the evaluation of the pressure area stagnation line angle and whisker spray area angle has been applied also to cfd images in order to obtain their numerical counterpart in fig 9 the main steps of the image processing procedure used to assess the two angles of interest starting from efd data left column and from cfd data right column are shown both sets of photos and figures refer to the monohedral hull at speed 4 6 m s and froude number equal to 1 06 as shown in fig 9 to calculate the pressure area stagnation line angle and whisker spray area angle the rhinoceros software has been used for the purpose of this work only the projected angles αsl and αws are considered as shown in panel f of fig 9 the obtained angle values for all hulls are plotted in figs 10 and 11 while in fig 12 the ratio of the two angles is presented 4 discussion the main aim of this work was to evaluate the reliability of the automatic workflow design in lincosim or more in general to establish to which extent an automated cfd workflow can be adopted today to perform a reliable hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls the evaluation of an automated cfd workflow has been performed for a systematic series made of four planing hulls previously studied in froude number range from 0 2 to 1 73 using standard efd facilities a complete set of quantitative and qualitative hydrodynamic key parameters has been compared to assess this main question the results presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 show that thanks to standardization and automation the virtualized tool is able to correctly predict the trends of all the four hulls in the whole froude number range for some relevant values of the froude number range the cfd outcomes are within the experimental uncertainty bound see figs 8 and 9 in other words this case study shows that by using lincosim a designer user will be able to correctly compare and rank the different hydrodynamics performances of the four planing hulls the effect of the hull form changing on hydrodynamic performances measured in experiments total drag sinkage and dynamic trim is correctly matched by cfd data analyzing also the results on some selected derived quantities such as pressure area stagnation line angle and the whisker spray area angle shown in figs 10 and 11 we can highlight that these derived quantities are also well caught by cfd compared to efd trends within the complete systematic series as shown in fig 12 for all hulls and all investigated speeds the value of the ratio of the two analyzed angles is lower than 2 0 for both efd and cfd datasets it also can be seen that the ratio of two stagnation lines angles for the monohedral hull and w1 are showing a small variation from 1 3 to 1 6 with respect to w2 and w3 hulls more in general we can state that this ratio in both efd and cfd data is decreasing with the increasing of the deadrise angle for froude number up to one considering also this set of comparisons based on derived quantities it can be appreciated that not only the integral values computed to assess the quantitative indices agree but also the qualitative visual aspects of the hull attitude and of the wave patterns agree the main conclusion is that cfd and efd techniques not only allow to find similar trends in the global quantities of interest but also measure the underlying physical dynamics of the phenomenon in a similar way in other words the two measurement tools are nearly equivalent for the studied set of hulls and this is true in particular from a design stage perspective where the most important aspect is correctly reproducing the trends of the dynamics and of the results once agreed that cfd and efd are two equivalent measurement tools for this set of planing hulls we can take advantage of the possibility to obtain no matter which information from cfd and get a better insight about the contribution of the drag components to total drag in the whole froude number range in fig 13 on the top and bottom panels the two drag contributions for all four hulls along the whole froude number range are plotted highlighting displacement semi planing and hydrodynamic planing regimes it is clear that pressure drag changes are driven by the dynamic trim value central panel of fig 13 by means of a direct linear correlation and independently from the froude number value instead the viscous drag is completely independent of the dynamic trim trends and is driven by the froude number value by means of a power correlation the viscous contribution in the whole froude range is quite similar for all the four hulls and only within the fully planing regime the differences became appreciable showing that for larger deadrise angles this contribution is larger another relevant point as shown in fig 14 is that the percentage contribution to total drag is similar for all the four hulls along the froude number explored range during the displacing phase the hulls drag is mainly due to pressure forces contribution 70 80 while viscous forces became significantly relevant 60 only during the fully planing phase during the semi planing phase there is a clear constant shift of the balance between the two contributions from pressure to viscous as the froude number increases notably the same standardized workflow is adopted for every hull at every velocity condition so that either the mesh is topologically standardized either the stopping criteria and the solver setup are coherent allowing for safe data comparison of different hulls at different flow conditions considering also the result presented in appendix c concerning the performances and computational costs of the two other solvers we can say that the 1 dof free of sink only and the captive ones are in strong agreement with the 2 dof solver see table c1 a relevant amount of computational time saving of about 50 70 see table c2 can be achieved when some degree of freedom can be excluded the possibility to use an optimal number of computational cores see table c3 without bothering for licensing limitations that for cfd commercial solver at the increased number of cores can be extremely severe is one of the main advantages freely provided by the adoption of our totally open source software stack workflow there are several limitations on the proposed tool that prevent its use to study every kind of hulls before a complete validation on a wider group of hulls can be performed concerning the meshing strategy adopted with a yplus value driven by the froude number we underline that the bandwidth selected to define the three hull behaviour regions displacing semi planing and planing can be modified since there is no accordance in the literature on the unique definition of the froude number value at which the hull is becoming semi planing or fully planing in the present validation work we faced only hulls at a model scale with full scale hulls the meshing schema should work but it must be confirmed by performing dedicated validations extreme cases in terms of hull velocity will affect both the froude number and the reynolds number and they must be tested to understand the robustness of the proposed meshing topology schema concerning the usage of the komegasst turbulence model and wall functions the selection has been made in order to have the most general robust and easy to define setup keeping valid the ability of the selected model to capture flow separations recirculating zones and complex tridimensional flow patterns see menter 1994 unfortunately it is known that the selected model like all other one and two equations turbulence models families is unable to capture the transition of the flow whenever it would occur along the hull see stern et al 2015 on the other hand more recent models including a larger set of equations and constants like kklomega for instance see fürst 2013 even if able to catch the flow transition are very sensitive to the wall function arrangement and to internal model constant calibration in particular the omega wall function which tends to delay the transition until the very back of the hull therefore the location of transition is quite sensitive to the choice of wall functions and the other wall boundary conditions limiting robustness and generality which makes tuning especially difficult from our generic point of view moreover this family of models is a low re model requiring the near wall cell to have a yplus value below 5 ideally below 1 which is very expensive for hull calculations due to the very high reynolds numbers involved another possibility to enhance the viscous drag contribution when needed would be to use higher levels of inlet turbulence instead the main problem with inlet turbulence is it tends to decay in the region upstream of the hull again there are ways to alter the models to avoid the undesired decay but they are quite complex and currently not available in openfoam concerning wall roughness treatment we had a very low reference value from the hull model scale builder that would be easily usable by the cfd solver nevertheless we decided to keep a zero roughness cfd modelling perfectly smooth hull surface for this first validation in the future we might also add this experimental value when available into the set of input and see if the cfd and efd comparison will show any further improvement 5 conclusions in conclusion we believe that the results presented herein support the concept that by means of standardization and automation of a well defined workflow it is possible to separate cfd knowledge based complexities from cfd data benefits obtaining a valuable virtualized version of more traditional measuring systems in this perspective lincosim by integrating cfd open source libraries web ui technologies database management paradigms and hpc infrastructure deploy presents an interesting level of innovation in the field of application even if each single technological brick is not new itself we believe that new applications like lincosim will possibly provide new standards for the next generation of engineers and designers credit authorship contribution statement raffaele ponzini writing original draft

requests appendix a web application front end design and usage lincosim s main concept is to allow the end user i e the designer user to focus almost exclusively on the physical case under examination leaving all other activities driven by an automatic workflow fully transparent to the user a brief discussion of the basic elements of the platform architecture as sketched in fig a1 is presented in the forthcoming fig a1 sketch of lincosim architecture with main roles involved fig a1 from a technological point of view the automation of high accuracy cfd simulations is far from a simple task in a typical scenario it is a matter of automatically reproducing a complex series of related tasks in which normally the human contribution is considerable involving in addition to the physics of the hydrodynamics problem to be simulated six basic ingredients cad positioning and meshing cfd solver setup data processing and visualization high performance computing clusters usage database management integration scripting for automation and job control the management of these competence areas requires broad spectrum skills not always owned by the same person or group this lack of competences is probably a reason why often in typical human based workflows despite their usefulness databases and integration scripts are not used at all in order to achieve automation the first step was the standardization of a case to be simulated i e to define the set of data from which the platform is able to build and execute the entire workflow the standardized lincosim data set is primarily composed of some physical quantities hull mass hull center of gravity hull moments of inertia hull speed water temperature draft initial estimated trim angle initial estimated this set joins the geometry of the hull to be loaded and the choice of the simulation setup among a series of predefined proposals each simulation setup corresponds to a different workflow with particular features e g captive 1 degree of freedom or 2 degrees of freedom and potentially employing different software stack for the fluid dynamics simulations at the moment lincosim works only with openfoam as a solver but the architecture makes it possible to connect other applications of this kind the only access point for the designer user is the web browser by means of the application front end this is a key benefit of the lincosim platform with respect to portability and usability since no software has to be installed on the designer user machine except for a very common web browser the web application is organized into two main sections geometries and simulations in the geometry section it is possible to load the triangulated surface stl obj of the hull to be simulated upon loading automatic validation of the surface is performed and if successful the geometry is displayed and made available when creating a simulation a navigable table allows the convenient and orderly management of the geometry database in the simulation section it is possible to create a simulation by choosing one of the valid geometry from a drop down list of validated geometries the simulation setup from a drop down list of available setups the hpc cluster to be used from a drop down list of available machines the set of the input physical parameters defined above once the simulation request is created it is possible to submit a single simulation or even a range of simulations in which one of the input parameters varies in a given range using a certain number of given steps if the simulation ends successfully otherwise an intelligible error is displayed the results are accessible from the simulation web page in the form of tables and several 1d 2d and 3d charts that propose the results in a form of direct interest for the designer user in addition there is a summary table that allows the user to search and access the database of the simulations according to a group based authorization logic it is also possible to request comparative graphs of the results of the simulations e g resistance vs speed of the hull or parallel coordinates comparisons for decision making notably all simulations data can be downloaded for further analysis in vtk file format csv file format or images depending on the nature of the data the front end communicates to the back end web services which manage the database the search engine and interact with the workload managers of the different hpc clusters configured to launch the simulations the submitted jobs perform the workflow defined by the selected simulation setup a simulation setup is commonly driven by one or more python scripts that starting from the input set of data perform automatically pre processing meshing solving and post processing of the data the building logic of a simulation setup will be discussed in the next section for any further technical detail on the lincosim architecture and implementation refer to salvadore and ponzini 2019 appendix b mesh sensitivity analysis when dealing with possible changes of the mesh cell sizes keeping the mesh topology fixed we can decide to act on the external cells only on the boundary layer cells only on both of them the verification and validation methodology for instance the richardson extrapolation method suggests modifying both of them by reducing all the cells length size by a constant factor ideally 2 to quantify the changes of the relevant differential parameters to establish what is the convergence ratio if any of each monitored quantity the meshing automation determines the positioning of the layers surrounding the hull in order to reach an estimated yplus close to a prescribed value it is clear that this value will be achieved within some approximation range and in any case only on average as the actual values of yplus at the different points of the hull depend on the actual conditions of the fluid solution of the simulation by way of example fig b1 a b and c show the yplus values as extracted from simulation results corresponding to average values of 69 42 and 10 respectively these behaviours are shown as trends against the axial abscissa for cuts at different distances from the plane of symmetry of the hull all in all the trends show important deviations from the average yplus values mainly related to the points of greatest over under velocity of the flow with respect to the average speed of the hull given this variability it is expected that the turbulence model wall functions will work in a non uniform fashion and this circumstance will produce effects on the final solution that are very difficult to accurately predict fig b1 plot over longitudinal lines at different location of the hull width for three w3

convergence for drag and sink and a non convergent pattern for trim w3 hull shows a monotonous convergence for the drag and for the sink and an oscillatory convergence for the dynamic trim value there are several common traits in the two hulls mesh sensitivity data the sink and the resistance are quite good the trim is the more problematic quantity it is anyway worthwhile underlining that the trim is always the most critical quantity to assess numerically especially when large changes are present as for planing hulls in our view for all quantities we see that the error between cfd and efd is limited and included within the uncertainty of the numerical data that is below 2 for the mono hull and below 9 for w3 vice versa we found it is more meaningful to show how variations of the external cell i e keeping a fixed value of the yplus set are not related to relevant variations in the accuracy of the solution this last approach summarized in table b2 is in our view more meaningful to show how the rans cfd modeling proposed is robust in estimating the different kpis being this last feature one of our main targets in fact lincosim is devised to support early performance hull evaluation and our main target is to support a correct and standardized ranking between different hull designs under the same flow conditions table b 2 mesh sensitivity to cell size at yplus give table mono and

in this section two different hulls mono and w3 at two velocity conditions 2 3 and 6 32 m s equivalent to froude numbers of 0 53 and 1 46 and their main hydrodynamic quantities differences after changing the solver number of degree of freedom from zero to two the model solver main parameters information and the results of the different configurations are given in table c1 with their reference efd data in this set of tests we have to compare from 2 dof to 1 dof drag and sinkage since the dynamic final trim is given and fixed from 2 dof to 0 dof drag since both the sinkage and the dynamic final trim are given and fixed notably the impact of changes of the three solver n dof options on the fluid dynamics parameters is very limited as expected in fact by playing with the dof solver options we are just limiting the number of the allowed degree of freedom that the rigid body dynamics solver have all other cfd model parameters including the set of equations that we are solving is unchanged therefore moving from the 2 dof solver to the 1 dof solver option only free of sink if the user is able to provide a correct value for the trim the final sink value will be correctly found

this kind of application can take great advantage of an available hpc platform in many ways the availability of a large number of computational cores interconnected with high performance networks low latency large bandwidth allows for a split in the computation of the single hull cfd on a set of computational cores let s say hundreds and obtain a lower time to result specific scalability tests can be performed in order to exploit platforms benefits at best by determining the optimal number of mesh cells per computational core several simultaneous cfd runs can now be performed thanks to open source license modelling of the selected solver this technique can also be performed using other third party cfd software but requiring a potentially very large licensing budget thanks to our fully open source technology development policy and to the availability of hpc platforms it was possible to explore both the possibilities explained above in order to rank the optimal number of computational cores per mesh problem density a set of scalability tests fixing the given cfd problem has been performed changing only the reference cell size used to build the overall meshing topology

21739,computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling is a powerful tool to analyze complex hydrodynamics problems like flow around bluff bodies and their interactions including flow separation and reattachments where analytical formulas are not applicable nor reliable nevertheless a relevant limitation on the systematic adoption of automated cfd workflows for a given typology of problems is still present in this work the results of an automatic and web based application named lincosim specifically designed to perform automatic cfd modelling of planing hulls are presented the tool uses only open source software and deploys high performances computing infrastructures to take advantage of well established yet innovative technological bricks a detailed comparison for planing hull hydrodynamics analyses is performed in an automated fashion on a systematic series of four planing hulls previously studied experimentally over a wide range of froude numbers the numerical outcomes and the systematic series trends of total resistance sinkage dynamic trim and wetted surface area are compared with the measured experimental results this paper shows that today cfd automated workflows can be used to study planing hull hydrodynamics highlighting the fact that several innovative aspects involved in lincosim could have a strong impact on the way cfd tools are adopted in modern marine industrial design keywords lincosim planing hull hydrodynamics computational fluid dynamics cfd experimental fluid dynamics efd openfoam high performance computing hpc 1 introduction thanks to the evolving technologies in numerical libraries and hardware computational power the possibility of achieving high quality computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling for complex hydrodynamics problems not only at the research level but also during ordinary day by day industrial product design is today a matter of fact nevertheless the standard way of using cfd applications remains somehow linked to an old style single user approach in which also routine and repetitive activities involved in a standardized cfd model development process are performed ex novo each time adopting a well established workflow automation paradigm based on a priori knowledge of the physics involved in the solution of the specific problem many time consuming tasks can be avoided moreover there are several limiting factors on a wider diffusion of 3d computational models to perform virtual towing tank data acquiring related also to software licensing and hardware infrastructure costs as a result due to the necessary human time required to perform such activities and to the limitation driven by technical costs there is a limitation on the effective number of cfd models analyzed in the preliminary hull design phase as confirmed by reichel and minchev 2014 small design offices seldom rely on cfd and only a fraction of the world s fleet uses cfd generated trim optimization databases to save fuel in daily operations furthermore for complex hydrodynamic phenomena including sharp flow separation at the chine dry transom at design speed relatively high running trim and large pressure gradients at the stagnation line as for planing hulls correct numerical setup for reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations requires experienced users therefore the use of simple empirical methods like savitsky 1964 or ones based on regression analysis or artificial neural network ann is still a very common design practice as stated in dumortier et al 2019 in that work the authors monitored for 11 months a sample of 35 sar military boats plascoa 1650 tested in real conditions in the arcachon bay and compared with the power prediction tool ppt based on savitsky theory with some modifications for the aerodynamic drag determination the average of the differences for speed under 9 knots is 0 24 while in the whole speed range the differences are included in a more widespread range 13 63 22 3 a more comprehensive work by radojcic 2019 presents a detailed overview of the latest experimental data and available regression analysis based methods for planing hull resistance and propulsion prediction highlighting the limits of applicability of each systematic series or relative regression formula starting from the works of caponnetto 2001 and brizzolara and serra 2007 and accordingly to more recent ones see broglia and durante 2017 stern et al 2015 brizzolara and vernengo 2016 broglia and durante 2017 sukas et al 2017 khazaee et al 2019 judge et al 2020 niazmand bilandi et al 2020 he et al 2019 huang et al 2019 it has been shown and accepted that cfd is potentially a powerful tool to provide a robust and accurate virtualized measurement technique for planing hull problems as for the experimental fluid dynamics efd approaches when cfd is used to reproduce the experiment the limited evaluation of the key hull parameters impact on the knowledge of the hydrodynamic performances in the early design stage can bring a final sub optimal design involving unexpected power engine consumption or undesired high trim angles at a given velocity condition as underlined in gatin et al 2019 automation in a naval design application is of interest for cfd to effectively contribute to the shipping industry on a larger scale the example of automation of the entire process has been proposed for kriso container ship kcs jbc car carrier and naval ship dtmb 5512 leaving cfd specific parameters away from the user and reducing the need of highly skilled cfd engineer nevertheless there is not yet to our knowledge a vertical application that includes the automation of the overall cfd workflow allowing for interactive navigation of inputs and outputs taking advantage of web technologies high performance computing hpc servers and open source libraries except for lincosim as we already presented in salvadore and ponzini 2019 the lincosim web application is part of the lincoln project see lincoln consortium see lincoln consortium 2020 and is a vertical solution that includes a complete cfd rans computational workflow using a fully open source based software stack providing the possibility to transparently take advantage of state of the art hpc facilities in some way lincosim embodies the philosophy of workflow as a service wfaas as presented in several works korambath et al 2016 haocheng et al 2011 zill et al 2013 for different fields of application in other words lincosim is a platform which fully automatizes the complex workflow of hydrodynamic simulation allowing a user designer to perform and manage state of the art 3d rans cfd studies without the necessity of having cfd software competences nor having hpc skills to execute codes in feasible computing times the evaluation of such a transversal tool requires the necessity of defining and ranking a set of very different parameters related to a very different field of application a technical developer side platform accessibility and stability components integration and user group management b usability end user side end user experience in terms of usability c quality of results application to a given experimental case or set of cases of the computational tool d computational costs and time to results evaluation of costs for the end user in terms of time to result and hardware requirements points a and b presenting the lincosim tool and including usage statistics matured over 18 months of usage by three different designer groups working within the lincoln project have been described in salvadore et al 2019 in appendix a the main details about the platform implementation are given for sake of completeness the remaining points are still open and are the objective of the present paper concerning point c the application of the automated cfd solver applied to the case of bare planing hulls analysis is presented in detail a systematic series made of four planing hulls previously experimentally studied begovic and bertorello 2012 has been selected analyzing the hydrodynamic outcomes of two degrees of freedom dof solver available in lincosim spanning the same froude number range as performed during the experimental campaign concerning point d to have a complete understanding of the computational performances and costs of lincosim for a given reference case hull at a given velocity value we analyzed the best parallel performances achievable by the existing hpc platform considering three different types of solver setup by playing with the number of degree of freedom from zero to two the forthcoming of the paper is as follows in section materials and methods the reference experimental dataset and the automatic computational workflow are presented results section contains the workflow numerical outcomes compared to the experimental measures and the application time to result and costs the discussion section provides a deep qualitative comparison between efd and cfd data analyzing the possible interplay between towing tank outcomes and numerical ones by including possible limitations of the overall approach the conclusions section provide a well rounded closure of the paper considering possible new perspectives for naval architects and designers appendix a is dedicated to the description of technical details of the web application appendix b contains the verification analysis of the cfd model and the mesh sensitivity analysis of the proposed meshing procedure appendix c is dedicated to the technical details of the computational costs of the possible variations on the number of degrees of freedom used by the solver and of the scalability performances of the solver 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental reference dataset during the last decade much research efforts have been invested in the understanding of possible strategies useful to obtain resistance reduction for achieving the highest speed of fast planing hulls new systematic series of planing hull models have been tested experimentally in calm water in metcalf and faul 2005 and kowalyshyn and metcalf 2006 begovic and bertorello 2012 begovic et al 2013 kim et al 2013 de luca and pensa 2012 de luca and pensa 2017 also stepped hulls have been tested by taunton et al 2010 garland 2011 white et al 2012 lee et al 2014 de marco et al 2017 najafi et al 2019 furthermore some applications of the interceptors mansoori et al 2017 zou et al 2019 spray rails seo et al 2016 molchanov et al 2019 tunnels yousefi et al 2014 or forced ventilation on the bottom as in cucinotta et al 2017 and yang et al 2019 have been revisited both experimentally and numerically as a possible improvement of hydrodynamic performances all new experimental data provides improved quality of measured data due to better instrumentations known uncertainty and contemporary hull form design assuring better references for the designers as well as for the validation of numerical tools among them for the lincosim application validation the experimental data from the begovic and bertorello 2012 are chosen in the systematic series the only parameter is a longitudinal variation of the deadrise angle for four models all models have the same deadrise angle of 17 at 0 25l from the stern in fig 1 the hulls body plans are shown one model has the constant deadrise angle all along the length so called monohedral model mono and the three other have a linear variation of the deadrise angle along the model length obtaining only linear inclination of the chine line wi i 1 2 3 the peculiarity of the models is the transparent bottom that enables the photographing of the wetted surface during the experimental campaign and allows for advanced analysis in post processing as shown in the forthcoming of the paper tests in calm water have been performed in the range of froude numbers fr from 0 266 to 1 73 to perform meaningful cfd analysis also some relevant information of each hull studied in the series is necessary these sets of values as measured during the experimental campaign are reported in table 1 2 2 cfd modelling and automation the cfd workflow for ship hydrodynamics problems is made of four main elements schematically shown in fig 2 a pre processing the geometry description of the hull hull cad and the fluid dynamics conditions at which the hull has to be tested are used to define the computational grid in terms of extension and cells size cfd model setup the proper fluid properties initial and boundary conditions and rigid body dynamics constants are defined according to user inputs this stage defines also what kind of physics has to be solved and how in other words the model setup is the element of the workflow that defines what kind of experiment we want to virtualize in hull hydrodynamics studies there are three main types of tests that can be performed for calm waters conditions so called captive or zero degrees of freedom runs 0 dof or free sink runs 1 dof or free sink and trim runs 2 dof cfd model computing the cfd model is resolved using a desktop pc and or distributed parallel computers depending on mesh model size and desired time to solution post processing the cfd outcomes are processed to get an arbitrary set of key parameter indices kpi values tables plots and diagrams that are necessary to support a ranking of the hull performances and eventually support decision making designer s activity standardization and parametrization of the user s inputs are the two main bricks of the lincosim way of working in fig 2 b we represented the technical steps involved in the three main automated blocks that are domain definition and meshing cfd modelling and equation solving data processing and visualization from fig 2 c it is possible to understand how complex the solutions path can be and how within each intermediate step a set of necessary tests are made before the workflow can be considered eligible to evolve from one step to the next one this set of tests is synthesized into a single python function named evolve py containing a set of rules identified by the authors and based on their experience these rules are adopted to discern positive step completion sufficient to evolve to the next step from negative ones related to an early workflow stop with information reporting to the end user about the issue occurred the presence of this function is necessary due to the numbers of possible causes that can prevent the computational workflow to end with success on top of this list we have meshing issues the meshing step is by far the most critical step of the workflow since from this step depends most of our workflow success for this reason as discussed in the next sections of the paper and in appendix b we designed the meshing procedure to ensure the most robust outcome as possible in lincosim the computational back end of all these four workflow steps are designed using only open source libraries more precisely the cfd undergoing engine is developed using the openfoam toolbox version 6 0 see weller et al 1998 openfoam is a state of the art open source toolbox that enables to solve the 3d navier stokes equation including dynamic mesh motion n dof n 0 1 2 in a cost effective way the solution of hull hydrodynamics involves the solving procedure of a set of differential equations for a full 3d domain the incompressible navier stokes for two phases air water with interface tracking and capturing and the rigid body dynamics of the hull in equilibrium under the effect of gravity hull mass hydrodynamic forces drag lift and moment must be solved to get information about the hull hydrodynamics values proper numerical schemes and solver setup of all these equations are already included and available for direct usage in the openfoam as the standard solver in our automated workflow a fixed numerical solver setup for all our computations was kept as standard in particular the standard interdymfoam rans solver equipped with komegasst turbulence model see menter 1994 was used and wall functions selecting very standard boundary conditions for the numerical patches are defined in table 2 for the rigid body dynamics solver we used the newmark solver selecting the velocity integration coefficient equal to 0 5 and the position integration coefficient equal to 0 25 therefore in lincosim the cfd modelling parametrization refers only to the domain definition the meshing procedure the rigid body dynamics settings the turbulence and the initial conditions definition in this way a sort of standardized setup is available for a given type of numerical experiment able to scale up and down with the hull size and adjust other parameters with hull hydrodynamics working conditions more in detail the user input used to automate the preprocessing step is the cad geometry input file the water temperature the hull velocity the estimated wave height on the hull and the free surface position the hull length lx defines the computational domain extension parametrization as shown in fig 3 the computational domain meshing is performed by parametrizing a well defined successive refinement procedure as given by the openfoam developers see cfd direct ltd 2020 for marine hydrodynamics problems see also ponzini and penza 2015 starting from the overall domain extension a set of nested successive box refinements together with a free surface refinement region and with further hull surface refinements are performed taking advantage of the free surface input value the dimension of the reference external mesh region cell is defined to match a target mesh cell size on the hull surface necessary to well describe the physical boundary layer region the boundary layer region is instead defined taking into account water temperature and hull velocity information using the ittc international towing tank conference formula for boundary layer thickness evaluation see ittc 2015 the number of mesh layers to be used to discretize the desired boundary layer thickness is adjusted automatically to reach a target yplus value while in theory see menter et al 1994 menter 1994 the optimal average yplus value should be set between 30 and 300 accordingly to the type of wall functions used we found that using our solver setup we would be able to obtain better results using a dynamic value of yplus linking its value to the froude number as shown in fig 4 in practice while setting up the meshing strategy for w3 hull the wall function performances have been tested for each froude number and compared against the experimental data as shown in fig 4 a during this set of tests all the meshing parameters were kept constant except for the yplus value we tested four meshes three with fixed yplus for all froude numbers with values of 30 50 and 150 and one with a dynamic yplus value changing with the froude number as shown in fig 4 b from the plots in fig 4 a it can be noticed that the variation of the drag differences with respect to the efd values are quite limited in the displacing and fully planing regions while they are becoming more prominent in the semi planing region using this meshing approach we were able to obtain a robust and general meshing strategy obtaining a reasonable number of cells size the final resulting mesh for a reference case hull with an average yplus value of 100 and a cell mesh size on the hull of about 0 05 m counts about 1 5 million cells for the semi hull and it is shown in fig 5 in appendix b table b1 for sake of completeness verification and validation set of data is given for two hulls mono and w3 at two different froude numbers using three meshes with a mesh cell length reduction factor of 1 4 moreover to show the robustness of our meshing strategy in table b2 also the sensitivity analysis to changes on the background cell mesh size keeping the yplus value fixed on the same set of hulls at the same froude numbers is reported using five different meshes coherently with the wall functions specification as shown in table b2 fixing the value of the yplus and the number of layer used to discretize the physical boundary layer thickness there is a very low difference in terms of quantitative integral fluid dynamics values in adopting a finer or coarser mesh cell size at the far field position we selected to adopt a background mesh cell size that will ensure an average mesh size between 1 5 and 1 75 million cells for the half hull being this final mesh size coherent to a reasonable time to result at a given degree of parallelism as shown in table c2 finally the cfd model setup parametrization is performed using the input that defines the rigid body dynamics constants using inertia mass and cog position input values the water rheological properties using water temperature input value the initial conditions values and the time step value using hull velocity free surface position inputs values by means of standard engineering formulas see ittc 2015 for the turbulence values a standard approach setting all the model parameters omega k and nut corresponding to a very low value of inlet turbulent intensity according to the towing tank experiment conditions has been adopted concerning the time step selection after testing the two options adaptive and fixed time step strategy we noticed that for sake of robustness the latter option was preferable and we designed therefore lincosim with fixed time step option to ensure courant number below one we perform an a priori analysis of the input we estimate and set a value of the integration time step to have courant at 0 5 at the end of the simulation we verify that the average value of the courant number along the simulation is not exceeding 1 0 in order to enable automatic stopping of the simulation a standardized criterion that ends the simulation when hull forces and or rigid body dynamics parameters are stabilized within a certain time window depending on the number of the degrees of freedom of the selected solver has been adopted in particular for the 0 dof solver the vertical and the axial forces components have been monitored while for the 1 dof and 2 dof solver the rigid body dynamics vertical and rotational velocity components have been controlled once the automatic stopping criteria arrested the simulation the post processing step is also automatically performed on the resulting final condition at the very end of the overall workflow a complete set of data of the hull at the final position is sampled for post processing including 3d hull pressure distribution 3d water and hull air water interface description 1d forces and momentum time history 1d rigid body dynamics time history final mesh distribution on three different orthogonal planes moreover data at the final equilibrium status of the hull need to be processed in order to extract relevant kpi for the designer user that will be therefore available for further analysis and data navigation thanks to the openfoam function objects data saving using the vtk file format is straightforward to perform and it has been implemented in lincosim the numerical data processing procedure for all the data is performed using python programming language see python software foundation 2020 oliphant 2006 langtangen 2009 and dedicated modules such as numpy see oliphant 2006 and vtk see schroeder et al 2006 in fig 6 a sample of some of the kpi available interactive panels from the lincosim gui is shown 3 results in order to evaluate lincosim results quality a set of analyses performed using the experimental data of the systematic series of bare planing hulls described in section 2 1 is given in particular we evaluated in this section of the paper as outcomes of main interest concerning the cfd workflow accuracy the comparison of main hydrodynamics quantities forces sink dynamic trim wetted surface area as calculated by cfd and measured by efd for the four hulls analyzing the whole froude range the comparison of derived hydrodynamics quantities such as the analysis of the pressure area stagnation and whisker spray area angles as calculated by cfd and measured by efd for the four hulls analyzing the available froude numbers in appendix c for the sake of completeness and as outcomes of secondary interest the n dof solvers comparison using two hulls mono and w3 at two velocity conditions 2 3 and 6 32 m s we compared the main hydrodynamics quantities forces sink dynamic trim differences by changing the number of degrees of freedom of the solver from zero to two the computational costs using two hulls mono and w3 at two velocity conditions 2 3 and 6 32 m s and the three solvers configurations we analyzed the time to results the scalability efficiency and the computational costs are instead analyzed using a single hull model mono at a single velocity condition 6 32 m s 3 1 solver accuracy main hydrodynamics quantities in order to evaluate solver accuracy main hydrodynamics quantities such as total drag sink dynamic trim and wetted surface area as calculated by cfd and measured by efd for the four hulls analyzing the whole froude range analyzed in begovic and bertorello 2012 have been compared the plots shown in fig 7 give the comparison for each hull of numerically calculated and the respective measured values including the experimental uncertainty bandwidth when available using the froude number value as the x axis the plots of the selected quantity for all four hulls together using the froude number as x axis and highlighting the three hydrodynamics behaviours experienced by the hull displacing semi planing and planing are reported in fig 8 3 2 solver accuracy derived hydrodynamics quantities in addition to the analysis of the directly measured values presented in the previous section we also analyzed a set of derived quantities such as the stagnation line angle αsl and whisker spray area angle αws these values are obtainable from experimental data by performing additional post processing of the acquired reference images during the experimental session as explained in begovic and bertorello 2012 in this paper the procedure used for the evaluation of the pressure area stagnation line angle and whisker spray area angle has been applied also to cfd images in order to obtain their numerical counterpart in fig 9 the main steps of the image processing procedure used to assess the two angles of interest starting from efd data left column and from cfd data right column are shown both sets of photos and figures refer to the monohedral hull at speed 4 6 m s and froude number equal to 1 06 as shown in fig 9 to calculate the pressure area stagnation line angle and whisker spray area angle the rhinoceros software has been used for the purpose of this work only the projected angles αsl and αws are considered as shown in panel f of fig 9 the obtained angle values for all hulls are plotted in figs 10 and 11 while in fig 12 the ratio of the two angles is presented 4 discussion the main aim of this work was to evaluate the reliability of the automatic workflow design in lincosim or more in general to establish to which extent an automated cfd workflow can be adopted today to perform a reliable hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls the evaluation of an automated cfd workflow has been performed for a systematic series made of four planing hulls previously studied in froude number range from 0 2 to 1 73 using standard efd facilities a complete set of quantitative and qualitative hydrodynamic key parameters has been compared to assess this main question the results presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 show that thanks to standardization and automation the virtualized tool is able to correctly predict the trends of all the four hulls in the whole froude number range for some relevant values of the froude number range the cfd outcomes are within the experimental uncertainty bound see figs 8 and 9 in other words this case study shows that by using lincosim a designer user will be able to correctly compare and rank the different hydrodynamics performances of the four planing hulls the effect of the hull form changing on hydrodynamic performances measured in experiments total drag sinkage and dynamic trim is correctly matched by cfd data analyzing also the results on some selected derived quantities such as pressure area stagnation line angle and the whisker spray area angle shown in figs 10 and 11 we can highlight that these derived quantities are also well caught by cfd compared to efd trends within the complete systematic series as shown in fig 12 for all hulls and all investigated speeds the value of the ratio of the two analyzed angles is lower than 2 0 for both efd and cfd datasets it also can be seen that the ratio of two stagnation lines angles for the monohedral hull and w1 are showing a small variation from 1 3 to 1 6 with respect to w2 and w3 hulls more in general we can state that this ratio in both efd and cfd data is decreasing with the increasing of the deadrise angle for froude number up to one considering also this set of comparisons based on derived quantities it can be appreciated that not only the integral values computed to assess the quantitative indices agree but also the qualitative visual aspects of the hull attitude and of the wave patterns agree the main conclusion is that cfd and efd techniques not only allow to find similar trends in the global quantities of interest but also measure the underlying physical dynamics of the phenomenon in a similar way in other words the two measurement tools are nearly equivalent for the studied set of hulls and this is true in particular from a design stage perspective where the most important aspect is correctly reproducing the trends of the dynamics and of the results once agreed that cfd and efd are two equivalent measurement tools for this set of planing hulls we can take advantage of the possibility to obtain no matter which information from cfd and get a better insight about the contribution of the drag components to total drag in the whole froude number range in fig 13 on the top and bottom panels the two drag contributions for all four hulls along the whole froude number range are plotted highlighting displacement semi planing and hydrodynamic planing regimes it is clear that pressure drag changes are driven by the dynamic trim value central panel of fig 13 by means of a direct linear correlation and independently from the froude number value instead the viscous drag is completely independent of the dynamic trim trends and is driven by the froude number value by means of a power correlation the viscous contribution in the whole froude range is quite similar for all the four hulls and only within the fully planing regime the differences became appreciable showing that for larger deadrise angles this contribution is larger another relevant point as shown in fig 14 is that the percentage contribution to total drag is similar for all the four hulls along the froude number explored range during the displacing phase the hulls drag is mainly due to pressure forces contribution 70 80 while viscous forces became significantly relevant 60 only during the fully planing phase during the semi planing phase there is a clear constant shift of the balance between the two contributions from pressure to viscous as the froude number increases notably the same standardized workflow is adopted for every hull at every velocity condition so that either the mesh is topologically standardized either the stopping criteria and the solver setup are coherent allowing for safe data comparison of different hulls at different flow conditions considering also the result presented in appendix c concerning the performances and computational costs of the two other solvers we can say that the 1 dof free of sink only and the captive ones are in strong agreement with the 2 dof solver see table c1 a relevant amount of computational time saving of about 50 70 see table c2 can be achieved when some degree of freedom can be excluded the possibility to use an optimal number of computational cores see table c3 without bothering for licensing limitations that for cfd commercial solver at the increased number of cores can be extremely severe is one of the main advantages freely provided by the adoption of our totally open source software stack workflow there are several limitations on the proposed tool that prevent its use to study every kind of hulls before a complete validation on a wider group of hulls can be performed concerning the meshing strategy adopted with a yplus value driven by the froude number we underline that the bandwidth selected to define the three hull behaviour regions displacing semi planing and planing can be modified since there is no accordance in the literature on the unique definition of the froude number value at which the hull is becoming semi planing or fully planing in the present validation work we faced only hulls at a model scale with full scale hulls the meshing schema should work but it must be confirmed by performing dedicated validations extreme cases in terms of hull velocity will affect both the froude number and the reynolds number and they must be tested to understand the robustness of the proposed meshing topology schema concerning the usage of the komegasst turbulence model and wall functions the selection has been made in order to have the most general robust and easy to define setup keeping valid the ability of the selected model to capture flow separations recirculating zones and complex tridimensional flow patterns see menter 1994 unfortunately it is known that the selected model like all other one and two equations turbulence models families is unable to capture the transition of the flow whenever it would occur along the hull see stern et al 2015 on the other hand more recent models including a larger set of equations and constants like kklomega for instance see fürst 2013 even if able to catch the flow transition are very sensitive to the wall function arrangement and to internal model constant calibration in particular the omega wall function which tends to delay the transition until the very back of the hull therefore the location of transition is quite sensitive to the choice of wall functions and the other wall boundary conditions limiting robustness and generality which makes tuning especially difficult from our generic point of view moreover this family of models is a low re model requiring the near wall cell to have a yplus value below 5 ideally below 1 which is very expensive for hull calculations due to the very high reynolds numbers involved another possibility to enhance the viscous drag contribution when needed would be to use higher levels of inlet turbulence instead the main problem with inlet turbulence is it tends to decay in the region upstream of the hull again there are ways to alter the models to avoid the undesired decay but they are quite complex and currently not available in openfoam concerning wall roughness treatment we had a very low reference value from the hull model scale builder that would be easily usable by the cfd solver nevertheless we decided to keep a zero roughness cfd modelling perfectly smooth hull surface for this first validation in the future we might also add this experimental value when available into the set of input and see if the cfd and efd comparison will show any further improvement 5 conclusions in conclusion we believe that the results presented herein support the concept that by means of standardization and automation of a well defined workflow it is possible to separate cfd knowledge based complexities from cfd data benefits obtaining a valuable virtualized version of more traditional measuring systems in this perspective lincosim by integrating cfd open source libraries web ui technologies database management paradigms and hpc infrastructure deploy presents an interesting level of innovation in the field of application even if each single technological brick is not new itself we believe that new applications like lincosim will possibly provide new standards for the next generation of engineers and designers credit authorship contribution statement raffaele ponzini writing original draft

from the european union s horizon 2020 under grant agreement n 727982 and to the lincoln project partners that helped the development of the platform in the present form by means of suggestions and requests appendix a web application front end design and usage lincosim s main concept is to allow the end user i e the designer user to focus almost exclusively on the physical case under examination leaving all other activities driven by an automatic workflow fully transparent to the user a brief discussion of the basic elements of the platform architecture as sketched in fig a1 is presented in the forthcoming fig a1 sketch of lincosim architecture with main roles involved fig a1 from a technological point of view the automation of high accuracy cfd simulations is far from a simple task in a typical scenario it is a matter of automatically reproducing a complex series of related tasks in which normally the human contribution is considerable involving in addition to the physics of the hydrodynamics problem to be simulated six basic ingredients cad positioning and meshing cfd solver setup data processing and visualization high performance computing clusters usage database management integration scripting for automation and job control the management of these competence areas requires broad spectrum skills not always owned by the same person or group this lack of competences is probably a reason why often in typical human based workflows despite their usefulness databases and integration scripts are not used at all in order to achieve automation the first step was the standardization of a case to be simulated i e to define the set of data from which the platform is able to build and execute the entire workflow the standardized lincosim data set is primarily composed of some physical quantities hull mass hull center of gravity hull moments of inertia hull speed water temperature draft initial estimated trim angle initial estimated this set joins the geometry of the hull to be loaded and the choice of the simulation setup among a series of predefined proposals each simulation setup corresponds to a different workflow with particular features e g captive 1 degree of freedom or 2 degrees of freedom and potentially employing different software stack for the fluid dynamics simulations at the moment lincosim works only with openfoam as a solver but the architecture makes it possible to connect other applications of this kind the only access point for the designer user is the web browser by means of the application front end this is a key benefit of the lincosim platform with respect to portability and usability since no software has to be installed on the designer user machine except for a very common web browser the web application is organized into two main sections geometries and simulations in the geometry section it is possible to load the triangulated surface stl obj of the hull to be simulated upon loading automatic validation of the surface is performed and if successful the geometry is displayed and made available when creating a simulation a navigable table allows the convenient and orderly management of the geometry database in the simulation section it is possible to create a simulation by choosing one of the valid geometry from a drop down list of validated geometries the simulation setup from a drop down list of available setups the hpc cluster to be used from a drop down list of available machines the set of the input physical parameters defined above once the simulation request is created it is possible to submit a single simulation or even a range of simulations in which one of the input parameters varies in a given range using a certain number of given steps if the simulation ends successfully otherwise an intelligible error is displayed the results are accessible from the simulation web page in the form of tables and several 1d 2d and 3d charts that propose the results in a form of direct interest for the designer user in addition there is a summary table that allows the user to search and access the database of the simulations according to a group based authorization logic it is also possible to request comparative graphs of the results of the simulations e g resistance vs speed of the hull or parallel coordinates comparisons for decision making notably all simulations data can be downloaded for further analysis in vtk file format csv file format or images depending on the nature of the data the front end communicates to the back end web services which manage the database the search engine and interact with the workload managers of the different hpc clusters configured to launch the simulations the submitted jobs perform the workflow defined by the selected simulation setup a simulation setup is commonly driven by one or more python scripts that starting from the input set of data perform automatically pre processing meshing solving and post processing of the data the building logic of a simulation setup will be discussed in the next section for any further technical detail on the lincosim architecture and implementation refer to salvadore and ponzini 2019 appendix b mesh sensitivity analysis when dealing with possible changes of the mesh cell sizes keeping the mesh topology fixed we can decide to act on the external cells only on the boundary layer cells only on both of them the verification and validation methodology for instance the richardson extrapolation method suggests modifying both of them by reducing all the cells length size by a constant factor ideally 2 to quantify the changes of the relevant differential parameters to establish what is the convergence ratio if any of each monitored quantity the meshing automation determines the positioning of the layers surrounding the hull in order to reach an estimated yplus close to a prescribed value it is clear that this value will be achieved within some approximation range and in any case only on average as the actual values of yplus at the different points of the hull depend on the actual conditions of the fluid solution of the simulation by way of example fig b1 a b and c show the yplus values as extracted from simulation results corresponding to average values of 69 42 and 10 respectively these behaviours are shown as trends against the axial abscissa for cuts at different distances from the plane of symmetry of the hull all in all the trends show important deviations from the average yplus values mainly related to the points of greatest over under velocity of the flow with respect to the average speed of the hull given this variability it is expected that the turbulence model wall functions will work in a non uniform fashion and this circumstance will produce effects on the final solution that are very difficult to accurately predict fig b1 plot over longitudinal lines at different location of the hull width for three w3 mesh at froude 0 53 a yplus averaged 69 b yplus averaged 42 c yplus averaged 10 fig b1 for the sake of completeness however we have run a mesh sensitivity analysis this analysis has been performed for

convergence for drag and sink and a non convergent pattern for trim w3 hull shows a monotonous convergence for the drag and for the sink and an oscillatory convergence for the dynamic trim value there are several common traits in the two hulls mesh sensitivity data the sink and the resistance are quite good the trim is the more problematic quantity it is anyway worthwhile underlining that the trim is always the most critical quantity to assess numerically especially when large changes are present as for planing hulls in our view for all quantities we see that the error between cfd and efd is limited and included within the uncertainty of the numerical data that is below 2 for the mono hull and below 9 for w3 vice versa we found it is more meaningful to show how variations of the external cell i e keeping a fixed value of the yplus set are not related to relevant variations in the accuracy of the solution this last approach summarized in table b2 is in our view more meaningful to show how the rans cfd modeling proposed is robust in estimating the different kpis being this last feature one of our main targets in fact lincosim is devised to support early performance hull evaluation and our main target is to support a correct and standardized ranking between different hull designs under the same flow conditions table b 2 mesh sensitivity to cell size at yplus give table mono and

in this section two different hulls mono and w3 at two velocity conditions 2 3 and 6 32 m s equivalent to froude numbers of 0 53 and 1 46 and their main hydrodynamic quantities differences after changing the solver number of degree of freedom from zero to two the model solver main parameters information and the results of the different configurations are given in table c1 with their reference efd data in this set of tests we have to compare from 2 dof to 1 dof drag and sinkage since the dynamic final trim is given and fixed from 2 dof to 0 dof drag since both the sinkage and the dynamic final trim are given and fixed notably the impact of changes of the three solver n dof options on the fluid dynamics parameters is very limited as expected in fact by playing with the dof solver options we are just limiting the number of the allowed degree of freedom that the rigid body dynamics solver have all other cfd model parameters including the set of equations that we are solving is unchanged therefore moving from the 2 dof solver to the 1 dof solver option only free of sink if the user is able to provide a correct value for the trim the final sink value will be correctly found by the solver and all other cfd outcomes will be comparable to the outcomes obtained with a more general solver moving from the 2 dof solver to the 0 dof solver option hull is under captive condition if the user is able to provide a correct value for the sink and the trim all the cfd outcomes will be comparable to the outcomes obtained with a more general solver table c1 ndof solver analysis

this kind of application can take great advantage of an available hpc platform in many ways the availability of a large number of computational cores interconnected with high performance networks low latency large bandwidth allows for a split in the computation of the single hull cfd on a set of computational cores let s say hundreds and obtain a lower time to result specific scalability tests can be performed in order to exploit platforms benefits at best by determining the optimal number of mesh cells per computational core several simultaneous cfd runs can now be performed thanks to open source license modelling of the selected solver this technique can also be performed using other third party cfd software but requiring a potentially very large licensing budget thanks to our fully open source technology development policy and to the availability of hpc platforms it was possible to explore both the possibilities explained above in order to rank the optimal number of computational cores per mesh problem density a set of scalability tests fixing the given cfd problem has been performed changing only the reference cell size used to build the overall meshing topology
