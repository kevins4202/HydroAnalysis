development and reproduction after subtraction of costs for maturity maintenance ṗj the abj model is used for the small yellow croaker as most fish species exhibit the metabolic acceleration during the early development stages e g augustine et al 2011 kooijman 2014 lika et al 2014 a model is named abj model because such acceleration occurs between birth and metamorphosis kooijman 2014 marques et al 2018 the isomorphic individual switches to the v1 morphic mode in which the surface area grows proportionally to structural volume the metabolic acceleration accommodates change of shape which reflects the increase of length approximately exponentially with age therefore the development of the species accords with metabolic acceleration as individuals change their shapes during early developmental stages through to metamorphosis into an adult shape kooijman 2014 lika et al 2014 the stage transitions occur when the cumulative investment into maturation eh exceeds certain thresholds eh b for birth eh j for metamorphosis and eh p for puberty an organism does not feed and reproduce at the embryo stage at the maturity threshold from birth an individual reaches its juvenile stage and begins to feed but does not reproduce maturity maintenance increases with maturity level until puberty when an individual reaches the adult stage the energy reserves for reproduction start to build up in a reproduction buffer being the difference between energy allocation for reproduction and maturity maintenance costs according to deb theory the rates of feeding and energy assimilation from food follows type ii functional response as 1 f x x x k where x is food density in the environment and xk is the half saturation constant if f 0 a fish takes no energy from environment if f 1 the steady state of energy reserve density is maximal and is denoted by em all physiological processes depend on temperature which follows the arrhenius equation this equation can be extended to include quantitative formulation for the reduction of rates at low and high temperatures see kooijman 2010 because comprehensive physiological datasets are not available for the small yellow croaker to estimate parameters outside the temperature tolerance range we only used the basic arrhenius relationship to calculate temperature effect on rate changes this simplification is unlikely to compromise

30 and 50 of the weight during some starvation periods over the course of a year bystrӧm et al 2006 paul et al 1998 it would be appropriate to assume that a combination of somatic and gonad reserves contribute to 50 of the total weight based on observational data yan et al 2006 li et al 2011 the shape coefficient was estimated to be 0 19 the first maturation age of small yellow croaker is less than one year yan et al 2014 and the reproductive cycle has shown that the gonad started to develop in january lim et al 2010 this corresponds to an age and length at puberty of 240 days and 7 0 cm respectively the length at age data were obtained from fisheries surveys in yellow and east china seas yan et al 2006 because the comprehensive data for weight at age were not available from any one publication the weight was back calculated from length and weight relationship yan et al 2006 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2010b fecundity data were obtained from a few observations shui 2000 yan et al 2006 zhang et al 2010a without a direct observation for wet weight at birth it was calculated from egg size prior to hatching lou et al 2016 zhan et al 2016 2 3 parameter estimation the model parameters were estimated following amp procedure marques et al 2019 three types of datasets are required for parameterisation including zero variate data univariate data and pseudo data the zero variate and univariate data are from observations the zero variate data are the observed single data points across life stages at known temperatures which are general physical characteristics in the development stages of small yellow croaker the available data include age at birth when larvae start to feed age since birth at puberty when they start to reproduce and the life span the univariate data are typically a set of observations for an individual in the form of independent i e time and dependent i e length variables in our model these data are age length and age weight which were obtained from a combination of both observed and back calculated age length relationships shui 2003 yan et al 2006 zhang et al 2010a the fecundity data were obtained from a few publications yan et al 2006 zhang et al 2010a li et al 2011 pseudo data provide prior information on the value of certain primary parameters lika and kooijman 2011 pseudo data can play several roles including defining the area of the parameter space where the parameter values are reasonable marques et al 2019 the pseudo data mainly consist of parameters including energy conductance ὺ allocation coefficient κ volume specific somatic maintenance ṗm the fraction of allocated energy to growth which is fixed in structure κg and maturity maintenance rate coefficient kj the parameter estimation consists of simultaneously minimizing the deviation of the model from the above data through the nelder mead simplex method to find the global minimum of the loss function 7 f i 1 n j 1 n i w i j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 where j is the data points in set ni wij is the weight of dataset di is the mean of the data and pi is the mean of the prediction the overall goodness of fit is assessed with mean relative error mre and symmetric mean squared error smse goodness of fit of the model predictions was assessed with relative error estimates for each zero variate data point and univariate data set marques et al 2019 the completeness of available data can be ranked with marks from low to high 0 to 10 using the completeness scale lika et al 2011 we assigned a completeness mark of 2 7 to the available data of small yellow croaker 2 4 study area and data for model application the model was applied to simulating energetics of the small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas where are its main habitat areas fig 2 the geographic distribution areas vary seasonally for which detailed descriptions are available in literature chen et al 2010 shan et al 2016 briefly small yellow croaker is mainly distributed in the near coastal area during spawning in spring in summer it migrates to the feeding grounds of inshore waters of the yellow sea and east china sea when temperature decreases from late autumn it migrates into the wintering ground in the deeper water in the southern yellow sea and east china sea the time series data for food density are one of the most important variables driving energetics of an organisms the small yellow croaker consumes a wide variety of different organisms analysis of stomach contents has shown that small yellow croaker consumes over thirty prey species belonging to three major groups including pisces thryssa kammalensi engraulis japonicus collichthys fragilis crustacea and zooplankters jin 1996 xue et al 2004 yan et al 2006 lin 2007 guo et al 2010 shan et al 2014 although there were temporal variations in abundance of each prey species overall food availability for small yellow croaker showed a seasonal cycle xue et al 2004 lowest biomass of total prey species occurred from late autumn to early spring the abundance of prey species increased from middle spring to early summer the food is most abundant in summer and autumn in addition the diet composition of small yellow croaker showed a large variation among studies analysis of stomach contents has shown that pisces contributed over 60 to the diet of small yellow croaker in yellow sea followed by crustacea which contributed over 30 jin 1996 this is consistent with the report that pisces and crustacea contributed 55 and 45 respective to the diet of small yellow croaker in east china sea however other study showed that crustacea contributed the most 70 to the diet of small yellow croaker whereas pisces contributed approximately 20 xue et al 2004 although these studies provided general information for spatial and temporal variations of prey species composition it is not possible to obtain time series food biomass for small yellow croaker from the published form of data alternatively we compiled biomass information for some of most abundant prey species and constructed a food index based on a weighted sum of the available data fig 3 this food index is used to calculate the functional response f eq 1 the growth data collected from yellow and east china seas were used for comparison between observed and modelled trajectories ren et al 2001 lin et al 2006 zhang et al 2010b fecundity was taken from literature ren et al 2001 zeng et al 2005 yan et al 2014 temperature is another input variable of the deb model there have been several previous studies on temperature in the yellow and east china seas qiu et al 1989 tang et al 1989 ju and xiong 2013 however most of these studies reported quarterly values of temperature monthly temperature values were only available in qiu et al 1989 these data were used for our model input fig 3 the highest temperature occurred in late summer and early autumn whereas the lowest temperature occurred in late winter and early spring 2 5 model application after estimation of parameter values the deb model was then coded in r and the desolve package used to conduct model simulations it was run for four years which corresponds with the available growth and fecundity data of the small yellow croaker the structural length is calculated as l v 1 3 the measurable length lw for a fish is related to the structural length l and is calculated by lw l δm with δm being the shape coefficient the body mass quantified as wet weight ww is the sum of structure v reserve e and energy reserve for reproduction er with necessary conversion coefficients between units 8 w w e κ r e r e j v d v w where ej is energy content of wet reserve j g 1 dvw is the energy density of wet structure which is assumed to be 1 g cm3 fecundity depends on energy reserves in the reproductive buffer er it is assumed that the energy for individual eggs is uniform in all ages the small yellow croaker spawns once a year jin 1996 ren et al 2001 spawning is triggered when the temperature rises to 12 c lin et al 2008a 2008b the reproduction buffer is emptied at spawning 3 results 3 1 model parameters with amp procedure the result of the predicted zero variate values for small yellow croaker are listed in table 2 the predicted and default parameters at a reference temperature of 20 c are presented in table 3 amp collect 2019 the parameter estimation resulted in acceptable goodness of fit with both mre and smse values of 0 083 the model adequately captures most of the observed values including the age at birth life span and wet weight however the model overestimates the ultimate length the maximum reproduction rate and gonado somatic index are overestimated the mismatches may have been due to uncertainties in observations sampling error which will be discussed in a later section 3 2 simulation results the model could successfully reproduce the growth of small yellow croaker the simulated length and weight at age of the individual are consistent with the observed and back calculated values fig 4 the length and weight are slightly overestimated for the 1 year old these mismatches may have been caused by uncertainty of either observation or and back calculated values because the observed values of both length and weight show large heterogeneity the growth shows seasonal variation which reflects food availability and temperature the fastest growth seasons were in spring through autumn the combination of low temperature and food index resulted in a decrease of body weight and no growth in length in some of the winter period this was due to the energy uptake from the environment being less than the energy spent on maintenance and gonad development spawning caused sharp declines in weight and was triggered by temperature at 12 c during april to may which is consistent with observations ren et al 2001 lou et al 2016 the simulated fecundity matches the observation reasonably well fig 5 the modelled fecundity was 4500 27 000 51 000 and 77 000 eggs respectively in ages 1 2 3 and 4 which was close to the average fecundity when length was converted into age using the age length relationship by zhang et al 2010a 4 discussion the deb model was parameterised for small yellow croaker to predict the uptake and utilisation of energy at the individual level under dynamic environmental conditions the model successfully reproduced the key features of growth and reproduction of small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas seasonal variations in growth reflected the dynamics of food density and temperature traditionally parameterisation of a deb model usually requires a large amount of physiological data van der veer et al 2006 ideally these data should be obtained from factorially designed experiments in which physiological rates are measured in individuals under a standard condition in controlled temperature ren and schiel 2008 for a typical fisheries species most studies are usually focused on biological and ecological characteristics there is general scarcity of comprehensive physiological measurements for many fisheries species in china seas for small yellow croaker lack of sufficient physiological information makes it impossible to estimate model parameters with traditional methods the development of the covariation method lika et al 2011 marques et al 2019 makes it possible to estimate parameters for species with limited physiological data such as the small yellow croaker because it requires minimal datasets from physiological measurements and mainly utilises observational data including zero variate univariate and pseudo data although the estimation of parameters in this study has shown promising results there are some differences between the observed and predicted values the source of data could have contributed to these uncertainties the maximum reproduction rate was much larger than the observation the observed value was obtained from fisheries survey data in 2000 shui 2000 the use of the largest value from the survey as the maximum reproduction rate could be only slightly representative for the population the overestimation of the gsi would reflect the stock dependent variation because this value was obtained from the stock off the korean peninsula lim et al 2010 studies on reproduction have shown some evidence that the fecundity of the species was higher in china seas than in korean coast ren et al 2001 lim et al 2010 verification of the difference in reproduction between stocks relies on further biological studies beyond the scope of the present investigation stomach analysis has shown that small yellow croaker feeds on over thirty prey species xue et al 2004 yan et al 2006 lin 2007 guo et al 2010 shan et al 2014 crustacea and pelagic fish species contribute most to the food density for small yellow croaker among the crustacea euphausiacea is the largest group of prey species there is strong temporal and spatial variation in the contribution of prey species to small yellow croaker food density for example in east china sea the contribution of crustacea to overall food consumption was 79 5 11 1 29 6 and 64 2 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively lin 2007 in the yellow sea however crustacea contributed 90 of the overall food consumed by small yellow croaker xue et al 2004 guo et al 2010 lack of a strong correlation between contribution of prey species in stomach contents and their relative abundance in the areas inhabited by small yellow croaker suggests that they selectively feed on some prey species in preferences to others xue et al 2004 in the present modelling exercise we used an overall index for food density due to a lack of comprehensive abundance information about prey species and the selective consumption by small yellow croaker the power of the model prediction could be improved through acquisition of quantitative data for spatial and temporal variation of prey species in the habitat occupied by small yellow croaker the deb model is applicable to the current population of small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas the set of parameter values may not be adequate for simulating its biological behaviour prior to the 1980s particularly during the 1950 1970s this is because the growth and population structure of small yellow croaker have undergone considerable changes over the past few decades despite interannual variations the growth rate of small yellow croaker has shown a continuous increase since the 1960s shan et al 2011 for example von bertalanffy growth rate was 0 17 1 d 1 in the late 1950s to 0 25 in the mid 1980s and to 0 45 in the early 2010s similarly the maturation age and length showed consistent decreases the length at the first maturation decreased from 14 to 16 cm in the 1950s to 13 cm in the 1980s it further dropped to 11 5 cm in the 1990s length at first maturation has been less than 10 cm in the last couple of decades with 1 year old individuals comprising the majority of spawners yan et al 2014 the reproductive characteristics have also changed with fecundity in small yellow croaker showing a consistent increase since the 1960s and having doubled by the 1990s yan et al 2014 fish may respond to overfishing and environmental changes with earlier maturation trippel 1995 gerritsen et al 2003 li et al 2011 the decrease in age and length at maturity of small yellow croaker could also be a consequence of density dependence johannessen et al 2001 heavy fishing pressure has led to evolutionary responses in fish maturation for some species law 2000 heino and godø 2002 ernande et al 2004 all these factors were likely to have contributed to the change of population characteristics over the last few decades the set of model parameters reflects the overall energetics and growth of small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas it was reported that there are a few stocks of the species in these waters including northern yellow sea and bohai stocks southern yellow sea stock and east china sea stock which have been determined by the spawning ground distribution liu 1962 jin et al 2005 morphological parameters lin et al 1964 and genetic analysis meng et al 2003 lin et al 2009 it is desirable to differentially estimate parameters and apply the model to different stocks of small yellow croaker as stock dependant variation of parameters was found in other species gatti et al 2017 however a lack of stock specific data prevented us from developing a few sets of parameters for the present study in conclusion small yellow croaker stocks in china have been heavily exploited and fishing effort has been above optimum levels chen et al 1997 shan et al 2011 zhang et al 2010a for the recovery of these fisheries stocks there is a need to develop a quantitative method that can be used effectively as a management guidance tool for optimum utilisation of the species currently the lack of appropriate tools for these stocks underscores the current need to assess fisheries resources more definitely and develop sustainable management strategies in the yellow and east china seas the present model is capable of simulating energetics and growth of small yellow croaker in the main geographic areas of the yellow and east chinas seas the model provides an important component for an individual based population model and is a first step toward the development of an effective management tool for the fisheries of small yellow croaker however future improvement of the model requires the refinement of stock specific parameters through the collection of appropriate data the arrhenius relationship needs to include the tolerance range for lower and upper boundaries of temperatures information on seasonal and spatial variations in abundance of prey species would also help improve the model predictions credit authorship contribution statement jeffrey s ren

respectively the length at age data were obtained from fisheries surveys in yellow and east china seas yan et al 2006 because the comprehensive data for weight at age were not available from any one publication the weight was back calculated from length and weight relationship yan et al 2006 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2010b fecundity data were obtained from a few observations shui 2000 yan et al 2006 zhang et al 2010a without a direct observation for wet weight at birth it was calculated from egg size prior to hatching lou et al 2016 zhan et al 2016 2 3 parameter estimation the model parameters were estimated following amp procedure marques et al 2019 three types of datasets are required for parameterisation including zero variate data univariate data and pseudo data the zero variate and univariate data are from observations the zero variate data are the observed single data points across life stages at known temperatures which are general physical characteristics in the development stages of small yellow croaker the available data include age at birth when larvae start to feed age since birth at puberty when they start to reproduce and the life span the univariate data are typically a set of observations for an individual in the form of independent i e time and dependent i e length variables in our model these data are age length and age weight which were obtained from a combination of both observed and back calculated age length relationships shui 2003 yan et al 2006 zhang et al 2010a the fecundity data were obtained from a few publications yan et al 2006 zhang et al 2010a li et al 2011 pseudo data provide prior information on the value of certain primary parameters lika and kooijman 2011 pseudo data can play several roles including defining the area of the parameter space where the parameter values are reasonable marques et al 2019 the pseudo data mainly consist of parameters including energy conductance ὺ allocation coefficient κ volume specific somatic maintenance ṗm the fraction of allocated energy to growth which is fixed in structure κg and maturity maintenance rate coefficient kj the parameter estimation consists of simultaneously minimizing the deviation of the model from the above data through the nelder mead simplex method to find the global minimum of the loss function 7 f i 1 n j 1 n i w i j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 where j is the data points in set ni wij is the weight of dataset di is the mean of the data and pi is the mean of the prediction the overall goodness of fit is assessed with mean relative error mre and symmetric mean squared error smse goodness of fit of the model predictions was assessed with relative error estimates for each zero variate data point and univariate data set marques et al 2019 the completeness of available data can be ranked with marks from low to high 0 to 10 using the completeness scale lika et al 2011 we assigned a completeness mark of 2 7 to the available data of small yellow croaker 2 4 study area and data for model application the model was applied to simulating energetics of the small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas where are its main habitat areas fig 2 the geographic distribution areas vary seasonally for which detailed descriptions are available in literature chen et al 2010 shan et al 2016 briefly small yellow croaker is mainly distributed in the near coastal area during spawning in spring in summer it migrates to the feeding grounds of inshore waters of the yellow sea and east china sea when temperature decreases from late autumn it migrates into the wintering ground in the deeper water in the southern yellow sea and east china sea the time series data for food density are one of the most important variables driving energetics of an organisms the small yellow croaker consumes a wide variety of different organisms analysis of stomach contents has shown that small yellow croaker consumes over thirty prey species belonging to three major groups including pisces thryssa kammalensi engraulis japonicus collichthys fragilis crustacea and zooplankters jin 1996 xue et al 2004 yan et al 2006 lin 2007 guo et al 2010 shan et al 2014 although there were temporal variations in abundance of each prey species overall food availability for small yellow croaker showed a seasonal cycle xue et al 2004 lowest biomass of total prey species occurred from late autumn to early spring the abundance of prey species increased from middle spring to early summer the food is most abundant in summer and autumn in addition the diet composition of small yellow croaker showed a large variation among studies analysis of stomach contents has shown that pisces contributed over 60 to the diet of small yellow croaker in yellow sea followed by crustacea which contributed over 30 jin 1996 this is consistent with the report that pisces and crustacea contributed 55 and 45 respective to the diet of small yellow croaker in east china sea however other study showed that crustacea contributed the most 70 to the diet of small yellow croaker whereas pisces contributed approximately 20 xue et al 2004 although these studies provided general information for spatial and temporal variations of prey species composition it is not possible to obtain time series food biomass for small yellow croaker from the published form of data alternatively we compiled biomass information for some of most abundant prey species and constructed a food index based on a weighted sum of the available data fig 3 this food index is used to calculate the functional response f eq 1 the growth data collected from yellow and east china seas were used for comparison between observed and modelled trajectories ren et al 2001 lin et al 2006 zhang et al 2010b fecundity was taken from literature ren et al 2001 zeng et al 2005 yan et al 2014 temperature is another input variable of the deb model there have been several previous studies on temperature in the yellow and east china seas qiu et al 1989 tang et al 1989 ju and xiong 2013 however most of these studies reported quarterly values of temperature monthly temperature values were only available in qiu et al 1989 these data were used for our model input fig 3 the highest temperature occurred in late summer and early autumn whereas the lowest temperature occurred in late winter and early spring 2 5 model application after estimation of parameter values the deb model was then coded in r and the desolve package used to conduct model simulations it was run for four years which corresponds with the available growth and fecundity data of the small yellow croaker the structural length is calculated as l v 1 3 the measurable length lw for a fish is related to the structural length l and is calculated by lw l δm with δm being the shape coefficient the body mass quantified as wet weight ww is the sum of structure v reserve e and energy reserve for reproduction er with necessary conversion coefficients between units 8 w w e κ r e r e j v d v w where ej is energy content of wet reserve j g 1 dvw is the energy density of wet structure which is assumed to be 1 g cm3 fecundity depends on energy reserves in the reproductive buffer er it is assumed that the energy for individual eggs is uniform in all ages the small yellow croaker spawns once a year jin 1996 ren et al 2001 spawning is triggered when the temperature rises to 12 c lin et al 2008a 2008b the reproduction buffer is emptied at spawning 3 results 3 1 model parameters with amp procedure the result of the predicted zero variate values for small yellow croaker are listed in table 2 the predicted and default parameters at a reference temperature of 20 c are presented in table 3 amp collect 2019 the parameter estimation resulted in acceptable goodness of fit with both mre and smse values of 0 083 the model adequately captures most of the observed values including the age at birth life span and wet weight however the model overestimates the ultimate length the maximum reproduction rate and gonado somatic index are overestimated the mismatches may have been due to uncertainties in observations sampling error which will be discussed in a later section 3 2 simulation results the model could successfully reproduce the growth of small yellow croaker the simulated length and weight at age of the individual are consistent with the observed and back calculated values fig 4 the length and weight are slightly overestimated for the 1 year old these mismatches may have been caused by uncertainty of either observation or and back calculated values because the observed values of both length and weight show large heterogeneity the growth shows seasonal variation which reflects food availability and temperature the fastest growth seasons were in spring through autumn the combination of low temperature and food index resulted in a decrease of body weight and no growth in length in some of the winter period this was due to the energy uptake from the environment being less than the energy spent on maintenance and gonad development spawning caused sharp declines in weight and was triggered by temperature at 12 c during april to may which is consistent with observations ren et al 2001 lou et al 2016 the simulated fecundity matches the observation reasonably well fig 5 the modelled fecundity was 4500 27 000 51 000 and 77 000 eggs respectively in ages 1 2 3 and 4 which was close to the average fecundity when length was converted into age using the age length relationship by zhang et al 2010a 4 discussion the deb model was parameterised for small yellow croaker to predict the uptake and utilisation of energy at the individual level under dynamic environmental conditions the model successfully reproduced the key features of growth and reproduction of small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas seasonal variations in growth reflected the dynamics of food density and temperature traditionally parameterisation of a deb model usually requires a large amount of physiological data van der veer et al 2006 ideally these data should be obtained from factorially designed experiments in which physiological rates are measured in individuals under a standard condition in controlled temperature ren and schiel 2008 for a typical fisheries species most studies are usually focused on biological and ecological characteristics there is general scarcity of comprehensive physiological measurements for many fisheries species in china seas for small yellow croaker lack of sufficient physiological information makes it impossible to estimate model parameters with traditional methods the development of the covariation method lika et al 2011 marques et al 2019 makes it possible to estimate parameters for species with limited physiological data such as the small yellow croaker because it requires minimal datasets from physiological measurements and mainly utilises observational data including zero variate univariate and pseudo data although the estimation of parameters in this study has shown promising results there are some differences between the observed and predicted values the source of data could have contributed to these uncertainties the maximum reproduction rate was much larger than the observation the observed value was obtained from fisheries survey data in 2000 shui 2000 the use of the largest value from the survey as the maximum reproduction rate could be only slightly representative for the population the overestimation of the gsi would reflect the stock dependent variation because this value was obtained from the stock off the korean peninsula lim et al 2010 studies on reproduction have shown some evidence that the fecundity of the species was higher in china seas than in korean coast ren et al 2001 lim et al 2010 verification of the difference in reproduction between stocks relies on further biological studies beyond the scope of the present investigation stomach analysis has shown that small yellow croaker feeds on over thirty prey species xue et al 2004 yan et al 2006 lin 2007 guo et al 2010 shan et al 2014 crustacea and pelagic fish species contribute most to the food density for small yellow croaker among the crustacea euphausiacea is the largest group of prey species there is strong temporal and spatial variation in the contribution of prey species to small yellow croaker food density for example in east china sea the contribution of crustacea to overall food consumption was 79 5 11 1 29 6 and 64 2 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively lin 2007 in the yellow sea however crustacea contributed 90 of the overall food consumed by small yellow croaker xue et al 2004 guo et al 2010 lack of a strong correlation between contribution of prey species in stomach contents and their relative abundance in the areas inhabited by small yellow croaker suggests that they selectively feed on some prey species in preferences to others xue et al 2004 in the present modelling exercise we used an overall index for food density due to a lack of comprehensive abundance information about prey species and the selective consumption by small yellow croaker the power of the model prediction could be improved through acquisition of quantitative data for spatial and temporal variation of prey species in the habitat occupied by small yellow croaker the deb model is applicable to the current population of small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas the set of parameter values may not be adequate for simulating its biological behaviour prior to the 1980s particularly during the 1950 1970s this is because the growth and population structure of small yellow croaker have undergone considerable changes over the past few decades despite interannual variations the growth rate of small yellow croaker has shown a continuous increase since the 1960s shan et al 2011 for example von bertalanffy growth rate was 0 17 1 d 1 in the late 1950s to 0 25 in the mid 1980s and to 0 45 in the early 2010s similarly the maturation age and length showed consistent decreases the length at the first maturation decreased from 14 to 16 cm in the 1950s to 13 cm in the 1980s it further dropped to 11 5 cm in the 1990s length at first maturation has been less than 10 cm in the last couple of decades with 1 year old individuals comprising the majority of spawners yan et al 2014 the reproductive characteristics have also changed with fecundity in small yellow croaker showing a consistent increase since the 1960s and having doubled by the 1990s yan et al 2014 fish may respond to overfishing and environmental changes with earlier maturation trippel 1995 gerritsen et al 2003 li et al 2011 the decrease in age and length at maturity of small yellow croaker could also be a consequence of density dependence johannessen et al 2001 heavy fishing pressure has led to evolutionary responses in fish maturation for some species law 2000 heino and godø 2002 ernande et al 2004 all these factors were likely to have contributed to the change of population characteristics over the last few decades the set of model parameters reflects the overall energetics and growth of small yellow croaker in the yellow and east china seas it was reported that there are a few stocks of the species in these waters including northern yellow sea and bohai stocks southern yellow sea stock and east china sea stock which have been determined by the spawning ground distribution liu 1962 jin et al 2005 morphological parameters lin et al 1964 and genetic analysis meng et al 2003 lin et al 2009 it is desirable to differentially estimate parameters and apply the model to different stocks of small yellow croaker as stock dependant variation of parameters was found in other species gatti et al 2017 however a lack of stock specific data prevented us from developing a few sets of parameters for the present study in conclusion small yellow croaker stocks in china have been heavily exploited and fishing effort has been above optimum levels chen et al 1997 shan et al 2011 zhang et al 2010a for the recovery of these fisheries stocks there is a need to develop a quantitative method that can be used effectively as a management guidance tool for optimum utilisation of the species currently the lack of appropriate tools for these stocks underscores the current need to assess fisheries resources more definitely and develop sustainable management strategies in the yellow and east china seas the present model is capable of simulating energetics and growth of small yellow croaker in the main geographic areas of the yellow and east chinas seas the model provides an important component for an individual based population model and is a first step toward the development of an effective management tool for the fisheries of small yellow croaker however future improvement of the model requires the refinement of stock specific parameters through the collection of appropriate data the arrhenius relationship needs to include the tolerance range for lower and upper boundaries of temperatures information on seasonal and spatial variations in abundance of prey species would also help improve the model predictions credit authorship contribution statement jeffrey s ren

24856,juvenile chinook salmon population dynamics in the columbia river estuary are influenced by physical processes hatchery practices and behavioral decision making to better understand how environmental forcing and swimming behavior influence estuarine migration and travel times we developed an individual based model ibm that uses 3 d outputs from a hydrodynamic model to simulate lagrangian transport as well as swimming and bioenergetics sub models to simulate active swimming and growth simulations were run in 2010 during the migration seasons for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon for both life history types alternative behaviors were simulated from random walks to behaviors that optimized efficient system migration for yearling chinook salmon and growth for subyearling chinook salmon simulation results compared well against observed data on travel times and common migration pathways the simulated travel times for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were within several hours of the observed travel times in general residence times and pathways were largely driven by river discharge and the phase of the tide during periods of greater river discharge simulated estuarine residence times were reduced and variability across individuals was minimal the timing of estuarine exit was closely tied to the phase of the tide with most simulated individuals exiting the system during the ebb phase while travel times were largely driven by flow velocities swimming behavior was likewise important simulated yearling chinook salmon behaviors that optimized movement with surrounding flows resulted in reduced estuarine residence times when compared to passive and random walk behaviors similarly simulated subyearling chinook salmon behaviors that optimized growth directed individuals to shallow peripheral habitats resulting in longer residence times and higher growth rates even if potentially important factors such as predator avoidance were not included this ibm provides an informative tool to model migration pathways growth and residence times of juvenile salmon in an estuarine environment and could be used to inform management decisions by evaluating various scenarios keywords juvenile chinook salmon columbia river estuary individual based model estuarine migration estuarine behavior 1 introduction the columbia river basin serves as important habitat for anadromous fish in the pacific northwest the river and its surrounding tributaries have historically supported large runs of several species of salmonids however habitat loss hydropower development navigation improvements and overfishing in the past century have all contributed to their decline bottom et al 2005 furthermore an increasing shift of hatcheries towards production oriented practices has reduced salmonid diversity and residency in the columbia river estuary bottom et al 2005 due to these ongoing stressors thirteen stocks are now listed under the endangered species act esa as threatened or endangered myers et al 1998 as a result of these listings there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of salmonid survival and migratory behaviors to inform recovery efforts and habitat restoration the importance of estuarine habitat has been of particular interest especially with regards to how the federal columbia river hydropower system fcrps has altered juvenile rearing habitats and overall production estuaries are important rearing habitats for salmonids that provide multiple services including food resources shelter from predators and a transitional habitat to physiologically adapt to increasing salinities bottom et al 2005 simenstad et al 1982 thorpe 1994 however estuaries can also be challenging environments due to tides strong and dynamic salinity gradients and increasing interactions with predators juvenile pacific salmon use estuaries to varying degrees bottom et al 2005 healey 1982 simenstad et al 1982 and populations have adapted to using freshwater and estuarine habitats in different capacities diverse migration patterns across life history types result in a wide range of estuarine residence times weitkamp et al 2014 for yearling salmonids estuarine residence times are on the order of days to weeks while estuarine residence times for subyearling salmonids often last weeks to months healey 1982 simenstad et al 1982 yearling salmonids migrate to the ocean after rearing in freshwater for a year or more i e coho sockeye steelhead and stream type chinook and typically travel quickly through the estuary using it as a migration corridor they are often assumed to minimally interact with estuarine habitat outside of the main channels however recent work by mcnatt and hinton 2017 observed yearling chinook salmon in wetland habitats thereby challenging this assumption subyearling salmonids i e ocean type chinook and chum spend less time rearing in freshwater and instead migrate earlier and spend longer periods in estuaries healey 1982 quinn 2005 weitkamp et al 2014 whereas yearling salmonids do not spend much time in shallow habitats smaller subyearling salmonids frequently occupy shallow nearshore wetland habitats mccabe et al 1986 simenstad et al 1982 smolts generally migrate between may and july responding to environmental cues such as the spring freshet juvenile salmon that have shorter estuarine residence migrate earlier in the season while those with longer estuarine residence migrate mid summer healey 1982 roegner et al 2012 weitkamp et al 2012 as juveniles migrate from freshwater to marine environments they experience different habitats and environmental conditions and this variation impacts the timing of their migration and size at ocean entry smolt migration rate and survival are affected by a number of factors including predation physiology river flows and ocean conditions although there have been concerted efforts to study smolt survival along the hydropower system upstream of bonneville dam less is known about how survival changes downstream of bonneville dam as smolts continue their migration through the estuary field based campaigns and modeling efforts have advanced our understanding of juvenile salmonid habitat preference survival and migration in the estuary however these studies are often of limited temporal or spatial scope and may underrepresent distributions of juvenile salmon particularly in shallow nearshore environments passive integrated transponder pit tag ledgerwood et al 2004 prentice et al 1990 and the juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system jsats tag mcmichael et al 2010 data have been especially useful for tracking survival and migration rates however such data are typically collected at a select few locations and thus lack comprehensive information about the entire migratory pathway modeling approaches have also been used to quantify optimal habitat for juvenile chinook salmon and how that changes based on river discharge kukulka and jay 2003a b tides and seasons salmon habitat opportunity bottom et al 2005 burla 2009 an area based metric and salmon habitat rostaminia 2017 a volume based metric have both been used to compute the amount of optimal salmon habitat available in specific hydrogeomorphic reaches of the estuary although these methods are informative to understanding how different reaches of the estuary function as habitat over time these eulerian based approaches do not account for how juvenile salmon interact with and respond to changing environmental conditions along a migration route furthermore these methods have relied solely on physical variables e g temperature salinity flow velocities and water depths and do not account for biological habitat components a more in depth investigation of how the estuary supports stocks of juvenile salmon is needed and requires a modeling technique that tracks estuarine residence and migration pathways of individual salmon this can be addressed with an individual based model ibm that simulates juvenile salmon migration in the estuary providing a means to characterize how system variability and behavioral decisions affect estuarine migration pathways ibms are effective tools for tracking the spatial and temporal distributions of organisms and their response to biotic and abiotic environmental conditions when coupled with bioenergetics models ibms can offer insight into the response of individual growth to environmental variability fiechter et al 2015a hinckley et al 1996 ibms vary in their level of sophistication some ibms simulate extensive life history processes and consider foraging growth mortality and reproduction while others are simpler and employ rule based methods to approximate movement patterns and habitat use giske et al 1998 tyler and rose 1994 ibms are frequently used to describe distributions of marine fish populations miller 2007 and have been adapted to simulate salmon migration pathways in the ocean byron and burke 2014 in addition ibms have been applied to the upstream reaches of the columbia river to investigate juvenile salmon passage through the hydropower system goodwin et al 2006 as well as to the columbia river plume brosnan 2014 and coastal ocean off oregon and washington burke et al 2014 2016 although ibms have been used in upstream reaches of the columbia river and off the mouth of the estuary there have been few attempts to simulate juvenile chinook salmon in the estuary the objectives of this work were to investigate potential estuarine migration pathways of yearling and subyearling chinook salmon in the columbia river estuary using different swimming behaviors and to explore how environmental conditions and behavioral decisions influence migration pathways travel times and growth rates to address these objectives an ibm coupled with a bioenergetics model was used to simulate movement due to advection and active swimming and growth based on the local environment results from model simulations were then validated against observations to assess model performance chinook salmon were the focus of this study as they are the most estuarine dependent salmonid species in the columbia river healey 1982 in addition there are multiple species of chinook salmon listed as endangered or threatened under the esa and multiple life history strategies for each species allowing for an intra specific behavioral comparison 2 methods 2 1 overview an ibm was used to simulate juvenile chinook salmon migration in the columbia river estuary from bonneville dam to the estuary mouth fig 1 the virtual environment wherein fish movement and growth were modeled utilized outputs from a hydrodynamic model data collected at bonneville dam and various locations in the estuary informed model design e g simulation timing starting fish lengths and length weight relationships in addition acoustic telemetry data from multiple regions of the columbia river estuary were used to assess the performance of the ibm wetland habitat quality adapted from the lower columbia estuary partnership lcep land cover dataset sanborn map company 2011 was used as a proxy for feeding success in the bioenergetics model fish were modeled using different swimming behaviors and results from these simulations were then analyzed to describe travel times migration pathways and growth in addition the effects of river and tidal forcing were considered the year of focus for this work was 2010 this year was selected because there was a large number of detections of juvenile chinook salmon in the columbia river estuary pair trawl experiment in 2010 and because there were abundant jsats data in the lower estuary flows in 2010 started below average but rose substantially by early june fig 2 with above average flows for most of june major flows associated with the spring freshet were slightly delayed when compared to historical mean flows temperatures recorded at bonneville dam were relatively low at bonneville during the spring season however by late summer temperatures exceeded 20 c the following sections describe the juvenile salmon data used to inform simulation design and to assess model performance the hydrodynamic model used to generate the virtual environment the framework and details of the ibm and how model results were analyzed 2 2 juvenile salmon data every year data are collected on the timing and survival of juvenile chinook salmon as they pass through the hydropower system and columbia river estuary passive integrated transponder pit tags are implanted in a portion of juvenile salmonids to track migration timing and survival as individual fish pass juvenile monitoring stations located at the dams their tag code and the date and time of detection are recorded the pit tag data are then uploaded to the columbia basin pit tag information system ptagis available at http www ptagis org the jsats developed by the pacific northwest national laboratory and noaa fisheries for the u s army corps of engineers also monitors juvenile salmonid survival and travel times in the columbia river lower estuary and plume the jsats tags last for approximately 30 days whereas the pit tags last for years remaining functional throughout the fish s lifespan the detection range of 300 m in the jsats system mcmichael et al 2010 is greater than the detection range for pit tags which typically must be within 10 100 cm of an antenna to be detected downstream of bonneville dam the last hydroelectric dam in the hydropower system a pair trawl is deployed from late march through early august in the lower estuary between eagle cliff rkm 83 and puget island rkm 61 fig 1 the pair trawl study targets migrating juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead and data collected from this long term study inform survival estimates of migrating juvenile salmonids and comparisons between in river migrants and barged fish that are transported and released below bonneville dam ledgerwood et al 2004 in 2010 there were more than 100 000 spring summer i e yearling chinook salmon and 28 698 fall i e subyearling chinook salmon that were pit tagged and detected at bonneville dam of the chinook salmon detected at bonneville dam 3632 spring summer and 461 fall chinook salmon were detected in the pair trawl representing detection rates of 3 6 and 1 6 as part of the 2010 jsats study harnish et al 2012 acoustic telemetry receivers were deployed in the navigation channel and off channel areas from the estuary mouth to rkm 86 in depths of at least 4 m fig 1 data were collected from these cross channel arrays from late april to august and later analyzed to describe common migration pathways travel times and survival of migrating juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead in the lower estuary there were 3880 yearling chinook salmon and 4449 subyearling chinook salmon that were tagged and released in the 2010 jsats study harnish et al 2012 subyearling chinook salmon included in the study were slightly larger than the general population as only individuals greater than 95 mm in fork length were targeted harnish et al 2012 2 3 hydrodynamic model hindcast simulations using the unstructured grid finite element model selfe zhang and baptista 2008 served as the virtual environment for the ibm this 3 d hydrodynamic model has been benchmarked for the columbia river estuary kärnä and baptista 2016a kärnä et al 2015 and data collected by numerous instruments throughout the estuary baptista et al 2015 have been used to evaluate model skill selfe solves a set of nonlinear baroclinic shallow water equations the unstructured grid consists of triangular elements in the horizontal that extend in the vertical dimension to form 3 d prisms the vertical grid in shallow regions is based on a hybrid terrain following and free surface adapted s grid song and haidvogel 1994 outside of the estuary the surface grid transitions to an equipotential z grid starting at the 100 m isobath the model is driven by multiple forcings taken from larger scale models atmospheric forcing is from the noaa ncep north american mesoscale forecast system and includes wind velocities shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature and pressure rogers et al 2009 the tides come from a regional inverse model myers and baptista 2001 and are applied along the ocean boundary temperature salinity and water elevations from the global navy coastal ocean model ncom barron et al 2006 are also imposed along the ocean boundary starting near the ocean boundary and extending approximately 50 km into the domain temperature and salinity values computed by selfe are nudged to ncom values to prevent values from drifting significantly from ncom river discharge elevations and water temperatures from usgs are used as riverine forcing from the columbia and willamette rivers as well as smaller tributaries the lewis and cowlitz rivers the horizontal mesh extends from northern california to vancouver island 39 n to 50 n and from the columbia river near bonneville dam river kilometer 234 to 300 km offshore fig 1 there are 89 819 nodes and 173 800 elements and domain resolution is highest in the estuary where resolution is typically between 100 200 m the resolution becomes coarser past the estuary in the plume 200 1000 m and is less resolved in the ocean 1 km the time step used in the circulation model is 36 s and outputs are stored every fifteen minutes 2 4 individual based model our ibm is described using the overview design concepts and details odd protocol for ibms outlined in grimm et al 2006 the purpose of the model as well as the structure and low level entities are first described this is followed by the design concepts that provide the framework for the ibm and the details that describe how the model is initialized what inputs are used and descriptions of the sub models a diagram of the model is shown in fig 3 2 4 1 overview 2 4 1 1 purpose the purpose of the ibm is to investigate potential migration pathways and travel times of juvenile chinook salmon in the columbia river estuary this was accomplished by simulating multiple swimming behaviors of varying complexity in addition to passive drift although there are long term studies describing travel times to various reaches in the estuary not enough is known about how environmental processes and swimming behavior influence estuarine residence and growth of juvenile chinook salmon the high spatiotemporal resolution of the ibm provides an effective means for evaluating how environmental processes e g river discharge and tides and behavioral decisions affect migration pathways and residence times results from model simulations are compared against observational data on travel times and preferred estuarine migration pathways to evaluate the model s performance 2 4 1 2 state variables and scales the ibm is made up of multiple low level entities that include environmental state variables and individual based variables the environmental state variables from the hydrodynamic model included water temperatures 3 d flow velocities and water depths in addition a habitat index that relates to the bioenergetics model was used the temporal resolution of the environmental variables was fifteen minutes with the exception of the habitat index that was constant over time in some simulations the estuary s hydrogeomorphic reach was considered as well as geographic targets within these reaches that correspond with the downstream extent of that reach the variables describing individual fish included their initial location and size defined by fork length and weight growth was simulated using a bioenergetics model where growth rates were dependent on water temperatures fish size the proportion of maximum consumption p value and prey energy density fish were initialized near bonneville dam and assigned a 3 d location and date of estuarine entry 2 4 1 3 process overview and scheduling simulations were conducted from march 13 to august 4 for yearling chinook salmon and from april 25 to november 3 for subyearling chinook salmon and correspond with statistics on run timing at bonneville dam the last dates of initialization were july 5 for yearlings and september 4 for subyearlings to ensure adequate time for individuals to exit the estuary these dates and the number of individuals simulated over time were based on normal distributions of run timing data see section 2 4 3 1 each model run commenced at 00 15 am pst on the first date of initialization environmental state variables were read in every fifteen minutes and values at finer temporal resolutions corresponding with the ibm time step were linearly interpolated movement due to advection followed by movement due to active swimming was calculated every 36 s and the new location was stored every fifteen minutes at the end of each fifteen minute time step individual growth was calculated using the bioenergetics model which factors in the temperature of the currently occupied position and the p value assigned to the occupied element mortality predation and density dependent interactions were not considered in the model if all individuals exited the estuary prior to the end date of the simulation the simulation ended early 2 4 2 design concepts 2 4 2 1 basic principles the ibm describes the migration of yearling and subyearling chinook salmon through a heterogenous environment where individuals go from narrow upstream reaches of the river to an increasingly tidally influenced environment as they move through this system they can adopt a number of strategies that ultimately shape their migration pathways yearling chinook salmon that are known to use the system as a migration corridor are more likely to occupy the main navigation channels whereas subyearling chinook salmon spend greater time in the estuary particularly in shallow water habitats there are therefore two different strategies to explore when it comes to simulating swimming behavior one that optimizes efficient migration through the system and one that optimizes growth in the estuary the behavioral rules implemented for yearling chinook salmon include directed migration optimizing timely estuarine exit whereas the rules for subyearling chinook salmon include reactive or directed movement to regions with high growth rate potential swim speeds are size dependent ware 1978 and it is recognized that larger salmon migrate more quickly through estuaries dawley et al 1986 healey 1982 therefore it is necessary to track changes in fork length over time as that affects travel times the bioenergetics model computes growth over time based on the environmental conditions experienced and as fish increase in length throughout the simulation so too does their swim speed the bioenergetics model used a constant prey energy density and a p value the proportion of maximum daily consumption that depended on habitat type to factor differences in habitat quality into the bioenergetics model p values were based on the presence or proximity to wetland habitat elements classified as wetland habitat as well as the immediately neighboring elements had a p value of 0 9 whereas outside of these regions the p value was 0 5 this allowed for a benefit to be factored in that considered preferred rearing habitats and relative feeding habits in these regions this approach of classifying p values based on habitat was similarly implemented in brosnan 2014 2 4 2 2 sensing and prediction for simulated yearling chinook salmon under the more complex behavioral rules e g negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk individuals factored environmental states into their decisions under the negative rheotaxis behavior fish oriented their movement to align with the direction of prevailing flows and could therefore sense their immediate flow environment under the biased correlated random walk behavior fish movement was correlated with the movement calculated from the previous time step and thus considered movement both due to advection and active swimming in addition the bias term directed fish to move downstream by orienting fish to move towards the downstream extent of each hydrogeomorphic reach thus individuals simulated under this behavior had a predictive sense of what direction to swim in based on the assumption that individuals optimize movement towards the ocean for simulated subyearling chinook salmon under the more complex behavioral rules e g kinesis and restricted area search individuals sensed and or predicted the growth rate potential of their environment individuals simulated using the kinesis behavior considered their immediate environment and their swim speed and direction were based on the computed rate of consumption of the current position against an optimal rate of consumption for individuals simulated using the restricted area search behavior they sensed their surrounding environment and evaluated the growth rate potential of the immediately neighboring elements where the average distance to neighbors was approximately 140 m while the restricted area search behavior accounted for both gains i e consumption and losses e g respiration egestion and excretion the kinesis behavior only considered gains 2 4 2 3 stochasticity simulations across the different behaviors were all started using the same random number seed the random seed was used to initialize the starting location initial lengths and weights and date of entry for each of the different behaviors that were simulated this means that all simulations started with the same initial conditions but they varied in the swimming behavior that was applied noise was also added to the model in the form of random noise that was added to individual swimming behavior 2 4 2 4 observation after every fifteen minute time step the location and the length and weight of each fish were recorded in addition environmental variables were stored including the temperature water depth and occupied element 2 4 3 details 2 4 3 1 initialization individuals were initiated in the upstream region of the model domain near bonneville dam at 45 38 06 n 121 57 41 w fig 1 using a normal distribution centered at this location with a standard deviation of 20 m in the horizontal vertical positions within the water column were initialized using a uniform distribution between 0 and 2 m below the surface initial fork lengths were based on daily fish condition fork length data collected at bonneville dam by the fish passage center smolt monitoring program the fork length data for subyearling chinook salmon showed an increasing trend over time to reduce the bias of these longer fork lengths when creating the distribution of subyearling chinook salmon starting lengths only fork length data through the end of august were considered the starting lengths were drawn from normal distributions for yearling chinook salmon μ 142 5 mm sd 18 7 mm and subyearling chinook salmon μ 95 6 mm sd 13 3 mm a truncated normal distribution with bounds at 61 mm and 140 mm was used for the subyearling chinook salmon to prevent lengths at the tails of the distribution this lower threshold also marks the difference between fingerlings and smaller emergent and resident frys simulation timing was based on the smolt index at bonneville dam from the fish passage center fig 4 the smolt index is based on pit tag detections at juvenile monitoring locations and factors in the flow magnitude to estimate the number of fish passing per day as not all fish are detected at the monitoring locations passage dates for subyearling chinook salmon prior to june were excluded when creating the run timing distribution as these detections are associated with juveniles from the previous year that were held over by hatcheries to be released as yearlings in fig 4 these larger individuals with earlier run timing are represented in the first two peaks although it is recognized that the timing of detections for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon do not follow normal distributions this distribution was used to initialize times of simulated passage at bonneville dam in the ibm using the mean and standard deviation of run timing normal distributions were generated for the yearling chinook salmon simulation dates μ 133 5 sd 13 days and subyearling chinook salmon simulation dates μ 185 5 sd 15 days as indicated in table 1 these distributions corresponded with initialization dates between march 13 july 5 centered on may 13 for yearling chinook salmon and april 25 september 4 centered on july 4 for subyearling chinook salmon while individuals may be detected at bonneville outside of these date ranges these periods pertain to the period when most individuals migrate the times of initialization were rounded to the nearest quarter hour to correspond with the fifteen minute time step of the hydrodynamic model output 2 4 3 2 input environmental variables e g water temperatures velocities water depths from the hydrodynamic model were used as model inputs wetland habitat data from the 2010 high resolution land cover data from lcep was used to generate p values used in the bioenergetics model representing a proxy of habitat quality this gis dataset was first described in simenstad et al 2011 where it was applied to a particular hydrogeomorphic reach the data include 26 different land cover classes including tidal and non tidal classes of coniferous deciduous shrub scrub and herbaceous habitat as well as classes more representative of substrates or anthropogenic uses e g agricultural impervious surface and developed juvenile salmon rely on food exported from emergent marsh habitat bottom et al 2005 and macroinvertebrates associated with such habitats serve as a significant dietary source bottom et al 2008 all wetland classes with the exception of upland habitats were merged into one wetland class and these data were then interpolated to the element centers 2 4 3 3 lagrangian transport sub model a lagrangian method was used to simulate fish movement due to advection the position at each time step was calculated from the previous time step according to 1 x t 1 x t u δ t 2 y t 1 y t v δ t 3 z t 1 z t w δ t velocities due to advection u v w were computed from spatial and temporal interpolation of the flow fields and the fish s location was updated using a runge kutta fourth order time integration method similar to the time step used in the hydrodynamic model a 36 s time step was used for interpolation this time step was preferred over the 15 min time step of the hydrodynamic model output because it improved the particle tracking skill in addition it reduced the frequency at which fish horizontally exited the domain or moved to dry elements which was a common occurrence especially in narrower reaches of the river if fish moved to a dry element or outside of the grid due to advection the intersection between the individual s pathway and the intersected element edge was computed and the tangential velocity was calculated to adjust the trajectory such that the individual maintained its position within the model domain 2 4 3 4 swimming behavior sub model swimming behavior was simulated using different movement models that varied based on assumptions about how juvenile chinook salmon use estuarine habitat it was assumed that yearling chinook salmon behaviors optimize efficient migration through the system while subyearling chinook salmon behaviors are more driven by the search for habitat where growth is optimized the movement models varied in complexity from simple random walks to more sophisticated behaviors that depended on local environmental conditions while predation is of concern in the system field data were not available at a high enough spatial and temporal resolution to inform the model in addition not enough is known about juvenile salmon predator avoidance swimming behaviors in the estuary for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon passive and random walk behaviors were simulated under the passive behavior individual movement was driven by advection only and no active swimming was included the simplest swimming behavior for both life history types was an uncorrelated and unbiased random walk where there was no behavioral response to external stimuli and the direction of movement was random codling et al 2008 willis 2011 this behavior was an effective null model allowing for comparisons against other swimming behaviors to assess whether or not more sophisticated models perform better than random movement humston et al 2004 watkins and rose 2013 random swimming was simulated by drawing a random swimming angle in the horizontal plane from a von mises distribution this circular normal distribution depends on two parameters μ and κ where μ represents the mean direction and κ represents the concentration around this direction to simulate uncorrelated and unbiased random movement μ and κ were both set to zero while fish move vertically based on flows vertical swimming was not included in the random walk behavior or other movement models in addition to the uncorrelated and unbiased random walk a biased correlated random walk bcrw was used for yearling chinook salmon it differed from the uncorrelated random walk because movement at each time step was correlated to the direction of movement in the previous time step leading to a local directional bias codling et al 2008 when correlation was high an individual maintained its heading whereas if correlation was near zero pathways appeared random correlated random walks are a popular choice for movement models as many animals tend to move forward in a persistent manner codling et al 2008 in addition to the directional persistence term this movement model included a directional bias such that movement was directed towards downstream locations these downstream locations may not always be fixed and instead can be adjusted based on an individual s location codling et al 2004 movement in the bcrw was calculated from a weighted sum of a persistence term and a navigation term according to the following equations bailey et al 2018 benhamou and bovet 1992 4 δ x t 1 x t l t 10 3 δ t w cos ω t ϕ n 1 w cos θ n δ n 5 δ y t 1 y t l t 10 3 δ t w sin ω t ϕ n 1 w sin θ n δ n where x and y are the locations lt is the fork length mm t is time w is a weighting term ω t is the target direction φ n is the navigation error term θn is the direction of movement in the previous step and δn is a persistence error term initial attempts to use the estuary mouth as a downstream target to orient fish towards when calculating the bias term were ineffective especially in the upstream reaches of the system due to the sinuosity of the river as well as the system s geographic extent multiple downstream locations were used to generate the bias term and the specific location used was dependent on the occupied hydrogeomorphic reach simenstad et al 2011 at each time step the direction to orient for the bias term i e angle between the current position and the reach s downstream location was calculated the persistence term was determined from the angle between the current position and the last position the bcrw employed here therefore incorporates a rheotactic response where the persistence term considers movement due to advection as well as powered swimming in addition to biased downstream movement the weighting term w was set to 0 1 and was based on values used in benhamou and bovet 1992 the navigation error term and the persistence error term both used a von mises distribution where κ the measure of concentration around the angle of movement equaled two the final movement model used for yearling chinook salmon was a taxis behavioral response to ambient flow environments this behavior was selected based on assumptions that yearlings time their migration to coincide with the spring freshet and typically spend less time in the estuary rheotaxis refers to a behavior where a fish aligns its swimming direction based on flows fraenkel and gunn 1940 and this behavior has been suggested as a strategy used by salmonids during their ocean migration booker et al 2008 burke et al 2014 mork et al 2012 royce et al 1968 and return migrations hamilton and mysak 1986 healey et al 2000 negative rheotaxis has also been suggested as a behavioral response to changing light conditions that encourages downstream movement in smolts cooke et al 2011 negative rheotaxis describes movement where fish orient themselves to swim in the direction of the prevailing current and positive rheotaxis describes movement where fish orient themselves to move against the current in this case negative rheotaxis was simulated such that yearling chinook salmon optimized their movement to align with the currents in upstream reaches of the system where river flows dominate swimming directions were associated with riverine flows in reaches where there is greater tidal forcing movement was more closely tied to the phase of the tide as individuals swim in the same direction that they are displaced by advection the angle of movement was computed from the horizontal velocity vectors at the currently occupied position with random noise added using a von mises distribution where κ equals two for subyearling chinook salmon passive and random walk behaviors were simulated in addition to kinesis and restricted area search swimming behaviors that depended on the expected consumption rate or growth rate the growth rate depends on water temperatures and the p value where high values are associated with wetland habitat the kinesis behavior entails movement that is responsive to ambient conditions but nondirectional while the restricted area search is more directional with the individual assessing nearby habitat for optimal environmental conditions and moving there kinesis behaviors result from an individual responding to environmental stimuli e g temperature salinity flows and either adjusting their speed orthokinesis or direction klinokinesis fraenkel and gunn 1940 kinesis behaviors are a popular choice in ibms see fiechter et al 2015b okunishi et al 2012 politikos et al 2015 rose et al 2015 watkins and rose 2017 swimming velocities consist of an inertial component as well as a random component defined as 6 v x t f x g x 7 v y t f y g y in this ibm the inertial components fx and fy were calculated as 8 f x v x t 1 h 1 i h 9 f y v y t 1 h 1 i h the random components gx and gy were calculated as 10 g x θ φ ε θ 1 h 2 i h 11 g y θ φ ε θ 1 h 2 i h variables in the above equations represent the following vx t 1 and vy t 1 are the x and y velocities during the last time step ih represents an index of habitat quality φ is the maximum sustained swimming speed and ε θ is a unit vector of a random angle generated using the von mises distribution h1 and h2 determine the height of the function and values used in humston et al 2000 and okunishi et al 2012 were used h1 0 75 h2 0 9 whereas most other swimming behaviors used a standard swim speed based on the assumption of 1 bl s 1 this behavioral model had an evolving swim speed that depended on habitat quality the maximum swimming speed used in this case was 4 bl s 1 when the inertial component was dominant the swimming velocities were reduced however when the random component was dominant the swimming velocities were closer to the maximum swimming speed values the inertial and random component depended on the habitat quality ih of the currently occupied element humston et al 2004 okunishi et al 2012 which was calculated as the product of two terms 12 i h i t i f where it is a temperature dependence function used to calculate consumption in the bioenergetics model and if is a metric representing prey availability since data on prey availability are limited for the entire estuary if in this ibm was equal to the p value of the occupied element that was based on the proximity to wetland habitat both it and if had theoretical maximums of 1 when ih was high movement was dominated by the inertial component and when ih was low movement was dominated by the random component the restricted area search behavior was slightly more complex than the kinesis behavior and consisted of an individual assessing the growth rate potential of the currently occupied element and all neighboring elements and moving to the element with the highest value humston et al 2004 railsback et al 1999 watkins and rose 2013 other ibms use metrics of habitat quality that are based on growth and mortality cues however this approach did not account for mortality the growth rate potential for each element was calculated using the depth averaged temperature at the element center the direction of swimming was computed based on the angle between the fish s current position and the center of the neighboring element with the highest growth rate potential stochastic noise was added using a von mises distribution where κ equals two velocity was computed as 13 v x t l i t 10 3 cos θ t ε 14 v y t l i t 10 3 sin θ t ε where v is the velocity m s 1 l is the body length in mm divided by 103 to convert to m θ is the angle between the current position and destination element and ε is stochastic noise for all movement models if the trajectory computed by swimming resulted in the fish exiting the domain or getting stranded on land the model continued to make attempts using different stochastic noise values until the trajectory resulted in the fish reaching a wet element if fish movement resulted in vertical exit from the river it was returned to the water surface if exiting at surface or to the bottom surface if exiting at bottom if an individual occupied an element that dried out at the next time step it was nudged to the nearest wet element 2 4 3 5 growth sub model the bioenergetics model relates the environmental conditions experienced during migration to individual growth allowing for an assessment of how simulated behaviors and migration pathways influence size and condition growth in the ibm was simulated using the wisconsin bioenergetics model hanson 1997 with parameters for chinook salmon defined in table 2 most of the original parameters described for adult chinook salmon were used stewart and ibarra 1991 with the exception of the temperature dependent consumption parameters that were more recently defined for subyearling chinook salmon plumb and moffitt 2015 weight w was computed according to the following 15 w t w t 1 c r s f u e p e f w t 1 where c is consumption r is respiration s is specific dynamic action f is egestion and u is excretion with c f and u in units of g prey g fish 1 d 1 and r in units of g o2 g fish 1 d 1 variables ep and ef represent the prey energy density and the fish energy density each of these variables was computed from temperature and mass dependent functions while reproduction is often included in this bioenergetics model it was not considered in this application the equations used in the wisconsin bioenergetics model were originally intended for a daily time step however growth in the ibm was computed every 15 min thus the final growth term was divided by 96 consumption was calculated according to 16 c c m a x p f t 17 c m a x a c w b c where c is the specific consumption rate g g 1d 1 cmax is the maximum specific feeding rate g g 1 d 1 p is the proportion of maximum consumption f t is a temperature dependence function t is water temperature c w is fish mass g ac is the intercept of the allometric mass function and bc is the slope of the allometric mass function the temperature dependence function used in this application was eq 3 temperature dependence for cool and cold water species thornton and lessem 1978 this function was also used in the kinesis model when calculating habitat quality respiration the energy used for routine metabolism depends on the water temperature and the fish s size and activity the total metabolism includes routine metabolism and digestion i e specific dynamic action sda energy lost to respiration was determined by multiplying the mass dependent resting metabolism component by a temperature dependence function and activity component 18 r a r w b r f t a c t i v i t y where r is respiration g g 1d 1 ar is the intercept of the allometric mass function w is weight g br is the slope of the allometric function f t is a temperature dependence function and activity is an activity multiplier that depends on the swimming speed cm s 1 of the fish the temperature dependence function used in the ibm was eq 1 exponential with swimming speed stewart et al 1983 while the velocity used in the kinesis model was variable an approach similar to that used in humston et al 2004 was used such that vel is set to 1 bl s 1 since the effect of swimming velocity on metabolism was less important than the effect of swimming behavior on simulated estuarine migration pathways and residence times this helped to eliminate differences across the subyearling chinook salmon movement models sda is equal to a proportion of energy consumed and was calculated according to 19 s s d a c f egestion f and excretion u depend on mass temperature and ration elliott 1976 and were calculated as follows 20 f a f t b f e g f p c 21 u a u t b u e g u p c f where af is the intercept of the proportion of consumed energy egested versus water temperature and ration bf is the coefficient of water temperature dependence of egestion and gf is the coefficient for feeding level dependence of egestion variables au bu and gu are similarly defined but for excretion outputs from the bioenergetics equations were converted from units of g g 1 d 1 to units of j g 1 d 1 by multiplying consumption c egestion f and excretion u by the prey energy density prey energy densities were based on a common prey type of juvenile chinook chironomid pupae diptera for which typical energy densities are 3400 j g 1 koehler et al 2006 respiration was also converted to units of j g 1d 1 by applying the oxy calorific coefficient 13 560 j g 1 o2 to convert the oxygen consumed to energy consumed hanson 1997 stewart et al 1983 once units were converted growth in g d 1 was calculated by dividing by the fish energy density and multiplying by the mass of the fish energy density was calculated as 22 e f α β w where ef is the fish energy density j g 1 α is the intercept of the allometric mass function β is the slope of the allometric mass function and w is the fish mass g to obtain the weight of the fish at each time step the computed growth was added to the weight at the previous time step depending on whether or not loss terms were greater than consumption terms the fish either lost or gained weight data on subyearling and yearling chinook salmon fork lengths from the lower estuary were used to generate a weight length relationship equation and this equation was then used to compute fork length from the new weight increases in length due to weight gain were calculated according to 23 w a l b where w is the mass of the fish g α is the intercept l is the length mm and b is the slope the slope and intercept were determined using observed length weight data and eq 23 was rearranged to solve for l 24 l w e 12 27476 1 3 18421 although fish weight can fluctuate their length cannot decrease as their weight decreases thus a fish was only allowed to increase in length if it was greater or equal to the expected weight for a fish of its size if the weight was greater or equal to this expected value the fish increased in length however if the weight was less than this expected value its length remained the same 2 5 analysis to assess the skill of the passive particle tracking model particles were simulated in a forward pattern during low and high flow periods for one two and three days the tracks generated by the forward particle tracking were compared against backward tracks that were initialized from the final positions of the forward tracks to evaluate skill the distances between the starting positions from the forward tracking and final positions from the backward tracking were computed the two periods simulated were a low flow period in april and a high flow period in june corresponding with the freshet simulations were conducted for various lengths of time to explore how the simulation length and distances traveled impacted model skill results from yearling and subyearling chinook salmon simulations were analyzed by describing estuarine residence times travel times to various locations throughout the estuary and growth model results were compared against observed travel times from the pair trawl as well as travel times from jsats data the comparison between simulated migration timing and observed migration timing was done by comparing bulk statistics and it should be noted that direct comparisons between model results and observations were not achievable in this application there were also temporal differences between the observations and the model results the timing of the pair trawl experiment march 23 through august 4 differed from the timing of individual initializations at bonneville for yearling chinook salmon march 13 july 5 and subyearling chinook salmon april 25 september 4 but despite this all individuals were considered as there was not significant variability in travel times to jones beach over time jsats data collection did not commence until late april since the observed detections at the jsats arrays occurred from april 29 june 15 for yearling chinook salmon and june 14 august 15 for subyearling chinook salmon only simulated fish that were active in the estuary during these periods were considered in model data comparisons with the jsats data lastly the subyearling chinook salmon targeted in the jsats study were larger than simulated subyearling chinook salmon but this size difference was not accounted for in the analysis in addition results from simulations were analyzed by visualizing common migration pathways and comparing against migration pathways described in harnish et al 2012 the impacts of environmental conditions on potential estuarine migration pathways were explored by analyzing the estuarine residence times against river flows at initialization and the tides at the time of marine entry the effects of swimming behaviors were explored with a greater emphasis on how behaviors of varying complexity influence migration patterns and travel rates and how they compare with observations and less on identifying the correct mechanisms that control behavioral decision making the ibm was intended to be used as an exploratory tool to assess the efficiency of behavioral mechanisms on simulating potential migration pathways of different life history types comparisons of more sophisticated movement models against passive and random walk simulations made it possible to determine if simple swimming behaviors and or passive drift adequately simulated migration histories or if more complex behaviors were appropriate data from the 2010 pair trawl study as well as pit tag detections from bonneville dam were downloaded from ptagis as there were often multiple detections of a single tag at one monitoring location the last record was used such that each tag only had one unique result at each location data from bonneville dam juvenile stations and the pair trawl twx were joined using the tag code identification number and the travel time to jones beach was computed by subtracting the time of detection at bonneville from the time of detection by the pair trawl travel times to jones beach for simulated fish were determined by calculating the time at which individuals passed 123 16 50 541 the approximate longitudinal location of jones beach fig 1 jsats data were downloaded from jsite and travel times between cross channel arrays were computed for rkm 86 50 rkm 50 37 rkm 37 22 and rkm 22 8 at each upstream array the time of last detection was computed for all individuals and at each downstream array the time of first detection was calculated in instances where individuals were detected by both the navigation channel array and peripheral channel array in the same general longitudinal location e g rkm 50 rkm 37 rkm 22 rkm 8 individuals were assigned to the upstream array where the last detection occurred when computing the time of first detection at the downstream array it was therefore necessary to factor in the time of last detection at the upstream array to ensure that all travel times reflected downstream movement prior to this consideration some of the travel times between downstream and upstream arrays were negative because the tides would transport fish near the estuary mouth back into the estuary and past the upstream array where it was already detected since a fish may have passed an upstream array multiple times due to the tides it was necessary to account for this pattern of movement when computing first and last detection times in addition the time of detection at the downstream array considered all detections for that unique rkm e g rkm 50 37 22 and 8 and did not distinguish between the main or navigation channel this method was implemented for both the jsats data and simulated fish for a more detailed description of how jsats travel times and pathways were calculated see harnish et al 2012 3 results 3 1 particle tracking skill errors in particle tracking can potentially distort simulated migration pathways in significant ways to assess tracking skill we used a closure approach where once a forward track was concluded we backward track from the end position to reconstruct the starting position at the starting time the distance between the original and reconstructed starting positions should be zero the larger the distance is the lesser the skill during low flow periods the particle tracking skill was high especially when only one or two days were simulated table 3 the mean skill was 0 16 0 38 0 39 m for the one day and two day low flow simulations model skill decreased as the simulation length increased with the mean distance between the starting forward positions and final backward positions increasing to 153 29 1377 06 m the particle tracking skill was also less during the high flow period where error was several orders of magnitude greater than the error during low flow periods with mean values ranging from 1122 28 m for the one day simulation up to 11 367 60 m for the three day simulation distances traveled were much greater during the high flow periods and were often twice as much as the distances traveled during low flow periods especially in the upper reaches of the river with the increases in flows and distances traveled the likelihood of particles exiting the domain was higher during the high flow period which could allow small errors in trajectories to be propagated over time when conducting backtracking in addition during the high flow period there were more particles that entered the ocean and backtracking from these initial positions could further introduce large errors especially if the particles did not return to the estuary 3 2 travel times residence and migration pathways 3 2 1 travel times travel times were considered for multiple regions including the upper estuary between bonneville dam and jones beach the region sampled by the pair trawl travel times and migration pathways were also described for the lower estuary between rkm 86 and various locations in the main channel and peripheral channels at rkm 50 37 22 and 8 travel times to the pair trawl and between jsats arrays were right skewed and not normally distributed so median values are described in addition means and standard deviations are reported in table 4 for reference the median travel time for yearling chinook salmon observed in the pair trawl experiment was 2 00 days n 3632 across all yearling chinook salmon simulations median travel times to jones beach ranged from 2 10 to 2 49 days table 4 fig 5 with values of 2 40 days for the passive particle simulation and 2 49 for the random walk simulation the more complex yearling chinook salmon behaviors including negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk resulted in reduced median travel times of 2 17 and 2 10 days median travel time from the pair trawl experiment for subyearling chinook salmon detected from march 23 through august 4 was 2 07 days n 461 the simulated travel times to jones beach for subyearling chinook salmon were slightly longer than observed values and were fairly similar to those of yearling chinook salmon table 4 fig 5 median travel times from the passive and random walk simulations were 2 23 and 2 27 days fish simulated using the kinesis behavior had a median travel time of 2 39 days travel times for the restricted area search behavior were longer than the other movement model travel times with a median value of 3 04 days this behavior was also much more right tailed than the others while there was a discrepancy in the temporal overlap between observed and simulated data overall there was very little difference between the observed yearling chinook salmon travel times and subyearling chinook salmon travel times from the pair trawl it s also important to note that the sample sizes between the two were not equivalent and that yearling chinook salmon were the life history type of interest during the pair trawl experiments in general the median travel times to jones beach from the ibm were consistently greater than median observed travel times to jones beach however this difference in travel times was on the scale of hours for both the yearling and subyearling chinook salmon passive simulations travel times due to passive drift were fairly close to the median observed travel times this suggests that passive drift alone could be largely responsible for travel times through upstream reaches of the system and that swimming behavior while important may not be as important of a driver however it s also important to note that the passive behavior was not as right skewed as the observations suggesting that passive drift does not capture the variability in travel times that is more evident in the observations and active swimming behaviors travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon from harnish et al 2012 as well as simulated travel times across behaviors are described for various segments of the lower estuary in table 5 and shown in figs 6 and 7 with the array locations shown in fig 1 in general travel times for simulated yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were within several hours of the observed travel times most simulated travel times were several hours longer than the observed travel times with the exception of the travel times between the navigation channel at rkm 50 to rkm 37 and the north channel near the washington shoreline between rkm 22 and rkm 8 travel times from clifton channel cc50 to rkm 37 were much greater for simulated yearling and subyearling chinook salmon with the exception of the biased correlated random walk behavior the median observed travel times between the navigation channel at rkm 86 and rkm 50 for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were 12 4 and 12 2 h simulated median travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon between these points ranged from 14 9 17 4 h and 15 2 17 2 h median observed travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook from the navigation channel at rkm 50 to rkm 37 were 4 5 and 5 1 h while simulated median travel times ranged from 3 0 3 6 h for yearling chinook salmon and 3 3 7 9 h for subyearling chinook salmon the travel times from clifton channel cc 50 to rkm 37 were often twice as long for simulated chinook salmon in addition the proportion of simulated fish detected in clifton channel was much less than the proportion of observed juvenile chinook salmon detected in this peripheral channel from the navigation channel at rkm 37 to rkm 22 the median observed travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were 11 9 h and 12 7 h for the passive and random walk yearling behaviors simulated travel times in this reach were nearly twice as long as observed values while the travel times for the negative taxis and biased correlated random walk behaviors were approximately three hours longer the simulated travel times for subyearling chinook salmon were up to four hours longer in this reach with the exception of the area search behavior that was over twice the observed rate from cathlamet bay at rkm 37 to rkm 22 observed travel times were 9 3 and 10 3 h and most simulated behaviors for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were approximately three hours longer except the area search behavior median travel times from the navigation channel from rkm 22 to rkm 8 were 2 8 and 4 0 h for observed yearling chinook salmon and subyearling chinook salmon the simulated travel times for the passive and random walk yearling chinook salmon behaviors through this reach were several hours longer while those of the negative taxis and biased correlated random walk behaviors were just over an hour longer for simulated subyearling chinook salmon in this reach the median travel times for the passive random walk and area search behaviors were within minutes to an hour of the observed travel times while the time of the kinesis behavior was over twice as long the median travel times between rkm 22 along the washington side wa 22 to rkm 8 were 2 2 and 2 1 h for observed yearling and subyearling chinook salmon and median simulated times ranged from 1 9 2 0 h for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon within this region median simulated travel times were nearly identical to the median observed times and there was very little variation across the behaviors suggesting that behavioral effects in this region were minimal and that physical processes dominate in general the travel times for simulated yearling chinook salmon were consistently reduced for the negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk behaviors compared to the passive and random walk behaviors in the rkm 50 to rkm 37 reach the simulated travel times for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were less than observed travel times the behavior that stood out as the most variable from observations was the restricted area search because of the longer travel times between arrays 3 2 2 estuarine residence times estuarine residence times for yearling chinook salmon did not vary significantly across the different swimming behaviors table 4 fig 8 in the passive particle simulation the median time to estuarine exit was 5 11 days and the median distance traveled per day was 55 87 km the random walk behavior resulted in slightly longer estuarine residence times of 5 38 days and a slightly decreased rate of travel of 53 48 km d 1 the median estuarine residence times of the negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk were slightly decreased at 4 92 and 4 78 days respectively with median travel rates of 61 11 and 61 27 km d 1 this difference in distances traveled between the passive and random walk simulations and the more sophisticated behaviors was due to the behavioral response of orienting movement based on the direction of prevailing currents and resulting directional biases median estuarine residence times for simulated subyearling chinook salmon were close to simulated yearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times and with the exception of the restricted area search behavior did not differ significantly across swimming behaviors table 4 fig 8 median estuarine residence times were 4 83 days for the passive behavior 4 96 days for the random walk behavior 5 24 days for the kinesis behavior and 9 34 days for the restricted area search behavior the median distance traveled per day in the restricted area search behavior 33 51 km d 1 was significantly less than the distances traveled in the simpler behavioral models and kinesis model 54 86 58 83 km d 1 while the medians were more appropriate to report as the data were not normally distributed the variability in subyearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times was especially evident when comparing the means and standard deviations the restricted area search behavior mean residence time and standard deviation were between 3 4 times greater than the other behaviors with values of 22 51 25 98 days longer estuarine residence times are typical for subyearling chinook salmon so longer estuarine residence times observed in the restricted area search behavior suggest that swimming behavior can have an important influence on residence times flow magnitude largely influenced simulated estuarine residence times for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon fig 9 and this was especially evident for the yearling chinook salmon behaviors passive particle simulations for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon and the random walk and kinesis behaviors for subyearling chinook salmon for the restricted area search behavior estuarine residence times were mostly reduced when river discharge at the time of release was greater than 8000 m3 s 1 and when flows were less than this threshold residence times were much longer the phase of the tide also impacted the timing of marine entry as most yearling and subyearling chinook salmon exited the estuary during the ebb phase fig 10 for several of the behaviors e g negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk this behavior was built in as fish oriented their swimming direction to move in the direction of prevailing currents however even for behaviors where swimming was not based on the flow direction most fish exited during the ebb phase since flow velocities in the lower estuary were high when both river discharge and tidal velocities directed flows seaward fish movement would be largely driven by advection and behavioral effects would likely be insignificant 3 2 3 migration pathways migration pathways were analyzed across simulated yearling and subyearling chinook salmon behaviors by examining the common routes used with a particular emphasis on the lower estuary in general yearling chinook salmon migration pathways were concentrated in the navigation channel before passing through the tidal flats into the north channel fig 11 there was minimal transport into the lateral bays in the passive simulation with the exception of baker bay migration pathways for the random walk simulation did not differ much from the passive particle pathways although there were slightly greater concentrations in the lateral bays in the more complex yearling chinook salmon behaviors negative rheotaxis and the biased correlated random walk individuals were concentrated in the navigation channel and the north channel while patterns were fairly similar to those seen in the passive and random walk simulations there was less concentration in the tidal flats and accumulation in baker bay and greater presence in cathlamet bay lastly most individuals near the estuary mouth traveled from the north channel as opposed to the navigation channel at rkm 22 suggesting that fish move from the navigation channel across the tidal flats to the north channel migration pathways for the subyearling chinook salmon passive and random walk behaviors showed similar patterns to the yearling chinook salmon behaviors with pathways concentrated in the navigation channel across the tidal flats and in the north channel fig 12 the kinesis behavior also showed concentrated migration pathways in these regions in addition to cathlamet bay there were some regions in youngs bay and cathlamet bay where individuals simulated using the kinesis behavior accumulated suggesting that flows in these regions were minimal and the connectivity across wet elements was reduced migration pathways for the restricted area search behavior differed drastically from the other subyearling chinook salmon behaviors since individuals were directed to regions with high growth rate potential pathways for this behavior were predominantly in shallow regions of the lower estuary and the lateral bays in particular these habitats were used more extensively than the navigation channel which helps to explain the longer residence times using this behavior as well as the minimal distances traveled on average when compared to other subyearling chinook salmon behaviors 3 2 4 growth daily growth was similar across the different yearling chinook salmon swimming behaviors with median values of 0 20 mm d 1 table 4 while most individuals grew throughout the simulation some simulated yearling chinook salmon did not increase in fork length at all minimal differences in simulated growth rates across these behaviors were likely due to the similar temperatures experienced by migrating individuals especially since most simulated yearling chinook salmon remained in the main channel regions and had similar travel times through the lower estuary even though the estuarine residence times for some of the subyearling chinook salmon behaviors e g random walk kinesis were fairly similar to the yearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times daily growth was often greater with median values ranging from 0 30 0 33 mm d 1 table 4 this was most likely due to differences in temperatures based on the timing of the simulations where subyearling chinook salmon experienced warmer temperatures throughout their migration the restricted area search behavior simulated for subyearling chinook salmon resulted in the highest median growth rate of 0 48 mm d 1 individuals simulated under the kinesis behavior had slightly greater growth rates than the random behavior however growth rates were still less than the area search behavior although both the kinesis and restricted area search behavior were designed to optimize growth the kinesis behavior was more reactive to environmental conditions experienced while the restricted area search behavior had a directional bias to move to regions with the highest growth rate potential this directional bias resulted in greater time spent in optimal temperatures and habitats resulting in greater growth 4 discussion results from the simulations indicate that estuarine residence times are strongly influenced by riverine flow previous work that quantified nursery habitat for the columbia river estuary found river forcing to be a dominant driver while the tides were a predominant force in lower reaches rostaminia 2017 across all simulated behaviors for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times were less when flows were greater 8000 m3 s during periods of high discharge estuarine residence times were mostly on the order of days these results are consistent with those of kärnä and baptista 2016b that show residence times being on the order of days in the system the different simulated yearling chinook salmon behaviors did not show significant variability in travel times to jones beach or estuarine residence times however the more complex swimming behaviors that factored in directional and navigational biases and or the direction of the prevailing currents resulted in reduced travel times and estuarine residence this highlights the influence of swimming behavior for yearling chinook salmon in that some behaviors optimize movement to remain in the main channels and outside of peripheral channels evidence of simulated yearling chinook salmon present in cathlamet bay across the movement models suggests that once juveniles enter the lower estuary they are no longer confined to main channels and instead may move into lateral bays both due to environmental forcing and swimming behavior the presence of yearling chinook salmon in cathlamet bay also suggests that they may utilize wetland habitats and may be directed to these regions both through advective processes and swimming behavior this supports recent work that has challenged the existing paradigm that yearling chinook salmon do not utilize wetland habitats across the subyearling chinook salmon swimming behaviors there was little variability across the passive random walk and kinesis behaviors however the restricted area search behavior differed significantly from those behaviors leading to longer estuarine residence increased growth and decreased daily travel rates the longer residence times increased growth and shorter distances traveled were likely associated with the occupation of peripheral habitats and lateral bays e g cathlamet bay where waters tend to be older kärnä and baptista 2016b by occupying waters where flows are reduced individuals are less likely to be rapidly flushed and thus their estuarine residence times may be extended in addition individuals were more likely to occupy shallower habitats where temperatures and the availability of food resources derived from wetland habitat were more optimal for growth although the restricted area search behavior was effective at directing individuals to productive shallow habitats it often resulted in aggregation in regions of local optima while this positively contributed to growth once individuals occupied an area where potential growth rates were high there was no incentive to search for new habitat in most cases flow velocities and randomness in the swimming behavior would limit long term aggregation however in regions with frequent wetting and drying where flows were minimal fish could easily be artificially retained previous attempts at developing a restricted area search behavior used different criteria based on nursery habitat that was computed from depth velocity salinity and temperature criteria but these habitats were extremely patchy directing individuals to these regions without secondary cues resulted in minimal occupation of optimal habitats using a secondary cue of searching for shallow habitat was effective in directing individuals to regions with good nursery habitat but frequently resulted in significant stranding because once fish encountered shallow habitat they tended to stay there in these regions water velocities were reduced and therefore fish moved less due to advection their swimming behavior became more of a driving force when the behavior directs individuals to local optima there is nothing to prompt movement outside of the optima especially if flows remain low this was also an issue when using the growth rate potential however there were a lot fewer fish that got stuck in extremely shallow habitats under this method additional behaviors were attempted to keep individuals from getting stuck yet they remained ineffective in leading individuals to exit the estuary there are several large scale drivers that influence migration behavior including some genetic component that entices individuals to move while individuals may spend various amounts of time in good habitat eventually they will be prompted to exit the estuary although the restricted area search behavior was effective at reproducing expected distributions of subyearling chinook salmon in shallow habitats it was not effective for simulating departure from these optimal habitats and thus may be limited when simulating a migratory species that exits the system future attempts should consider using a size dependent time dependent or duration dependent behavior within the restricted area search behavior to avoid accumulation in certain regions while it was expected that the kinesis simulations might increase the likelihood of fish encountering wetland habitat the reduced residence times for this simulation suggest that was not the case with regards to observed estuarine residence times there have not been many studies that have documented travel times between bonneville dam and the estuary mouth as most studies have focused on particular reaches of the estuary e g bonneville dam to jones beach carter et al 2009 found that smolts pass through the estuary more quickly during periods of high discharge and later in the migration season and that yearling chinook salmon migrate at rates of 60 km day between vancouver washington and the estuary mouth these results correspond with results for simulated yearling chinook salmon where individuals that migrate later and during periods of high discharge have shorter estuarine residence times and average distances traveled are on the order of 55 65 km d 1 mccomas et al 2008 found that acoustic tagged subyearling chinook salmon moved quickly through the system to the river mouth with a mean travel time of 4 1 days this is fairly close to the estuarine residence times of the simpler simulated subyearling chinook salmon behaviors e g passive random walk and kinesis when comparing the observed travel times against simulated travel times to jones beach there was fairly close agreement between observed and modeled values for the yearling chinook salmon especially in the negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk although the sample size for subyearling chinook salmon in the pair trawl was small there was also fairly close agreement between observed values and simulated values for the passive random walk and kinesis behaviors in addition the simulated travel times were within range of observed travel times described from the jsats data and the preferred migration pathways from simulations i e greater occupation of navigation channel and wa 22 were also seen in the observations although direct comparisons with observed data were not possible in this application the proximity of simulated travel times against observed travel times is a promising result and suggests that an ibm can be an effective tool for exploring migratory behavior of juvenile chinook salmon in an estuarine environment simulated growth rates in the ibm for subyearling chinook salmon were within the range of growth rates reported from field observations while those for yearling chinook salmon were typically less than observed rates rich 1920 estimated growth rates of 0 44 mm d 1 from rkm 261 to the river mouth while other studies have identified growth rates of 0 25 and 0 31 mm d 1 mccabe et al 1986 roegner et al 2012 campbell 2010 studied otolith derived growth estimates and determined mean daily growth rates of 0 41 mm d 1 for juvenile salmon in saline portions of the estuary mcnatt et al 2016 documented mean growth rates of 0 49 0 58 mm d 1 for juveniles residing in wetlands with length increases by as much as 10 20 mm for juveniles remaining in wetland areas longer than 15 days additional growth rates estimated from otolith analysis were on average 0 5 mm d 1 bottom et al 2008 while it may be challenging to validate growth rates from the ibm the growth rates were within the range of observed values which lends support to the ibm being an effective tool for exploring how the estuary supports growth of juvenile chinook salmon during their migration 4 1 limitations ibms have become an increasingly popular approach for simulating animal behavior and for exploring ecological questions they offer a means by which we can test hypotheses and investigate how environmental processes and individual behavior influence population level dynamics despite advances in modeling techniques and computing power ibms continue to be limited since modeling relies on assumptions and simplification of behaviors ibms should not be expected to exactly mimic nature however they can be effective in answering questions that might be difficult to investigate using observations or eulerian modeling techniques this paper highlights the functionality of an ibm to investigate estuarine migration patterns of juvenile chinook salmon but it is important to note the limitations of our model and ibms in general as juvenile chinook salmon migrate from freshwater to brackish and increasingly marine waters their behavior changes in response to ambient conditions while the ibm effectively approximates movement it is not a realistic representation of actual swimming behaviors through an evolving environment the ibm is certainly an improvement from eulerian based methods that quantify salmon habitat for juvenile chinook salmon but there are still limits on its utility furthermore juvenile chinook salmon likely employ multiple strategies as they migrate through the system and rely on multiple cues simultaneously when making movement decisions their needs change over time and they switch modes multiple times during their migration from focusing on downstream movement to feeding and predator avoidance in addition there are larger scale processes that influence their behavior as well as their genetically driven urge to migrate to the ocean these environmental and behavioral drivers are constantly at play in different degrees since models are designed to simplify behavior to help us understand some of these dynamics they will never accurately capture all of the more complex processes at play while including the bioenergetics model was a necessary component especially as it influenced the swim speeds there were limitations in how it was implemented all of the standard equations used in the model worked well however the way in which prey energy density was approximated was overly simple a constant prey energy density was used and the p value which controls the amount of energy was based on proximity to wetland habitat these methods of oversimplifying the bioenergetics model were somewhat necessary as high resolution data on salmon prey in the columbia river estuary are limited however this oversimplification likely influenced results for individual growth and may explain why yearling chinook salmon growth showed such little variation and why the restricted area search behavior led to such high growth rates although simulated behaviors produced results that were within the range of observed travel times model results should be interpreted with caution because predator avoidance was not considered as a behavioral response and the cumulative effects of predation on migration patterns were not represented predation and mortality were not included in this version of the model due to the lack of high resolution spatial and temporal observations on these top down drivers in addition not enough is known about how juvenile chinook salmon swimming behavior is influenced by predator avoidance particularly in a system where flow velocities are so high even though information may be lacking we acknowledge that predator avoidance could play a role in residence times and preferred migration pathways the hydrodynamic model used as the virtual environment for the ibm had some limitations including the lack of freshwater flows imposed in the model that limited circulation in the smaller tributaries in the lateral bays this led to the accumulation of passive particles or simulated fish in the shallowest upstream reaches of these tributaries kärnä and baptista 2016b mention that hydrodynamic model results in the lateral bays may not be reliable due to the lack of freshwater input and because of issues with the wetting drying method which is consistent with issues encountered in this work in addition most of the model skill validation for the circulation model focused on the main channels or deeper locations in the lateral bays thus it is difficult to assess the skill of the circulation model in shallow regions lastly the resolution of the bathymetry and size of the grid in shallow regions was limited which affected migration pathways in shallow regions with regards to model data comparisons the pair trawl and jsats data were very valuable however the fish targeted in these studies were often not representative of the full diversity of sizes and life histories present in the estuary instead they primarily targeted larger juveniles that remained in the main channels in general acoustic telemetry studies are rare in shallow habitats however there are some exceptions johnson et al 2015 mcnatt et al 2016 data describing travel times are likely inappropriate to apply to smaller subyearling chinook salmon as they have longer residence times and are less likely to be tagged see bottom et al 2005 similarly many of these tagging studies target fish from hatcheries and thus are not necessarily representative of behaviors associated with wild type chinook salmon 5 conclusions an ibm was developed to explore estuarine migration pathways residence times and growth of juvenile chinook salmon migrating through the columbia river estuary multiple behaviors were implemented ranging from random behaviors to more sophisticated behaviors that either optimized efficient migration through the system or opportunities for growth simulated behaviors for juvenile yearling chinook salmon that optimized rapid migration outperformed the passive drift and random walk simulation due to reduced residence times similarly the behaviors implemented for subyearling chinook salmon that optimized increased growth resulted in higher growth rates when compared to the random walk behavior in most simulations residence times were on the order of days river discharge had a strong influence on residence times and during periods of high discharge residence times were reduced while the model does have many limitations in its current implementation it was effective for investigating how juvenile chinook salmon respond to environmental forcing and behavioral controls river discharge was a strong driver of residence times however active swimming and behavioral decisions made by individuals were also important in driving potential migratory pathways the availability of pit tag and jsats tag data allowed for an in depth model data comparison consistent patterns in migration pathways and travel times between the simulated individuals and observed individuals suggest that this ibm could be used to

24856,juvenile chinook salmon population dynamics in the columbia river estuary are influenced by physical processes hatchery practices and behavioral decision making to better understand how environmental forcing and swimming behavior influence estuarine migration and travel times we developed an individual based model ibm that uses 3 d outputs from a hydrodynamic model to simulate lagrangian transport as well as swimming and bioenergetics sub models to simulate active swimming and growth simulations were run in 2010 during the migration seasons for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon for both life history types alternative behaviors were simulated from random walks to behaviors that optimized efficient system migration for yearling chinook salmon and growth for subyearling chinook salmon simulation results compared well against observed data on travel times and common migration pathways the simulated travel times for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were within several hours of the observed travel times in general residence times and pathways were largely driven by river discharge and the phase of the tide during periods of greater river discharge simulated estuarine residence times were reduced and variability across individuals was minimal the timing of estuarine exit was closely tied to the phase of the tide with most simulated individuals exiting the system during the ebb phase while travel times were largely driven by flow velocities swimming behavior was likewise important simulated yearling chinook salmon behaviors that optimized movement with surrounding flows resulted in reduced estuarine residence times when compared to passive and random walk behaviors similarly simulated subyearling chinook salmon behaviors that optimized growth directed individuals to shallow peripheral habitats resulting in longer residence times and higher growth rates even if potentially important factors such as predator avoidance were not included this ibm provides an informative tool to model migration pathways growth and residence times of juvenile salmon in an estuarine environment and could be used to inform management decisions by evaluating various scenarios keywords juvenile chinook salmon columbia river estuary individual based model estuarine migration estuarine behavior 1 introduction the columbia river basin serves as important habitat for anadromous fish in the pacific northwest the river and its surrounding tributaries have historically supported large runs of several species of salmonids however habitat loss hydropower development navigation improvements and overfishing in the past century have all contributed to their decline bottom et al 2005 furthermore an increasing shift of hatcheries towards production oriented practices has reduced salmonid diversity and residency in the columbia river estuary bottom et al 2005 due to these ongoing stressors thirteen stocks are now listed under the endangered species act esa as threatened or endangered myers et al 1998 as a result of these listings there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of salmonid survival and migratory behaviors to inform recovery efforts and habitat restoration the importance of estuarine habitat has been of particular interest especially with regards to how the federal columbia river hydropower system fcrps has altered juvenile rearing habitats and overall production estuaries are important rearing habitats for salmonids that provide multiple services including food resources shelter from predators and a transitional habitat to physiologically adapt to increasing salinities bottom et al 2005 simenstad et al 1982 thorpe 1994 however estuaries can also be challenging environments due to tides strong and dynamic salinity gradients and increasing interactions with predators juvenile pacific salmon use estuaries to varying degrees bottom et al 2005 healey 1982 simenstad et al 1982 and populations have adapted to using freshwater and estuarine habitats in different capacities diverse migration patterns across life history types result in a wide range of estuarine residence times weitkamp et al 2014 for yearling salmonids estuarine residence times are on the order of days to weeks while estuarine residence times for subyearling salmonids often last weeks to months healey 1982 simenstad et al 1982 yearling salmonids migrate to the ocean after rearing in freshwater for a year or more i e coho sockeye steelhead and stream type chinook and typically travel quickly through the estuary using it as a migration corridor they are often assumed to minimally interact with estuarine habitat outside of the main channels however recent work by mcnatt and hinton 2017 observed yearling chinook salmon in wetland habitats thereby challenging this assumption subyearling salmonids i e ocean type chinook and chum spend less time rearing in freshwater and instead migrate earlier and spend longer periods in estuaries healey 1982 quinn 2005 weitkamp et al 2014 whereas yearling salmonids do not spend much time in shallow habitats smaller subyearling salmonids frequently occupy shallow nearshore wetland habitats mccabe et al 1986 simenstad et al 1982 smolts generally migrate between may and july responding to environmental cues such as the spring freshet juvenile salmon that have shorter estuarine residence migrate earlier in the season while those with longer estuarine residence migrate mid summer healey 1982 roegner et al 2012 weitkamp et al 2012 as juveniles migrate from freshwater to marine environments they experience different habitats and environmental conditions and this variation impacts the timing of their migration and size at ocean entry smolt migration rate and survival are affected by a number of factors including predation physiology river flows and ocean conditions although there have been concerted efforts to study smolt survival along the hydropower system upstream of bonneville dam less is known about how survival changes downstream of bonneville dam as smolts continue their migration through the estuary field based campaigns and modeling efforts have advanced our understanding of juvenile salmonid habitat preference survival and migration in the estuary however these studies are often of limited temporal or spatial scope and may underrepresent distributions of juvenile salmon particularly in shallow nearshore environments passive integrated transponder pit tag ledgerwood et al 2004 prentice et al 1990 and the juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system jsats tag mcmichael et al 2010 data have been especially useful for tracking survival and migration rates however such data are typically collected at a select few locations and thus lack comprehensive information about the entire migratory pathway modeling approaches have also been used to quantify optimal habitat for juvenile chinook salmon and how that changes based on river discharge kukulka and jay 2003a b tides and seasons salmon habitat opportunity bottom et al 2005 burla 2009 an area based metric and salmon habitat rostaminia 2017 a volume based metric have both been used to compute the amount of optimal salmon habitat available in specific hydrogeomorphic reaches of the estuary although these methods are informative to understanding how different reaches of the estuary function as habitat over time these eulerian based approaches do not account for how juvenile salmon interact with and respond to changing environmental conditions along a migration route furthermore these methods have relied solely on physical variables e g temperature salinity flow velocities and water depths and do not account for biological habitat components a more in depth investigation of how the estuary supports stocks of juvenile salmon is needed and requires a modeling technique that tracks estuarine residence and migration pathways of individual salmon this can be addressed with an individual based model ibm that simulates juvenile salmon migration in the estuary providing a means to characterize how system variability and behavioral decisions affect estuarine migration pathways ibms are effective tools for tracking the spatial and temporal distributions of organisms and their response to biotic and abiotic environmental conditions when coupled with bioenergetics models ibms can offer insight into the response of individual growth to environmental variability fiechter et al 2015a hinckley et al 1996 ibms vary in their level of sophistication some ibms simulate extensive life history processes and consider foraging growth mortality and reproduction while others are simpler and employ rule based methods to approximate movement patterns and habitat use giske et al 1998 tyler and rose 1994 ibms are frequently used to describe distributions of marine fish populations miller 2007 and have been adapted to simulate salmon migration pathways in the ocean byron and burke 2014 in addition ibms have been applied to the upstream reaches of the columbia river to investigate juvenile salmon passage through the hydropower system goodwin et al 2006 as well as to the columbia river plume brosnan 2014 and coastal ocean off oregon and washington burke et al 2014 2016 although ibms have been used in upstream reaches of the columbia river and off the mouth of the estuary there have been few attempts to simulate juvenile chinook salmon in the estuary the objectives of this work were to investigate potential estuarine migration pathways of yearling and subyearling chinook salmon in the columbia river estuary using different swimming behaviors and to explore how environmental conditions and behavioral decisions influence migration pathways travel times and growth rates to address these objectives an ibm coupled with a bioenergetics model was used to simulate movement due to advection and active swimming and growth based on the local environment results from model simulations were then validated against observations to assess model performance chinook salmon were the focus of this study as they are the most estuarine dependent salmonid species in the columbia river healey 1982 in addition there are multiple species of chinook salmon listed as endangered or threatened under the esa and multiple life history strategies for each species allowing for an intra specific behavioral comparison 2 methods 2 1 overview an ibm was used to simulate juvenile chinook salmon migration in the columbia river estuary from bonneville dam to the estuary mouth fig 1 the virtual environment wherein fish movement and growth were modeled utilized outputs from a hydrodynamic model data collected at bonneville dam and various locations in the estuary informed model design e g simulation timing starting fish lengths and length weight relationships in addition acoustic telemetry data from multiple regions of the columbia river estuary were used to assess the performance of the ibm wetland habitat quality adapted from the lower columbia estuary partnership lcep land cover dataset sanborn map company 2011 was used as a proxy for feeding success in the bioenergetics model fish were modeled using different swimming behaviors and results from these simulations were then analyzed to describe travel times migration pathways and growth in addition the effects of river and tidal forcing were considered the year of focus for this work was 2010 this year was selected because there was a large number of detections of juvenile chinook salmon in the columbia river estuary pair trawl experiment in 2010 and because there were abundant jsats data in the lower estuary flows in 2010 started below average but rose substantially by early june fig 2 with above average flows for most of june major flows associated with the spring freshet were slightly delayed when compared to historical mean flows temperatures recorded at bonneville dam were relatively low at bonneville during the spring season however by late summer temperatures exceeded 20 c the following sections describe the juvenile salmon data used to inform simulation design and to assess model performance the hydrodynamic model used to generate the virtual environment the framework and details of the ibm and how model results were analyzed 2 2 juvenile salmon data every year data are collected on the timing and survival of juvenile chinook salmon as they pass through the hydropower system and columbia river estuary passive integrated transponder pit tags are implanted in a portion of juvenile salmonids to track migration timing and survival as individual fish pass juvenile monitoring stations located at the dams their tag code and the date and time of detection are recorded the pit tag data are then uploaded to the columbia basin pit tag information system ptagis available at http www ptagis org the jsats developed by the pacific northwest national laboratory and noaa fisheries for the u s army corps of engineers also monitors juvenile salmonid survival and travel times in the columbia river lower estuary and plume the jsats tags last for approximately 30 days whereas the pit tags last for years remaining functional throughout the fish s lifespan the detection range of 300 m in the jsats system mcmichael et al 2010 is greater than the detection range for pit tags which typically must be within 10 100 cm of an antenna to be detected downstream of bonneville dam the last hydroelectric dam in the hydropower system a pair trawl is deployed from late march through early august in the lower estuary between eagle cliff rkm 83 and puget island rkm 61 fig 1 the pair trawl study targets migrating juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead and data collected from this long term study inform survival estimates of migrating juvenile salmonids and comparisons between in river migrants and barged fish that are transported and released below bonneville dam ledgerwood et al 2004 in 2010 there were more than 100 000 spring summer i e yearling chinook salmon and 28 698 fall i e subyearling chinook salmon that were pit tagged and detected at bonneville dam of the chinook salmon detected at bonneville dam 3632 spring summer and 461 fall chinook salmon were detected in the pair trawl representing detection rates of 3 6 and 1 6 as part of the 2010 jsats study harnish et al 2012 acoustic telemetry receivers were deployed in the navigation channel and off channel areas from the estuary mouth to rkm 86 in depths of at least 4 m fig 1 data were collected from these cross channel arrays from late april to august and later analyzed to describe common migration pathways travel times and survival of migrating juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead in the lower estuary there were 3880 yearling chinook salmon and 4449 subyearling chinook salmon that were tagged and released in the 2010 jsats study harnish et al 2012 subyearling chinook salmon included in the study were slightly larger than the general population as only individuals greater than 95 mm in fork length were targeted harnish et al 2012 2 3 hydrodynamic model hindcast simulations using the unstructured grid finite element model selfe zhang and baptista 2008 served as the virtual environment for the ibm this 3 d hydrodynamic model has been benchmarked for the columbia river estuary kärnä and baptista 2016a kärnä et al 2015 and data collected by numerous instruments throughout the estuary baptista et al 2015 have been used to evaluate model skill selfe solves a set of nonlinear baroclinic shallow water equations the unstructured grid consists of triangular elements in the horizontal that extend in the vertical dimension to form 3 d prisms the vertical grid in shallow regions is based on a hybrid terrain following and free surface adapted s grid song and haidvogel 1994 outside of the estuary the surface grid transitions to an equipotential z grid starting at the 100 m isobath the model is driven by multiple forcings taken from larger scale models atmospheric forcing is from the noaa ncep north american mesoscale forecast system and includes wind velocities shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature and pressure rogers et al 2009 the tides come from a regional inverse model myers and baptista 2001 and are applied along the ocean boundary temperature salinity and water elevations from the global navy coastal ocean model ncom barron et al 2006 are also imposed along the ocean boundary starting near the ocean boundary and extending approximately 50 km into the domain temperature and salinity values computed by selfe are nudged to ncom values to prevent values from drifting significantly from ncom river discharge elevations and water temperatures from usgs are used as riverine forcing from the columbia and willamette rivers as well as smaller tributaries the lewis and cowlitz rivers the horizontal mesh extends from northern california to vancouver island 39 n to 50 n and from the columbia river near bonneville dam river kilometer 234 to 300 km offshore fig 1 there are 89 819 nodes and 173 800 elements and domain resolution is highest in the estuary where resolution is typically between 100 200 m the resolution becomes coarser past the estuary in the plume 200 1000 m and is less resolved in the ocean 1 km the time step used in the circulation model is 36 s and outputs are stored every fifteen minutes 2 4 individual based model our ibm is described using the overview design concepts and details odd protocol for ibms outlined in grimm et al 2006 the purpose of the model as well as the structure and low level entities are first described this is followed by the design concepts that provide the framework for the ibm and the details that describe how the model is initialized what inputs are used and descriptions of the sub models a diagram of the model is shown in fig 3 2 4 1 overview 2 4 1 1 purpose the purpose of the ibm is to investigate potential migration pathways and travel times of juvenile chinook salmon in the columbia river estuary this was accomplished by simulating multiple swimming behaviors of varying complexity in addition to passive drift although there are long term studies describing travel times to various reaches in the estuary not enough is known about how environmental processes and swimming behavior influence estuarine residence and growth of juvenile chinook salmon the high spatiotemporal resolution of the ibm provides an effective means for evaluating how environmental processes e g river discharge and tides and behavioral decisions affect migration pathways and residence times results from model simulations are compared against observational data on travel times and preferred estuarine migration pathways to evaluate the model s performance 2 4 1 2 state variables and scales the ibm is made up of multiple low level entities that include environmental state variables and individual based variables the environmental state variables from the hydrodynamic model included water temperatures 3 d flow velocities and water depths in addition a habitat index that relates to the bioenergetics model was used the temporal resolution of the environmental variables was fifteen minutes with the exception of the habitat index that was constant over time in some simulations the estuary s hydrogeomorphic reach was considered as well as geographic targets within these reaches that correspond with the downstream extent of that reach the variables describing individual fish included their initial location and size defined by fork length and weight growth was simulated using a bioenergetics model where growth rates were dependent on water temperatures fish size the proportion of maximum consumption p value and prey energy density fish were initialized near bonneville dam and assigned a 3 d location and date of estuarine entry 2 4 1 3 process overview and scheduling simulations were conducted from march 13 to august 4 for yearling chinook salmon and from april 25 to november 3 for subyearling chinook salmon and correspond with statistics on run timing at bonneville dam the last dates of initialization were july 5 for yearlings and september 4 for subyearlings to ensure adequate time for individuals to exit the estuary these dates and the number of individuals simulated over time were based on normal distributions of run timing data see section 2 4 3 1 each model run commenced at 00 15 am pst on the first date of initialization environmental state variables were read in every fifteen minutes and values at finer temporal resolutions corresponding with the ibm time step were linearly interpolated movement due to advection followed by movement due to active swimming was calculated every 36 s and the new location was stored every fifteen minutes at the end of each fifteen minute time step individual growth was calculated using the bioenergetics model which factors in the temperature of the currently occupied position and the p value assigned to the occupied element mortality predation and density dependent interactions were not considered in the model if all individuals exited the estuary prior to the end date of the simulation the simulation ended early 2 4 2 design concepts 2 4 2 1 basic principles the ibm describes the migration of yearling and subyearling chinook salmon through a heterogenous environment where individuals go from narrow upstream reaches of the river to an increasingly tidally influenced environment as they move through this system they can adopt a number of strategies that ultimately shape their migration pathways yearling chinook salmon that are known to use the system as a migration corridor are more likely to occupy the main navigation channels whereas subyearling chinook salmon spend greater time in the estuary particularly in shallow water habitats there are therefore two different strategies to explore when it comes to simulating swimming behavior one that optimizes efficient migration through the system and one that optimizes growth in the estuary the behavioral rules implemented for yearling chinook salmon include directed migration optimizing timely estuarine exit whereas the rules for subyearling chinook salmon include reactive or directed movement to regions with high growth rate potential swim speeds are size dependent ware 1978 and it is recognized that larger salmon migrate more quickly through estuaries dawley et al 1986 healey 1982 therefore it is necessary to track changes in fork length over time as that affects travel times the bioenergetics model computes growth over time based on the environmental conditions experienced and as fish increase in length throughout the simulation so too does their swim speed the bioenergetics model used a constant prey energy density and a p value the proportion of maximum daily consumption that depended on habitat type to factor differences in habitat quality into the bioenergetics model p values were based on the presence or proximity to wetland habitat elements classified as wetland habitat as well as the immediately neighboring elements had a p value of 0 9 whereas outside of these regions the p value was 0 5 this allowed for a benefit to be factored in that considered preferred rearing habitats and relative feeding habits in these regions this approach of classifying p values based on habitat was similarly implemented in brosnan 2014 2 4 2 2 sensing and prediction for simulated yearling chinook salmon under the more complex behavioral rules e g negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk individuals factored environmental states into their decisions under the negative rheotaxis behavior fish oriented their movement to align with the direction of prevailing flows and could therefore sense their immediate flow environment under the biased correlated random walk behavior fish movement was correlated with the movement calculated from the previous time step and thus considered movement both due to advection and active swimming in addition the bias term directed fish to move downstream by orienting fish to move towards the downstream extent of each hydrogeomorphic reach thus individuals simulated under this behavior had a predictive sense of what direction to swim in based on the assumption that individuals optimize movement towards the ocean for simulated subyearling chinook salmon under the more complex behavioral rules e g kinesis and restricted area search individuals sensed and or predicted the growth rate potential of their environment individuals simulated using the kinesis behavior considered their immediate environment and their swim speed and direction were based on the computed rate of consumption of the current position against an optimal rate of consumption for individuals simulated using the restricted area search behavior they sensed their surrounding environment and evaluated the growth rate potential of the immediately neighboring elements where the average distance to neighbors was approximately 140 m while the restricted area search behavior accounted for both gains i e consumption and losses e g respiration egestion and excretion the kinesis behavior only considered gains 2 4 2 3 stochasticity simulations across the different behaviors were all started using the same random number seed the random seed was used to initialize the starting location initial lengths and weights and date of entry for each of the different behaviors that were simulated this means that all simulations started with the same initial conditions but they varied in the swimming behavior that was applied noise was also added to the model in the form of random noise that was added to individual swimming behavior 2 4 2 4 observation after every fifteen minute time step the location and the length and weight of each fish were recorded in addition environmental variables were stored including the temperature water depth and occupied element 2 4 3 details 2 4 3 1 initialization individuals were initiated in the upstream region of the model domain near bonneville dam at 45 38 06 n 121 57 41 w fig 1 using a normal distribution centered at this location with a standard deviation of 20 m in the horizontal vertical positions within the water column were initialized using a uniform distribution between 0 and 2 m below the surface initial fork lengths were based on daily fish condition fork length data collected at bonneville dam by the fish passage center smolt monitoring program the fork length data for subyearling chinook salmon showed an increasing trend over time to reduce the bias of these longer fork lengths when creating the distribution of subyearling chinook salmon starting lengths only fork length data through the end of august were considered the starting lengths were drawn from normal distributions for yearling chinook salmon μ 142 5 mm sd 18 7 mm and subyearling chinook salmon μ 95 6 mm sd 13 3 mm a truncated normal distribution with bounds at 61 mm and 140 mm was used for the subyearling chinook salmon to prevent lengths at the tails of the distribution this lower threshold also marks the difference between fingerlings and smaller emergent and resident frys simulation timing was based on the smolt index at bonneville dam from the fish passage center fig 4 the smolt index is based on pit tag detections at juvenile monitoring locations and factors in the flow magnitude to estimate the number of fish passing per day as not all fish are detected at the monitoring locations passage dates for subyearling chinook salmon prior to june were excluded when creating the run timing distribution as these detections are associated with juveniles from the previous year that were held over by hatcheries to be released as yearlings in fig 4 these larger individuals with earlier run timing are represented in the first two peaks although it is recognized that the timing of detections for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon do not follow normal distributions this distribution was used to initialize times of simulated passage at bonneville dam in the ibm using the mean and standard deviation of run timing normal distributions were generated for the yearling chinook salmon simulation dates μ 133 5 sd 13 days and subyearling chinook salmon simulation dates μ 185 5 sd 15 days as indicated in table 1 these distributions corresponded with initialization dates between march 13 july 5 centered on may 13 for yearling chinook salmon and april 25 september 4 centered on july 4 for subyearling chinook salmon while individuals may be detected at bonneville outside of these date ranges these periods pertain to the period when most individuals migrate the times of initialization were rounded to the nearest quarter hour to correspond with the fifteen minute time step of the hydrodynamic model output 2 4 3 2 input environmental variables e g water temperatures velocities water depths from the hydrodynamic model were used as model inputs wetland habitat data from the 2010 high resolution land cover data from lcep was used to generate p values used in the bioenergetics model representing a proxy of habitat quality this gis dataset was first described in simenstad et al 2011 where it was applied to a particular hydrogeomorphic reach the data include 26 different land cover classes including tidal and non tidal classes of coniferous deciduous shrub scrub and herbaceous habitat as well as classes more representative of substrates or anthropogenic uses e g agricultural impervious surface and developed juvenile salmon rely on food exported from emergent marsh habitat bottom et al 2005 and macroinvertebrates associated with such habitats serve as a significant dietary source bottom et al 2008 all wetland classes with the exception of upland habitats were merged into one wetland class and these data were then interpolated to the element centers 2 4 3 3 lagrangian transport sub model a lagrangian method was used to simulate fish movement due to advection the position at each time step was calculated from the previous time step according to 1 x t 1 x t u δ t 2 y t 1 y t v δ t 3 z t 1 z t w δ t velocities due to advection u v w were computed from spatial and temporal interpolation of the flow fields and the fish s location was updated using a runge kutta fourth order time integration method similar to the time step used in the hydrodynamic model a 36 s time step was used for interpolation this time step was preferred over the 15 min time step of the hydrodynamic model output because it improved the particle tracking skill in addition it reduced the frequency at which fish horizontally exited the domain or moved to dry elements which was a common occurrence especially in narrower reaches of the river if fish moved to a dry element or outside of the grid due to advection the intersection between the individual s pathway and the intersected element edge was computed and the tangential velocity was calculated to adjust the trajectory such that the individual maintained its position within the model domain 2 4 3 4 swimming behavior sub model swimming behavior was simulated using different movement models that varied based on assumptions about how juvenile chinook salmon use estuarine habitat it was assumed that yearling chinook salmon behaviors optimize efficient migration through the system while subyearling chinook salmon behaviors are more driven by the search for habitat where growth is optimized the movement models varied in complexity from simple random walks to more sophisticated behaviors that depended on local environmental conditions while predation is of concern in the system field data were not available at a high enough spatial and temporal resolution to inform the model in addition not enough is known about juvenile salmon predator avoidance swimming behaviors in the estuary for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon passive and random walk behaviors were simulated under the passive behavior individual movement was driven by advection only and no active swimming was included the simplest swimming behavior for both life history types was an uncorrelated and unbiased random walk where there was no behavioral response to external stimuli and the direction of movement was random codling et al 2008 willis 2011 this behavior was an effective null model allowing for comparisons against other swimming behaviors to assess whether or not more sophisticated models perform better than random movement humston et al 2004 watkins and rose 2013 random swimming was simulated by drawing a random swimming angle in the horizontal plane from a von mises distribution this circular normal distribution depends on two parameters μ and κ where μ represents the mean direction and κ represents the concentration around this direction to simulate uncorrelated and unbiased random movement μ and κ were both set to zero while fish move vertically based on flows vertical swimming was not included in the random walk behavior or other movement models in addition to the uncorrelated and unbiased random walk a biased correlated random walk bcrw was used for yearling chinook salmon it differed from the uncorrelated random walk because movement at each time step was correlated to the direction of movement in the previous time step leading to a local directional bias codling et al 2008 when correlation was high an individual maintained its heading whereas if correlation was near zero pathways appeared random correlated random walks are a popular choice for movement models as many animals tend to move forward in a persistent manner codling et al 2008 in addition to the directional persistence term this movement model included a directional bias such that movement was directed towards downstream locations these downstream locations may not always be fixed and instead can be adjusted based on an individual s location codling et al 2004 movement in the bcrw was calculated from a weighted sum of a persistence term and a navigation term according to the following equations bailey et al 2018 benhamou and bovet 1992 4 δ x t 1 x t l t 10 3 δ t w cos ω t ϕ n 1 w cos θ n δ n 5 δ y t 1 y t l t 10 3 δ t w sin ω t ϕ n 1 w sin θ n δ n where x and y are the locations lt is the fork length mm t is time w is a weighting term ω t is the target direction φ n is the navigation error term θn is the direction of movement in the previous step and δn is a persistence error term initial attempts to use the estuary mouth as a downstream target to orient fish towards when calculating the bias term were ineffective especially in the upstream reaches of the system due to the sinuosity of the river as well as the system s geographic extent multiple downstream locations were used to generate the bias term and the specific location used was dependent on the occupied hydrogeomorphic reach simenstad et al 2011 at each time step the direction to orient for the bias term i e angle between the current position and the reach s downstream location was calculated the persistence term was determined from the angle between the current position and the last position the bcrw employed here therefore incorporates a rheotactic response where the persistence term considers movement due to advection as well as powered swimming in addition to biased downstream movement the weighting term w was set to 0 1 and was based on values used in benhamou and bovet 1992 the navigation error term and the persistence error term both used a von mises distribution where κ the measure of concentration around the angle of movement equaled two the final movement model used for yearling chinook salmon was a taxis behavioral response to ambient flow environments this behavior was selected based on assumptions that yearlings time their migration to coincide with the spring freshet and typically spend less time in the estuary rheotaxis refers to a behavior where a fish aligns its swimming direction based on flows fraenkel and gunn 1940 and this behavior has been suggested as a strategy used by salmonids during their ocean migration booker et al 2008 burke et al 2014 mork et al 2012 royce et al 1968 and return migrations hamilton and mysak 1986 healey et al 2000 negative rheotaxis has also been suggested as a behavioral response to changing light conditions that encourages downstream movement in smolts cooke et al 2011 negative rheotaxis describes movement where fish orient themselves to swim in the direction of the prevailing current and positive rheotaxis describes movement where fish orient themselves to move against the current in this case negative rheotaxis was simulated such that yearling chinook salmon optimized their movement to align with the currents in upstream reaches of the system where river flows dominate swimming directions were associated with riverine flows in reaches where there is greater tidal forcing movement was more closely tied to the phase of the tide as individuals swim in the same direction that they are displaced by advection the angle of movement was computed from the horizontal velocity vectors at the currently occupied position with random noise added using a von mises distribution where κ equals two for subyearling chinook salmon passive and random walk behaviors were simulated in addition to kinesis and restricted area search swimming behaviors that depended on the expected consumption rate or growth rate the growth rate depends on water temperatures and the p value where high values are associated with wetland habitat the kinesis behavior entails movement that is responsive to ambient conditions but nondirectional while the restricted area search is more directional with the individual assessing nearby habitat for optimal environmental conditions and moving there kinesis behaviors result from an individual responding to environmental stimuli e g temperature salinity flows and either adjusting their speed orthokinesis or direction klinokinesis fraenkel and gunn 1940 kinesis behaviors are a popular choice in ibms see fiechter et al 2015b okunishi et al 2012 politikos et al 2015 rose et al 2015 watkins and rose 2017 swimming velocities consist of an inertial component as well as a random component defined as 6 v x t f x g x 7 v y t f y g y in this ibm the inertial components fx and fy were calculated as 8 f x v x t 1 h 1 i h 9 f y v y t 1 h 1 i h the random components gx and gy were calculated as 10 g x θ φ ε θ 1 h 2 i h 11 g y θ φ ε θ 1 h 2 i h variables in the above equations represent the following vx t 1 and vy t 1 are the x and y velocities during the last time step ih represents an index of habitat quality φ is the maximum sustained swimming speed and ε θ is a unit vector of a random angle generated using the von mises distribution h1 and h2 determine the height of the function and values used in humston et al 2000 and okunishi et al 2012 were used h1 0 75 h2 0 9 whereas most other swimming behaviors used a standard swim speed based on the assumption of 1 bl s 1 this behavioral model had an evolving swim speed that depended on habitat quality the maximum swimming speed used in this case was 4 bl s 1 when the inertial component was dominant the swimming velocities were reduced however when the random component was dominant the swimming velocities were closer to the maximum swimming speed values the inertial and random component depended on the habitat quality ih of the currently occupied element humston et al 2004 okunishi et al 2012 which was calculated as the product of two terms 12 i h i t i f where it is a temperature dependence function used to calculate consumption in the bioenergetics model and if is a metric representing prey availability since data on prey availability are limited for the entire estuary if in this ibm was equal to the p value of the occupied element that was based on the proximity to wetland habitat both it and if had theoretical maximums of 1 when ih was high movement was dominated by the inertial component and when ih was low movement was dominated by the random component the restricted area search behavior was slightly more complex than the kinesis behavior and consisted of an individual assessing the growth rate potential of the currently occupied element and all neighboring elements and moving to the element with the highest value humston et al 2004 railsback et al 1999 watkins and rose 2013 other ibms use metrics of habitat quality that are based on growth and mortality cues however this approach did not account for mortality the growth rate potential for each element was calculated using the depth averaged temperature at the element center the direction of swimming was computed based on the angle between the fish s current position and the center of the neighboring element with the highest growth rate potential stochastic noise was added using a von mises distribution where κ equals two velocity was computed as 13 v x t l i t 10 3 cos θ t ε 14 v y t l i t 10 3 sin θ t ε where v is the velocity m s 1 l is the body length in mm divided by 103 to convert to m θ is the angle between the current position and destination element and ε is stochastic noise for all movement models if the trajectory computed by swimming resulted in the fish exiting the domain or getting stranded on land the model continued to make attempts using different stochastic noise values until the trajectory resulted in the fish reaching a wet element if fish movement resulted in vertical exit from the river it was returned to the water surface if exiting at surface or to the bottom surface if exiting at bottom if an individual occupied an element that dried out at the next time step it was nudged to the nearest wet element 2 4 3 5 growth sub model the bioenergetics model relates the environmental conditions experienced during migration to individual growth allowing for an assessment of how simulated behaviors and migration pathways influence size and condition growth in the ibm was simulated using the wisconsin bioenergetics model hanson 1997 with parameters for chinook salmon defined in table 2 most of the original parameters described for adult chinook salmon were used stewart and ibarra 1991 with the exception of the temperature dependent consumption parameters that were more recently defined for subyearling chinook salmon plumb and moffitt 2015 weight w was computed according to the following 15 w t w t 1 c r s f u e p e f w t 1 where c is consumption r is respiration s is specific dynamic action f is egestion and u is excretion with c f and u in units of g prey g fish 1 d 1 and r in units of g o2 g fish 1 d 1 variables ep and ef represent the prey energy density and the fish energy density each of these variables was computed from temperature and mass dependent functions while reproduction is often included in this bioenergetics model it was not considered in this application the equations used in the wisconsin bioenergetics model were originally intended for a daily time step however growth in the ibm was computed every 15 min thus the final growth term was divided by 96 consumption was calculated according to 16 c c m a x p f t 17 c m a x a c w b c where c is the specific consumption rate g g 1d 1 cmax is the maximum specific feeding rate g g 1 d 1 p is the proportion of maximum consumption f t is a temperature dependence function t is water temperature c w is fish mass g ac is the intercept of the allometric mass function and bc is the slope of the allometric mass function the temperature dependence function used in this application was eq 3 temperature dependence for cool and cold water species thornton and lessem 1978 this function was also used in the kinesis model when calculating habitat quality respiration the energy used for routine metabolism depends on the water temperature and the fish s size and activity the total metabolism includes routine metabolism and digestion i e specific dynamic action sda energy lost to respiration was determined by multiplying the mass dependent resting metabolism component by a temperature dependence function and activity component 18 r a r w b r f t a c t i v i t y where r is respiration g g 1d 1 ar is the intercept of the allometric mass function w is weight g br is the slope of the allometric function f t is a temperature dependence function and activity is an activity multiplier that depends on the swimming speed cm s 1 of the fish the temperature dependence function used in the ibm was eq 1 exponential with swimming speed stewart et al 1983 while the velocity used in the kinesis model was variable an approach similar to that used in humston et al 2004 was used such that vel is set to 1 bl s 1 since the effect of swimming velocity on metabolism was less important than the effect of swimming behavior on simulated estuarine migration pathways and residence times this helped to eliminate differences across the subyearling chinook salmon movement models sda is equal to a proportion of energy consumed and was calculated according to 19 s s d a c f egestion f and excretion u depend on mass temperature and ration elliott 1976 and were calculated as follows 20 f a f t b f e g f p c 21 u a u t b u e g u p c f where af is the intercept of the proportion of consumed energy egested versus water temperature and ration bf is the coefficient of water temperature dependence of egestion and gf is the coefficient for feeding level dependence of egestion variables au bu and gu are similarly defined but for excretion outputs from the bioenergetics equations were converted from units of g g 1 d 1 to units of j g 1 d 1 by multiplying consumption c egestion f and excretion u by the prey energy density prey energy densities were based on a common prey type of juvenile chinook chironomid pupae diptera for which typical energy densities are 3400 j g 1 koehler et al 2006 respiration was also converted to units of j g 1d 1 by applying the oxy calorific coefficient 13 560 j g 1 o2 to convert the oxygen consumed to energy consumed hanson 1997 stewart et al 1983 once units were converted growth in g d 1 was calculated by dividing by the fish energy density and multiplying by the mass of the fish energy density was calculated as 22 e f α β w where ef is the fish energy density j g 1 α is the intercept of the allometric mass function β is the slope of the allometric mass function and w is the fish mass g to obtain the weight of the fish at each time step the computed growth was added to the weight at the previous time step depending on whether or not loss terms were greater than consumption terms the fish either lost or gained weight data on subyearling and yearling chinook salmon fork lengths from the lower estuary were used to generate a weight length relationship equation and this equation was then used to compute fork length from the new weight increases in length due to weight gain were calculated according to 23 w a l b where w is the mass of the fish g α is the intercept l is the length mm and b is the slope the slope and intercept were determined using observed length weight data and eq 23 was rearranged to solve for l 24 l w e 12 27476 1 3 18421 although fish weight can fluctuate their length cannot decrease as their weight decreases thus a fish was only allowed to increase in length if it was greater or equal to the expected weight for a fish of its size if the weight was greater or equal to this expected value the fish increased in length however if the weight was less than this expected value its length remained the same 2 5 analysis to assess the skill of the passive particle tracking model particles were simulated in a forward pattern during low and high flow periods for one two and three days the tracks generated by the forward particle tracking were compared against backward tracks that were initialized from the final positions of the forward tracks to evaluate skill the distances between the starting positions from the forward tracking and final positions from the backward tracking were computed the two periods simulated were a low flow period in april and a high flow period in june corresponding with the freshet simulations were conducted for various lengths of time to explore how the simulation length and distances traveled impacted model skill results from yearling and subyearling chinook salmon simulations were analyzed by describing estuarine residence times travel times to various locations throughout the estuary and growth model results were compared against observed travel times from the pair trawl as well as travel times from jsats data the comparison between simulated migration timing and observed migration timing was done by comparing bulk statistics and it should be noted that direct comparisons between model results and observations were not achievable in this application there were also temporal differences between the observations and the model results the timing of the pair trawl experiment march 23 through august 4 differed from the timing of individual initializations at bonneville for yearling chinook salmon march 13 july 5 and subyearling chinook salmon april 25 september 4 but despite this all individuals were considered as there was not significant variability in travel times to jones beach over time jsats data collection did not commence until late april since the observed detections at the jsats arrays occurred from april 29 june 15 for yearling chinook salmon and june 14 august 15 for subyearling chinook salmon only simulated fish that were active in the estuary during these periods were considered in model data comparisons with the jsats data lastly the subyearling chinook salmon targeted in the jsats study were larger than simulated subyearling chinook salmon but this size difference was not accounted for in the analysis in addition results from simulations were analyzed by visualizing common migration pathways and comparing against migration pathways described in harnish et al 2012 the impacts of environmental conditions on potential estuarine migration pathways were explored by analyzing the estuarine residence times against river flows at initialization and the tides at the time of marine entry the effects of swimming behaviors were explored with a greater emphasis on how behaviors of varying complexity influence migration patterns and travel rates and how they compare with observations and less on identifying the correct mechanisms that control behavioral decision making the ibm was intended to be used as an exploratory tool to assess the efficiency of behavioral mechanisms on simulating potential migration pathways of different life history types comparisons of more sophisticated movement models against passive and random walk simulations made it possible to determine if simple swimming behaviors and or passive drift adequately simulated migration histories or if more complex behaviors were appropriate data from the 2010 pair trawl study as well as pit tag detections from bonneville dam were downloaded from ptagis as there were often multiple detections of a single tag at one monitoring location the last record was used such that each tag only had one unique result at each location data from bonneville dam juvenile stations and the pair trawl twx were joined using the tag code identification number and the travel time to jones beach was computed by subtracting the time of detection at bonneville from the time of detection by the pair trawl travel times to jones beach for simulated fish were determined by calculating the time at which individuals passed 123 16 50 541 the approximate longitudinal location of jones beach fig 1 jsats data were downloaded from jsite and travel times between cross channel arrays were computed for rkm 86 50 rkm 50 37 rkm 37 22 and rkm 22 8 at each upstream array the time of last detection was computed for all individuals and at each downstream array the time of first detection was calculated in instances where individuals were detected by both the navigation channel array and peripheral channel array in the same general longitudinal location e g rkm 50 rkm 37 rkm 22 rkm 8 individuals were assigned to the upstream array where the last detection occurred when computing the time of first detection at the downstream array it was therefore necessary to factor in the time of last detection at the upstream array to ensure that all travel times reflected downstream movement prior to this consideration some of the travel times between downstream and upstream arrays were negative because the tides would transport fish near the estuary mouth back into the estuary and past the upstream array where it was already detected since a fish may have passed an upstream array multiple times due to the tides it was necessary to account for this pattern of movement when computing first and last detection times in addition the time of detection at the downstream array considered all detections for that unique rkm e g rkm 50 37 22 and 8 and did not distinguish between the main or navigation channel this method was implemented for both the jsats data and simulated fish for a more detailed description of how jsats travel times and pathways were calculated see harnish et al 2012 3 results 3 1 particle tracking skill errors in particle tracking can potentially distort simulated migration pathways in significant ways to assess tracking skill we used a closure approach where once a forward track was concluded we backward track from the end position to reconstruct the starting position at the starting time the distance between the original and reconstructed starting positions should be zero the larger the distance is the lesser the skill during low flow periods the particle tracking skill was high especially when only one or two days were simulated table 3 the mean skill was 0 16 0 38 0 39 m for the one day and two day low flow simulations model skill decreased as the simulation length increased with the mean distance between the starting forward positions and final backward positions increasing to 153 29 1377 06 m the particle tracking skill was also less during the high flow period where error was several orders of magnitude greater than the error during low flow periods with mean values ranging from 1122 28 m for the one day simulation up to 11 367 60 m for the three day simulation distances traveled were much greater during the high flow periods and were often twice as much as the distances traveled during low flow periods especially in the upper reaches of the river with the increases in flows and distances traveled the likelihood of particles exiting the domain was higher during the high flow period which could allow small errors in trajectories to be propagated over time when conducting backtracking in addition during the high flow period there were more particles that entered the ocean and backtracking from these initial positions could further introduce large errors especially if the particles did not return to the estuary 3 2 travel times residence and migration pathways 3 2 1 travel times travel times were considered for multiple regions including the upper estuary between bonneville dam and jones beach the region sampled by the pair trawl travel times and migration pathways were also described for the lower estuary between rkm 86 and various locations in the main channel and peripheral channels at rkm 50 37 22 and 8 travel times to the pair trawl and between jsats arrays were right skewed and not normally distributed so median values are described in addition means and standard deviations are reported in table 4 for reference the median travel time for yearling chinook salmon observed in the pair trawl experiment was 2 00 days n 3632 across all yearling chinook salmon simulations median travel times to jones beach ranged from 2 10 to 2 49 days table 4 fig 5 with values of 2 40 days for the passive particle simulation and 2 49 for the random walk simulation the more complex yearling chinook salmon behaviors including negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk resulted in reduced median travel times of 2 17 and 2 10 days median travel time from the pair trawl experiment for subyearling chinook salmon detected from march 23 through august 4 was 2 07 days n 461 the simulated travel times to jones beach for subyearling chinook salmon were slightly longer than observed values and were fairly similar to those of yearling chinook salmon table 4 fig 5 median travel times from the passive and random walk simulations were 2 23 and 2 27 days fish simulated using the kinesis behavior had a median travel time of 2 39 days travel times for the restricted area search behavior were longer than the other movement model travel times with a median value of 3 04 days this behavior was also much more right tailed than the others while there was a discrepancy in the temporal overlap between observed and simulated data overall there was very little difference between the observed yearling chinook salmon travel times and subyearling chinook salmon travel times from the pair trawl it s also important to note that the sample sizes between the two were not equivalent and that yearling chinook salmon were the life history type of interest during the pair trawl experiments in general the median travel times to jones beach from the ibm were consistently greater than median observed travel times to jones beach however this difference in travel times was on the scale of hours for both the yearling and subyearling chinook salmon passive simulations travel times due to passive drift were fairly close to the median observed travel times this suggests that passive drift alone could be largely responsible for travel times through upstream reaches of the system and that swimming behavior while important may not be as important of a driver however it s also important to note that the passive behavior was not as right skewed as the observations suggesting that passive drift does not capture the variability in travel times that is more evident in the observations and active swimming behaviors travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon from harnish et al 2012 as well as simulated travel times across behaviors are described for various segments of the lower estuary in table 5 and shown in figs 6 and 7 with the array locations shown in fig 1 in general travel times for simulated yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were within several hours of the observed travel times most simulated travel times were several hours longer than the observed travel times with the exception of the travel times between the navigation channel at rkm 50 to rkm 37 and the north channel near the washington shoreline between rkm 22 and rkm 8 travel times from clifton channel cc50 to rkm 37 were much greater for simulated yearling and subyearling chinook salmon with the exception of the biased correlated random walk behavior the median observed travel times between the navigation channel at rkm 86 and rkm 50 for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were 12 4 and 12 2 h simulated median travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon between these points ranged from 14 9 17 4 h and 15 2 17 2 h median observed travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook from the navigation channel at rkm 50 to rkm 37 were 4 5 and 5 1 h while simulated median travel times ranged from 3 0 3 6 h for yearling chinook salmon and 3 3 7 9 h for subyearling chinook salmon the travel times from clifton channel cc 50 to rkm 37 were often twice as long for simulated chinook salmon in addition the proportion of simulated fish detected in clifton channel was much less than the proportion of observed juvenile chinook salmon detected in this peripheral channel from the navigation channel at rkm 37 to rkm 22 the median observed travel times for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were 11 9 h and 12 7 h for the passive and random walk yearling behaviors simulated travel times in this reach were nearly twice as long as observed values while the travel times for the negative taxis and biased correlated random walk behaviors were approximately three hours longer the simulated travel times for subyearling chinook salmon were up to four hours longer in this reach with the exception of the area search behavior that was over twice the observed rate from cathlamet bay at rkm 37 to rkm 22 observed travel times were 9 3 and 10 3 h and most simulated behaviors for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were approximately three hours longer except the area search behavior median travel times from the navigation channel from rkm 22 to rkm 8 were 2 8 and 4 0 h for observed yearling chinook salmon and subyearling chinook salmon the simulated travel times for the passive and random walk yearling chinook salmon behaviors through this reach were several hours longer while those of the negative taxis and biased correlated random walk behaviors were just over an hour longer for simulated subyearling chinook salmon in this reach the median travel times for the passive random walk and area search behaviors were within minutes to an hour of the observed travel times while the time of the kinesis behavior was over twice as long the median travel times between rkm 22 along the washington side wa 22 to rkm 8 were 2 2 and 2 1 h for observed yearling and subyearling chinook salmon and median simulated times ranged from 1 9 2 0 h for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon within this region median simulated travel times were nearly identical to the median observed times and there was very little variation across the behaviors suggesting that behavioral effects in this region were minimal and that physical processes dominate in general the travel times for simulated yearling chinook salmon were consistently reduced for the negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk behaviors compared to the passive and random walk behaviors in the rkm 50 to rkm 37 reach the simulated travel times for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon were less than observed travel times the behavior that stood out as the most variable from observations was the restricted area search because of the longer travel times between arrays 3 2 2 estuarine residence times estuarine residence times for yearling chinook salmon did not vary significantly across the different swimming behaviors table 4 fig 8 in the passive particle simulation the median time to estuarine exit was 5 11 days and the median distance traveled per day was 55 87 km the random walk behavior resulted in slightly longer estuarine residence times of 5 38 days and a slightly decreased rate of travel of 53 48 km d 1 the median estuarine residence times of the negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk were slightly decreased at 4 92 and 4 78 days respectively with median travel rates of 61 11 and 61 27 km d 1 this difference in distances traveled between the passive and random walk simulations and the more sophisticated behaviors was due to the behavioral response of orienting movement based on the direction of prevailing currents and resulting directional biases median estuarine residence times for simulated subyearling chinook salmon were close to simulated yearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times and with the exception of the restricted area search behavior did not differ significantly across swimming behaviors table 4 fig 8 median estuarine residence times were 4 83 days for the passive behavior 4 96 days for the random walk behavior 5 24 days for the kinesis behavior and 9 34 days for the restricted area search behavior the median distance traveled per day in the restricted area search behavior 33 51 km d 1 was significantly less than the distances traveled in the simpler behavioral models and kinesis model 54 86 58 83 km d 1 while the medians were more appropriate to report as the data were not normally distributed the variability in subyearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times was especially evident when comparing the means and standard deviations the restricted area search behavior mean residence time and standard deviation were between 3 4 times greater than the other behaviors with values of 22 51 25 98 days longer estuarine residence times are typical for subyearling chinook salmon so longer estuarine residence times observed in the restricted area search behavior suggest that swimming behavior can have an important influence on residence times flow magnitude largely influenced simulated estuarine residence times for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon fig 9 and this was especially evident for the yearling chinook salmon behaviors passive particle simulations for both yearling and subyearling chinook salmon and the random walk and kinesis behaviors for subyearling chinook salmon for the restricted area search behavior estuarine residence times were mostly reduced when river discharge at the time of release was greater than 8000 m3 s 1 and when flows were less than this threshold residence times were much longer the phase of the tide also impacted the timing of marine entry as most yearling and subyearling chinook salmon exited the estuary during the ebb phase fig 10 for several of the behaviors e g negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk this behavior was built in as fish oriented their swimming direction to move in the direction of prevailing currents however even for behaviors where swimming was not based on the flow direction most fish exited during the ebb phase since flow velocities in the lower estuary were high when both river discharge and tidal velocities directed flows seaward fish movement would be largely driven by advection and behavioral effects would likely be insignificant 3 2 3 migration pathways migration pathways were analyzed across simulated yearling and subyearling chinook salmon behaviors by examining the common routes used with a particular emphasis on the lower estuary in general yearling chinook salmon migration pathways were concentrated in the navigation channel before passing through the tidal flats into the north channel fig 11 there was minimal transport into the lateral bays in the passive simulation with the exception of baker bay migration pathways for the random walk simulation did not differ much from the passive particle pathways although there were slightly greater concentrations in the lateral bays in the more complex yearling chinook salmon behaviors negative rheotaxis and the biased correlated random walk individuals were concentrated in the navigation channel and the north channel while patterns were fairly similar to those seen in the passive and random walk simulations there was less concentration in the tidal flats and accumulation in baker bay and greater presence in cathlamet bay lastly most individuals near the estuary mouth traveled from the north channel as opposed to the navigation channel at rkm 22 suggesting that fish move from the navigation channel across the tidal flats to the north channel migration pathways for the subyearling chinook salmon passive and random walk behaviors showed similar patterns to the yearling chinook salmon behaviors with pathways concentrated in the navigation channel across the tidal flats and in the north channel fig 12 the kinesis behavior also showed concentrated migration pathways in these regions in addition to cathlamet bay there were some regions in youngs bay and cathlamet bay where individuals simulated using the kinesis behavior accumulated suggesting that flows in these regions were minimal and the connectivity across wet elements was reduced migration pathways for the restricted area search behavior differed drastically from the other subyearling chinook salmon behaviors since individuals were directed to regions with high growth rate potential pathways for this behavior were predominantly in shallow regions of the lower estuary and the lateral bays in particular these habitats were used more extensively than the navigation channel which helps to explain the longer residence times using this behavior as well as the minimal distances traveled on average when compared to other subyearling chinook salmon behaviors 3 2 4 growth daily growth was similar across the different yearling chinook salmon swimming behaviors with median values of 0 20 mm d 1 table 4 while most individuals grew throughout the simulation some simulated yearling chinook salmon did not increase in fork length at all minimal differences in simulated growth rates across these behaviors were likely due to the similar temperatures experienced by migrating individuals especially since most simulated yearling chinook salmon remained in the main channel regions and had similar travel times through the lower estuary even though the estuarine residence times for some of the subyearling chinook salmon behaviors e g random walk kinesis were fairly similar to the yearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times daily growth was often greater with median values ranging from 0 30 0 33 mm d 1 table 4 this was most likely due to differences in temperatures based on the timing of the simulations where subyearling chinook salmon experienced warmer temperatures throughout their migration the restricted area search behavior simulated for subyearling chinook salmon resulted in the highest median growth rate of 0 48 mm d 1 individuals simulated under the kinesis behavior had slightly greater growth rates than the random behavior however growth rates were still less than the area search behavior although both the kinesis and restricted area search behavior were designed to optimize growth the kinesis behavior was more reactive to environmental conditions experienced while the restricted area search behavior had a directional bias to move to regions with the highest growth rate potential this directional bias resulted in greater time spent in optimal temperatures and habitats resulting in greater growth 4 discussion results from the simulations indicate that estuarine residence times are strongly influenced by riverine flow previous work that quantified nursery habitat for the columbia river estuary found river forcing to be a dominant driver while the tides were a predominant force in lower reaches rostaminia 2017 across all simulated behaviors for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon estuarine residence times were less when flows were greater 8000 m3 s during periods of high discharge estuarine residence times were mostly on the order of days these results are consistent with those of kärnä and baptista 2016b that show residence times being on the order of days in the system the different simulated yearling chinook salmon behaviors did not show significant variability in travel times to jones beach or estuarine residence times however the more complex swimming behaviors that factored in directional and navigational biases and or the direction of the prevailing currents resulted in reduced travel times and estuarine residence this highlights the influence of swimming behavior for yearling chinook salmon in that some behaviors optimize movement to remain in the main channels and outside of peripheral channels evidence of simulated yearling chinook salmon present in cathlamet bay across the movement models suggests that once juveniles enter the lower estuary they are no longer confined to main channels and instead may move into lateral bays both due to environmental forcing and swimming behavior the presence of yearling chinook salmon in cathlamet bay also suggests that they may utilize wetland habitats and may be directed to these regions both through advective processes and swimming behavior this supports recent work that has challenged the existing paradigm that yearling chinook salmon do not utilize wetland habitats across the subyearling chinook salmon swimming behaviors there was little variability across the passive random walk and kinesis behaviors however the restricted area search behavior differed significantly from those behaviors leading to longer estuarine residence increased growth and decreased daily travel rates the longer residence times increased growth and shorter distances traveled were likely associated with the occupation of peripheral habitats and lateral bays e g cathlamet bay where waters tend to be older kärnä and baptista 2016b by occupying waters where flows are reduced individuals are less likely to be rapidly flushed and thus their estuarine residence times may be extended in addition individuals were more likely to occupy shallower habitats where temperatures and the availability of food resources derived from wetland habitat were more optimal for growth although the restricted area search behavior was effective at directing individuals to productive shallow habitats it often resulted in aggregation in regions of local optima while this positively contributed to growth once individuals occupied an area where potential growth rates were high there was no incentive to search for new habitat in most cases flow velocities and randomness in the swimming behavior would limit long term aggregation however in regions with frequent wetting and drying where flows were minimal fish could easily be artificially retained previous attempts at developing a restricted area search behavior used different criteria based on nursery habitat that was computed from depth velocity salinity and temperature criteria but these habitats were extremely patchy directing individuals to these regions without secondary cues resulted in minimal occupation of optimal habitats using a secondary cue of searching for shallow habitat was effective in directing individuals to regions with good nursery habitat but frequently resulted in significant stranding because once fish encountered shallow habitat they tended to stay there in these regions water velocities were reduced and therefore fish moved less due to advection their swimming behavior became more of a driving force when the behavior directs individuals to local optima there is nothing to prompt movement outside of the optima especially if flows remain low this was also an issue when using the growth rate potential however there were a lot fewer fish that got stuck in extremely shallow habitats under this method additional behaviors were attempted to keep individuals from getting stuck yet they remained ineffective in leading individuals to exit the estuary there are several large scale drivers that influence migration behavior including some genetic component that entices individuals to move while individuals may spend various amounts of time in good habitat eventually they will be prompted to exit the estuary although the restricted area search behavior was effective at reproducing expected distributions of subyearling chinook salmon in shallow habitats it was not effective for simulating departure from these optimal habitats and thus may be limited when simulating a migratory species that exits the system future attempts should consider using a size dependent time dependent or duration dependent behavior within the restricted area search behavior to avoid accumulation in certain regions while it was expected that the kinesis simulations might increase the likelihood of fish encountering wetland habitat the reduced residence times for this simulation suggest that was not the case with regards to observed estuarine residence times there have not been many studies that have documented travel times between bonneville dam and the estuary mouth as most studies have focused on particular reaches of the estuary e g bonneville dam to jones beach carter et al 2009 found that smolts pass through the estuary more quickly during periods of high discharge and later in the migration season and that yearling chinook salmon migrate at rates of 60 km day between vancouver washington and the estuary mouth these results correspond with results for simulated yearling chinook salmon where individuals that migrate later and during periods of high discharge have shorter estuarine residence times and average distances traveled are on the order of 55 65 km d 1 mccomas et al 2008 found that acoustic tagged subyearling chinook salmon moved quickly through the system to the river mouth with a mean travel time of 4 1 days this is fairly close to the estuarine residence times of the simpler simulated subyearling chinook salmon behaviors e g passive random walk and kinesis when comparing the observed travel times against simulated travel times to jones beach there was fairly close agreement between observed and modeled values for the yearling chinook salmon especially in the negative rheotaxis and biased correlated random walk although the sample size for subyearling chinook salmon in the pair trawl was small there was also fairly close agreement between observed values and simulated values for the passive random walk and kinesis behaviors in addition the simulated travel times were within range of observed travel times described from the jsats data and the preferred migration pathways from simulations i e greater occupation of navigation channel and wa 22 were also seen in the observations although direct comparisons with observed data were not possible in this application the proximity of simulated travel times against observed travel times is a promising result and suggests that an ibm can be an effective tool for exploring migratory behavior of juvenile chinook salmon in an estuarine environment simulated growth rates in the ibm for subyearling chinook salmon were within the range of growth rates reported from field observations while those for yearling chinook salmon were typically less than observed rates rich 1920 estimated growth rates of 0 44 mm d 1 from rkm 261 to the river mouth while other studies have identified growth rates of 0 25 and 0 31 mm d 1 mccabe et al 1986 roegner et al 2012 campbell 2010 studied otolith derived growth estimates and determined mean daily growth rates of 0 41 mm d 1 for juvenile salmon in saline portions of the estuary mcnatt et al 2016 documented mean growth rates of 0 49 0 58 mm d 1 for juveniles residing in wetlands with length increases by as much as 10 20 mm for juveniles remaining in wetland areas longer than 15 days additional growth rates estimated from otolith analysis were on average 0 5 mm d 1 bottom et al 2008 while it may be challenging to validate growth rates from the ibm the growth rates were within the range of observed values which lends support to the ibm being an effective tool for exploring how the estuary supports growth of juvenile chinook salmon during their migration 4 1 limitations ibms have become an increasingly popular approach for simulating animal behavior and for exploring ecological questions they offer a means by which we can test hypotheses and investigate how environmental processes and individual behavior influence population level dynamics despite advances in modeling techniques and computing power ibms continue to be limited since modeling relies on assumptions and simplification of behaviors ibms should not be expected to exactly mimic nature however they can be effective in answering questions that might be difficult to investigate using observations or eulerian modeling techniques this paper highlights the functionality of an ibm to investigate estuarine migration patterns of juvenile chinook salmon but it is important to note the limitations of our model and ibms in general as juvenile chinook salmon migrate from freshwater to brackish and increasingly marine waters their behavior changes in response to ambient conditions while the ibm effectively approximates movement it is not a realistic representation of actual swimming behaviors through an evolving environment the ibm is certainly an improvement from eulerian based methods that quantify salmon habitat for juvenile chinook salmon but there are still limits on its utility furthermore juvenile chinook salmon likely employ multiple strategies as they migrate through the system and rely on multiple cues simultaneously when making movement decisions their needs change over time and they switch modes multiple times during their migration from focusing on downstream movement to feeding and predator avoidance in addition there are larger scale processes that influence their behavior as well as their genetically driven urge to migrate to the ocean these environmental and behavioral drivers are constantly at play in different degrees since models are designed to simplify behavior to help us understand some of these dynamics they will never accurately capture all of the more complex processes at play while including the bioenergetics model was a necessary component especially as it influenced the swim speeds there were limitations in how it was implemented all of the standard equations used in the model worked well however the way in which prey energy density was approximated was overly simple a constant prey energy density was used and the p value which controls the amount of energy was based on proximity to wetland habitat these methods of oversimplifying the bioenergetics model were somewhat necessary as high resolution data on salmon prey in the columbia river estuary are limited however this oversimplification likely influenced results for individual growth and may explain why yearling chinook salmon growth showed such little variation and why the restricted area search behavior led to such high growth rates although simulated behaviors produced results that were within the range of observed travel times model results should be interpreted with caution because predator avoidance was not considered as a behavioral response and the cumulative effects of predation on migration patterns were not represented predation and mortality were not included in this version of the model due to the lack of high resolution spatial and temporal observations on these top down drivers in addition not enough is known about how juvenile chinook salmon swimming behavior is influenced by predator avoidance particularly in a system where flow velocities are so high even though information may be lacking we acknowledge that predator avoidance could play a role in residence times and preferred migration pathways the hydrodynamic model used as the virtual environment for the ibm had some limitations including the lack of freshwater flows imposed in the model that limited circulation in the smaller tributaries in the lateral bays this led to the accumulation of passive particles or simulated fish in the shallowest upstream reaches of these tributaries kärnä and baptista 2016b mention that hydrodynamic model results in the lateral bays may not be reliable due to the lack of freshwater input and because of issues with the wetting drying method which is consistent with issues encountered in this work in addition most of the model skill validation for the circulation model focused on the main channels or deeper locations in the lateral bays thus it is difficult to assess the skill of the circulation model in shallow regions lastly the resolution of the bathymetry and size of the grid in shallow regions was limited which affected migration pathways in shallow regions with regards to model data comparisons the pair trawl and jsats data were very valuable however the fish targeted in these studies were often not representative of the full diversity of sizes and life histories present in the estuary instead they primarily targeted larger juveniles that remained in the main channels in general acoustic telemetry studies are rare in shallow habitats however there are some exceptions johnson et al 2015 mcnatt et al 2016 data describing travel times are likely inappropriate to apply to smaller subyearling chinook salmon as they have longer residence times and are less likely to be tagged see bottom et al 2005 similarly many of these tagging studies target fish from hatcheries and thus are not necessarily representative of behaviors associated with wild type chinook salmon 5 conclusions an ibm was developed to explore estuarine migration pathways residence times and growth of juvenile chinook salmon migrating through the columbia river estuary multiple behaviors were implemented ranging from random behaviors to more sophisticated behaviors that either optimized efficient migration through the system or opportunities for growth simulated behaviors for juvenile yearling chinook salmon that optimized rapid migration outperformed the passive drift and random walk simulation due to reduced residence times similarly the behaviors implemented for subyearling chinook salmon that optimized increased growth resulted in higher growth rates when compared to the random walk behavior in most simulations residence times were on the order of days river discharge had a strong influence on residence times and during periods of high discharge residence times were reduced while the model does have many limitations in its current implementation it was effective for investigating how juvenile chinook salmon respond to environmental forcing and behavioral controls river discharge was a strong driver of residence times however active swimming and behavioral decisions made by individuals were also important in driving potential migratory pathways the availability of pit tag and jsats tag data allowed for an in depth model data comparison consistent patterns in migration pathways and travel times between the simulated individuals and observed individuals suggest that this ibm could be used to

24857,petrels and penguins form the clade austrodyptornithes the add my pet collection of referenced data and dynamic energy budget deb parameters presently has 64 members of this clade adaptations to their wandering life style could now be studied i here try to characterise this clade from an energy perspective it turned out that petrels are in several respects extreme among birds showing adaptations to life at low mean food levels penguins show the same tendency but less extreme almost all petrel species show a weight reduction well prior to fledging till the adult weight this permanent weight reduction suggests that the mean adult feeding level is about 80 of the maximum one this pattern is well captured by the standard deb model in which energy reserve plays an important role they also have relatively large eggs and long incubation times and low reproduction rates i argue that large eggs minimize the age at fledging given that a particular maturity threshold needs to be reached for fledging austrodyptornithes have a high age at puberty which in combination with low reproduction rates causes very low maximum population growth rates the energy allocation to reproduction for petrels is typical among birds so the low reproduction rates are the results of the large eggs another adaptation to low mean food levels is the large stomach gut capacity which appeared to be coupled to a high reserve capacity this points to be an adaptation to a patchy occurrence of their food probably in combination with spells of poor weather conditions for feeding petrels have a high supply stress and altriciality coefficient compared to birds while penguins are a very small altriciality coefficient this reflects a very high maturity level at puberty for both taxa in combination with high maturity level at birth for petrels and a typical one for penguins they have a relatively long life span compared to other birds but not extreme the relative egg size of penguins is typical for birds to smaller than typical penguins combine small eggs with long foraging trips while small young need frequent feeding they evolved two adaptation for this crop milk feeding and collecting lipid rich food for their offspring the energetic differences that have been found between petrels and penguins may directly relate to feeding in surface waters by petrels and in deeper waters by penguins seasonal fluctuations in food density are more pronounced in surface waters the higher clades aequornithes and aequorlitornithes are in many respect intermediate between austrodyptornithes and other birds demonstrating a clear taxonomic coherence in energy parameters keywords dynamic energy budget theory add my pet life at low food reserve capacity low max population

earth context in kooijman 2004 the amp collection is about parameter values of deb models for animal species and referenced data and implied properties marques et al 2018 we did something similar for fish kooijman and lika 2014 although amp had 64 fish species in 2014 and presently 567 are tubenoses procellariiformes and the closely related penguins sphenisciformes with which they form the clade austrodyptornithes special in terms of values of deb parameters compared to the higher clade aequornithes mayr 2017 or to the even higher clade aequorlitornithes see table 1 and finally to the birds aves themselves all austrodyptornithes are outspoken colony breeding seabirds schreiber and burger 2001 but can we find energetic differences between petrels and penguins birds are together with mammals special among animals because they are near the demand end of the supply demand spectrum lika et al 2014 advanced forms of endothermy being an aspect kooijman 2010 moreover they are unique by reaching ultimate weight very early in their development well before puberty and having a high body temperature compared to mammals after birth kooijman 1986b 2009 this allows for short incubation times given the relatively large size of their eggs fish are more typical among animals by having a length at puberty about half their ultimate length kooijman and lika 2014 meaning that they still grow by a factor 2 in length or 8 in weight during the reproductive stage birds evolved from precocial to altricial development while mammals did the opposite we now have a good explanation for this augustine et al 2019 involving adaptation to life in forests for birds where they developed the highest diversity the forest dwelling passeriformes are by far the largest bird order with 60 of all bird species and very altricial this crown group of birds all have a very similar anatomy mayr 2013 which is possibly link to life in trees anisodactyl feet syrinx small body size short round wings high water content of neonate tissues faecal sacks advanced forms of parental care including territorial defence austrodyptornithes however did not evolve an intimate dependency on plants but specialised in life with open oceans more generally the aequorlitornithes the water and shore birds with some 7 of the bird species also did not focus on woody plants which contrasts them with passerines this divergence in bird evolution adds to the significance of the topic of this paper full grown petrels span a weight range from 19 5 g for the least storm petrel halocyptena microsoma to 8700 g for the southern royal albatross diomedea epomophora this is the largest weight range within any bird order warham 1990 the range for the penguins is 1500 g for the little penguin eudyptula minor to 45000 g for the emperor penguin aptenodytes forsteri the weight range of a factor 2300 for the austrodyptornithes makes them excellent candidates for a study on energetics since many aspects have a direct link with body size kooijman 1986a the next section first gives some background to the patterns in parameter values that have been found 2 methods the standard amp procedure was followed by composing for each species a mydata file with data from the literature on energetics and life history a predict file that computes predictions for this data given parameter values and a pars init file which specifies initial parameter guesses marques et al 2018 2019 the debtool software then computes parameter estimates and the results are copied into the pars init file these parameters are subsequently used to predict a wide variety of traits some of which are discussed here the amp website anonymous 2020a lists several dozen of traits of each species but amptool anonymous 2020b can list well over 100 traits per species that can be used to study effects of temperature and food availability except for figs 1 and 7 all figures in this paper relate to deb based expectations not to empirical data the mean relative error of all predictions for the all austrodyptornithes data is only 0 078 the paper compares relationships between traits for the various taxa in log transformed scatter plots although standard practice in the ecological literature is to apply forms of statistical testing to arrive at conclusions from this type of plots this is not done here the reason is that this is not possible since this paper makes the point that related species tend to have similar deb parameter values this not only holds for petrels but for all animals as shown in co variation patterns of parameter values augustine et al 2019 kooijman 2013 2014 lika et al 2014 and since traits are function of parameters this also holds for traits a newly developed method for the estimation of deb parameters in a multi species context even exploits this principle lika et al 2020 an implication is however that the various points in a scatter plot for different species are statistically dependent while all statistical tests assume independence ignoring this important fact results of such statistical tests are misleading to capture the weight reduction prior to fledging the scaled function response i e food intake as fraction of the maximum possible one for an individual of that size was taken to be a first order spline function which equals 1 from birth to some time point prior to fledging and an estimated lower value for at or after fledging fig 1 shows that this procedure results in a nice fit to data the estimated scaled functional responses at fledging as reported in table 2 were obtained by interpolation in this spline function since birds become endothermic after birth while their heating capacity typically falls short the body temperature is frequently lower than the target temperature just after birth konarzewski and kooijman 1994 kooijman 1994 2010 resulting in a temporarily reduced growth rate kooijman 2014 despite continued brooding by the parents this effect was not clearly present in the data for austrodyptornithes so it was assumed that the body temperature was directly on target at birth and constant this is doubtlessly a simplification in this particular case for austrodyptornithes i searched the literature for data on all the 165 extant species some species might have escaped but i have the impression that the collection is rather complete in terms of published data at present 2020 01 01 that is to say we found embryo development data for the laysan and black footed albatross phoebastria immutabilis and p nigripes zonneveld and kooijman 1993 but no post embryonic growth data the software packages amptool and debtool anonymous 2020b 2020c have been used for the analyses presented in this paper they are freely available on github the data is made available via ampdata on the amp website anonymous 2020a all results for all species can also be found on the amp website anonymous 2020a this includes the data with references the predictions including graphs of growth curves the code that has been used to estimate parameters the estimated parameter values as well as implied traits the analysis of patterns in the co variation of parameter values is done against the physics based rules for co variation of deb parameters kooijman 1986a 2010 parameters are either intensive or extensive and appropriate ratios of extensive parameters are intensive maximum structural length turns out to depend on 3 parameters only of which single one is extensive and therefore proportional to maximum structural length this in combination defines how each parameter co varies with maximum structural length and therefore also how functions of parameters such as maximum weight and respiration co varies with maximum structural length this phrasing attempts to link up with the literature on body size scaling relationships although the deb view is that body size is an emergent property of metabolism not an independent variable lika et al 2019 these rules do not include ecological and or evolutionary adaptations which can modify patterns substantially the supporting information has a matlab script file to generate figs 2 to 5 its header gives details the name of each species is shown by clicking on data points in the matlab figure that the script generates 3 results and discussion tubenoses have a remarkable growth pattern among birds where the late nestling reduces in weight before fledging after a peak in weight weight at fledging reduces to the adult level we reported this for the wandering albatross diomedea exulans teixeira et al 2014 explaining the reason by starvation prior to fledging table 2 shows that this pattern applies to almost all tubenose members large and small but it is certainly not unique among birds oilbirds steatornis caripensis are known for this but swallows hirundinidae for instance sport this pattern as well a temporary dip in weight at or just after fledging is common among birds and probably linked to learning the art of finding and selecting food such dips do not last long and a decrease in weight does not start that much prior to fledging if the weight at fledging is lower than before and equals the adult weight this means that the mean feeding level of the adults is less than maximal table 2 shows that the scaled function response at fledging is around 0 8 but it can be as low as 0 55 as found for the gould s petrel pterodroma leucoptera scatter in growth data from several chicks combined might easily hide the reduction in weight prior to fledging and be a reason why six species have scaled functional response 1 at fledging the mechanism for this reduction is probably linked to the fact that petrels breed on small ocean islands in colonies that are highly synchronised by the seasons after the young hatch the local food supplies become depleted and when the young grows and requires more food the parents need to collect food more distantly which costs time and so reduces the mean food arrival rate at the nest fig 2 shows that the population growth rate of the austrodyptornithes is very low among birds and of petrels even lower than penguins the specific body growth rate at maximum growth as function of maximum weight of the austrodyptornithes is typical for birds not shown the figure also presents the explanation they have an exceptionally long juvenile stage so a high maturity level at puberty this in combination with their low reproduction rate for the petrels see fig 5 that will be discussed later the population growth rate of the clades aequornithes and aequorlitornithes are between those of the petrels and the rest of the birds reproduction rate and age at puberty are the dominant controllers of population growth kooijman et al 2020 the birds in general have a low population growth rate among animals kooijman et al 2020 since the maximum population growth rate equals the specific body growth rate at maximum growth on average kooijman et al 2020 the increase of time since birth at puberty with maximum weight is consistent with expected co variation rules kooijman 1986a birds grow old compared to other animals and certainly in view of their high body temperature although the life span of austrodyptornithes is much longer than that of the galliformes buttemer et al 2008 they do not grow exceptionally old among birds see fig 3 but still are rather old the life span of penguins is typical for birds of that size life span does not play an important role in their low population growth rate petrels are known for the large stomach gut capacity warham 1990 this might be an adaptation to the patchy occurrence to their food surface dwelling krill squid fish tunicates depending on the species in combination with periods of poor weather conditions for feeding it therefore does not come as a complete surprise that they also have a large reserve capacity see fig 3 that this results from parameter estimation is encouraging since the data itself do not directly relate to this trait this is in harmony with observations that petrels starve during often lengthy incubation shifts fig 4 shows that petrels have long incubation times indeed and also large eggs which explains the long incubation times as i suggested many years ago kooijman 1993 the large egg size might be an adaptation to minimize age at fledge which corresponds to the period during which the parents have to frequent the nesting site this might seem contradictory but the mother can pass more reserve to the egg than she can to the chick via food due to the limited assimilation capacity of the chick this speeds up development so reduces age at fledge on the basis of the deb assumption that the nestling need to pass a given maturity level for fledging penguins do not have relatively large eggs and also not a relatively large incubation time petrels sensu lato have a low reproduction rate see fig 5 but the energy allocation to reproduction is typical for birds in combination with fig 4 this means that the reason for the low reproduction rate is the large egg size penguins have a more typical reproduction rate for birds the reproduction rate of the clades aequornithes and aequorlitornithes are between those of the petrels and the birds like that of the penguins petrels and penguins differ substantially in the supply stress and altriciality coefficient see fig 6 the supply stress ss quantifies the species in the supply demand spectrum lika et al 2014 many eco physiological properties are associated with the position in this spectrum a species for which s s 0 classifies as a pure supply species and for s s 4 27 as a pure demand species but these extremes cannot be reached the supply stress has the interpretation of the maturity maintenance times the squared somatic maintenance divided by the cubed assimilation in terms of somatic maintenance petrels and penguins have similar mean values as birds in general not shown so the deviating supply stress for petrels is caused by their high maturity maintenance which is consistent with their high age at puberty especially because the allocation to maturation and maturity maintenance is typical among birds the figure also shows that the higher clades of the petrels are between them and the birds demonstrating a clear taxonomic coherence the altriciality coefficient is defined as the log transformed ratio of the maturity levels at birth and puberty augustine et al 2019 the differences between the petrels and the birds are now smaller since the high maturity level at puberty is in this coefficient over compensated by the high maturity level at birth the penguins are now extreme in their low value for the altriciality coefficient this can be understood by their more typical egg size for birds size and maturity more or less covary still combined with a high maturity level at puberty this analysis shows that petrels are extreme among birds in a number of traits partly followed by penguins the aequornithes and the aequorlitornithes are in several respects intermediary relative to other birds petrel traits are very low population growth rate large egg size low reproduction rate long incubation time large maturity level at puberty large reserve capacity and life at relatively low feeding levels they also have rather long life span these traits have a high degree of coherence testifying of an adaptations to life at low food levels contrary to petrels penguins do not have relatively large eggs the emperor penguin has in fact the smallest egg among birds as fraction of adult weight even smaller than the european cuckoo which is a brood parasite on small passerines penguins sport the remarkable combination of small eggs and long foraging trips small young need frequent feeding change in reserve density is inverse to length in deb theory they evolved two adaptations to deal with this the first one is the production of crop milk which is also sported by flamingos and pigeons one of the parents remain with their young while small the second one is collecting lipid rich food especially anchovy or pleurogramma in the case of the emperor penguin for their young while outside the breeding season they have a richer diet including cephalopods which are low in lipids small eggs require more time between egg laying and fledging while the favourable season is short small bodied penguins apparently have that time but deb scaling rules predict that this time increases with length kooijman 1986a the little penguin eudyptula minor can raise 2 or 3 broods per season the two largest penguins the king penguin aptenodytes patagonicus and emperor penguin a forsteri need some 15 and 13 months respectively for this period and skip years in breeding as shown in fig 7 the nesting period of adelie penguins pygoscelis adeliae is short enough to fit in the period when food is abundant with the implication that their growth curve fits the von bertalanffy one well emperor penguins are too big so their nesting period too long and have to deal with periods of food depletion during this period causing substantial deviations from von bertalanffy growth kooijman 2010 while petrels feed in surface waters which follow seasonal fluctuations in food availability rapidly penguins typically feed in deeper waters at least they have the option where these fluctuations are damped this difference in life style might be directly linked to the differences in energetics that have been found it is also the reason why petrels evolved dynamic gliding and penguins flippers and other deep water adaptations such as their blood circulation system and unusually structured haemoglobin at least in the emperor penguin that is known for diving deep i was unable to find structure in the weight reduction prior to fledging while hoping to find links with geographic environmental conditions or food availability this is partly due to the problem that many species have a very wide distribution range while growth date was only available from a single location only also details on feeding were lacking even on food species local weather conditions during the nesting period and the like i expect that a lot of structure in the data actually exists but

24857,petrels and penguins form the clade austrodyptornithes the add my pet collection of referenced data and dynamic energy budget deb parameters presently has 64 members of this clade adaptations to their wandering life style could now be studied i here try to characterise this clade from an energy perspective it turned out that petrels are in several respects extreme among birds showing adaptations to life at low mean food levels penguins show the same tendency but less extreme almost all petrel species show a weight reduction well prior to fledging till the adult weight this permanent weight reduction suggests that the mean adult feeding level is about 80 of the maximum one this pattern is well captured by the standard deb model in which energy reserve plays an important role they also have relatively large eggs and long incubation times and low reproduction rates i argue that large eggs minimize the age at fledging given that a particular maturity threshold needs to be reached for fledging austrodyptornithes have a high age at puberty which in combination with low reproduction rates causes very low maximum population growth rates the energy allocation to reproduction for petrels is typical among birds so the low reproduction rates are the results of the large eggs another adaptation to low mean food levels is the large stomach gut capacity which appeared to be coupled to a high reserve capacity this points to be an adaptation to a patchy occurrence of their food probably in combination with spells of poor weather conditions for feeding petrels have a high supply stress and altriciality coefficient compared to birds while penguins are a very small altriciality coefficient this reflects a very high maturity level at puberty for both taxa in combination with high maturity level at birth for petrels and a typical one for penguins they have a relatively long life span compared to other birds but not extreme the relative egg size of penguins is typical for birds to smaller than typical penguins combine small eggs with long foraging trips while small young need frequent feeding they evolved two adaptation for this crop milk feeding and collecting lipid rich food for their offspring the energetic differences that have been found between petrels and penguins may directly relate to feeding in surface waters by petrels and in deeper waters by penguins seasonal fluctuations in food density are more pronounced in surface waters the higher clades aequornithes and aequorlitornithes are in many respect intermediate between austrodyptornithes and other birds demonstrating a clear taxonomic coherence in energy parameters keywords dynamic energy budget theory add my pet life at low food reserve capacity low max population growth rate 1 introduction among the tubenoses also called petrels sensu lato as always used in this text following warham 1990 albatrosses capture everybody s imagination by mastering of the art of dynamic gliding they are absent in calm equatorial waters and extinct in northern atlantic mayr 2017 the southern hemisphere has presently the highest tubenose diversity does their specialization as wanderers over world s oceans translate to particular patterns in dynamic energy budget deb parameters relative to other birds with a third of the extant species of tubenoses presently 2020 01 01 in the add my pet amp collection anonymous 2020a of deb parameters it now has become possible to investigate this introductions to the standard deb model can be found in kooijman 2001 van der meer 2006 sousa et al 2008 sousa et al 2010 kooijman 2012 ledder 2014 sara et al 2014 jusup et al 2017 and muller et al 2019 an evolutionary context in kooijman and troost 2007 kooijman et al 2003 and a system earth context in kooijman 2004 the amp collection is about parameter values of deb models for animal species and referenced data and implied properties marques et al 2018 we did something similar for fish kooijman and lika 2014 although amp had 64 fish species in 2014 and presently 567 are tubenoses procellariiformes and the closely related penguins sphenisciformes with which they form the clade austrodyptornithes special in terms of values of deb parameters compared to the higher clade aequornithes mayr 2017 or to the even higher clade aequorlitornithes see table 1 and finally to the birds aves themselves all austrodyptornithes are outspoken colony breeding seabirds schreiber and burger 2001 but can we find energetic differences between petrels and penguins birds are together with mammals special among animals because they are near the demand end of the supply demand spectrum lika et al 2014 advanced forms of endothermy being an aspect kooijman 2010 moreover they are unique by reaching ultimate weight very early in their development well before puberty and having a high body temperature compared to mammals after birth kooijman 1986b 2009 this allows for short incubation times given the relatively large size of their eggs fish are more typical among animals by having a length at puberty about half their ultimate length kooijman and lika 2014 meaning that they still grow by a factor 2 in length or 8 in weight during the reproductive stage birds evolved from precocial to altricial development while mammals did the opposite we now have a good explanation for this augustine et al 2019 involving adaptation to life in forests for birds where they developed the highest diversity the forest dwelling passeriformes are by far the largest bird order with 60 of all bird species and very altricial this crown group of birds all have a very similar anatomy mayr 2013 which is possibly link to life in trees anisodactyl feet syrinx small body size short round wings high water content of neonate tissues faecal sacks advanced forms of parental care including territorial defence austrodyptornithes however did not evolve an intimate dependency on plants but specialised in life with open oceans more generally the aequorlitornithes the water and shore birds with some 7 of the bird species also did not focus on woody plants which contrasts them with passerines this divergence in bird evolution adds to the significance of the topic of this paper full grown petrels span a weight range from 19 5 g for the least storm petrel halocyptena microsoma to 8700 g for the southern royal albatross diomedea epomophora this is the largest weight range within any bird order warham 1990 the range for the penguins is 1500 g for the little penguin eudyptula minor to 45000 g for the emperor penguin aptenodytes forsteri the weight range of a factor 2300 for the austrodyptornithes makes them excellent candidates for a study on energetics since many aspects

24858,there is a great concern about the current growing and indiscriminate human activity over the environment that supports us many researchers and strategists have predicted human and natural disasters based on assumptions linked to economic social and environmental trends most of these events have either not happened the impact was far less than projected or they may have been delayed several years such situations might have not been due to erroneous assumptions or calculations but rather to the ability of ecosystems to recover and adapt following a stressful situation or a disruptive event so called resilience the mechanisms of how resilience works generally imply intrinsic complex feedback loops of the systems such loops absorb the external impacts and distribute them through the different elements that conform the system this work analyzes a social feedback loop in the dynamics of a human ecosystem and its consequences in the search for sustainable governmental targets the loop is derived from the uncertainties in the demographic parameters and is incorporated into a mass based compartmental model of a human ecosystem with social inequity the methodology has been applied to three different types of societies with different development levels using five different governmental targets as expected it is clear that feedback loops affect the behavior of the system results show that the same government target provides different results for different societies societies with a higher level of development present a better economic social environmental performance when an environmental target is used such as ghg emissions on the other hand the society with less development presents a better performance when the used target is related to the economics of the system in order to achieve a sufficiently resilient and sustainable society the choice of an accurate governmental target is crucial since the objectives act differently for each type of society results also show that decision variables have more variation in the first periods of the analysis being practically stable in the final years then the initial years of the simulation analysis are the most important to stabilize the system therefore in real world societies not only the choice of the objective is important but also the feedback mechanisms those mechanisms have to be implemented as quickly as possible in order to identify or avoid probable future catastrophic scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sustainability feedback loop human ecosystem model 1 introduction there are a growing number of studies on the consumer driven increase in human activity and the subsequent damage to the environment to better understand the level of damage derived from anthropogenic activities mathematical models have been used to examine the scale and degree of the interactions between human and ecological systems through a combination of these approaches along with the observation and analysis of historical data and trends various works have derived and projected possible future scenarios not a few of those works have concluded imminent crises in human societies derived from social and ecological problems which eventually could lead to ecological extinctions or economic social collapses one of the first of these catastrophic predictions made from a mathematical basis can be attributed to mathus 1978 who at the end of the 18th century observed that population grew faster than the production of food resources which in a few decades from then would lead to global scale famines although the prediction never became reality due to the attenuation of population growth as well as notable improvements in agricultural processes it did result in an economic demographic theory from which several works were derived madsen et al 2019 these kinds of predictions are not only presented in the availability of food resources fossil fuels have been the basis of the world economy for a couple of centuries so the concern for their supplies becomes inherent in 1865 stanley jevons predicted that england would deplete its coal mines by 1900 paralyzing its factories and slowing its economic growth missemer 2012 while jevons predictions were correct that coal was limited and would soon not be enough to meet the world s energy requirements his theory did not contemplate that it would soon be replaced by oil like coal oil is a limited resource several works have suggested that the world could soon deplete its oil reserves hubbert 1962 campbell and laherrere 1998 deffeyes 2001 although unlike carbon there is not a clear replacement for oil in the near future in this context the environmental sector has also received a lot of attention in the last decades in 1970 the secretary of the smithsonian institution s dillon ripley predicted that between 75 and 80 of earth s species would become extinct in 25 years further in 1979 biologist n mayers predicted that by the year 2000 a fourth of the earth s species would have disappeared these environmental predictions were not completely fulfilled bailey 2015 however it is also true that such predictions are not qualitatively wrong at all there is a lot of evidence that human activity is accelerating biodiversity loss at 1000 10 000 times the natural rate despite a large number of predicted economic social and environmental catastrophes the real impact of these events has been far less than projected or they may have been delayed several years this does not mean that predictions were incorrect or that they should have been ignored or minimized the calculations and methodologies used are also not necessarily wrong it is usual to make future conclusions by extrapolating current trends overlooking some human development driving forces of change like potential social and cultural changes scientific and technological improvements as well as political and legislative changes in addition natural systems have complex intrinsic feedback mechanisms that provide them with greater resilience than that expected initially not considering these aspects could significantly alter the conclusions feedback in general can be understood as a mechanism by which a fraction of the output flow of a system mass energy information etc is redirected to the input changing its current behavior based on its previous behavior self directed in such way this sequence of effects that a change in a certain element of the system has on itself after going through a chain of effects in other parts of the system is called a feedback loop a feedback loop can be either positive if the final response increases the disturbance or negative if it decreased it for example global warming has a positive feedback loop when warming increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere which in turn leads to further warming on the other hand it has a negative feedback loop by the stefan boltzmann law all complex dynamic systems such as human ecosystems have numerous feedback loops that make the systems interconnected kunz et al 2013 such loops allow all of their parts to be within the limits necessary to move within a functional regime changes in the components of an ecosystem can be driven by external factors for example climate prices and demands political changes or internal factors like mortality and birth rates growth factors or food availability literature establishes that it is the change that triggers these feedback mechanisms thus acting as a catalyst for the response of the system forbes et al 2004 dale et al 2010 however issues such as the magnitude of change and the composition of elements necessary to obtain a measurable reaction as well as the immediacy and the degree of response are the main factors to be determined elshafei et al 2014 therefore in order to understand the complex dynamics resulting from the feedback between natural resources and human elements at multiple levels the development of a conceptual framework is required this problem has been addressed by a large number of works from different approaches which can be grouped into two categories lowerroman 1 natural feedback loops in which the structures and the responses of the natural elements that intervene in the feedback of the ecosystems are analyzed much of this work is derived from the so called world of daisies watson and lovelock 1983 in that theory a system described by lotka volterra equations with interaction parameters as a function of temperature self regulates by varying the population of certain species by changing the value of the albedo lowerroman 1 anthropogenic feedback loops the general idea is that all significant changes invariably feedback into the system through a behavioral response of the human sector these can be also divided into two approaches a philosophical or theoretical this approach proposes and analyzes conceptual feedback loops draw connections between constituent parts of the system define strategies to have more sustainable systems and serve as points of pressure in decision makers from business scales moizer and tracey 2010 to communities dale et al 2010 b numerical through the use of mathematical models or statistical and computational tools these approaches seek to determine the magnitude of the human behavioral response and their level of influence in the environment they can be qualitative or quantitative and are usually suitable for particular systems analyzing the feedback between resources actors and institutions across multiple scales such as in agricultural water systems elshafei et al 2014 or in the fishing industry hunt et al 2011 schlüter et al 2012 present an interesting review of the literature in this regard both approaches are complementary to each other the philosophical approach is focused on human human interactions and it has a deeper knowledge of human and social responses where the mathematics are hard to apply the numerical approach focuses on human environment interactions and usually derive into a mathematical model that measures the environmental response the importance of the analysis of the feedback loops in sustainability models arises from their ability to analyze possible future scenarios without compromising a system or experiment with it such significance is increased when they are used as ecosystem management tools if the effects of these loops are not understood at least in an essential level then the behaviors obtained from their simulations will widely differ from the real systems that they represent consequently the lack of understanding of the loops of an ecosystem will cause the decision makers to act under erroneous premises making the system vulnerable and hindering their resilience whiteman et al 2012 on the contrary under an adequate scheme that includes the basic aspects of feedback the consequences of the decisions will be evident and the behavior of the system can be managed instead of passively reacting to the events that change it sterman 2001 in this regard many kinds of mathematical models for ecosystems can be found in the literature however as stated earlier they usually are developed to describe particular systems even though this particularity provides them accuracy and data availability making them more realistic it is also true that it led them away from generality and makes them more difficult to be applied in different frameworks moreover if the analysis is going to be made from a sustainability perspective the mathematical model needs to be not only dynamic by definition but also must incorporate economic environmental and social aspects in an integrated way recently a series of compartmental models based on dynamic trophic mass consumption has been developed and improved in consecutive stages in search of a more complete model that includes crucial components of an ecosystem fath et al 2003 cabezas et al 2007 kotecha et al 2013 the most recent version is a stochastic model with a stratified population presented by rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 such model is a representation of a human ecosystem with economic and social elements such as per capita wages and social inequity within an ecological framework this model series has demonstrated to be a useful integrated tool in the sustainability analysis of human ecosystems from different perspectives therefore in the present work an anthropogenic feedback loop was included in this sustainability ecosystem model trying to identify conceptualize and quantify the factors involved in the system performance the aim is to formulate generalized principles that can lead to sustainable public policies 2 methods the model used in this work is a generic conceptual representation of a human ecosystem developed under an ecologic framework it involves fifteen compartments arranged by trophic levels as is shown in fig 1 the model includes three resource pools rp is the main source of the supplies required by the system water nutrients sunlight etc irp represents the resources derived from the residues due to human activity which are inaccessible to the human sector and are gradually reintegrated into the system through wild primary producers similarly erp represents finite non renewable energetic resources oil natural gas etc there are eight ecological compartments p1 represents the agricultural sector and h1 is the livestock sector both are considered domestic and depend directly on human activity p2 represents wild plants belonging to the state such as timber resources h2 are wild herbivores that consume p1 and c1 are carnivores that have access to h1 similarly p3 h3 and c2 are also primary wild plants herbivores and carnivores that do not interact directly with humans the last trophic level is the human sector hh1 represents a major fraction of the population that has a relatively low income and hh2 is the minor part that has a high income ep is the energy production sector and is involves all manufacturing and services industries lotka volterra differential equations are used to model the mass flows in a closed system for natural interactions represented as continuous lines in fig 1 lotka volterra terms remain with no change bilinear product by growth death factor lotka 1925 volterra 1926 however in the human influenced flows dashed lines such terms are calculated by algebraic equations derived from economic and social considerations more details can be found in rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 the model also calculates five indicators to evaluate the sustainable performance of the system i fisher information fi is a measure of the order or dynamic regime of the system it is a concept closely related to sustainability through the sustainable regime hypothesis eason and cabezas 2012 in this work fi is calculated using the continuous dynamic variables compartments by the analytical approach gonzalez mejia et al 2015 discuss differences between both approaches and summarized the later version of the sustainable regime hypothesis ii ecological footprint analysis efa measures the equivalent land demand of the population by identifying the amount of bio productive land required to support the annual average consumption and the waste production of an individual wackernagel 1996 all compartments and the human influenced flows are involved in its calculation iii green net regional product gnrp represents a common approach to estimate sustainability from a welfare perspective in a simplified way gnrp is defined as the sum of the real value of consumption and the real value of the net investments heberling et al 2012 gnrp is computed by estimating the economic value of the system through product prices and productions p1 h1 is and ep iv per capita wage w is directly related to the economic performance of the whole society gdp is defined as the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units then we assume that wages can be used as a representation of gdp per capita inside the model v green house gases ghg concentration determines the total co2eq contribution of the human sector activity and the mitigation by the natural sector in this way the dynamics of co2eq can be monitored by summing the positive negative contributions of each variable that involves the absorption emission of ghg such as natural compartments and human activity related flows in this manner the model includes several key elements of a human ecosystem and involves the three main sustainability fronts economic social and ecological however an important issue remains to be addressed which approach is the most appropriate to incorporate feedback into the model 2 1 conceptual incorporation of a feedback loop into the system dynamics despite the fact that the model utilized has been developed within an ecological framework incorporating natural feedback loops is not the most feasible option since capturing and mathematically categorizing natural change dynamics is extremely difficult in general there is no enough available data to identify the structures and functionalities of the interaction parameters in addition one cannot physically and ethically experiment with the world or with human ecosystems to obtain such functionalities therefore the most viable approach for current models is including anthropogenic feedback loops representing human responses however measuring quantifying and representing the emotional human response to diverse contextual situations in mathematical expressions are also nearly impossible tasks in addition previous works on this topic are usually carried out for specific cases of study that require particularities of the systems some of them cannot be applied to a generic framework such as the one considered in this work to properly identify feedback loops in general conceptual schemes such as the stratified model used in this work one must keep in mind the real system that is being represented the system has to be analyzed in order to determine the key factors that significantly affect the long term global behavior of it even though the model used is conceptual and does not represent any ecosystem or society in particular it does include representative elements and crucial aspects that allow it to be a generic representation of a human ecosystem since the dynamic behavior of the model is widely governed by the human sector changes in the human population will represent significant changes in the overall long term performance of the system the number of humans depends directly on the mortality and birth rates thus the predominant change factor of the model is the uncertainty in death and birth rates of the human compartment this stochasticity in demographic parameters entails a great uncertainty in the long term behavior of the model described and therefore in the sustainability of the system in a real world society this unpredictable dynamic performance would imply that the decision makers must recommend periodic social technological adjustments through legislation and public policies in order to maintain the system towards an objective set at the beginning of the analysis these basic ideas were applied in this work to develop the conceptual demographic feedback loop presented in fig 2 the procedure starts from observing the historical trend of the dynamics of a human ecosystem to estimate the parameters that determine its population growth then by assuming that such historical trend is maintained a medium or long term projection is made to calculate the expected behavior of the system once the expected behavior is known a feasible future scenario the decision makers will intend to move away or stay on that path depending on the goal sought or achieved decision makers can act through legislation and or public policies the goal sought might be social environmental economic or sustainable this analytic procedure is expected to be periodic and repeated on various cycles during the time horizon 2 2 numerical implementation of the feedback loop the numerical implementation of the conceptual feedback loop into the proposed model is achieved through the procedure shown in fig 3 it consists of a sequential cyclic approach involving three main steps i stochastic simulation of a time period ii development of a predictive model and iii an optimization step to propagate the feedback information to the following periods each step is explained next 2 2 1 a stochastic simulation step this step represents reality that is to say how the system is evolving under the current public policies due that the feedback loop comes from such public policies which to properly determine its effects are usually evaluated after several years after they are implemented the time horizon under analysis is divided into n periods of p years in other words each period n represents a wait and see time at the end of which the public policies are updated the model is simulated for the first period by using the initial values of the state variables and the given values of the model parameters see fig 3 it is important to notice that the model is stochastic because it considers the uncertain time dependent behavior of the demographic parameters as is shown in eqs 1 2 rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 1 d m h h i j m h h i j 1 δ t σ m i ε m δ t 2 d a p c b i j a p c b i j 1 δ t σ b i ε b δ t where dmhhij and dapcbij are increments of mhhij and apcbij which are the mortality and birth rates respectively δt is the integration step size σmi and σbi are the variance parameters εm and εb are random values that have a unit normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation hence at this point these demographic parameters are represented through ito process so that the dynamic simulation of the model can be performed by using a stochastic numerical integration technique at the end of the simulation period the output variables are analyzed and linear trends of the uncertain demographic parameters of each population are assumed for the next step 2 2 2 developing a deterministic predictive model the development of the predictive model is also based on the approach proposed by rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 the stochastic demographic parameters used in the previous steps are assumed to represent a real behavior in fact they are obtained from real population data such a demographic behavior is used in this step to build a linear predictive model the linear model is used to predict future scenarios and to evaluate the indicators government targets the predictive model is of course simpler than the original in such model the demographic parameters are known and display a linear behavior derived from an extrapolation of the linear trend obtained at final of the previous step eqs 3 4 so that uncertainties are not taken into consideration the predictive model is a deterministic model 3 m h h i j m m h h t b m h h 4 a p c b i j m a p c b t b a p c b where mmhh and mapcb are the slope for mortality and birth rates functions respectively bmhh and bapcb are the intercepts while t is the time it can be said that the predictive model is a model used by decision makers inside the simulated real world by the stochastic model in general in the real world such models fail to fully capture the real dynamics of the systems and are subject to many assumptions and simplifications nevertheless this deterministic model is used in the optimization step explained in the following subsection the idea is to use this simpler model to obtain new values for the techno economic and social parameters that may influence the trend of population growth the new set of values represents the implementation of new public policies inside the simulated real world derived from formal mathematical tools as well as in the real world not perfect but acceptable tools are used to develop appropriate guidelines furthermore with that improved set of values for the parameters obtained from the optimization the goal is self regulating the system in the following time periods and bringing it closer to a more sustainable path 2 2 3 formulation and solution of an optimal control problem this step is a simulation inside the simulation where decision makers every certain number of years develop the predictive model a simpler version of their world and use mathematical programming to establish accurate public policies aimed to modify a set of parameters looking to achieve a government goal because of the dynamic nature of the model the optimization step requires the use of optimal control theory optimal control problems involve a time dependent objective and a set of constraints in the form of differential equations if the model also includes algebraic equations as in this case then the complexity of the problem increases diwekar 2003 the constraints of the optimization model used here is a set of differential algebraic equations dae the differential equations correspond to the dynamics of the compartmental variables the algebraic equations correspond to the mass flows and economic social variables of the stratified economic ecologic social model the problem also contains a set of control decision variables which are time dependent variables that can be manipulated in order to bring the system through a desirable performance in sustainability analysis the selection of those decision variables is a crucial stage notice that the use of external control variables as decision variables does not make sense in this context since the model is a closed mass representation of a human ecosystem the selection of the decision variables was achieved through a sensitivity analysis performed as a preliminary step before the numerical implementation of the feedback loop in such preliminary step all of the techno economic and social model parameters that can be modified through governmental policies were identified first then the sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which among them have a greater influence on the system dynamics when they are perturbed those parameters chosen in the preliminary step are used as given known parameters during the initial simulation step of fig 3 and section 2 2 1 in a given time period n representing a set of public policies established at the beginning of the period and remain constant in all p years of the period but then they become the decision variables of the deterministic optimization step described here the aim is to modify i e provide feedback information into the system their values in order to improve the performance of the system for future periods the last component of the optimal control problem is precisely the desirable target to be minimized that is the objective function or performance index this work uses the sustainability indicators described above to define the objective function of the model sustainability is not defined through a single point but rather is a path through time therefore the objective function is also time dependent the objective function definition requires a mathematical function that can represent the search for an economic ecologic social balance through minimization an approach that is commonly used is the penalization of the deviation of the state of the system from equilibrium sager et al 2006 a sustainability indicator can be used to measure the state of the system and the point of equilibrium can be obtained from an ideal sustainable state doshi et al 2014 thus the objective function could be formulated as given by eq 5 5 j m i n t 0 t f z z b 2 where t 0 and tf are the initial and final time in which the analysis is done z is the value of any of the sustainability indicator for the system and zb is the baseline ideal sustainability indicator at the end the optimization stage provides new values for the selected techno economical social parameters control variables which are fed to the simulation step of the next time period of the sequential cyclic procedure of fig 3 that closes a cycle of the algorithm and provides the starting point to the following period hence it is expected that the new values of the parameters will lead the system to a more sustainable path for future periods 3 results and discussion following the strategy proposed by rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 four societies with different development levels were used to analyze the effects that the feedback loop incorporated into the model has over the resilience and sustainability of the system 1 society type a an ideal society with perfect resources distribution used as baseline for comparison 2 society type b a developed country 3 society type c a newly advanced economic development country 4 society type d a developing country 3 1 numerical results of simulations without feedback seeking simplicity the model is not included in this paper but it is provided as a part of the supplementary information accompanying this paper first in order to evaluate and analyze the effect over the sustainable performance of a human ecosystem with feedback loops the model was simulated for the different societies during a time horizon of 200 years without considering feedback the profiles obtained for the sustainability indicators are shown in fig 4 the black lines are the type a profiles it can be seen that except for fi and ghg concentration sustainable indicators remain practically constant through the simulation time this represents that their ecological economic social balance does not change over time being sustainable by definition fig 4a shows that fi doubles its value in the first 80 years this is a signal at the beginning the system is gaining dynamic order moving to a more sustainable regime in which it remains to the end of the simulation on the other hand in fig 4e it is observed a linear growth of co2 equivalent concentration moving from 200 to 1000 ppm this is indicative that even in a hypothetic ideal society that keeps unalterable the negative environmental impacts of current human activity will remain and will rise society type b represent by dashed blue lines in fig 4 is the most equitable society under analysis 63 of its wealth belongs to 75 of its population in fig 4a it can be seen that as in the base case the system gains order in the first part nevertheless it is reduced a little after that denoting that type b is moving in a less sustainable regime than the base case fig 4b shows that the required productive land in practically the same also in fig 4d it is observed that per capita wages are constant for long time periods being very similar than the base case at the end of the simulation time this can be interpreted as social stability individually these profiles could be understood as a sustainable system however looking at fig 4c and e there is a notorious continuous decrease in the system economy and environmental performance that denotes an unsustainable path society type c is the dotted green lines in fig 4 this is a transitional society between type d and type b which can be observed in fig 4a where the system order fluctuates among them the per capita wages of this society fig 4d is continuously increasing being significantly higher than the base case in the first instance this situation can be thought of as highly desirable since it represents a higher income for inhabitants however as the previous case fig 4c and e denotes a greater reduction on the economic environmental wellbeing being the ghg concentration doubled from type b society type d is the most inequality the richest quartile of the population has 62 of the overall wealth in fig 4 the red dash dotted lines represent this society like in the other societies its efa value does not vary significantly fig 4 b fig 4a shows fi despite its profiles relatively constant from year 40 it is the lowest value this denotes that is the system with less dynamic order in regard to the other indicators the performance is very similar in trend than type c but so much pronounced the gnrp value is the lowest in all time fig 4c and the final value of ghg concentration is the higher twelve times than the base case fig 4e this society is the less sustainable even when the per capita wages are the highest fig 4d the differences among the sustainable indicators profiles for types b c and d societies with respect to the base case entail significant changes in the behavior of system variables such as the accelerated decay of some compartments including humans in some cases this behavior would imply the total extinction of the compartment as it is the case for compartment p1 other effects include the increase in the prices of the products the increase of prices is more significant in society type d than those of societies b and c once the behavior of the different types of society was analyzed without considering feedback the model parameters that can be modified by public policies were determined and submitted to a sensitivity analysis the aim is to determine the parameters whose variations influence the more the system performance such parameters are selected to become the decision variables in the optimization problem table 1 summarizes the selected decision parameters grpp2 is the growth of plant p2 which depends only on natural resources and owes characteristics of the plant however current developing technologies allow plants to grow faster and bigger or if needed the opposite result is also possible cisp is a factor that relates the amount of industrial sector production to its price this can be modified through government legislation and incentives aw is the base value from which wages are calculated which is interpreted as a minimum wage most countries have already introduced minimum wage legislation in this way if a government considers it relevant it can change such base value in order to improve wages k is the amount of consumption of timber resources from the human sector which is established at discretion by the government finally theta and lambda are the amounts of the agrarian sector and the biological resources to produce one unit of industrial services both of them can be modified by technological improvements it is important to notice that although the selected variables have a direct equivalence to real factors that can be modified in reality through technology or public policies the model still is a conceptual representation the selected variables remain then as conceptual decisions providing a desirable qualitative performance rather than an expected quantitative improvement 3 2 numerical results of simulations with the implementation of the feedback loop the numerical implementation of the feedback loop described in section 2 2 and fig 3 was then applied to societies types b c and d using type a as the sustainable baseline all analyzes were performed using 10 periods of 20 years projections to 50 years were used in the optimization step in order to solve the optimization problem obtained at the end of each period matlab interior point algorithm is used the previous period values of decision variables looking to determine the level of influence that the feedback loop has on the sustainability of the system each of the 5 different indicators fi efa gnrp w and co2eq were used as a sustainable governmental target through eq 1 however sustainable indicators are not continuous functions they generally involve discrete points the discrete values of the indicators are usually calculated over long enough time periods as to collect the data required for their calculation to simplify their estimations the numerical implementation of the approach uses integration steps of one year obtaining in this way values of the sustainable indicators in a realistic temporality therefore in practice the objective function becomes a discretized expression eq 6 6 j m i n i t o i t f z i z b i 2 where t0 and tf are the initial and final time in which the analysis is done zi is the annual scalar value of the sustainability indicator for the system in year i and zbi is the annual scalar value of the sustainability indicator of the baseline in year i the simulation results involve a large number of profiles of the state variables and performance indicators for the various societies only the profiles for some of the key variables representing the performance of the system from different perspectives are presented here the population size nhh was selected as the main social factor which in the three types of society is significantly reduced without feedback the desirable behavior of this variable is to keep certain stability a decreasing population could derive in human extinction and excessive growth could involve significant social and economic issues for an environmental perspective p1 was selected p1 is the natural compartment which is extinguished without feedback in all cases the ideal scenario is not only to avoid its extinction but also to increase the number of plants the co2eq concentration profile is also shown because it is one of the greatest current global concerns the ideal scenario is to keep its value as low as possible from the economic perspective two parameters are selected w and wp w represents the average wealth of the population and the desirable effect is to increase its value as much as possible wp is the average product price whose value should be kept as low as possible the following results represent typical uncertain scenarios of each society for each of the different sustainability targets fig 5 shows the results for the type b society from the economic point of view it is with the use co2eq and gnrp as indicators that the salary w shows an improvement while the optimization of the others indicators does not cause significant changes fig 5a the prices fig 5b present the same tendencies as those of the per capita wages from the environmental perspective only the use of co2eq results in a considerable delay in the extinction of p1 fig 5c the greatest reduction of the ghg concentration fig 5d is of course achieved when such variable is used as the target followed by the case of w as objective from the social perspective the population shows a general decreasing trend but the cases where fi and w are used as objective functions are able to mitigate such decrease fig 5e there are some peculiar situations that can be analyzed co2eq as objective can control the overall performance of the system but in exchange for a half population reduction w can stabilize the human population and reduce the ghg emissions but in exchange for reducing a little the wage and of still losing p1 fi can reverse the initial population decrease but in order to achieve it a significant reduction of wages and prices has to be done for a 20 years period fig 6 presents the results for the type c society for an economic point of view gnrp and fi are the indicators that lead to a better behavior of the system fig 6 a and b from the environmental perspective the extinction of p1 cannot be avoided or delayed through the optimization of any of the indicators fig 6d presents the concentration of ghg only the use of gnrp as target did not provide a positive result although it did not make it worse either the concentration of co2eq was the one that achieved the most significant change socially fig 6e shows that w co2eq and efa manage to reverting the population decrease in fact the use of efa allows keeping the population relatively stable throughout the whole time horizon of the analysis it can be observed that there is a clear inverse relationship between wages and prices population in order to improve per capita wages prices also have to rise this entails a reduction of the population also when fi is used as the target the ghg concentration is initially high but in the final 50 years it tends to be stabilized without compromising other variables in a different situation when co2eq is used as the target the population and the ghg concentration can be controlled but it compromises the per capita wages around year 100 being zero for a 10 years period similar from the others societies the results of the type d are presented in fig 7 for the economic perspective the use of w as target is the only case where the desirable behavior of wages is not achieved fig 7a the opposite occurs for average prices fig 7b environmentally fi and co2eq delayed the extinction of p1 for a long period of time whereas it is the use of w as target which achieves the most positive significant change in the behavior of the system fig 7c for the concentration of ghg fig 7d shows that w and co2eq as targets drastically improve the performance of the system considerably reducing the final value of this variable fig 7e shows that the population size remains practically stable if w is used as an objective the rest of the indicators do not favor significant changes as in previous cases the use of fi or co2eq as the target can reduce significantly the ghg concentration and delay the p1 extinction but in exchange for not reversing the population decline the use of gnrp as the target can improve the economy of the system even when in the other aspects there is no positive or negative change for society type d it is the use of w as indicator which shows a greater effect on the system performance under the feedback loop approach therefore the results obtained for this particular case are analyzed in greater detail fig 8 presents the profiles of the techno economical regulatory parameters of the system decision variables for such case the largest changes in their values are observed in the first three periods they are basically constant beyond that point as established earlier these decision variables are conceptual and their behavior does not represent actual values or magnitude of any real system instead they represent the qualitative influence that they have over the system dynamics fig 8a and b shows that the growing rate of p2 has to be slightly reduced while its consumption has to be increased this means that it is necessary to reduce the p2 compartment in the first decades fig 8c indicates that the industrial sector has to raise its prices fig 8d shows that the government must first reduce the base wage before being able to raise it this situation can be interpreted as a period of austerity prior to a period of prosperity finally fig 8e and f clearly shows the need for better production technologies with better efficiency in the use of the resources fig 9 shows the sustainable indicators profiles for the type d society results include the behavior achieved with and without feedback loop results for the baseline are also shown as expected the behavior of the system changes under a feedback loop approach changes in the decision variables during the first decades allow the system to behave in a way similar that the ideal case achieving a relatively sustainable human ecosystem the catastrophic scenario that occurs without feedback is avoided in order to further examine this observation the remaining natural compartments are shown fig 10 shows the profiles for the plants and the resources whereas fig 11 does the same with the profiles of the carnivores and herbivores when feedback is provided although the system does not completely reach the ideal case it does behave with similar trends despite the instability caused by economic inequality along with the demographic uncertainties finally fig 12 presents the demographic variables profiles of the stochastic simulation step and the linear predicted profiles used in the optimization step the red dots indicate the start of a period n the black dashed lines are the projections made at the end of such period which are used in the optimization step to establish the new guidelines to use at period n 1 it can be seen that for birth rates the predicted values are close to the stochastic profiles even in the farther predictions 50 years the error is less than 20 on the other hand the mortality rates eventually fail to capture the behavior of the main simulation due to the large uncertainty effect like in the real world the mathematical predictions inside the simulation can be good enough to represent future trends or fail due to the inherent incapacity to have a perfect model 4 conclusions the inclusion of feedback loops into the model favors a greater resilience of the system the loops allow self regulation and mitigate the influence of both the instabilities and external uncertainties similar to the behavior of human ecosystems of the real world when analyzing the results it appears that the more unstable systems have greater opportunities to achieve a sustainable path than the most sustainable systems as long as the government target is the most adequate in a more sustainable society like society type b different government targets can be used to improve the variables performance in a less sustainable society like type d not all of the targets achieve desirable results but the influence of the critical target over the entire system is bigger improving all variables at once this occurs in society type d with per capita wages as the target it is well documented in the literature that in the real world more developed societies are able to face situations of instability in a more efficient manner however the previous conclusion does not contradict this fact since it is true that developed countries can adopt more easily legislative and technological changes what the results indicate is that if the developing societies had the same capacity as the more developed ones those changes would represent a greater impact in addition since the results show that each type of society has different adequate targets for different economical ecological social needs it can be concluded that the choice of an adequate governmental sustainable target suitable for the particularities of the system is of crucial importance in order to achieve a desired sustainable path even more such a desirable path is achieved in the first periods when the effect of the instabilities is still small and can be reverted therefore the first years are critical to achieving a good sustainable performance in a real context governments managers policy makers and all kinds of decision makers often do not try to anticipate changes and prepare for them instead they act after a disturbance has happened thus as bailey 2015 indicates catastrophic predictions in this work represented by the predictive model can act as a trigger to stimulate the social response and exercise pressure over institutions responsible for public policies however even when predictive models are important to activate feedback mechanisms by establishing non desirable future scenarios their usefulness is limited when try to avoid them the inclusion of feedback loops in the modeling and analysis of dynamic systems helps to favor a correct decision making process it contributes with the study of non intuitive feasible scenarios impossible to analyze otherwise while the presented methodology is a good step forward in the development of coupled human and natural systems it is true that this work only focuses on anthropogenic feedback loops natural loops are also important and

24858,there is a great concern about the current growing and indiscriminate human activity over the environment that supports us many researchers and strategists have predicted human and natural disasters based on assumptions linked to economic social and environmental trends most of these events have either not happened the impact was far less than projected or they may have been delayed several years such situations might have not been due to erroneous assumptions or calculations but rather to the ability of ecosystems to recover and adapt following a stressful situation or a disruptive event so called resilience the mechanisms of how resilience works generally imply intrinsic complex feedback loops of the systems such loops absorb the external impacts and distribute them through the different elements that conform the system this work analyzes a social feedback loop in the dynamics of a human ecosystem and its consequences in the search for sustainable governmental targets the loop is derived from the uncertainties in the demographic parameters and is incorporated into a mass based compartmental model of a human ecosystem with social inequity the methodology has been applied to three different types of societies with different development levels using five different governmental targets as expected it is clear that feedback loops affect the behavior of the system results show that the same government target provides different results for different societies societies with a higher level of development present a better economic social environmental performance when an environmental target is used such as ghg emissions on the other hand the society with less development presents a better performance when the used target is related to the economics of the system in order to achieve a sufficiently resilient and sustainable society the choice of an accurate governmental target is crucial since the objectives act differently for each type of society results also show that decision variables have more variation in the first periods of the analysis being practically stable in the final years then the initial years of the simulation analysis are the most important to stabilize the system therefore in real world societies not only the choice of the objective is important but also the feedback mechanisms those mechanisms have to be implemented as quickly as possible in order to identify or avoid probable future catastrophic scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sustainability feedback loop human ecosystem model 1 introduction there are a growing number of studies on the consumer driven increase in human activity and the subsequent damage to the environment to better understand the level of damage derived from anthropogenic activities mathematical models have been used to examine the scale and degree of the interactions between human and ecological systems through a combination of these approaches along with the observation and analysis of historical data and trends various works have derived and projected possible future scenarios not a few of those works have concluded imminent crises in human societies derived from social and ecological problems which eventually could lead to ecological extinctions or economic social collapses one of the first of these catastrophic predictions made from a mathematical basis can be attributed to mathus 1978 who at the end of the 18th century observed that population grew faster than the production of food resources which in a few decades from then would lead to global scale famines although the prediction never became reality due to the attenuation of population growth as well as notable improvements in agricultural processes it did result in an economic demographic theory from which several works were derived madsen et al 2019 these kinds of predictions are not only presented in the availability of food resources fossil fuels have been the basis of the world economy for a couple of centuries so the concern for their supplies becomes inherent in 1865 stanley jevons predicted that england would deplete its coal mines by 1900 paralyzing its factories and slowing its economic growth missemer 2012 while jevons predictions were correct that coal was limited and would soon not be enough to meet the world s energy requirements his theory did not contemplate that it would soon be replaced by oil like coal oil is a limited resource several works have suggested that the world could soon deplete its oil reserves hubbert 1962 campbell and laherrere 1998 deffeyes 2001 although unlike carbon there is not a clear replacement for oil in the near future in this context the environmental sector has also received a lot of attention in the last decades in 1970 the secretary of the smithsonian institution s dillon ripley predicted that between 75 and 80 of earth s species would become extinct in 25 years further in 1979 biologist n mayers predicted that by the year 2000 a fourth of the earth s species would have disappeared these environmental predictions were not completely fulfilled bailey 2015 however it is also true that such predictions are not qualitatively wrong at all there is a lot of evidence that human activity is accelerating biodiversity loss at 1000 10 000 times the natural rate despite a large number of predicted economic social and environmental catastrophes the real impact of these events has been far less than projected or they may have been delayed several years this does not mean that predictions were incorrect or that they should have been ignored or minimized the calculations and methodologies used are also not necessarily wrong it is usual to make future conclusions by extrapolating current trends overlooking some human development driving forces of change like potential social and cultural changes scientific and technological improvements as well as political and legislative changes in addition natural systems have complex intrinsic feedback mechanisms that provide them with greater resilience than that expected initially not considering these aspects could significantly alter the conclusions feedback in general can be understood as a mechanism by which a fraction of the output flow of a system mass energy information etc is redirected to the input changing its current behavior based on its previous behavior self directed in such way this sequence of effects that a change in a certain element of the system has on itself after going through a chain of effects in other parts of the system is called a feedback loop a feedback loop can be either positive if the final response increases the disturbance or negative if it decreased it for example global warming has a positive feedback loop when warming increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere which in turn leads to further warming on the other hand it has a negative feedback loop by the stefan boltzmann law all complex dynamic systems such as human ecosystems have numerous feedback loops that make the systems interconnected kunz et al 2013 such loops allow all of their parts to be within the limits necessary to move within a functional regime changes in the components of an ecosystem can be driven by external factors for example climate prices and demands political changes or internal factors like mortality and birth rates growth factors or food availability literature establishes that it is the change that triggers these feedback mechanisms thus acting as a catalyst for the response of the system forbes et al 2004 dale et al 2010 however issues such as the magnitude of change and the composition of elements necessary to obtain a measurable reaction as well as the immediacy and the degree of response are the main factors to be determined elshafei et al 2014 therefore in order to understand the complex dynamics resulting from the feedback between natural resources and human elements at multiple levels the development of a conceptual framework is required this problem has been addressed by a large number of works from different approaches which can be grouped into two categories lowerroman 1 natural feedback loops in which the structures and the responses of the natural elements that intervene in the feedback of the ecosystems are analyzed much of this work is derived from the so called world of daisies watson and lovelock 1983 in that theory a system described by lotka volterra equations with interaction parameters as a function of temperature self regulates by varying the population of certain species by changing the value of the albedo lowerroman 1 anthropogenic feedback loops the general idea is that all significant changes invariably feedback into the system through a behavioral response of the human sector these can be also divided into two approaches a philosophical or theoretical this approach proposes and analyzes conceptual feedback loops draw connections between constituent parts of the system define strategies to have more sustainable systems and serve as points of pressure in decision makers from business scales moizer and tracey 2010 to communities dale et al 2010 b numerical through the use of mathematical models or statistical and computational tools these approaches seek to determine the magnitude of the human behavioral response and their level of influence in the environment they can be qualitative or quantitative and are usually suitable for particular systems analyzing the feedback between resources actors and institutions across multiple scales such as in agricultural water systems elshafei et al 2014 or in the fishing industry hunt et al 2011 schlüter et al 2012 present an interesting review of the literature in this regard both approaches are complementary to each other the philosophical approach is focused on human human interactions and it has a deeper knowledge of human and social responses where the mathematics are hard to apply the numerical approach focuses on human environment interactions and usually derive into a mathematical model that measures the environmental response the importance of the analysis of the feedback loops in sustainability models arises from their ability to analyze possible future scenarios without compromising a system or experiment with it such significance is increased when they are used as ecosystem management tools if the effects of these loops are not understood at least in an essential level then the behaviors obtained from their simulations will widely differ from the real systems that they represent consequently the lack of understanding of the loops of an ecosystem will cause the decision makers to act under erroneous premises making the system vulnerable and hindering their resilience whiteman et al 2012 on the contrary under an adequate scheme that includes the basic aspects of feedback the consequences of the decisions will be evident and the behavior of the system can be managed instead of passively reacting to the events that change it sterman 2001 in this regard many kinds of mathematical models for ecosystems can be found in the literature however as stated earlier they usually are developed to describe particular systems even though this particularity provides them accuracy and data availability making them more realistic it is also true that it led them away from generality and makes them more difficult to be applied in different frameworks moreover if the analysis is going to be made from a sustainability perspective the mathematical model needs to be not only dynamic by definition but also must incorporate economic environmental and social aspects in an integrated way recently a series of compartmental models based on dynamic trophic mass consumption has been developed and improved in consecutive stages in search of a more complete model that includes crucial components of an ecosystem fath et al 2003 cabezas et al 2007 kotecha et al 2013 the most recent version is a stochastic model with a stratified population presented by rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 such model is a representation of a human ecosystem with economic and social elements such as per capita wages and social inequity within an ecological framework this model series has demonstrated to be a useful integrated tool in the sustainability analysis of human ecosystems from different perspectives therefore in the present work an anthropogenic feedback loop was included in this sustainability ecosystem model trying to identify conceptualize and quantify the factors involved in the system performance the aim is to formulate generalized principles that can lead to sustainable public policies 2 methods the model used in this work is a generic conceptual representation of a human ecosystem developed under an ecologic framework it involves fifteen compartments arranged by trophic levels as is shown in fig 1 the model includes three resource pools rp is the main source of the supplies required by the system water nutrients sunlight etc irp represents the resources derived from the residues due to human activity which are inaccessible to the human sector and are gradually reintegrated into the system through wild primary producers similarly erp represents finite non renewable energetic resources oil natural gas etc there are eight ecological compartments p1 represents the agricultural sector and h1 is the livestock sector both are considered domestic and depend directly on human activity p2 represents wild plants belonging to the state such as timber resources h2 are wild herbivores that consume p1 and c1 are carnivores that have access to h1 similarly p3 h3 and c2 are also primary wild plants herbivores and carnivores that do not interact directly with humans the last trophic level is the human sector hh1 represents a major fraction of the population that has a relatively low income and hh2 is the minor part that has a high income ep is the energy production sector and is involves all manufacturing and services industries lotka volterra differential equations are used to model the mass flows in a closed system for natural interactions represented as continuous lines in fig 1 lotka volterra terms remain with no change bilinear product by growth death factor lotka 1925 volterra 1926 however in the human influenced flows dashed lines such terms are calculated by algebraic equations derived from economic and social considerations more details can be found in rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 the model also calculates five indicators to evaluate the sustainable performance of the system i fisher information fi is a measure of the order or dynamic regime of the system it is a concept closely related to sustainability through the sustainable regime hypothesis eason and cabezas 2012 in this work fi is calculated using the continuous dynamic variables compartments by the analytical approach gonzalez mejia et al 2015 discuss differences between both approaches and summarized the later version of the sustainable regime hypothesis ii ecological footprint analysis efa measures the equivalent land demand of the population by identifying the amount of bio productive land required to support the annual average consumption and the waste production of an individual wackernagel 1996 all compartments and the human influenced flows are involved in its calculation iii green net regional product gnrp represents a common approach to estimate sustainability from a welfare perspective in a simplified way gnrp is defined as the sum of the real value of consumption and the real value of the net investments heberling et al 2012 gnrp is computed by estimating the economic value of the system through product prices and productions p1 h1 is and ep iv per capita wage w is directly related to the economic performance of the whole society gdp is defined as the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units then we assume that wages can be used as a representation of gdp per capita inside the model v green house gases ghg concentration determines the total co2eq contribution of the human sector activity and the mitigation by the natural sector in this way the dynamics of co2eq can be monitored by summing the positive negative contributions of each variable that involves the absorption emission of ghg such as natural compartments and human activity related flows in this manner the model includes several key elements of a human ecosystem and involves the three main sustainability fronts economic social and ecological however an important issue remains to be addressed which approach is the most appropriate to incorporate feedback into the model 2 1 conceptual incorporation of a feedback loop into the system dynamics despite the fact that the model utilized has been developed within an ecological framework incorporating natural feedback loops is not the most feasible option since capturing and mathematically categorizing natural change dynamics is extremely difficult in general there is no enough available data to identify the structures and functionalities of the interaction parameters in addition one cannot physically and ethically experiment with the world or with human ecosystems to obtain such functionalities therefore the most viable approach for current models is including anthropogenic feedback loops representing human responses however measuring quantifying and representing the emotional human response to diverse contextual situations in mathematical expressions are also nearly impossible tasks in addition previous works on this topic are usually carried out for specific cases of study that require particularities of the systems some of them cannot be applied to a generic framework such as the one considered in this work to properly identify feedback loops in general conceptual schemes such as the stratified model used in this work one must keep in mind the real system that is being represented the system has to be analyzed in order to determine the key factors that significantly affect the long term global behavior of it even though the model used is conceptual and does not represent any ecosystem or society in particular it does include representative elements and crucial aspects that allow it to be a generic representation of a human ecosystem since the dynamic behavior of the model is widely governed by the human sector changes in the human population will represent significant changes in the overall long term performance of the system the number of humans depends directly on the mortality and birth rates thus the predominant change factor of the model is the uncertainty in death and birth rates of the human compartment this stochasticity in demographic parameters entails a great uncertainty in the long term behavior of the model described and therefore in the sustainability of the system in a real world society this unpredictable dynamic performance would imply that the decision makers must recommend periodic social technological adjustments through legislation and public policies in order to maintain the system towards an objective set at the beginning of the analysis these basic ideas were applied in this work to develop the conceptual demographic feedback loop presented in fig 2 the procedure starts from observing the historical trend of the dynamics of a human ecosystem to estimate the parameters that determine its population growth then by assuming that such historical trend is maintained a medium or long term projection is made to calculate the expected behavior of the system once the expected behavior is known a feasible future scenario the decision makers will intend to move away or stay on that path depending on the goal sought or achieved decision makers can act through legislation and or public policies the goal sought might be social environmental economic or sustainable this analytic procedure is expected to be periodic and repeated on various cycles during the time horizon 2 2 numerical implementation of the feedback loop the numerical implementation of the conceptual feedback loop into the proposed model is achieved through the procedure shown in fig 3 it consists of a sequential cyclic approach involving three main steps i stochastic simulation of a time period ii development of a predictive model and iii an optimization step to propagate the feedback information to the following periods each step is explained next 2 2 1 a stochastic simulation step this step represents reality that is to say how the system is evolving under the current public policies due that the feedback loop comes from such public policies which to properly determine its effects are usually evaluated after several years after they are implemented the time horizon under analysis is divided into n periods of p years in other words each period n represents a wait and see time at the end of which the public policies are updated the model is simulated for the first period by using the initial values of the state variables and the given values of the model parameters see fig 3 it is important to notice that the model is stochastic because it considers the uncertain time dependent behavior of the demographic parameters as is shown in eqs 1 2 rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 1 d m h h i j m h h i j 1 δ t σ m i ε m δ t 2 d a p c b i j a p c b i j 1 δ t σ b i ε b δ t where dmhhij and dapcbij are increments of mhhij and apcbij which are the mortality and birth rates respectively δt is the integration step size σmi and σbi are the variance parameters εm and εb are random values that have a unit normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation hence at this point these demographic parameters are represented through ito process so that the dynamic simulation of the model can be performed by using a stochastic numerical integration technique at the end of the simulation period the output variables are analyzed and linear trends of the uncertain demographic parameters of each population are assumed for the next step 2 2 2 developing a deterministic predictive model the development of the predictive model is also based on the approach proposed by rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 the stochastic demographic parameters used in the previous steps are assumed to represent a real behavior in fact they are obtained from real population data such a demographic behavior is used in this step to build a linear predictive model the linear model is used to predict future scenarios and to evaluate the indicators government targets the predictive model is of course simpler than the original in such model the demographic parameters are known and display a linear behavior derived from an extrapolation of the linear trend obtained at final of the previous step eqs 3 4 so that uncertainties are not taken into consideration the predictive model is a deterministic model 3 m h h i j m m h h t b m h h 4 a p c b i j m a p c b t b a p c b where mmhh and mapcb are the slope for mortality and birth rates functions respectively bmhh and bapcb are the intercepts while t is the time it can be said that the predictive model is a model used by decision makers inside the simulated real world by the stochastic model in general in the real world such models fail to fully capture the real dynamics of the systems and are subject to many assumptions and simplifications nevertheless this deterministic model is used in the optimization step explained in the following subsection the idea is to use this simpler model to obtain new values for the techno economic and social parameters that may influence the trend of population growth the new set of values represents the implementation of new public policies inside the simulated real world derived from formal mathematical tools as well as in the real world not perfect but acceptable tools are used to develop appropriate guidelines furthermore with that improved set of values for the parameters obtained from the optimization the goal is self regulating the system in the following time periods and bringing it closer to a more sustainable path 2 2 3 formulation and solution of an optimal control problem this step is a simulation inside the simulation where decision makers every certain number of years develop the predictive model a simpler version of their world and use mathematical programming to establish accurate public policies aimed to modify a set of parameters looking to achieve a government goal because of the dynamic nature of the model the optimization step requires the use of optimal control theory optimal control problems involve a time dependent objective and a set of constraints in the form of differential equations if the model also includes algebraic equations as in this case then the complexity of the problem increases diwekar 2003 the constraints of the optimization model used here is a set of differential algebraic equations dae the differential equations correspond to the dynamics of the compartmental variables the algebraic equations correspond to the mass flows and economic social variables of the stratified economic ecologic social model the problem also contains a set of control decision variables which are time dependent variables that can be manipulated in order to bring the system through a desirable performance in sustainability analysis the selection of those decision variables is a crucial stage notice that the use of external control variables as decision variables does not make sense in this context since the model is a closed mass representation of a human ecosystem the selection of the decision variables was achieved through a sensitivity analysis performed as a preliminary step before the numerical implementation of the feedback loop in such preliminary step all of the techno economic and social model parameters that can be modified through governmental policies were identified first then the sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which among them have a greater influence on the system dynamics when they are perturbed those parameters chosen in the preliminary step are used as given known parameters during the initial simulation step of fig 3 and section 2 2 1 in a given time period n representing a set of public policies established at the beginning of the period and remain constant in all p years of the period but then they become the decision variables of the deterministic optimization step described here the aim is to modify i e provide feedback information into the system their values in order to improve the performance of the system for future periods the last component of the optimal control problem is precisely the desirable target to be minimized that is the objective function or performance index this work uses the sustainability indicators described above to define the objective function of the model sustainability is not defined through a single point but rather is a path through time therefore the objective function is also time dependent the objective function definition requires a mathematical function that can represent the search for an economic ecologic social balance through minimization an approach that is commonly used is the penalization of the deviation of the state of the system from equilibrium sager et al 2006 a sustainability indicator can be used to measure the state of the system and the point of equilibrium can be obtained from an ideal sustainable state doshi et al 2014 thus the objective function could be formulated as given by eq 5 5 j m i n t 0 t f z z b 2 where t 0 and tf are the initial and final time in which the analysis is done z is the value of any of the sustainability indicator for the system and zb is the baseline ideal sustainability indicator at the end the optimization stage provides new values for the selected techno economical social parameters control variables which are fed to the simulation step of the next time period of the sequential cyclic procedure of fig 3 that closes a cycle of the algorithm and provides the starting point to the following period hence it is expected that the new values of the parameters will lead the system to a more sustainable path for future periods 3 results and discussion following the strategy proposed by rodriguez gonzalez et al 2018 four societies with different development levels were used to analyze the effects that the feedback loop incorporated into the model has over the resilience and sustainability of the system 1 society type a an ideal society with perfect resources distribution used as baseline for comparison 2 society type b a developed country 3 society type c a newly advanced economic development country 4 society type d a developing country 3 1 numerical results of simulations without feedback seeking simplicity the model is not included in this paper but it is provided as a part of the supplementary information accompanying this paper first in order to evaluate and analyze the effect over the sustainable performance of a human ecosystem with feedback loops the model was simulated for the different societies during a time horizon of 200 years without considering feedback the profiles obtained for the sustainability indicators are shown in fig 4 the black lines are the type a profiles it can be seen that except for fi and ghg concentration sustainable indicators remain practically constant through the simulation time this represents that their ecological economic social balance does not change over time being sustainable by definition fig 4a shows that fi doubles its value in the first 80 years this is a signal at the beginning the system is gaining dynamic order moving to a more sustainable regime in which it remains to the end of the simulation on the other hand in fig 4e it is observed a linear growth of co2 equivalent concentration moving from 200 to 1000 ppm this is indicative that even in a hypothetic ideal society that keeps unalterable the negative environmental impacts of current human activity will remain and will rise society type b represent by dashed blue lines in fig 4 is the most equitable society under analysis 63 of its wealth belongs to 75 of its population in fig 4a it can be seen that as in the base case the system gains order in the first part nevertheless it is reduced a little after that denoting that type b is moving in a less sustainable regime than the base case fig 4b shows that the required productive land in practically the same also in fig 4d it is observed that per capita wages are constant for long time periods being very similar than the base case at the end of the simulation time this can be interpreted as social stability individually these profiles could be understood as a sustainable system however looking at fig 4c and e there is a notorious continuous decrease in the system economy and environmental performance that denotes an unsustainable path society type c is the dotted green lines in fig 4 this is a transitional society between type d and type b which can be observed in fig 4a where the system order fluctuates among them the per capita wages of this society fig 4d is continuously increasing being significantly higher than the base case in the first instance this situation can be thought of as highly desirable since it represents a higher income for inhabitants however as the previous case fig 4c and e denotes a greater reduction on the economic environmental wellbeing being the ghg concentration doubled from type b society type d is the most inequality the richest quartile of the population has 62 of the overall wealth in fig 4 the red dash dotted lines represent this society like in the other societies its efa value does not vary significantly fig 4 b fig 4a shows fi despite its profiles relatively constant from year 40 it is the lowest value this denotes that is the system with less dynamic order in regard to the other indicators the performance is very similar in trend than type c but so much pronounced the gnrp value is the lowest in all time fig 4c and the final value of ghg concentration is the higher twelve times than the base case fig 4e this society is the less sustainable even when the per capita wages are the highest fig 4d the differences among the sustainable indicators profiles for types b c and d societies with respect to the base case entail significant changes in the behavior of system variables such as the accelerated decay of some compartments including humans in some cases this behavior would imply the total extinction of the compartment as it is the case for compartment p1 other effects include the increase in the prices of the products the increase of prices is more significant in society type d than those of societies b and c once the behavior of the different types of society was analyzed without considering feedback the model parameters that can be modified by public policies were determined and submitted to a sensitivity analysis the aim is to determine the parameters whose variations influence the more the system performance such parameters are selected to become the decision variables in the optimization problem table 1 summarizes the selected decision parameters grpp2 is the growth of plant p2 which depends only on natural resources and owes characteristics of the plant however current developing technologies allow plants to grow faster and bigger or if needed the opposite result is also possible cisp is a factor that relates the amount of industrial sector production to its price this can be modified through government legislation and incentives aw is the base value from which wages are calculated which is interpreted as a minimum wage most countries have already introduced minimum wage legislation in this way if a government considers it relevant it can change such base value in order to improve wages k is the amount of consumption of timber resources from the human sector which is established at discretion by the government finally theta and lambda are the amounts of the agrarian sector and the biological resources to produce one unit of industrial services both of them can be modified by technological improvements it is important to notice that although the selected variables have a direct equivalence to real factors that can be modified in reality through technology or public policies the model still is a conceptual representation the selected variables remain then as conceptual decisions providing a desirable qualitative performance rather than an expected quantitative improvement 3 2 numerical results of simulations with the implementation of the feedback loop the numerical implementation of the feedback loop described in section 2 2 and fig 3 was then applied to societies types b c and d using type a as the sustainable baseline all analyzes were performed using 10 periods of 20 years projections to 50 years were used in the optimization step in order to solve the optimization problem obtained at the end of each period matlab interior point algorithm is used the previous period values of decision variables looking to determine the level of influence that the feedback loop has on the sustainability of the system each of the 5 different indicators fi efa gnrp w and co2eq were used as a sustainable governmental target through eq 1 however sustainable indicators are not continuous functions they generally involve discrete points the discrete values of the indicators are usually calculated over long enough time periods as to collect the data required for their calculation to simplify their estimations the numerical implementation of the approach uses integration steps of one year obtaining in this way values of the sustainable indicators in a realistic temporality therefore in practice the objective function becomes a discretized expression eq 6 6 j m i n i t o i t f z i z b i 2 where t0 and tf are the initial and final time in which the analysis is done zi is the annual scalar value of the sustainability indicator for the system in year i and zbi is the annual scalar value of the sustainability indicator of the baseline in year i the simulation results involve a large number of profiles of the state variables and performance indicators for the various societies only the profiles for some of the key variables representing the performance of the system from different perspectives are presented here the population size nhh was selected as the main social factor which in the three types of society is significantly reduced without feedback the desirable behavior of this variable is to keep certain stability a decreasing population could derive in human extinction and excessive growth could involve significant social and economic issues for an environmental perspective p1 was selected p1 is the natural compartment which is extinguished without feedback in all cases the ideal scenario is not only to avoid its extinction but also to increase the number of plants the co2eq concentration profile is also shown because it is one of the greatest current global concerns the ideal scenario is to keep its value as low as possible from the economic perspective two parameters are selected w and wp w represents the average wealth of the population and the desirable effect is to increase its value as much as possible wp is the average product price whose value should be kept as low as possible the following results represent typical uncertain scenarios of each society for each of the different sustainability targets fig 5 shows the results for the type b society from the economic point of view it is with the use co2eq and gnrp as indicators that the salary w shows an improvement while the optimization of the others indicators does not cause significant changes fig 5a the prices fig 5b present the same tendencies as those of the per capita wages from the environmental perspective only the use of co2eq results in a considerable delay in the extinction of p1 fig 5c the greatest reduction of the ghg concentration fig 5d is of course achieved when such variable is used as the target followed by the case of w as objective from the social perspective the population shows a general decreasing trend but the cases where fi and w are used as objective functions are able to mitigate such decrease fig 5e there are some peculiar situations that can be analyzed co2eq as objective can control the overall performance of the system but in exchange for a half population reduction w can stabilize the human population and reduce the ghg emissions but in exchange for reducing a little the wage and of still losing p1 fi can reverse the initial population decrease but in order to achieve it a significant reduction of wages and prices has to be done for a 20 years period fig 6 presents the results for the type c society for an economic point of view gnrp and fi are the indicators that lead to a better behavior of the system fig 6 a and b from the environmental perspective the extinction of p1 cannot be avoided or delayed through the optimization of any of the indicators fig 6d presents the concentration of ghg only the use of gnrp as target did not provide a positive result although it did not make it worse either the concentration of co2eq was the one that achieved the most significant change socially fig 6e shows that w co2eq and efa manage to reverting the population decrease in fact the use of efa allows keeping the population relatively stable throughout the whole time horizon of the analysis it can be observed that there is a clear inverse relationship between wages and prices population in order to improve per capita wages prices also have to rise this entails a reduction of the population also when fi is used as the target the ghg concentration is initially high but in the final 50 years it tends to be stabilized without compromising other variables in a different situation when co2eq is used as the target the population and the ghg concentration can be controlled but it compromises the per capita wages around year 100 being zero for a 10 years period similar from the others societies the results of the type d are presented in fig 7 for the economic perspective the use of w as target is the only case where the desirable behavior of wages is not achieved fig 7a the opposite occurs for average prices fig 7b environmentally fi and co2eq delayed the extinction of p1 for a long period of time whereas it is the use of w as target which achieves the most positive significant change in the behavior of the system fig 7c for the concentration of ghg fig 7d shows that w and co2eq as targets drastically improve the performance of the system considerably reducing the final value of this variable fig 7e shows that the population size remains practically stable if w is used as an objective the rest of the indicators do not favor significant changes as in previous cases the use of fi or co2eq as the target can reduce significantly the ghg concentration and delay the p1 extinction but in exchange for not reversing the population decline the use of gnrp as the target can improve the economy of the system even when in the other aspects there is no positive or negative change for society type d it is the use of w as indicator which shows a greater effect on the system performance under the feedback loop approach therefore the results obtained for this particular case are analyzed in greater detail fig 8 presents the profiles of the techno economical regulatory parameters of the system decision variables for such case the largest changes in their values are observed in the first three periods they are basically constant beyond that point as established earlier these decision variables are conceptual and their behavior does not represent actual values or magnitude of any real system instead they represent the qualitative influence that they have over the system dynamics fig 8a and b shows that the growing rate of p2 has to be slightly reduced while its consumption has to be increased this means that it is necessary to reduce the p2 compartment in the first decades fig 8c indicates that the industrial sector has to raise its prices fig 8d shows that the government must first reduce the base wage before being able to raise it this situation can be interpreted as a period of austerity prior to a period of prosperity finally fig 8e and f clearly shows the need for better production technologies with better efficiency in the use of the resources fig 9 shows the sustainable indicators profiles for the type d society results include the behavior achieved with and without feedback loop results for the baseline are also shown as expected the behavior of the system changes under a feedback loop approach changes in the decision variables during the first decades allow the system to behave in a way similar that the ideal case achieving a relatively sustainable human ecosystem the catastrophic scenario that occurs without feedback is avoided in order to further examine this observation the remaining natural compartments are shown fig 10 shows the profiles for the plants and the resources whereas fig 11 does the same with the profiles of the carnivores and herbivores when feedback is provided although the system does not completely reach the ideal case it does behave with similar trends despite the instability caused by economic inequality along with the demographic uncertainties finally fig 12 presents the demographic variables profiles of the stochastic simulation step and the linear predicted profiles used in the optimization step the red dots indicate the start of a period n the black dashed lines are the projections made at the end of such period which are used in the optimization step to establish the new guidelines to use at period n 1 it can be seen that for birth rates the predicted values are close to the stochastic profiles even in the farther predictions 50 years the error is less than 20 on the other hand the mortality rates eventually fail to capture the behavior of the main simulation due to the large uncertainty effect like in the real world the mathematical predictions inside the simulation can be good enough to represent future trends or fail due to the inherent incapacity to have a perfect model 4 conclusions the inclusion of feedback loops into the model favors a greater resilience of the system the loops allow self regulation and mitigate the influence of both the instabilities and external uncertainties similar to the behavior of human ecosystems of the real world when analyzing the results it appears that the more unstable systems have greater opportunities to achieve a sustainable path than the most sustainable systems as long as the government target is the most adequate in a more sustainable society like society type b different government targets can be used to improve the variables performance in a less sustainable society like type d not all of the targets achieve desirable results but the influence of the critical target over the entire system is bigger improving all variables at once this occurs in society type d with per capita wages as the target it is well documented in the literature that in the real world more developed societies are able to face situations of instability in a more efficient manner however the previous conclusion does not contradict this fact since it is true that developed countries can adopt more easily legislative and technological changes what the results indicate is that if the developing societies had the same capacity as the more developed ones those changes would represent a greater impact in addition since the results show that each type of society has different adequate targets for different economical ecological social needs it can be concluded that the choice of an adequate governmental sustainable target suitable for the particularities of the system is of crucial importance in order to achieve a desired sustainable path even more such a desirable path is achieved in the first periods when the effect of the instabilities is still small and can be reverted therefore the first years are critical to achieving a good sustainable performance in a real context governments managers policy makers and all kinds of decision makers often do not try to anticipate changes and prepare for them instead they act after a disturbance has happened thus as bailey 2015 indicates catastrophic predictions in this work represented by the predictive model can act as a trigger to stimulate the social response and exercise pressure over institutions responsible for public policies however even when predictive models are important to activate feedback mechanisms by establishing non desirable future scenarios their usefulness is limited when try to avoid them the inclusion of feedback loops in the modeling and analysis of dynamic systems helps to favor a correct decision making process it contributes with the study of non intuitive feasible scenarios impossible to analyze otherwise while the presented methodology is a good step forward in the development of coupled human and natural systems it is true that this work only focuses on anthropogenic feedback loops natural loops are also important and

than a decade and zostera meadow have gradually recovered expressing lagoon ecosystem restoration such as thau lagoon do the progressive achievement of the good ecological status of the thau lagoon possibly threatens the shellfish industry in terms of production and oyster quality by reducing the carrying capacity to provide answers about the right balance to be achieved between conservation and exploitation a new numerical tool was developed to help in decision making we hereby propose to incorporate a dynamic energy budget type shellfish production model to an existing lagoon ecosystem box model the influence of different scenarios of nutrient inputs related to projections of population growth or improvement of treatment plants and shellfish stocks were tested on oyster performances

mainly controlled by nutrient inputs which depend on hydro meteorological variability and specifically by phosphorus and n p ratios of nutrient inputs scenarios tested however demonstrated smaller

consideration of major components e g aquaculture socio economics and environmental based on best available knowledge and a search for a trade off between environment conservation and socio economic objectives this rapid growing economic sector has inevitably raised questions of carrying capacity and sustainability nunes et al 2003 in this context the concept of the carrying capacity is commonly used as it involves major aspects of integrated ecosystem functioning such as physics productivity ecology and socio economics mckindsey et al 2006 regarding cultured bivalves this carrying capacity can be primarily defined as the biomass of a population supported permanently by a given system dame and prins 1998 kashiwai 1998 however this definition has been successively extended to a maximized production without affecting growth rates carver and mallet 1990 to a maximized production of marketable cohorts bacher et al 1998 and more recently to a maximized production within the frame of environmental sustainability smaal et al 1997 ferreira et al 2008 byron et al 2011b filgueira et al 2015 the current consensus is that production carrying capacity represents the stock that maximizes harvests while ecosystem responses or ecological carrying capacity deal with unwanted modifications of phytoplankton abundances nutrient cycling or organic content in sediments mckindsey et al 2006 grant et al 2007 guyondet et al 2014 recent research has been promoting use of mathematical models of various complexity dabrowski et al 2013 to tackle the issues of cultured shellfish management a lot of efforts have been made in the representation of shellfish modelling from individual based gangnery 2003 to mechanistic bourlès et al 2009 kooijman 2010 alunno bruscia et al 2011 and mixed brigolin et al 2009 models these individual models are then coupled to ecosystem food web based models that include most of the relevant biological compartments of aquatic systems grangeré et al 2009 byron et al 2011c filgueira et al 2014b these coupled models can thus be complexified by representing exchanges with the outer world through simple renewal times grangeré et al 2009 box model chapelle et al 2000 filgueira and grant 2009 raillard and menesguen 1994 and fully spatialized hydrodynamic models guyondet et al 2010 while these models give insights into the carrying capacity of an ecosystem it is crucial to derive other model outputs to evaluate impacts of shellfish farming on ecosystem functioning the thau lagoon as many other coastal mediterranean lagoons has been experiencing major anthropogenic pressures as it received large nutrient loadings from its watershed la jeunesse and elliott 2004 plus et al 2006 these nutrient inputs have been identified as the main cause of eutrophication issues or dystrophic crisis souchu et al 1998 harzallah and chapelle 2002 thus many efforts have been made to reduce nutrient loadings mainly through the installation of waste water treatment plants wwtp in the 1970 s and their refurbishment later in the 2000 s these works have drastically reduced the amount of nutrient inputs from the watershed and successfully led to reach a current good ecological status of water column of the thau lagoon according to the eu water framework directive wfd ec 2000 derolez et al 2019 these profound changes in the lagoon inputs from the watershed have raised concerns from shellfish farmers oyster farming after having taken precedence over mussel farming in the 1990s has seen its activity largely impacted by juvenile mortality phenomena from 2008 pernet et al 2012 which significantly reduced the overall annual shellfish production under current production conditions long term observations of farmed oyster performances have shown improved growth rates and condition index probably linked to a decrease in the oyster stock despite the decrease in phytoplankton biomass observed bec et al 2018 considering these recent and important changes in the pressures exerted on the thau lagoon an assessment of its ecological carrying capacity for shellfish culture is required we hereby present a modelling work to address concerns arising from shellfish farmers and consider realistic actions combining the achievement of regulatory constraints and the sustainability of this major socio economic activity the gamelag model pete et al tbs was formerly developed for the bages sigean lagoon to produce similar ecological indicators as those used in the wfd european community 2000 these indicators have been established as relevant criterion to assess ecological status of a given ecosystem according to different categories from high to very bad in addition a dynamic energy budget deb model for the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas formerly developed on the atlantic coast pouvreau et al 2006 bernard et al 2011a was parameterized for the thau lagoon and coupled to the gamelag model concomitantly to the model implementation a major part of the presented work was realized in close partnership with shellfish growers local and governmental management bodies and scientists based on this joint work management scenarios were established on realistic working hypotheses the objectives of this work were therefore 1 to build a carrying capacity model and 2 to test the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and oyster stocking densities on oyster performances condition index production carrying capacity and ecological status of the thau lagoon this work was carried out in collaboration with managers and farmers to find the right balance between conservation and exploitation for sustainable development of shellfish farming in good ecological status coastal area 2 material methods 2 1 study site thau lagoon fig 1 is located on the south coast of france 43 18 43 28 n 3 30 3 45 e and has a total area of 68 km2 19 5 km long by 4 5 km width and an average depth of 4 m fiandrino et al 2017 the lagoon is connected to the sea through two inlets i e the sète channel in the north 90 of sea water exchanges and the grau de pisse saumes inlet in the south the sète channel is 2 4 km long with a mean cross section of about 300 m2 the mediterranean climate is characterised by a wide range of temperatures 5 29 c and salinities in the lagoon cover a range of 27 42 with a low spatial gradient data from rephy monitoring network fiandrino et al 2017 the lagoon has a narrow located between the balaruc point and the barrou point separating the lagoon into two basins the petit etang to the east and grand etang to the west the grand etang is the location of shellfish farming activities spread over three areas at the north of this basin 20 of the lagoon surface these shellfish farming zones namely bouzigues mèze and marseillan fig 1 gather around 2800 farming structures 1250 m2 and a total area of 640 ha harbouring growing oyster juveniles hereafter spat and adults hereafter oyster of the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas 70 of the shellfish stocks and mussel mytilus galloprovincialis the watershed spreads mainly northward from the lagoon over an area of 280 km2 and is drained by several rivers with intermittent flows the main tributary the vène river is connected to the crique de l angle area and brings an annual average of 15 1 mm3 of freshwater about 50 of total flow ranging from 3 1 to 24 7 mm3 between 2009 and 2016 the population in this watershed amounts to 126 604 inhabitants french national institute of statistics and economical studies insee 2015 over 14 main cities equipped with waste water treatment plants wwtp five of these towns sète poussan bouzigues gigean and balaruc fig 1 are connected to the sète wwtp which discards effluents 7 km offshore in the mediterranean sea the four other cities montbazin villeveyrac mèze loupian and pinet pomerols have their own wwtp releasing effluents into the thau lagoon 2 2 carrying capacity model the gamelag model pete et al tbs was formerly developed for management purposes with regards to water quality assessment under the wfd gamelag works on the principle of a box model where the lagoon is represented by basins physically homogeneous in which the stocks of the different biological compartments are simulated as well as the fluxes of matter nitrogen n and phosphorus p connecting these compartments fig 2 the lagoon was separated into three main boxes green boxes fig 1 petit etang box 1 east of grand etang and west of grand etang box 2 and 3 respectively on fig 1 in order to simplify the model and to be able to compare it with available observations the mèze and marseillan shellfish farming zones were gathered to form box 5 whereas bouzigues shellfish farming zone formed box 4 red boxes fig 1 the hydrodynamic exchanges between box 1 and the mediterranean sea and between two adjacent physical boxes are simulated following formalism defined by gordon et al 1996 based on daily net residual volumes and mixing volumes while net residual volumes are state variables of the hydrodynamic module of the gamelag model daily time series of mixing volumes at frontiers of physical boxes have to be defined as forcing dataset the hydrodynamic exchanges between box 4 and physical box 1 and between box 5 and physical box 2 only depend on mixing volume there is no net residual volumes between these boxes mixing volume takes into account wind mixin mainly inside the lagoon and tide driven exchange between lagoon and the sea these mixing volumes are therefore varying in time a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model for application at regional scale mars 3d was used to compute daily time series of mixing volumes lagarde et al 2019 lazure and dumas 2008 descriptions of the mars3d model applied on thau lagoon and the forcing dataset necessary for simulating water bodies circulation are provided in fiandrino et al 2017 same atmospheric wind air temperature incident radiation and hydrological daily average river water fluxes m3 s 1 from the watershed are used to force mars 3d and gamelag models specific dataset were used sea level elevation in sete channel to force mars 3d model at the open boundary condition for the simulated period in order to model the growth of an average oyster individual in the shellfish production areas of the thau lagoon a coupling of the gamelag and deb oyster model was carried out to form gamelag conch model it involves the integration of the deb model into the biogeochemical model the dynamic energy budget of c gigas model is based on the deb theory kooijman 2009 and adapted to the pacific oyster in the atlantic under various versions 3 state variables pouvreau et al 2006 or 4 state variables bernard et al 2011b the dynamics in time of the different energy fluxes are described by a system of differential equations see suppl mat tables s1 and associated processes pouvreau et al 2006 bernard et al 2011b within the frame of this work the model was adapted and parameterised for the thau lagoon with additional parameters related to rearing schemes see suppl mat table s2 the deb model operates on energy flows in joules allocated to different functions within the individual reserve maintenance growth and reproduction amongst these energy costs some imply a dissipation of energy which must be translated into excretion of matter to maintain steady mass balances within the gamelag conch model the oyster food resource in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus xn and xp is assumed to be a mix of various available particles in the water column e g state variables of the biogeochemical model and is defined as 1 x n α p s p s α p l p l α z s z s α z l z l α p o n p o n and 2 x p α p s p s α p l p l n p p h y t o α z s z s α z l z l n p z o o α p o p p o p where ps pl zs and zl are small and large phytoplankton and small and large zooplankton and pon the sum of labile and refractory particulate organic nitrogen each of these food resources is weighted by a preference coefficient αi with i ps pl zs zl pon or pop the oyster food resource is expressed in phosphorus using n to p stoichiometry of phytoplankton and zooplankton npphyto and npzoo whereas pop is the sum of labile and refractory particulate organic phosphorus hence the stoichiometry of food resources is expressed as 3 n p x x n x p the food resource and dissipated deb energy fluxes were translated respectively from mmol n or p to joules and from joules to mmol n or p using conversion factors see suppl mat table s2 in the deb model some of the available energy is lost first there is the amount of material ingested but not assimilated by the oyster which is expressed in the deb model by the excretion of faeces and pseudo faeces joules per unit of time this part of the non assimilated food either reached the sea bed to fuel sediment stock of n and p or was remineralised into inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column once assimilated the energy is allocated into the compartments of the deb model structures reserves and reproduction in order to maintain balanced stoichiometry in the deb model excretion is required and is simulated according to the stoichiometry of the ingested material thus the ratio n p of the resource npx is compared to the ratio n p of the oyster npo when this npx is greater than the npo the regeneration of material is in the form of ammonium in the model on the contrary when the npx is lower than the npo the regeneration was assumed to be in the form of orthophosphate in this way even if the stoichiometry of the resource is variable the individual rejects a quantity of n or p to maintain a balanced stoichiometry this system of regeneration of post assimilation material provides available mineral forms of n and p in the water column the maintenance costs 4 p m p j growth costs 5 p g e g d v μ v e g and gamete production costs 6 p g e ggo d go μ go e ggo were also added to the amounts of regenerated matter as they correspond to dissipated energy see suppl mat table s3 in the gamelag conch model these energy costs were converted into nh4 or po4 3 with conversion factors coyster and μen energy yield of reserves these conversion factors are based on the available data on the chemical potential of the different compartments of the oyster add my pet portal https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet thus the chemical potential of the food once converted to j mmol 1 n gives a conversion factor coyster of 3250 j mmol 1 n the coyster conversion factor affects energy related to ingested but non assimilated matter faeces and pseudo faeces and the energy related to predation on the different compartments composing oyster food i e small and large phytoplankton small and large zooplankton and particulate organic matter the second conversion factor μen is obtained by deriving the chemical potential of bivalve reserves with the nitrogen or phosphorus content of the organic matter that makes up these reserves the factor thus obtained is 3667 j mmol 1 n in general these conversion factors vary between 2400 and 3700 j mmol 1 n depending on whether food structure or reserves are considered as n or p content platt and irwin 1973 grangeré et al 2009 2 3 oyster seeding scheme in the model seeding scheme as the introduction in farming structures of spats and oysters is rather complex in the thau lagoon and mainly depends on environmental conditions contamination risks time frame or market dynamics two main periods for seeding were extracted from the monograph results gervasoni and giffon 2016 indicating that according to growth durations most spats 6 8 mm were mainly reared on lanterns or pearl nets and introduced between july and august 47 reared over the summer for a period of 6 8 months in addition this study indicated that oysters 15 20 mm were introduced within the early months of the year 53 in january and february for a duration of 12 to 14 months to reach marketable size oyster therefore in order to simplify this seeding time schedule for the gamelag conch model we assumed a common seeding scheme where oysters were introduced on the first of february and harvested in mid december regarding to spat seeding the first of july was used in the model to start growth of spats for a duration of 7 months in february remaining spats from year n were then used to seed oysters in year n 1 the total abundances were 532 1 106 and 235 7 106 individuals for spats and oysters respectively for the entire farming zone box 4 box 5 fig 1 mortality rates were also extracted from the monograph with values of 38 2 10 5 10 4 d 1 during the pre growing phase and 32 5 8 9 10 4 d 1 during the growing phase cepralmar 2016 seeding densities were then used to simulate stocking densities over the growing period as follows 7 d o y s t e r d t s e e d i n g o y s t e r o y s t e r m o r t a l i t y o y s t e r and 8 d s p a t d t s e e d i n g s p a t s p a t m o r t a l i t y s p a t where seedingoyster and seedingspat are densities of oysters and spats introduced as described above the number of individuals introduced was extracted from the monograph gervasoni and giffon 2016 and extrapolated to the farming zones with data from local authorities ddtm 2014 which represented an average exploitation of 70 of growing structures length l and dry flesh matter dfm were calculated at harvest for each simulated year annual oyster production was estimated from total weight derived from dfm equation 16 table s1 in suppl material and the number of living individuals simulated at harvest oyster condition index ci was estimated from model outputs by using the ratio of dfm g over length cm 2 4 reference simulation the baseline simulation e g reference scenario n 1 table 1 used in this study represented the current conditions of the thau lagoon functioning this baseline simulation was used to evaluate model skills see section 2 5 this simulation covered the period from 2014 to 2016 and was carried out with the hydro meteorological conditions of these three years including precipitation contributions of the natural catchment and contributions from wwtp based on the data of self monitoring recorded at the entrance of the wwtp data from smbt hydrological conditions of the simulated years were contrasted in terms of total rainfall and associated trophic contributions the year 2015 defined as a dry year 255 mm compared to 1970 2016 average showed low natural hydrological contributions with inputs of 0 77 t of p and 12 7 t of n whereas the years 2014 and 2016 with more intense rainfall events 70 mm and 55 mm compared to 1970 2016 average brought natural nutrient loadings to a respective estimate of 5 and 5 6 t of p and 86 6 t and 98 t of n during wet years anthropogenic inputs from wwtp amounted for 18 of n loading against 55 for p inputs total inputs from the watershed natural and anthropogenic reached 109 2 39 4 and 113 8 tons of n and 10 1 6 1 and 10 2 t of p for the three simulated years for the year 2015 wwtp discharges constituted the main source of n 62 and p 90 inputs whereas for the wet years 2014 and 2016 wwtp inputs accounted for up to 20 of total nutrient loadings the initialization of the biological compartments takes into account the most recent observations in order to get as close as possible to the current conditions in the simulations concerning the initialization of shellfish culture data from the cépralmar monograph cépralmar 2016 were used for livestock densities in the bouzigues and mèze marseillan areas see section oyster seeding scheme in the model the extrapolation of these survey results to both production areas was based on the data provided by local authorities ddtm 2014 with 2632 tables in concession of which 382 were not active the estimate of the structures hosting pre growth spats and growth adults was conducted using data from the monograph cepralmar 2016 extrapolated to the 2250 tables in operation on each of the two areas this baseline scenario is referred as ref in table 1 scenario n 1 table 1 2 5 model skills evaluation model computation the willmott index of agreement willmott 1981 d was used to evaluate the performance this metric is a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error and varies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement at all this index of agreement was used to evaluate model skills on salinity chl a concentration as well as shell length cm and tissue dry weight g of cultured oysters available observations for these variables were compared to simulations for the two shellfish farming zones fig 1 box 4 and 5 the gamelag conch model was implemented in r r core team 2017 using the desolve package soetaert et al 2010 for differential equation solving time step 1 day 2 6 description of scenarios scenarios of different nutrient inputs and shellfish culture strategies were determined in close interactions with shellfish farmers mediterranean shellfish committee crcm managers the thau basin organization smbt the centre for studies of lagoon and maritime activities cepralmar the french water agency aerm c departmental direction of territories and sea ddtm and scientists marbec these scenarios were built on realistic management hypotheses established during participative meetings and are based on two main axes 1 scenarios related to trophic contributions from the watershed and associated management measures and 2 scenarios related to shellfish production and they are summarized in table 1 the anthropogenic contributions of the watershed were tested according to different scenarios corresponding to different management hypotheses around the watershed of thau scenario 2 5 table 1 the yields of the wwtps are constrained by the environment that receives the discharges and come within the context of the regional plan for water management sdage rhône méditerranée and the local water management scheme sage applied to the thau lagoon territory when these receiving water bodies carry a risk of eutrophication they are classified as sensitive to eutrophication according to european regulation ec 1991 in the context of sensitive zones the european legislation ec 1991 requires wwtp to treat at least 80 of phosphorus and 70 to 80 of nitrogen for cities with more than 10 000 inhabitant equivalents ie for smaller municipalities these obligations vary and may be higher depending on the case thau lagoon was classified as a sensitive zone in 2004 according to european recommendations ec 2004 on these provisions it was concluded to test initially two scenarios declining these treatments of wwtp to 1 maximum yield scenario 2 max yield with abatements greater than 90 for nitrogen and phosphorus 2 normal yield scenario 3 nal yield corresponding to reductions of 75 and 60 respectively for nitrogen and phosphorus it should be noted that only the mèze lagoon based treatment plant currently offers yields comparable to the high abatements required by the sensitive zone classification 90 in direct relation with the environmental management constraints the territorial occupation scheme scot and in particular the demographic projections of this scot were evaluated in this study indeed an increase in population estimated at 23 at 2030 horizon directly leads to increased wwtp effluents wastewater discharges and consequently recommendations to anticipate these evolutions must be incorporated into a management policy of the territory this scenario scenario 4 scot table 1 aimed at estimating the impact of the population increase on the thau catchment area by 2030 in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the lagoon as well as its impact on ecological status and shellfish cultures in the thau lagoon current yields of wwtps were then applied to these estimated quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus to provide quantities entering the lagoon the following scenario scenario 5 sète table 1 corresponded to potential management leverage for freshwater and nutrient inputs n p to the lagoon through an operating strategy of the sète wwtp this scenario addressed the question of the evaluation of the impact of discharges in the sète channels and hence in the lagoon in anticipation of important modernization works on the wwtp the sète wwtp currently has its outfall in the sea but could release discharges to the sète channels in case of heavy rains this scenario examined the effect of an additional 69 5 72 9 and 84 7 tons of nitrogen in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in terms of phosphorus additional quantities were estimated at 3 7 3 1 and 3 6 tons for the same years respectively the scenario of different oyster stocking densities tested in this study corresponded to seeding conditions for which all the growing structures would be filled with oysters at the maximum densities allowed by the structure scheme ddtm 2014 in comparison to reference seeding conditions see section oyster seeding scheme in the model abundances were increased by a factor 2 for spats e g 501 106 and 546 106 individuals for box 4 bouzigues and box 5 mèze marseillan respectively and by a factor 1 3 for oysters e g 158 7 106 and 129 9 106 individuals for box 4 and box 5 respectively 2 7 data treatment and scenario realization prior to the simulations of these different scenarios a first step was the wwtp data processing to force the gamelag conch model work to recover volumes and concentrations of global nitrogen ngl and global phosphorus pgl at the inlets of the wwtps was performed based on data from sandre portal http www sandre eaufrance fr these data were used to establish 1 yield matrices for each wwtp located on the thau watershed and 2 matrices of fractions of the different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus for each of the wwtp to allow the transformation of total nitrogen and total phosphorus after treatment into their different inorganic and organic fractions necessary to force the model in a first step the input data of wwtp undergoes a reduction corresponding to the scenario tested see abatements table 1 and in a second step the output concentrations thus estimated are fractionated according to the different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus for the corresponding wwtp this procedure allowed for multiple different yield matrices or input augmentations as per scot projections applied to the same starting ngl and pgl datasets this method was applied for all scenarios with three matrices of yields covering current treatment maximum treatment and normal treatment see sections on reference and scenarios description 2 8 carrying capacity evaluation as mentioned in the introduction the targeted carrying capacity lies in the equilibrium between an optimised harvest without negative effects on ecological functioning the dame index and phytoplankton depletion index were then used where the former provides a bulk information on ecosystem functioning and allows comparison between different ecosystems whereas the depletion index linked more finely cultured bivalves to its resource 2 8 1 dame index the dame index was calculated from the characteristic times of the lagoon dame and prins 1998 these characteristic times included i the lagoon renewal time rt time required to renew the entire lagoon volume which is a hydrodynamic feature ii the phytoplankton renewal time ppt equivalent to the ratio of the average phytoplankton biomass to average gross primary production and finally iii the clearance time ct time required for the total stock of shellfish to filter the lagoon volume the renewal time rt was calculated for the whole lagoon using the volumes entering the lagoon by the sète channel 9 r t v l a g u n e v i n where vlagune and v i n were the volumes of the lagoon m3 and mean annual incoming volume m3 d 1 respectively this formulation gave renewal times of 48 6 48 4 and 48 8 days for the years 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively these rt values were in agreement with the field observations reported by fiandrino et al 2012 where rt 50 days the phytoplankton renewal time ppt was obtained by the ratio of the annual mean phytoplankton biomass estimated from the chl a concentration expressed in mmol n m 3 on the mean daily gross primary production estimated from the phytoplankton growth calculated by the model and expressed in mmol n m 3 d 1 the clearance time ct time required for cultured oysters to filter the volume of the lagoon was calculated taking into account the oyster filtration rate according to the formulation of bougrier et al 1995 10 f i l t r a t i o n r a t e 4 825 0 013 t c 18 954 2 d f m 0 439 where t c was the temperature in degrees celsius and dfm the dry weight g at harvest the filtration rate was expressed in l ind 1 h 1 the clearance time ct was expressed by comparing the filtered volume with the average volume of the lagoon 11 c l e a r a n c e t i m e v o l l a g o o n f i l t r a t i o n r a t e n b o f i n d i v i d u a l s 24 1000 where the filtration rate was extrapolated to the number of cultured individuals for a day and expressed in m3 d 1 and vollagoon m3 to give a clearance time in days all these characteristic times were expressed in days and their ratios ct rt and ct ppt potentially inform on the capacity of the lagoon to support or not a sustainable shellfish production the ct rt ratio indicated whether filter feeders and its resources were controlled by exchanges with the sea or by internal including inputs from the watershed availability of nutrients the ct ppt ratio expressed directly the link between the resource and the shellfish culture where a ratio of 1 would indicate that all phytoplankton primary production was consumed by filter feeders in culture and would therefore be a critical value 2 8 2 lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index at the scale of the lagoon area a phytoplankton depletion index filgueira et al 2014a was calculated to determine the impact of shellfish farming on its main resource this index compared the average phytoplankton biomass in farming areas box 4 and 5 fig 1 with the phytoplankton biomass produced outside these zones off table boxes 1 2 and 3 fig 1 negative values indicated a depletion in nutritive resource whereas positive values indicated sufficient resource for the growth of bivalves 12 l a g o o n s c a l e d e p l e t i o n i n d e x c h l a f a r m s c h l a o f f t a b l e 100 100 this formula compared the daily average chl a concentration of all shellfish growing areas box 4 and 5 fig 1 with the daily average chl a concentration for all off table areas boxes 1 2 and 3 fig 1 this index may be gauged against the natural variability of the phytoplankton biomass to evaluate the sustainability of the shellfish farming activity grant and filgueira 2011 this lagoon scale depletion index is asymmetrical and a value of 100 indicates a complete depletion whereas enrichment has no upper limit for this reason the median annual values of this index were preferred to mean values and were used to compare the scenarios 2 9 ecological indicators and ecological status the compartments of the model relative to the dissolved organic and inorganic matter were used to estimate summer nutrient concentrations 90th percentiles p90 were calculated from the 92 daily values obtained from june 1st to august 31st for each simulated year of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din no3 nh4 dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip total nitrogen tn dissolved and particulate inorganic and organic nitrogen as well as the two small and large phytoplankton compartments and total phosphorus tp inorganic phosphorus and dissolved and particulate organic and phytoplankton compartments expressed as phosphorus using the redfield 1963 n p ratio of 16 these four variables din dip tn and tp represented estimates of the wfd indicators measured for the diagnosis of the ecological status of lagoon water bodies derolez et al 2013 these simulated indicators were used to compare the reference scenario with actual observations and the influence of the different scenarios tested on the ecological status the model also estimated chlorophyll a concentration in the water column using the small and large phytoplankton variables these two state variables were expressed in mmol n m 3 in the model and converted to μg chl a l 1 using a conversion factor of 1 parsons et al 1961 the summer averages obtained from the simulations were used as an indicator of the phytoplankton biomass as in the wfd diagnosis finally the tn to tp ratio was used as an indicator of nitrogen and phosphorus balance within the system 2 10 statistical analyses data did not fulfilled tests for both normality and homosedasticity and non parametric kruskal wallis was therefore used for statistical analysis correlations were determined following spearmann correlation coefficient ρ statistical analyses were considered significant with p value 0 01 principal component analysis pca was performed on model outputs presented in this work all statistical analyses were performed using the r software r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 model skills model skills evaluation was based on model outputs of the reference scenario representing current situation the gamelag conch model satisfactorily simulated observations of salinity fig 3 a for both shellfish farming zones with a willmott index d of 0 96 linear regression r2 0 91 this agreement between observed and simulated values prevailed the good representation of the lagoon hydrodynamics when described by 3 physical boxes see carrying capacity model description similar to salinity model outputs were correctly correlated with the observed length fig 3 c and dry weight fig 3 d of oysters with willmott index of 0 69 r2 0 77 and 0 76 r2 0 76 respectively a poorer willmott index was found for the chl a variable at d 0 46 r2 0 03 the comparison of observations against simulations indicated that simulated chl a concentrations were within the range of observations for concentrations lower than 2 5 µg chl a l 1 however the model could not capture the timing of extreme values peaks which explained the mismatch on fig 3 b for high chl a concentrations 3 2 nutrients inputs and shellfish performances for the three simulated years and all the scenarios annual nutrient inputs varied from 25 5 to 198 6 tons of nitrogen and from 1 8 to 13 8 tons of phosphorus table 2 these ranges included lower and higher values of nutrient inputs than that of the reference scenario 39 4 to 111 5 t of n and 6 1 to 10 2 t of p table 2 results presented in fig 4 and table 2 highlighted the significant variability of oyster performances weight and production according to years and scenarios of nutrient inputs the variability of oyster production as well as total weight of oyster was mainly controlled by the hydrometeorology with oyster production being 1 8 2 3 times higher during rainy years than dry years whatever the tested scenario table 2 total weight of oysters at harvest varied between 36 6 to 100 5 g table 2 according to scenarios and simulated years similar to production total weight was significantly higher in wet years than dry years kruskal wallis p 0 05 although no significant differences were found between scenarios in comparison to the current situation reference higher oyster productions were simulated with normal waste water treatment plant efficiency normal yield 75 n 60 p with an additional 1700 t produced during dry years corresponding to an increase in production of 25 this increase was less important during wet years 940 1200 t 5 7 by contrast maximum wwtp efficiency max yield 90 n p induced a mean decrease of 1598 t corresponding to a decrease of 12 in comparison with mean reference production the foreseen increase in population scot scenario induced a mean increase in oyster production of 5 finally in the séte scenario oyster production was not enhanced and recorded 875 t less than reference production table 2 while nitrogen and phosphorus inputs were significantly higher than reference 1 8 2 8 times more n and 1 3 1 5 more p scenario of oyster stocking density to its authorized maximum by the french regulation body triggered a mean increase of oyster productions by 7 at the expenses of thinner oysters with a lower condition index to conclude oyster production the comparison of scenarios showed that only sète n 5 and max yield n 2 scenarios induced lower oyster production than reference scenario exhibiting a decrease of 8 and 16 respectively all other scenarios that involved increased nutrient inputs nal yield n 3 and scot n 4 presented higher oyster production levels with sensibly higher shell length and total weight table 2 on the contrary if scenario max dens n 6 rendered higher oyster production than reference scenario no increase of length or total weight of individuals was apparent oyster condition index ci was used as a proxy for the health of oysters and was significantly lower in 2015 kruskal wallis p 0 05 with no differences between scenarios when discriminating dry and wet years according to the different nitrogen and phosphorus inputs simulated one can note on fig 4 that oyster production values were maximized for a mass ratio n p of the watershed contributions around 8 3 that is about 100 t n for 12 t p or a molar ratio of 18 4 fig 4 this seemingly optimal n p ratio was obtained for the scenarios varying nutrient loadings nal yield n 3 scot n 4 and reference during wet years 2014 2016 but not during 2015 table 2 where n p ratio was 6 6 in fact the nitrogen inputs according to the different scenarios during the dry year 2015 varied from 25 to 50 of those during the two wet years 2014 and 2016 with the largest difference between dry and wet years recorded for the max yield scenario table 2 for phosphorus the variability of the contributions according to the hydrometeorology was less marked nevertheless inputs of phosphorus in the dry year were 1 5 3 times lower than for wet years this difference between wet and dry years was also largely marked by a significant modification of the contribution of the wwtp to the total inputs of the watershed reaching 89 on average in a dry year nitrogen to phosphorus mass ratios of inputs varied from 4 6 to 16 0 10 35 mol mol depending on the year and scenario and encompassed the optimal 8 3 n p value linked to the highest oyster productions obtained in our simulations 3 3 carrying capacity while renewal time rt seemed constant and corresponded to 48 6 days table 2 phytoplankton biomass renewal time ppt and clearance time ct varied according to scenarios with minimal and maximal means observed for max density and normal yield scenarios respectively table 2 the ct rt ratio remained constant regardless of the nutrient loading scenario mean of 0 38 and was lower as part of the max density scenario mean 0 30 indicating that water renewal times exceeded clearance times the ct ppt ratios ranged from 2 06 to 2 93 with minimal mean observed at max density table 2 fig 5 indicating that shellfish culture pressure on phytoplankton was not critical because clearance time was of 34 to 50 of phytoplankton production potential in other words the renewal time of phytoplankton production in the thau lagoon was systematically twice as fast as the time required for oysters to filter all the phytoplankton biomass produced this max density scenario led to the lowest ct ppt ratios with values of 2 13 2 45 and 1 98 for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively revealing a stronger pressure of shellfish farming on its phytoplankton resources than the other scenarios this pressure was accompanied by the lowest lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index over these three simulated years table 2 the ct rt and ct ppt ratios showed no significant correlation with n p ratio of catchment inputs for the reference scenario presented fig 6 the median value of this index varied between 14 and 13 indicating that the lagoon was in slight depletion conditions but may support shellfish production the median lagoon scale depletion indices appeared consistently negative regardless of the scenario tested fig 6 a b c overall median lagoon scale depletion indices varied between 12 3 and 15 1 depending on the year and scenarios tested but they did not show a clear trend depending on the amount of nitrogen or phosphorus brought by the watershed fig 6 a and b the range of values of the median depletion index was bounded by the scenarios max density and max yield the difference between simulated years was the main contrast between these median values of the depletion index kruskal wallis p value 0 01 fig 6 c showed these median depletion indices as a function of the n p ratios of the catchment contributions and the values of these indices decreased with decreasing n p ratio of watershed inputs in 2015 and 2016 spearman correlation coefficient of 0 83 and 0 94 respectively 3 4 ecological status although carrying capacity can be assessed through different indices ecological status of the lagoon must be regarded as another major characteristic depending on nutrient loadings or shellfish culture practices the p90 summer concentrations of din dip tn and tp derived from the reference simulations fig 7 a b c were consistent with the concentrations observed in the water column of thau lagoon in the context of the 2011 2016 wfd diagnosis concentrations measured 0 2 0 2 22 2 0 9 μmol l 1 respectively rephy 2017 din p90 were significantly higher kruskal wallis p value 0 001 in 2015 mean 0 49 than in 2014 and 2016 mean 0 31 and 0 33 respectively regardless of the scenario tested tn p90 were contrasted between years with significant differences recorded between 2014 and the two other years 2015 and 2016 kruskal wallis p value 0 001 finally chl a p90 were found significantly lower kruskal wallis p value 0 001 in 2014 mean 1 71 µg l 1 than 2015 and 2016 mean 3 60 and 3 45 µg l 1 respectively however the model seemed to underestimate tn values 17 6 and 20 4 μmol l 1 for the reference scenario n 92 and all scenarios n 552 respectively nitrogen and phosphorus inputs associated with the different scenarios did not seem to affect the ecological diagnosis of the water column based on nutrient indicators as none of these scenarios triggered a modification of ecological status classes these simulated indicators gave p90 values in agreement with the high status fixed by wfd medde 2015 in accordance with the high status evaluated by 2011 2016 wfd diagnosis only simulated dip concentrations were classified in the good ecological status for all scenarios table 2 shellfish production at harvest for all scenarios decreased significantly for a given year when the n p ratio of catchment contributions increased fig 8 a these relationships have a spearman correlation coefficient of 0 75 0 98 and 0 90 for years 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively p value 0 05 for the three relationships although no significant relationship has been established between shellfish production and nitrogen inputs or phosphorus inputs independently in addition production was negatively correlated with the median lagoon scale depletion index but this relationship was not linear for a given year fig 8 b the max dens scenario n 6 had the lowest median depletion index fig 8 b indicating that it had more impact on phytoplankton biomass than scenarios with comparable production outputs ie nal yield scenario n 3 on the other hand the max yield n 2 and sète n 5 scenarios gave the highest median depletion indexes but at the expense of lower oyster productions the comparison of nitrogen and phosphorus quantities added to the lagoon in each of the three simulated years showed the role of the hydro meteorology on oyster production 4 discussion the gamelag conch model was developed to address the questions related to the management of the thau lagoon ecosystem with regards to the issues of shellfish production and ecological status regulations scenarios tested were developed from realistic management hypotheses these hypotheses included leverages on the quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus potentially available through waste water treatment plant management or on the quantities of cultured filter feeders introduced in farming zones 4 1 scenarios and oyster performances all scenarios tested in this study were based on achievable management objectives in this respect little difference was highlighted from oyster performance model outputs when comparing scenarios although nutrient loadings in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus were varying with these different scenarios the highest increase in oyster production was recorded at 25 normal yield scenario in 2015 in comparison to reference this specific case corresponded to the modification of the mèze wwtp efficiency going from maximum to normal abatements and a very dry year 2015 200 mm where wwtp effluents were the main contributors to nutrient loadings 7 t n and 2 t p to a lesser extent scot and max density scenarios also demonstrated an increase in oyster production but limited to 3 9 and 1 10 respectively the effect of increased nutrient loadings mainly nitrogen on the production of cultured filter feeders has already been reported in modelling studies ferreira et al 2007 guyondet et al 2014 rose et al 2015 on the opposite reducing nutrient loadings from the watershed scenario max yield in this study through the improvement of waste water treatment efficiency triggered a loss in production between 8 and 18 compared to our reference scenario further indicating this dependence of oyster farming on nutrient supply of the thau system however the variation in nutrient loadings quantity may not solely explain the response of cultured oyster as large addition of nitrogen 171 in the sète scenario rendered lower oyster production than reference 2 to 13 this effect is probably linked to the joint influence of nitrogen and phosphorus additions the location of these inputs and the response of the biological compartments and is further discussed below in terms of oyster performances scenarios associated with increased nutrient loadings demonstrated that oysters marginally gained in length quality condition index and total weight at harvest but remained in the same market grade 66 85 g according to the french 6 grades weight where n 5 30 45 g n 4 46 65 g n 3 66 85 g n 2 86 110 g n 1 111 150 g and n 0 over 151 g however a reduction of as well as unbalanced nutrient loadings produced smaller oysters and a modification of the market grade 46 65 g with potential repercussion on economic aspects ferreira et al 2007 finally max density scenario demonstrated higher oyster production but at the expenses of thinner oysters with lower condition index this scenario highlighted the density effect where an increased abundance triggered a competition for the resources yielding smaller individuals gangnery et al 2001 gangnery 2003 filgueira et al 2014b the scenarios tested here have revealed differences in terms of oyster performances and productions however major contrasts were brought by interannual variability where dry against wet years triggered the largest variations in nutrient loadings consequently oyster productions were significantly lower in years presenting evident rainfall deficit oyster lengths total weight and condition index were also significantly affected with smaller lighter and lower quality during dry years nevertheless oyster production and performances evaluated through this modelling work shall be replaced within the context of ecological status and ecological carrying capacity to better assess overall functioning of the ecosystem byron et al 2011b higgins et al 2011 4 2 trophic carrying capacity and ecological status one of the objectives of this work was to assess the carrying capacity of the thau lagoon regarding to shellfish farming within the frame of wfd regulation the thau lagoon as any other shellfish farming sites is characterized by complex dynamics of interacting biological and physical processes within these systems filter feeding activity may deeply modify the energy fluxes as they clear large volume of water including suspended particles dowd 2003 filgueira et al 2014a to evaluate the capability of an ecosystem to support various uses it is important to compare phytoplankton production phytoplankton biomass lagoon hydrodynamics as well as shellfish culture pressure to truly highlight the limits of the ecosystem a first approach using these different aspects of the functioning of the ecosystem is the dame index dame and prins 1998 this index relates the characteristic times rt renewal time ct clearance time and ppt phytoplankton biomass renewal time of the thau lagoon the ct rt ratio indicates whether filter feeders and its resources are controlled by exchanges with the sea or by internal including inputs from the watershed availability of nutrients the gamelag conh model was able to simulate oyster productions along with indicators of the ecological status depletion index and characteristic times ct rt ppt comparatively with different scenarios of nutrient inputs and shellfish cultures the relationships between oyster production and the carrying capacity of the lagoon was evaluated with regards to the dame index particularly the ct ppt ratio and the lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index both markers demonstrated a top down control of filter feeders on phytoplankton population in this study simulated clearance and water renewal times ct and rt indicated that hydrodynamic exchanges with the far field outside the lagoon were not efficient enough to drive the filter feeder resources therefore phytoplankton dynamic or its bottom up control would rather be driven by nutrients coming from the watershed in comparison the marennes oléron site bacher 1989 dame and prins 1998 raillard and menesguen 1994 showed slower phytoplankton biomass renewal times and much faster filtration capacity resulting in a system that did appear to be largely under pressure marennes oléron ct ppt 0 27 despite a more efficient hydrodynamics than in the thau lagoon marennes oléron rt 7 1 the simulated values of the ct ppt ratio suggested that the consumption of phytoplankton biomass by farmed oysters was constrained between 34 and 50 leaving half or more of the phytoplankton stock available for other trophic levels trousselier deslous paoli 2001 had also concluded that thau lagoon was productive in the 1990s with shellfish harvested production representing about 3 of primary production dame and prins 1998 postulated that successful shellfish population occur when rt is less than 40 days and ppt below 4 days if characteristic times calculated for the thau lagoon are longer than these recommended times shellfish cultures have prospered in the thau lagoon and its carrying capacity did not seem to be threatened both ratios ct rt and ct ppt expressed the state of the carrying capacity of the lagoon by comparing the characteristic times of physics phytoplankton and shellfish in culture table 2 however they do not consider the presence of nutritive resources other than phytoplankton such as zooplankton or particulate organic matter the model outputs indicated that oyster production is related to the input n p molar ratio with production increasing with decreasing n p ratios these linear relationships were contrasted between years highlighting the strong influence of the hydrological regime and hence the quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the lagoon these first relationships were bounded by the maximum wwtp yield and normal wwtp yield scenarios as they provided the highest and lowest input n p molar ratio respectively this also revealed that if filter feeder production might be increased by decreasing the n p ratio of inputs the amount of nutrients coming from the watershed most probably phosphorus would limit the maximum levels of production to be reached the shellfish productions were also increasing with decreasing lagoon scale depletion index indicating that more production would trigger higher depletion of the thau system once again the most apparent contrast was linked to the different simulated years where higher nutrient loadings generated higher shellfish productions and hence an increased pressure on its phytoplankton resource n p ratio of loadings however was similar in 2014 and 2016 whereas phytoplankton summer biomass was similar in 2015 and 2015 therefore higher oyster production and subsequent increased filter feeder pressure could not only be explained by nutrient loadings annual mean temperature anomaly compared to the 1970 2016 mean 15 3 c was 1 5 c 1 4 c and 1 1 c for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in previous modelling studies filgueira et al 2016 increased temperature has been identified as a key factor in enhancing grazer activity through higher metabolism with concomitant higher pressure on phytoplankton the highest oyster production simulated in 2014 would be in agreement with highest annual average temperature recorded in 2014 for the thau lagoon in addition 2015 was associated with low nutrient inputs which resulted in low oyster performances even if temperature anomaly was similar to 2014 in this second relationship e g oyster production against depletion index oyster production was bounded by the maximum oyster densities and the maximum wwtp yield scenarios the use of maximum allowed stocking densities generated the highest depletion in agreement with the density effect chapelle et al 2000 grant et al 2007 grangeré et al 2010 the increase in the quantities of seeded shellfish did not lead to significantly higher harvests compared to the reference scenario 1 10 moreover the shellfish thus produced were smaller probably because of the competition for the nutritive resource between growing individuals this scenario also exhibited the lowest ct ppt ratios indicating a noticeable pressure of farmed oysters on their phytoplankton resource accordingly highest depletion was recorded when increasing stocking densities which corroborates this impact on phytoplankton stock however chl a concentrations used in the ecological status evaluation were not lower in the presence of higher densities of filter feeders than with the other scenarios this might be explained either by the fact that 1 energy stocks of filter feeders during the summer are allocated to spawning rather than nutrition e g filtration or 2 the increase in cultured bivalve density may have a positive feedback effect on phytoplankton outside growing structures through more excretion of inorganic nutrients kellogg et al 2014 it is important to note that shellfish farming activities occupy about 20 of the thau lagoon area 30 by volume which is probably a criterion of its durability in agreement with the occupational state of the thau lagoon byron et al 2011b reported using the ecopath model on the narragansett bay another example of a low intensity of shellfish cultures where carrying capacity is not reached due to high nutrient loadings and primary productivity these authors evaluated that if shellfish cultures density remained at current levels the growing area might theoretically be extended up to 26 of the bay area without exceeding the ecological carrying capacity on the contrary the study by filgueira et al 2014a concerning a bay occupied at 80 in volume by the mussel farms showed a strong impact on the phytoplankton resource where the median bay scale depletion index 34 2 was below the sustainable threshold calculated from natural variability of chl a concentration 27 5 this shellfish farming pressure was also reported to a lesser extent in saint peter s bay guyondet et al 2014 where only the central part of the bay exhibited depletion for a total farmed area of 40 the simulated ecological indicators were chosen to correspond to the observations used in the wfd diagnosis ec 2000 regardless of scenarios or simulated years these ecological indicators fell into the high ecological status class only simulated dip concentrations exceeded the high to good threshold 0 3 µm hence placing the ecological status of the lagoon into the good conditions for the water column chemistry the comparison of simulated years or scenarios showed significant differences for din between dry and wet years with higher concentrations recorded during the dry year 2015 and for chl a where concentrations in 2015 and 2016 were found higher than in 2014 the main concluding remarks on this ecological status evaluation is that scenarios tested in this study did not altered the ecological status of the lagoon in addition to this fulfilling high ecological status weak phytoplankton depletion and the moderate pressure of cultured oysters on their resources the current oyster production ref scenario n 1 oscillating between 7900 and 17 000 tons would therefore be sustainable and not conflicting with eu regulation nor are opposed to the important efforts made to reduce nutrient inputs from the watershed indeed ecological carrying capacity appears as a major component in the evaluation of the whole ecosystem functioning and should be carefully considered at the same level as ecological status 4 3 control of lagoon phytoplankton and shellfish productivity the results obtained in this modelling work of the thau lagoon seemed to indicate a control of the system by the nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from the watershed and more precisely by the n p ratio of these inputs when the inputs related to the various scenarios are detailed it appeared that if the n inputs from the watershed covered a wide range of values 25 5 198 6 tons the variability of phosphorus inputs was much smaller 1 8 13 8 tons the variability of n and p inputs related to the hydrometeorological regime seemed the main driver for the variability of shellfish production increases of 57 and 27 in n and p inputs during wet years led to a 36 increase in predicted oyster production by replacing shellfish production at harvest in the context of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs for all scenarios and the three simulated years an optimum of the n p inputs molar ratio appeared 18 4 around which the oyster productions seemed to be maximized in 2014 and 2016 wet years current loadings reference both natural and anthropogenic are just over 100 tons of nitrogen in wet years 2014 2016 for a phosphorus input of about 10 tons bringing the n p molar ratio above 22 to obtain a molar ratio of inputs around 18 4 it would therefore be necessary to bring an additional 2 5 tons of p into the system i e 12 5 tons of p in total phosphorus appeared to be insufficient and therefore limiting if one considers these current contributions of nitrogen the sète scenario n 5 confirmed the hypothesis of a phosphorus controlled system where a misleading excess of nitrogen 100 tons did not help to achieve higher production because this scenario increased the phosphorus deficit in the system although more p was brought to the lagoon oyster production did decrease in comparison with reference scenario the sète scenario tested the response of the ecosystem to excess n and p loading from a wwtp in the current situation this wwtp releases its wastewater into the sea this scenario involved the release of waste waters into box 1 petit étang of the model box 1 is the box connected with the sea hence part of these inputs is exchanged with the sea the other part reached box 2 then box 3 where cultured areas are located in the sète scenario the model shows that sediment has accumulated more n times 2 5 and has released less p times 0 4 in box 1 than the reference along with the sediment compartment macroalgae notably ulva and gracilaria yielded higher biomasses times 2 and times 1 5 for ulva and gracilaria respectively than in the reference scenario this may indicate that macrophytes enter a competition for nutrients in box 1 n p in sediment and macroalgae did not show marked differences in all other boxes of the model nevertheless this would indicate that box 1 was the first to respond to these additional inputs remaining nitrogen and phosphorus were then exchanged with the sea and with box 2 and further up macrophytes competing for nutrient resources and a greater accumulation of matter may have led to a lower p availability in boxes 2 and 3 including farming areas boxes 4 and 5 and hence lower oyster production n inputs n p inputs p and n p ratio of inputs np were used in a pca analysis fig 9 along with shellfish culture performances variables such as production prod total weight at harvest p tot or condition index ci and ecosystem functioning variables as chlorophyll a concentration in and out oyster farming zones chla of and chla out respectively or the lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index di phosphorus inputs were strongly correlated with shellfish performances first axis 71 51 of variance explained and chlorophyll a concentrations suggesting a key role of phosphorus in controlling both phytoplankton and oyster production the phosphorus inputs were inversely correlated with the depletion index indicating also a role in regulating the carrying capacity of the thau lagoon nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of inputs and to a lesser extent nitrogen inputs explained the second dimension of this pca analysis 14 88 of variance explained fig 9 a suggesting that if phosphorus may control production levels importantly the balance between nitrogen and phosphorus in loadings carried from the watershed had a major importance in the efficiency of the thau ecosystem and hence on its trophic carrying capacity supplementary variables as simulated years and simulated scenarios once placed in this pca fig 9 b demonstrated the major importance of contrasted hydrological conditions as suggested above whereas the variability linked to the scenarios tested in this study exhibited less difference between scenarios with no clear pattern deslous paoli et al 1998 reported this control of shellfish production by phosphorus in the 1990s where the oyster stocking density was around 25 to 30 000 tons of shellfish and for an annual production exceeding 15 000 tons against 9200 to 9500 tons currently reported by shellfish farmers this study also reported phosphate concentrations in water 40 times higher than the current concentrations 4 μm against 0 1 μm at the same time even though the concentrations of po4 3 in water have been decreasing since the 1970s the significant expansion of oyster farming during this period from 1400 to 2440 tables in 20 years would have reduced the risk of eutrophication by removing about 30 according to the authors of this readily available phosphorus from the thau lagoon at present the decrease in phosphorus inputs from the watershed and consequently the concentrations in the water column is mainly attributed to the major efforts made on the waste water treatment systems derolez et al 2013 la jeunesse 2001 souchu et al 2010 depending on the year the contribution of anthropogenic inputs from wwtp varies importantly to supply up to 90 of total inputs in dry years the n p molar ratio of these anthropogenic inputs 5 2009 2016 average data not shown is much lower than that of natural inputs 40 2009 2016 average data not shown thus placing the lagoon in nitrogen limiting conditions in those years the main source of current phosphorus inputs coming from the wwtps 5 conclusions the gamelag conch model developed to answer the problem of reconciling resource exploitation through shellfish culture and regulatory constraints allowed an evaluation of the ecosystem carrying capacity of the thau lagoon and the simulation of various scenarios waste water treatment management and shellfish farming strategies to the best of our knowledge there are no existing model taking into account both nitrogen and phosphorus inputs within the frame of carrying capacity assessment and most carrying capacity models are based solely on nitrogen dowd 2003 byron et al 2011c chapelle et al 2000 filgueira et al 2014a guyondet et al 2014 or biomass data sets jiang and gibbs 2005 under current conditions the carrying capacity of the thau lagoon does not appear to be limiting the interannual variability introduced by the differences in weather conditions strongly affects shellfish farming in terms of production and shellfish performances rather than did the contrast between the different tested scenarios the productivity of the ecosystem seemed to depend mainly on watershed inputs in which inputs from wwtps had a predominant role in dry years shellfish production was more specifically controlled by phosphorus as revealed by unbalanced n p ratio in loadings the trophic resource being sufficient the oyster control on the phytoplankton was not excessive and depended on the stock density of cultured bivalves or additional phosphorus brought to the lagoon the use of high stocking densities should be prohibited because if they generated higher production than current conditions at the expenses of thinner oysters with low condition index finally the ecological status did not appear to be threatened with regard to the current shellfish pressure this model thus appeared as a suitable tool for management perspectives another strength and recommended approach byron et al 2011a of this work resides in the implication of shellfish farmers stakeholders local and governmental management bodies as well as scientists to implement realistically based scenarios in the search for an equilibrium between shellfish production and ecological status regulation however important caveats must be given here as this paper reports a global evaluation of the carrying capacity through the use of characteristic times or depletion index that might vary in time and space dame and prins 1998 guyondet et al 2014 further work is necessary to alleviate this time varying control of the carrying capacity where characteristic times or even depletion index are used to identify seasonal effects and sensitive periods to be confronted to shellfish production performances and potential ecological impacts this ongoing work shall help management of shellfish culture practices in this context of maintaining good ecological status a perspective use of this numerical tool resides in a theoretical approach that would involve large variations of nutrient loadings to seek for tipping points where depletion or ecological indicators may drastically change with strong impacts on the whole ecosystem functioning short term development of this tool would address the question of anoxic crisis which had sporadically occurred in the thau lagoon when temperature increases and weather conditions are calm these anoxic crises have led to dramatic loss of cultured bivalves hence temporarily damaging ecological conditions of the lagoon further developments of this management tool should address questions related to climate change where the frequency and or the intensity of meteorological events such as temperature increase or the modification of rainfall regimes should be considered concomitantly with increase in population in turn increasing watershed loadings subsequent refit of wwtp and sustainability of uses in the thau lagoon credit authorship contribution statement romain pete conceptualization methodology software formal

24859,the decrease of microbial and nutrient inputs from the watershed has long dominated lagoon ecosystem management objectives phytoplankton biomass and abundance have drastically decreased for more than a decade and zostera meadow have gradually recovered expressing lagoon ecosystem restoration such as thau lagoon do the progressive achievement of the good ecological status of the thau lagoon possibly threatens the shellfish industry in terms of production and oyster quality by reducing the carrying capacity to provide answers about the right balance to be achieved between conservation and exploitation a new numerical tool was developed to help in decision making we hereby propose to incorporate a dynamic energy budget type shellfish production model to an existing lagoon ecosystem box model the influence of different scenarios of nutrient inputs related to projections of population growth or improvement of treatment plants and shellfish stocks were tested on oyster performances production oyster condition index carrying capacity of the lagoon and ecological status indices used within the eu water framework directive model outputs demonstrated that shellfish production was mainly controlled by nutrient inputs which depend on hydro meteorological variability and specifically by phosphorus and n p ratios of nutrient inputs scenarios tested however demonstrated smaller

mollusks produced worldwide fao 2018 plays a key role in local socio economic developments fao therefore promoted in its recent report a holistic and integrated ecosystem approach of aquaculture eaa to address management issues of sustainable aquaculture amongst the key features of this eea framework fao highlighted the wide stakeholder participation in planning and implementing a comprehensive consideration of major components e g aquaculture socio economics and environmental based on best available knowledge and a search for a trade off between environment conservation and socio economic objectives this rapid growing economic sector has inevitably raised questions of carrying capacity and sustainability nunes et al 2003 in this context the concept of the carrying capacity is commonly used as it involves major aspects of integrated ecosystem functioning such as physics productivity ecology and socio economics mckindsey et al 2006 regarding cultured bivalves this carrying capacity can be primarily defined as the biomass of a population supported permanently by a given system dame and prins 1998 kashiwai 1998 however this definition has been successively extended to a maximized production without affecting growth rates carver and mallet 1990 to a maximized production of marketable cohorts bacher et al 1998 and more recently to a maximized production within the frame of environmental sustainability smaal et al 1997 ferreira et al 2008 byron et al 2011b filgueira et al 2015 the current consensus is that production carrying capacity represents the stock that maximizes harvests while ecosystem responses or ecological carrying capacity deal with unwanted modifications of phytoplankton abundances nutrient cycling or organic content in sediments mckindsey et al 2006 grant et al 2007 guyondet et al 2014 recent research has been promoting use of mathematical models of various complexity dabrowski et al 2013 to tackle the issues of cultured shellfish management a lot of efforts have been made in the representation of shellfish modelling from individual based gangnery 2003 to mechanistic bourlès et al 2009 kooijman 2010 alunno bruscia et al 2011 and mixed brigolin et al 2009 models these individual models are then coupled to ecosystem food web based models that include most of the relevant biological compartments of aquatic systems grangeré et al 2009 byron et al 2011c filgueira et al 2014b these coupled models can thus be complexified by representing exchanges with the outer world through simple renewal times grangeré et al 2009 box model chapelle et al 2000 filgueira and grant 2009 raillard and menesguen 1994 and fully spatialized hydrodynamic models guyondet et al 2010 while these models give insights into the carrying capacity of an ecosystem it is crucial to derive other model outputs to evaluate impacts of shellfish farming on ecosystem functioning the thau lagoon as many other coastal mediterranean lagoons has been experiencing major anthropogenic pressures as it received large nutrient loadings from its watershed la jeunesse and elliott 2004 plus et al 2006 these nutrient inputs have been identified as the main cause of eutrophication issues or dystrophic crisis souchu et al 1998 harzallah and chapelle 2002 thus many efforts have been made to reduce nutrient loadings mainly through the installation of waste water treatment plants wwtp in the 1970 s and their refurbishment later in the 2000 s these works have drastically reduced the amount of nutrient inputs from the watershed and successfully led to reach a current good ecological status of water column of the thau lagoon according to the eu water framework directive wfd ec 2000 derolez et al 2019 these profound changes in the lagoon inputs from the watershed have raised concerns from shellfish farmers oyster farming after having taken precedence over mussel farming in the 1990s has seen its activity largely impacted by juvenile mortality phenomena from 2008 pernet et al 2012 which significantly reduced the overall annual shellfish production under current production conditions long term observations of farmed oyster performances have shown improved growth rates and condition index probably linked to a decrease in the oyster stock despite the decrease in phytoplankton biomass observed bec et al 2018 considering these recent and important changes in the pressures exerted on the thau lagoon an assessment of its ecological carrying capacity for shellfish culture is required we hereby present a modelling work to address concerns arising from shellfish farmers and consider realistic actions combining the achievement of regulatory constraints and the sustainability of this major socio economic activity the gamelag model pete et al tbs was formerly developed for the bages sigean lagoon to produce similar ecological indicators as those used in the wfd european community 2000 these indicators have been established as relevant criterion to assess ecological status of a given ecosystem according to different categories from high to very bad in addition a dynamic energy budget deb model for the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas formerly developed on the atlantic coast pouvreau et al 2006 bernard et al 2011a was parameterized for the thau lagoon and coupled to the gamelag model concomitantly to the model implementation a major part of the presented work was realized in close partnership with shellfish growers local and governmental management bodies and scientists based on this joint work management scenarios were established on realistic working hypotheses the objectives of this work were therefore 1 to build a carrying capacity model and 2 to test the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and oyster stocking densities on oyster performances condition index production carrying capacity and ecological status of the thau lagoon this work was carried out in collaboration with managers and farmers to find the right balance between conservation and exploitation for sustainable development of shellfish farming in good ecological status coastal area 2 material methods 2 1 study site thau lagoon fig 1 is located on the south coast of france 43 18 43 28 n 3 30 3 45 e and has a total area of 68 km2 19 5 km long by 4 5 km width and an average depth of 4 m fiandrino et al 2017 the lagoon is connected to the sea through two inlets i e the sète channel in the north 90 of sea water exchanges and the grau de pisse saumes inlet in the south the sète channel is 2 4 km long with a mean cross section of about 300 m2 the mediterranean climate is characterised by a wide range of temperatures 5 29 c and salinities in the lagoon cover a range of 27 42 with a low spatial gradient data from rephy monitoring network fiandrino et al 2017 the lagoon has a narrow located between the balaruc point and the barrou point separating the lagoon into two basins the petit etang to the east and grand etang to the west the grand etang is the location of shellfish farming activities spread over three areas at the north of this basin 20 of the lagoon surface these shellfish farming zones namely bouzigues mèze and marseillan fig 1 gather around 2800 farming structures 1250 m2 and a total area of 640 ha harbouring growing oyster juveniles hereafter spat and adults hereafter oyster of the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas 70 of the shellfish stocks and mussel mytilus galloprovincialis the watershed spreads mainly northward from the lagoon over an area of 280 km2 and is drained by several rivers with intermittent flows the main tributary the vène river is connected to the crique de l angle area and brings an annual average of 15 1 mm3 of freshwater about 50 of total flow ranging from 3 1 to 24 7 mm3 between 2009 and 2016 the population in this watershed amounts to 126 604 inhabitants french national institute of statistics and economical studies insee 2015 over 14 main cities equipped with waste water treatment plants wwtp five of these towns sète poussan bouzigues gigean and balaruc fig 1 are connected to the sète wwtp which discards effluents 7 km offshore in the mediterranean sea the four other cities montbazin villeveyrac mèze loupian and pinet pomerols have their own wwtp releasing effluents into the thau lagoon 2 2 carrying capacity model the gamelag model pete et al tbs was formerly developed for management purposes with regards to water quality assessment under the wfd gamelag works on the principle of a box model where the lagoon is represented by basins physically homogeneous in which the stocks of the different biological compartments are simulated as well as the fluxes of matter nitrogen n and phosphorus p connecting these compartments fig 2 the lagoon was separated into three main boxes green boxes fig 1 petit etang box 1 east of grand etang and west of grand etang box 2 and 3 respectively on fig 1 in order to simplify the model and to be able to compare it with available observations the mèze and marseillan shellfish farming zones were gathered to form box 5 whereas bouzigues shellfish farming zone formed box 4 red boxes fig 1 the hydrodynamic exchanges between box 1 and the mediterranean sea and between two adjacent physical boxes are simulated following formalism defined by gordon et al 1996 based on daily net residual volumes and mixing volumes while net residual volumes are state variables of the hydrodynamic module of the gamelag model daily time series of mixing volumes at frontiers of physical boxes have to be defined as forcing dataset the hydrodynamic exchanges between box 4 and physical box 1 and between box 5 and physical box 2 only depend on mixing volume there is no net residual volumes between these boxes mixing volume takes into account wind mixin mainly inside the lagoon and tide driven exchange between lagoon and the sea these mixing volumes are therefore varying in time a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model for application at regional scale mars 3d was used to compute daily time series of mixing volumes lagarde et al 2019 lazure and dumas 2008 descriptions of the mars3d model applied on thau lagoon and the forcing dataset necessary for simulating water bodies circulation are provided in fiandrino et al 2017 same atmospheric wind air temperature incident radiation and hydrological daily average river water fluxes m3 s 1 from the watershed are used to force mars 3d and gamelag models specific dataset were used sea level elevation in sete channel to force mars 3d model at the open boundary condition for the simulated period in order to model the growth of an average oyster individual in the shellfish production areas of the thau lagoon a coupling of the gamelag and deb oyster model was carried out to form gamelag conch model it involves the integration of the deb model into the biogeochemical model the dynamic energy budget of c gigas model is based on the deb theory kooijman 2009 and adapted to the pacific oyster in the atlantic under various versions 3 state variables pouvreau et al 2006 or 4 state variables bernard et al 2011b the dynamics in time of the different energy fluxes are described by a system of differential equations see suppl mat tables s1 and associated processes pouvreau et al 2006 bernard et al 2011b within the frame of this work the model was adapted and parameterised for the thau lagoon with additional parameters related to rearing schemes see suppl mat table s2 the deb model operates on energy flows in joules allocated to different functions within the individual reserve maintenance growth and reproduction amongst these energy costs some imply a dissipation of energy which must be translated into excretion of matter to maintain steady mass balances within the gamelag conch model the oyster food resource in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus xn and xp is assumed to be a mix of various available particles in the water column e g state variables of the biogeochemical model and is defined as 1 x n α p s p s α p l p l α z s z s α z l z l α p o n p o n and 2 x p α p s p s α p l p l n p p h y t o α z s z s α z l z l n p z o o α p o p p o p where ps pl zs and zl are small and large phytoplankton and small and large zooplankton and pon the sum of labile and refractory particulate organic nitrogen each of these food resources is weighted by a preference coefficient αi with i ps pl zs zl pon or pop the oyster food resource is expressed in phosphorus using n to p stoichiometry of phytoplankton and zooplankton npphyto and npzoo whereas pop is the sum of labile and refractory particulate organic phosphorus hence the stoichiometry of food resources is expressed as 3 n p x x n x p the food resource and dissipated deb energy fluxes were translated respectively from mmol n or p to joules and from joules to mmol n or p using conversion factors see suppl mat table s2 in the deb model some of the available energy is lost first there is the amount of material ingested but not assimilated by the oyster which is expressed in the deb model by the excretion of faeces and pseudo faeces joules per unit of time this part of the non assimilated food either reached the sea bed to fuel sediment stock of n and p or was remineralised into inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column once assimilated the energy is allocated into the compartments of the deb model structures reserves and reproduction in order to maintain balanced stoichiometry in the deb model excretion is required and is simulated according to the stoichiometry of the ingested material thus the ratio n p of the resource npx is compared to the ratio n p of the oyster npo when this npx is greater than the npo the regeneration of material is in the form of ammonium in the model on the contrary when the npx is lower than the npo the regeneration was assumed to be in the form of orthophosphate in this way even if the stoichiometry of the resource is variable the individual rejects a quantity of n or p to maintain a balanced stoichiometry this system of regeneration of post assimilation material provides available mineral forms of n and p in the water column the maintenance costs 4 p m p j growth costs 5 p g e g d v μ v e g and gamete production costs 6 p g e ggo d go μ go e ggo were also added to the amounts of regenerated matter as they correspond to dissipated energy see suppl mat table s3 in the gamelag conch model these energy costs were converted into nh4 or po4 3 with conversion factors coyster and μen energy yield of reserves these conversion factors are based on the available data on the chemical potential of the different compartments of the oyster add my pet portal https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet thus the chemical potential of the food once converted to j mmol 1 n gives a conversion factor coyster of 3250 j mmol 1 n the coyster conversion factor affects energy related to ingested but non assimilated matter faeces and pseudo faeces and the energy related to predation on the different compartments composing oyster food i e small and large phytoplankton small and large zooplankton and particulate organic matter the second conversion factor μen is obtained by deriving the chemical potential of bivalve reserves with the nitrogen or phosphorus content of the organic matter that makes up these reserves the factor thus obtained is 3667 j mmol 1 n in general these conversion factors vary between 2400 and 3700 j mmol 1 n depending on whether food structure or reserves are considered as n or p content platt and irwin 1973 grangeré et al 2009 2 3 oyster seeding scheme in the model seeding scheme as the introduction in farming structures of spats and oysters is rather complex in the thau lagoon and mainly depends on environmental conditions contamination risks time frame or market dynamics two main periods for seeding were extracted from the monograph results gervasoni and giffon 2016 indicating that according to growth durations most spats 6 8 mm were mainly reared on lanterns or pearl nets and introduced between july and august 47 reared over the summer for a period of 6 8 months in addition this study indicated that oysters 15 20 mm were introduced within the early months of the year 53 in january and february for a duration of 12 to 14 months to reach marketable size oyster therefore in order to simplify this seeding time schedule for the gamelag conch model we assumed a common seeding scheme where oysters were introduced on the first of february and harvested in mid december regarding to spat seeding the first of july was used in the model to start growth of spats for a duration of 7 months in february remaining spats from year n were then used to seed oysters in year n 1 the total abundances were 532 1 106 and 235 7 106 individuals for spats and oysters respectively for the entire farming zone box 4 box 5 fig 1 mortality rates were also extracted from the monograph with values of 38 2 10 5 10 4 d 1 during the pre growing phase and 32 5 8 9 10 4 d 1 during the growing phase cepralmar 2016 seeding densities were then used to simulate stocking densities over the growing period as follows 7 d o y s t e r d t s e e d i n g o y s t e r o y s t e r m o r t a l i t y o y s t e r and 8 d s p a t d t s e e d i n g s p a t s p a t m o r t a l i t y s p a t where seedingoyster and seedingspat are densities of oysters and spats introduced as described above the number of individuals introduced was extracted from the monograph gervasoni and giffon 2016 and extrapolated to the farming zones with data from local authorities ddtm 2014 which represented an average exploitation of 70 of growing structures length l and dry flesh matter dfm were calculated at harvest for each simulated year annual oyster production was estimated from total weight derived from dfm equation 16 table s1 in suppl material and the number of living individuals simulated at harvest oyster condition index ci was estimated from model outputs by using the ratio of dfm g over length cm 2 4 reference simulation the baseline simulation e g reference scenario n 1 table 1 used in this study represented the current conditions of the thau lagoon functioning this baseline simulation was used to evaluate model skills see section 2 5 this simulation covered the period from 2014 to 2016 and was carried out with the hydro meteorological conditions of these three years including precipitation contributions of the natural catchment and contributions from wwtp based on the data of self monitoring recorded at the entrance of the wwtp data from smbt hydrological conditions of the simulated years were contrasted in terms of total rainfall and associated trophic contributions the year 2015 defined as a dry year 255 mm compared to 1970 2016 average showed low natural hydrological contributions with inputs of 0 77 t of p and 12 7 t of n whereas the years 2014 and 2016 with more intense rainfall events 70 mm and 55 mm compared to 1970 2016 average brought natural nutrient loadings to a respective estimate of 5 and 5 6 t of p and 86 6 t and 98 t of n during wet years anthropogenic inputs from wwtp amounted for 18 of n loading against 55 for p inputs total inputs from the watershed natural and anthropogenic reached 109 2 39 4 and 113 8 tons of n and 10 1 6 1 and 10 2 t of p for the three simulated years for the year 2015 wwtp discharges constituted the main source of n 62 and p 90 inputs whereas for the wet years 2014 and 2016 wwtp inputs accounted for up to 20 of total nutrient loadings the initialization of the biological compartments takes into account the most recent observations in order to get as close as possible to the current conditions in the simulations concerning the initialization of shellfish culture data from the cépralmar monograph cépralmar 2016 were used for livestock densities in the bouzigues and mèze marseillan areas see section oyster seeding scheme in the model the extrapolation of these survey results to both production areas was based on the data provided by local authorities ddtm 2014 with 2632 tables in concession of which 382 were not active the estimate of the structures hosting pre growth spats and growth adults was conducted using data from the monograph cepralmar 2016 extrapolated to the 2250 tables in operation on each of the two areas this baseline scenario is referred as ref in table 1 scenario n 1 table 1 2 5 model skills evaluation model computation the willmott index of agreement willmott 1981 d was used to evaluate the performance this metric is a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error and varies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement at all this index of agreement was used to evaluate model skills on salinity chl a concentration as well as shell length cm and tissue dry weight g of cultured oysters available observations for these variables were compared to simulations for the two shellfish farming zones fig 1 box 4 and 5 the gamelag conch model was implemented in r r core team 2017 using the desolve package soetaert et al 2010 for differential equation solving time step 1 day 2 6 description of scenarios scenarios of different nutrient inputs and shellfish culture strategies were determined in close interactions with shellfish farmers mediterranean shellfish committee crcm managers the thau basin organization smbt the centre for studies of lagoon and maritime activities cepralmar the french water agency aerm c departmental direction of territories and sea ddtm and scientists marbec these scenarios were built on realistic management hypotheses established during participative meetings and are based on two main axes 1 scenarios related to trophic contributions from the watershed and associated management measures and 2 scenarios related to shellfish production and they are summarized in table 1 the anthropogenic contributions of the watershed were tested according to different scenarios corresponding to different management hypotheses around the watershed of thau scenario 2 5 table 1 the yields of the wwtps are constrained by the environment that receives the discharges and come within the context of the regional plan for water management sdage rhône méditerranée and the local water management scheme sage applied to the thau lagoon territory when these receiving water bodies carry a risk of eutrophication they are classified as sensitive to eutrophication according to european regulation ec 1991 in the context of sensitive zones the european legislation ec 1991 requires wwtp to treat at least 80 of phosphorus and 70 to 80 of nitrogen for cities with more than 10 000 inhabitant equivalents ie for smaller municipalities these obligations vary and may be higher depending on the case thau lagoon was classified as a sensitive zone in 2004 according to european recommendations ec 2004 on these provisions it was concluded to test initially two scenarios declining these treatments of wwtp to 1 maximum yield scenario 2 max yield with abatements greater than 90 for nitrogen and phosphorus 2 normal yield scenario 3 nal yield corresponding to reductions of 75 and 60 respectively for nitrogen and phosphorus it should be noted that only the mèze lagoon based treatment plant currently offers yields comparable to the high abatements required by the sensitive zone classification 90 in direct relation with the environmental management constraints the territorial occupation scheme scot and in particular the demographic projections of this scot were evaluated in this study indeed an increase in population estimated at 23 at 2030 horizon directly leads to increased wwtp effluents wastewater discharges and consequently recommendations to anticipate these evolutions must be incorporated into a management policy of the territory this scenario scenario 4 scot table 1 aimed at estimating the impact of the population increase on the thau catchment area by 2030 in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the lagoon as well as its impact on ecological status and shellfish cultures in the thau lagoon current yields of wwtps were then applied to these estimated quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus to provide quantities entering the lagoon the following scenario scenario 5 sète table 1 corresponded to potential management leverage for freshwater and nutrient inputs n p to the lagoon through an operating strategy of the sète wwtp this scenario addressed the question of the evaluation of the impact of discharges in the sète channels and hence in the lagoon in anticipation of important modernization works on the wwtp the sète wwtp currently has its outfall in the sea but could release discharges to the sète channels in case of heavy rains this scenario examined the effect of an additional 69 5 72 9 and 84 7 tons of nitrogen in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in terms of phosphorus additional quantities were estimated at 3 7 3 1 and 3 6 tons for the same years respectively the scenario of different oyster stocking densities tested in this study corresponded to seeding conditions for which all the growing structures would be filled with oysters at the maximum densities allowed by the structure scheme ddtm 2014 in comparison to reference seeding conditions see section oyster seeding scheme in the model abundances were increased by a factor 2 for spats e g 501 106 and 546 106 individuals for box 4 bouzigues and box 5 mèze marseillan respectively and by a factor 1 3 for oysters e g 158 7 106 and 129 9 106 individuals for box 4 and box 5 respectively 2 7 data treatment and scenario realization prior to the simulations of these different scenarios a first step was the wwtp data processing to force the gamelag conch model work to recover volumes and concentrations of global nitrogen ngl and global phosphorus pgl at the inlets of the wwtps was performed based on data from sandre portal http www sandre eaufrance fr these data were used to establish 1 yield matrices for each wwtp located on the thau watershed and 2 matrices of fractions of the different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus for each of the wwtp to allow the transformation of total nitrogen and total phosphorus after treatment into their different inorganic and organic fractions necessary to force the model in a first step the input data of wwtp undergoes a reduction corresponding to the scenario tested see abatements table 1 and in a second step the output concentrations thus estimated are fractionated according to the different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus for the corresponding wwtp this procedure allowed for multiple different yield matrices or input augmentations as per scot projections applied to the same starting ngl and pgl datasets this method was applied for all scenarios with three matrices of yields covering current treatment maximum treatment and normal treatment see sections on reference and scenarios description 2 8 carrying capacity evaluation as mentioned in the introduction the targeted carrying capacity lies in the equilibrium between an optimised harvest without negative effects on ecological functioning the dame index and phytoplankton depletion index were then used where the former provides a bulk information on ecosystem functioning and allows comparison between different ecosystems whereas the depletion index linked more finely cultured bivalves to its resource 2 8 1 dame index the dame index was calculated from the characteristic times of the lagoon dame and prins 1998 these characteristic times included i the lagoon renewal time rt time required to renew the entire lagoon volume which is a hydrodynamic feature ii the phytoplankton renewal time ppt equivalent to the ratio of the average phytoplankton biomass to average gross primary production and finally iii the clearance time ct time required for the total stock of shellfish to filter the lagoon volume the renewal time rt was calculated for the whole lagoon using the volumes entering the lagoon by the sète channel 9 r t v l a g u n e v i n where vlagune and v i n were the volumes of the lagoon m3 and mean annual incoming volume m3 d 1 respectively this formulation gave renewal times of 48 6 48 4 and 48 8 days for the years 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively these rt values were in agreement with the field observations reported by fiandrino et al 2012 where rt 50 days the phytoplankton renewal time ppt was obtained by the ratio of the annual mean phytoplankton biomass estimated from the chl a concentration expressed in mmol n m 3 on the mean daily gross primary production estimated from the phytoplankton growth calculated by the model and expressed in mmol n m 3 d 1 the clearance time ct time required for cultured oysters to filter the volume of the lagoon was calculated taking into account the oyster filtration rate according to the formulation of bougrier et al 1995 10 f i l t r a t i o n r a t e 4 825 0 013 t c 18 954 2 d f m 0 439 where t c was the temperature in degrees celsius and dfm the dry weight g at harvest the filtration rate was expressed in l ind 1 h 1 the clearance time ct was expressed by comparing the filtered volume with the average volume of the lagoon 11 c l e a r a n c e t i m e v o l l a g o o n f i l t r a t i o n r a t e n b o f i n d i v i d u a l s 24 1000 where the filtration rate was extrapolated to the number of cultured individuals for a day and expressed in m3 d 1 and vollagoon m3 to give a clearance time in days all these characteristic times were expressed in days and their ratios ct rt and ct ppt potentially inform on the capacity of the lagoon to support or not a sustainable shellfish production the ct rt ratio indicated whether filter feeders and its resources were controlled by exchanges with the sea or by internal including inputs from the watershed availability of nutrients the ct ppt ratio expressed directly the link between the resource and the shellfish culture where a ratio of 1 would indicate that all phytoplankton primary production was consumed by filter feeders in culture and would therefore be a critical value 2 8 2 lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index at the scale of the lagoon area a phytoplankton depletion index filgueira et al 2014a was calculated to determine the impact of shellfish farming on its main resource this index compared the average phytoplankton biomass in farming areas box 4 and 5 fig 1 with the phytoplankton biomass produced outside these zones off table boxes 1 2 and 3 fig 1 negative values indicated a depletion in nutritive resource whereas positive values indicated sufficient resource for the growth of bivalves 12 l a g o o n s c a l e d e p l e t i o n i n d e x c h l a f a r m s c h l a o f f t a b l e 100 100 this formula compared the daily average chl a concentration of all shellfish growing areas box 4 and 5 fig 1 with the daily average chl a concentration for all off table areas boxes 1 2 and 3 fig 1 this index may be gauged against the natural variability of the phytoplankton biomass to evaluate the sustainability of the shellfish farming activity grant and filgueira 2011 this lagoon scale depletion index is asymmetrical and a value of 100 indicates a complete depletion whereas enrichment has no upper limit for this reason the median annual values of this index were preferred to mean values and were used to compare the scenarios 2 9 ecological indicators and ecological status the compartments of the model relative to the dissolved organic and inorganic matter were used to estimate summer nutrient concentrations 90th percentiles p90 were calculated from the 92 daily values obtained from june 1st to august 31st for each simulated year of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din no3 nh4 dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip total nitrogen tn dissolved and particulate inorganic and organic nitrogen as well as the two small and large phytoplankton compartments and total phosphorus tp inorganic phosphorus and dissolved and particulate organic and phytoplankton compartments expressed as phosphorus using the redfield 1963 n p ratio of 16 these four variables din dip tn and tp represented estimates of the wfd indicators measured for the diagnosis of the ecological status of lagoon water bodies derolez et al 2013 these simulated indicators were used to compare the reference scenario with actual observations and the influence of the different scenarios tested on the ecological status the model also estimated chlorophyll a concentration in the water column using the small and large phytoplankton variables these two state variables were expressed in mmol n m 3 in the model and converted to μg chl a l 1 using a conversion factor of 1 parsons et al 1961 the summer averages obtained from the simulations were used as an indicator of the phytoplankton biomass as in the wfd diagnosis finally the tn to tp ratio was used as an indicator of nitrogen and phosphorus balance within the system 2 10 statistical analyses data did not fulfilled tests for both normality and homosedasticity and non parametric kruskal wallis was therefore used for statistical analysis correlations were determined following spearmann correlation coefficient ρ statistical analyses were considered significant with p value 0 01 principal component analysis pca was performed on model outputs presented in this work all statistical analyses were performed using the r software r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 model skills model skills evaluation was based on model outputs of the reference scenario representing current situation the gamelag conch model satisfactorily simulated observations of salinity fig 3 a for both shellfish farming zones with a willmott index d of 0 96 linear regression r2 0 91 this agreement between observed and simulated values prevailed the good representation of the lagoon hydrodynamics when described by 3 physical boxes see carrying capacity model description similar to salinity model outputs were correctly correlated with the observed length fig 3 c and dry weight fig 3 d of oysters with willmott index of 0 69 r2 0 77 and 0 76 r2 0 76 respectively a poorer willmott index was found for the chl a variable at d 0 46 r2 0 03 the comparison of observations against simulations indicated that simulated chl a concentrations were within the range of observations for concentrations lower than 2 5 µg chl a l 1 however the model could not capture the timing of extreme values peaks which explained the mismatch on fig 3 b for high chl a concentrations 3 2 nutrients inputs and shellfish performances for the three simulated years and all the scenarios annual nutrient inputs varied from 25 5 to 198 6 tons of nitrogen and from 1 8 to 13 8 tons of phosphorus table 2 these ranges included lower and higher values of nutrient inputs than that of the reference scenario 39 4 to 111 5 t of n and 6 1 to 10 2 t of p table 2 results presented in fig 4 and table 2 highlighted the significant variability of oyster performances weight and production according to years and scenarios of nutrient inputs the variability of oyster production as well as total weight of oyster was mainly controlled by the hydrometeorology with oyster production being 1 8 2 3 times higher during rainy years than dry years whatever the tested scenario table 2 total weight of oysters at harvest varied between 36 6 to 100 5 g table 2 according to scenarios and simulated years similar to production total weight was significantly higher in wet years than dry years kruskal wallis p 0 05 although no significant differences were found between scenarios in comparison to the current situation reference higher oyster productions were simulated with normal waste water treatment plant efficiency normal yield 75 n 60 p with an additional 1700 t produced during dry years corresponding to an increase in production of 25 this increase was less important during wet years 940 1200 t 5 7 by contrast maximum wwtp efficiency max yield 90 n p induced a mean decrease of 1598 t corresponding to a decrease of 12 in comparison with mean reference production the foreseen increase in population scot scenario induced a mean increase in oyster production of 5 finally in the séte scenario oyster production was not enhanced and recorded 875 t less than reference production table 2 while nitrogen and phosphorus inputs were significantly higher than reference 1 8 2 8 times more n and 1 3 1 5 more p scenario of oyster stocking density to its authorized maximum by the french regulation body triggered a mean increase of oyster productions by 7 at the expenses of thinner oysters with a lower condition index to conclude oyster production the comparison of scenarios showed that only sète n 5 and max yield n 2 scenarios induced lower oyster production than reference scenario exhibiting a decrease of 8 and 16 respectively all other scenarios that involved increased nutrient inputs nal yield n 3 and scot n 4 presented higher oyster production levels with sensibly higher shell length and total weight table 2 on the contrary if scenario max dens n 6 rendered higher oyster production than reference scenario no increase of length or total weight of individuals was apparent oyster condition index ci was used as a proxy for the health of oysters and was significantly lower in 2015 kruskal wallis p 0 05 with no differences between scenarios when discriminating dry and wet years according to the different nitrogen and phosphorus inputs simulated one can note on fig 4 that oyster production values were maximized for a mass ratio n p of the watershed contributions around 8 3 that is about 100 t n for 12 t p or a molar ratio of 18 4 fig 4 this seemingly optimal n p ratio was obtained for the scenarios varying nutrient loadings nal yield n 3 scot n 4 and reference during wet years 2014 2016 but not during 2015 table 2 where n p ratio was 6 6 in fact the nitrogen inputs according to the different scenarios during the dry year 2015 varied from 25 to 50 of those during the two wet years 2014 and 2016 with the largest difference between dry and wet years recorded for the max yield scenario table 2 for phosphorus the variability of the contributions according to the hydrometeorology was less marked nevertheless inputs of phosphorus in the dry year were 1 5 3 times lower than for wet years this difference between wet and dry years was also largely marked by a significant modification of the contribution of the wwtp to the total inputs of the watershed reaching 89 on average in a dry year nitrogen to phosphorus mass ratios of inputs varied from 4 6 to 16 0 10 35 mol mol depending on the year and scenario and encompassed the optimal 8 3 n p value linked to the highest oyster productions obtained in our simulations 3 3 carrying capacity while renewal time rt seemed constant and corresponded to 48 6 days table 2 phytoplankton biomass renewal time ppt and clearance time ct varied according to scenarios with minimal and maximal means observed for max density and normal yield scenarios respectively table 2 the ct rt ratio remained constant regardless of the nutrient loading scenario mean of 0 38 and was lower as part of the max density scenario mean 0 30 indicating that water renewal times exceeded clearance times the ct ppt ratios ranged from 2 06 to 2 93 with minimal mean observed at max density table 2 fig 5 indicating that shellfish culture pressure on phytoplankton was not critical because clearance time was of 34 to 50 of phytoplankton production potential in other words the renewal time of phytoplankton production in the thau lagoon was systematically twice as fast as the time required for oysters to filter all the phytoplankton biomass produced this max density scenario led to the lowest ct ppt ratios with values of 2 13 2 45 and 1 98 for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively revealing a stronger pressure of shellfish farming on its phytoplankton resources than the other scenarios this pressure was accompanied by the lowest lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index over these three simulated years table 2 the ct rt and ct ppt ratios showed no significant correlation with n p ratio of catchment inputs for the reference scenario presented fig 6 the median value of this index varied between 14 and 13 indicating that the lagoon was in slight depletion conditions but may support shellfish production the median lagoon scale depletion indices appeared consistently negative regardless of the scenario tested fig 6 a b c overall median lagoon scale depletion indices varied between 12 3 and 15 1 depending on the year and scenarios tested but they did not show a clear trend depending on the amount of nitrogen or phosphorus brought by the watershed fig 6 a and b the range of values of the median depletion index was bounded by the scenarios max density and max yield the difference between simulated years was the main contrast between these median values of the depletion index kruskal wallis p value 0 01 fig 6 c showed these median depletion indices as a function of the n p ratios of the catchment contributions and the values of these indices decreased with decreasing n p ratio of watershed inputs in 2015 and 2016 spearman correlation coefficient of 0 83 and 0 94 respectively 3 4 ecological status although carrying capacity can be assessed through different indices ecological status of the lagoon must be regarded as another major characteristic depending on nutrient loadings or shellfish culture practices the p90 summer concentrations of din dip tn and tp derived from the reference simulations fig 7 a b c were consistent with the concentrations observed in the water column of thau lagoon in the context of the 2011 2016 wfd diagnosis concentrations measured 0 2 0 2 22 2 0 9 μmol l 1 respectively rephy 2017 din p90 were significantly higher kruskal wallis p value 0 001 in 2015 mean 0 49 than in 2014 and 2016 mean 0 31 and 0 33 respectively regardless of the scenario tested tn p90 were contrasted between years with significant differences recorded between 2014 and the two other years 2015 and 2016 kruskal wallis p value 0 001 finally chl a p90 were found significantly lower kruskal wallis p value 0 001 in 2014 mean 1 71 µg l 1 than 2015 and 2016 mean 3 60 and 3 45 µg l 1 respectively however the model seemed to underestimate tn values 17 6 and 20 4 μmol l 1 for the reference scenario n 92 and all scenarios n 552 respectively nitrogen and phosphorus inputs associated with the different scenarios did not seem to affect the ecological diagnosis of the water column based on nutrient indicators as none of these scenarios triggered a modification of ecological status classes these simulated indicators gave p90 values in agreement with the high status fixed by wfd medde 2015 in accordance with the high status evaluated by 2011 2016 wfd diagnosis only simulated dip concentrations were classified in the good ecological status for all scenarios table 2 shellfish production at harvest for all scenarios decreased significantly for a given year when the n p ratio of catchment contributions increased fig 8 a these relationships have a spearman correlation coefficient of 0 75 0 98 and 0 90 for years 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively p value 0 05 for the three relationships although no significant relationship has been established between shellfish production and nitrogen inputs or phosphorus inputs independently in addition production was negatively correlated with the median lagoon scale depletion index but this relationship was not linear for a given year fig 8 b the max dens scenario n 6 had the lowest median depletion index fig 8 b indicating that it had more impact on phytoplankton biomass than scenarios with comparable production outputs ie nal yield scenario n 3 on the other hand the max yield n 2 and sète n 5 scenarios gave the highest median depletion indexes but at the expense of lower oyster productions the comparison of nitrogen and phosphorus quantities added to the lagoon in each of the three simulated years showed the role of the hydro meteorology on oyster production 4 discussion the gamelag conch model was developed to address the questions related to the management of the thau lagoon ecosystem with regards to the issues of shellfish production and ecological status regulations scenarios tested were developed from realistic management hypotheses these hypotheses included leverages on the quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus potentially available through waste water treatment plant management or on the quantities of cultured filter feeders introduced in farming zones 4 1 scenarios and oyster performances all scenarios tested in this study were based on achievable management objectives in this respect little difference was highlighted from oyster performance model outputs when comparing scenarios although nutrient loadings in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus were varying with these different scenarios the highest increase in oyster production was recorded at 25 normal yield scenario in 2015 in comparison to reference this specific case corresponded to the modification of the mèze wwtp efficiency going from maximum to normal abatements and a very dry year 2015 200 mm where wwtp effluents were the main contributors to nutrient loadings 7 t n and 2 t p to a lesser extent scot and max density scenarios also demonstrated an increase in oyster production but limited to 3 9 and 1 10 respectively the effect of increased nutrient loadings mainly nitrogen on the production of cultured filter feeders has already been reported in modelling studies ferreira et al 2007 guyondet et al 2014 rose et al 2015 on the opposite reducing nutrient loadings from the watershed scenario max yield in this study through the improvement of waste water treatment efficiency triggered a loss in production between 8 and 18 compared to our reference scenario further indicating this dependence of oyster farming on nutrient supply of the thau system however the variation in nutrient loadings quantity may not solely explain the response of cultured oyster as large addition of nitrogen 171 in the sète scenario rendered lower oyster production than reference 2 to 13 this effect is probably linked to the joint influence of nitrogen and phosphorus additions the location of these inputs and the response of the biological compartments and is further discussed below in terms of oyster performances scenarios associated with increased nutrient loadings demonstrated that oysters marginally gained in length quality condition index and total weight at harvest but remained in the same market grade 66 85 g according to the french 6 grades weight where n 5 30 45 g n 4 46 65 g n 3 66 85 g n 2 86 110 g n 1 111 150 g and n 0 over 151 g however a reduction of as well as unbalanced nutrient loadings produced smaller oysters and a modification of the market grade 46 65 g with potential repercussion on economic aspects ferreira et al 2007 finally max density scenario demonstrated higher oyster production but at the expenses of thinner oysters with lower condition index this scenario highlighted the density effect where an increased abundance triggered a competition for the resources yielding smaller individuals gangnery et al 2001 gangnery 2003 filgueira et al 2014b the scenarios tested here have revealed differences in terms of oyster performances and productions however major contrasts were brought by interannual variability where dry against wet years triggered the largest variations in nutrient loadings consequently oyster productions were significantly lower in years presenting evident rainfall deficit oyster lengths total weight and condition index were also significantly affected with smaller lighter and lower quality during dry years nevertheless oyster production and performances evaluated through this modelling work shall be replaced within the context of ecological status and ecological carrying capacity to better assess overall functioning of the ecosystem byron et al 2011b higgins et al 2011 4 2 trophic carrying capacity and ecological status one of the objectives of this work was to assess the carrying capacity of the thau lagoon regarding to shellfish farming within the frame of wfd regulation the thau lagoon as any other shellfish farming sites is characterized by complex dynamics of interacting biological and physical processes within these systems filter feeding activity may deeply modify the energy fluxes as they clear large volume of water including suspended particles dowd 2003 filgueira et al 2014a to evaluate the capability of an ecosystem to support various uses it is important to compare phytoplankton production phytoplankton biomass lagoon hydrodynamics as well as shellfish culture pressure to truly highlight the limits of the ecosystem a first approach using these different aspects of the functioning of the ecosystem is the dame index dame and prins 1998 this index relates the characteristic times rt renewal time ct clearance time and ppt phytoplankton biomass renewal time of the thau lagoon the ct rt ratio indicates whether filter feeders and its resources are controlled by exchanges with the sea or by internal including inputs from the watershed availability of nutrients the gamelag conh model was able to simulate oyster productions along with indicators of the ecological status depletion index and characteristic times ct rt ppt comparatively with different scenarios of nutrient inputs and shellfish cultures the relationships between oyster production and the carrying capacity of the lagoon was evaluated with regards to the dame index particularly the ct ppt ratio and the lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index both markers demonstrated a top down control of filter feeders on phytoplankton population in this study simulated clearance and water renewal times ct and rt indicated that hydrodynamic exchanges with the far field outside the lagoon were not efficient enough to drive the filter feeder resources therefore phytoplankton dynamic or its bottom up control would rather be driven by nutrients coming from the watershed in comparison the marennes oléron site bacher 1989 dame and prins 1998 raillard and menesguen 1994 showed slower phytoplankton biomass renewal times and much faster filtration capacity resulting in a system that did appear to be largely under pressure marennes oléron ct ppt 0 27 despite a more efficient hydrodynamics than in the thau lagoon marennes oléron rt 7 1 the simulated values of the ct ppt ratio suggested that the consumption of phytoplankton biomass by farmed oysters was constrained between 34 and 50 leaving half or more of the phytoplankton stock available for other trophic levels trousselier deslous paoli 2001 had also concluded that thau lagoon was productive in the 1990s with shellfish harvested production representing about 3 of primary production dame and prins 1998 postulated that successful shellfish population occur when rt is less than 40 days and ppt below 4 days if characteristic times calculated for the thau lagoon are longer than these recommended times shellfish cultures have prospered in the thau lagoon and its carrying capacity did not seem to be threatened both ratios ct rt and ct ppt expressed the state of the carrying capacity of the lagoon by comparing the characteristic times of physics phytoplankton and shellfish in culture table 2 however they do not consider the presence of nutritive resources other than phytoplankton such as zooplankton or particulate organic matter the model outputs indicated that oyster production is related to the input n p molar ratio with production increasing with decreasing n p ratios these linear relationships were contrasted between years highlighting the strong influence of the hydrological regime and hence the quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the lagoon these first relationships were bounded by the maximum wwtp yield and normal wwtp yield scenarios as they provided the highest and lowest input n p molar ratio respectively this also revealed that if filter feeder production might be increased by decreasing the n p ratio of inputs the amount of nutrients coming from the watershed most probably phosphorus would limit the maximum levels of production to be reached the shellfish productions were also increasing with decreasing lagoon scale depletion index indicating that more production would trigger higher depletion of the thau system once again the most apparent contrast was linked to the different simulated years where higher nutrient loadings generated higher shellfish productions and hence an increased pressure on its phytoplankton resource n p ratio of loadings however was similar in 2014 and 2016 whereas phytoplankton summer biomass was similar in 2015 and 2015 therefore higher oyster production and subsequent increased filter feeder pressure could not only be explained by nutrient loadings annual mean temperature anomaly compared to the 1970 2016 mean 15 3 c was 1 5 c 1 4 c and 1 1 c for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in previous modelling studies filgueira et al 2016 increased temperature has been identified as a key factor in enhancing grazer activity through higher metabolism with concomitant higher pressure on phytoplankton the highest oyster production simulated in 2014 would be in agreement with highest annual average temperature recorded in 2014 for the thau lagoon in addition 2015 was associated with low nutrient inputs which resulted in low oyster performances even if temperature anomaly was similar to 2014 in this second relationship e g oyster production against depletion index oyster production was bounded by the maximum oyster densities and the maximum wwtp yield scenarios the use of maximum allowed stocking densities generated the highest depletion in agreement with the density effect chapelle et al 2000 grant et al 2007 grangeré et al 2010 the increase in the quantities of seeded shellfish did not lead to significantly higher harvests compared to the reference scenario 1 10 moreover the shellfish thus produced were smaller probably because of the competition for the nutritive resource between growing individuals this scenario also exhibited the lowest ct ppt ratios indicating a noticeable pressure of farmed oysters on their phytoplankton resource accordingly highest depletion was recorded when increasing stocking densities which corroborates this impact on phytoplankton stock however chl a concentrations used in the ecological status evaluation were not lower in the presence of higher densities of filter feeders than with the other scenarios this might be explained either by the fact that 1 energy stocks of filter feeders during the summer are allocated to spawning rather than nutrition e g filtration or 2 the increase in cultured bivalve density may have a positive feedback effect on phytoplankton outside growing structures through more excretion of inorganic nutrients kellogg et al 2014 it is important to note that shellfish farming activities occupy about 20 of the thau lagoon area 30 by volume which is probably a criterion of its durability in agreement with the occupational state of the thau lagoon byron et al 2011b reported using the ecopath model on the narragansett bay another example of a low intensity of shellfish cultures where carrying capacity is not reached due to high nutrient loadings and primary productivity these authors evaluated that if shellfish cultures density remained at current levels the growing area might theoretically be extended up to 26 of the bay area without exceeding the ecological carrying capacity on the contrary the study by filgueira et al 2014a concerning a bay occupied at 80 in volume by the mussel farms showed a strong impact on the phytoplankton resource where the median bay scale depletion index 34 2 was below the sustainable threshold calculated from natural variability of chl a concentration 27 5 this shellfish farming pressure was also reported to a lesser extent in saint peter s bay guyondet et al 2014 where only the central part of the bay exhibited depletion for a total farmed area of 40 the simulated ecological indicators were chosen to correspond to the observations used in the wfd diagnosis ec 2000 regardless of scenarios or simulated years these ecological indicators fell into the high ecological status class only simulated dip concentrations exceeded the high to good threshold 0 3 µm hence placing the ecological status of the lagoon into the good conditions for the water column chemistry the comparison of simulated years or scenarios showed significant differences for din between dry and wet years with higher concentrations recorded during the dry year 2015 and for chl a where concentrations in 2015 and 2016 were found higher than in 2014 the main concluding remarks on this ecological status evaluation is that scenarios tested in this study did not altered the ecological status of the lagoon in addition to this fulfilling high ecological status weak phytoplankton depletion and the moderate pressure of cultured oysters on their resources the current oyster production ref scenario n 1 oscillating between 7900 and 17 000 tons would therefore be sustainable and not conflicting with eu regulation nor are opposed to the important efforts made to reduce nutrient inputs from the watershed indeed ecological carrying capacity appears as a major component in the evaluation of the whole ecosystem functioning and should be carefully considered at the same level as ecological status 4 3 control of lagoon phytoplankton and shellfish productivity the results obtained in this modelling work of the thau lagoon seemed to indicate a control of the system by the nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from the watershed and more precisely by the n p ratio of these inputs when the inputs related to the various scenarios are detailed it appeared that if the n inputs from the watershed covered a wide range of values 25 5 198 6 tons the variability of phosphorus inputs was much smaller 1 8 13 8 tons the variability of n and p inputs related to the hydrometeorological regime seemed the main driver for the variability of shellfish production increases of 57 and 27 in n and p inputs during wet years led to a 36 increase in predicted oyster production by replacing shellfish production at harvest in the context of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs for all scenarios and the three simulated years an optimum of the n p inputs molar ratio appeared 18 4 around which the oyster productions seemed to be maximized in 2014 and 2016 wet years current loadings reference both natural and anthropogenic are just over 100 tons of nitrogen in wet years 2014 2016 for a phosphorus input of about 10 tons bringing the n p molar ratio above 22 to obtain a molar ratio of inputs around 18 4 it would therefore be necessary to bring an additional 2 5 tons of p into the system i e 12 5 tons of p in total phosphorus appeared to be insufficient and therefore limiting if one considers these current contributions of nitrogen the sète scenario n 5 confirmed the hypothesis of a phosphorus controlled system where a misleading excess of nitrogen 100 tons did not help to achieve higher production because this scenario increased the phosphorus deficit in the system although more p was brought to the lagoon oyster production did decrease in comparison with reference scenario the sète scenario tested the response of the ecosystem to excess n and p loading from a wwtp in the current situation this wwtp releases its wastewater into the sea this scenario involved the release of waste waters into box 1 petit étang of the model box 1 is the box connected with the sea hence part of these inputs is exchanged with the sea the other part reached box 2 then box 3 where cultured areas are located in the sète scenario the model shows that sediment has accumulated more n times 2 5 and has released less p times 0 4 in box 1 than the reference along with the sediment compartment macroalgae notably ulva and gracilaria yielded higher biomasses times 2 and times 1 5 for ulva and gracilaria respectively than in the reference scenario this may indicate that macrophytes enter a competition for nutrients in box 1 n p in sediment and macroalgae did not show marked differences in all other boxes of the model nevertheless this would indicate that box 1 was the first to respond to these additional inputs remaining nitrogen and phosphorus were then exchanged with the sea and with box 2 and further up macrophytes competing for nutrient resources and a greater accumulation of matter may have led to a lower p availability in boxes 2 and 3 including farming areas boxes 4 and 5 and hence lower oyster production n inputs n p inputs p and n p ratio of inputs np were used in a pca analysis fig 9 along with shellfish culture performances variables such as production prod total weight at harvest p tot or condition index ci and ecosystem functioning variables as chlorophyll a concentration in and out oyster farming zones chla of and chla out respectively or the lagoon scale phytoplankton depletion index di phosphorus inputs were strongly correlated with shellfish performances first axis 71 51 of variance explained and chlorophyll a concentrations suggesting a key role of phosphorus in controlling both phytoplankton and oyster production the phosphorus inputs were inversely correlated with the depletion index indicating also a role in regulating the carrying capacity of the thau lagoon nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of inputs and to a lesser extent nitrogen inputs explained the second dimension of this pca analysis 14 88 of variance explained fig 9 a suggesting that if phosphorus may control production levels importantly the balance between nitrogen and phosphorus in loadings carried from the watershed had a major importance in the efficiency of the thau ecosystem and hence on its trophic carrying capacity supplementary variables as simulated years and simulated scenarios once placed in this pca fig 9 b demonstrated the major importance of contrasted hydrological conditions as suggested above whereas the variability linked to the scenarios tested in this study exhibited less difference between scenarios with no clear pattern deslous paoli et al 1998 reported this control of shellfish production by phosphorus in the 1990s where the oyster stocking density was around 25 to 30 000 tons of shellfish and for an annual production exceeding 15 000 tons against 9200 to 9500 tons currently reported by shellfish farmers this study also reported phosphate concentrations in water 40 times higher than the current concentrations 4 μm against 0 1 μm at the same time even though the concentrations of po4 3 in water have been decreasing since the 1970s the significant expansion of oyster farming during this period from 1400 to 2440 tables in 20 years would have reduced the risk of eutrophication by removing about 30 according to the authors of this readily available phosphorus from the thau lagoon at present the decrease in phosphorus inputs from the watershed and consequently the concentrations in the water column is mainly attributed to the major efforts made on the waste water treatment systems derolez et al 2013 la jeunesse 2001 souchu et al 2010 depending on the year the contribution of anthropogenic inputs from wwtp varies importantly to supply up to 90 of total inputs in dry years the n p molar ratio of these anthropogenic inputs 5 2009 2016 average data not shown is much lower than that of natural inputs 40 2009 2016 average data not shown thus placing the lagoon in nitrogen limiting conditions in those years the main source of current phosphorus inputs coming from the wwtps 5 conclusions the gamelag conch model developed to answer the problem of reconciling resource exploitation through shellfish culture and regulatory constraints allowed an evaluation of the ecosystem carrying capacity of the thau lagoon and the simulation of various scenarios waste water treatment management and shellfish farming strategies to the best of our knowledge there are no existing model taking into account both nitrogen and phosphorus inputs within the frame of carrying capacity assessment and most carrying capacity models are based solely on nitrogen dowd 2003 byron et al 2011c chapelle et al 2000 filgueira et al 2014a guyondet et al 2014 or biomass data sets jiang and gibbs 2005 under current conditions the carrying capacity of the thau lagoon does not appear to be limiting the interannual variability introduced by the differences in weather conditions strongly affects shellfish farming in terms of production and shellfish performances rather than did the contrast between the different tested scenarios the productivity of the ecosystem seemed to depend mainly on watershed inputs in which inputs from wwtps had a predominant role in dry years shellfish production was more specifically controlled by phosphorus as revealed by unbalanced n p ratio in loadings the trophic resource being sufficient the oyster control on the phytoplankton was not excessive and depended on the stock density of cultured bivalves or additional phosphorus brought to the lagoon the use of high stocking densities should be prohibited because if they generated higher production than current conditions at the expenses of thinner oysters with low condition index finally the ecological status did not appear to be threatened with regard to the current shellfish pressure this model thus appeared as a suitable tool for management perspectives another strength and recommended approach byron et al 2011a of this work resides in the implication of shellfish farmers stakeholders local and governmental management bodies as well as scientists to implement realistically based scenarios in the search for an equilibrium between shellfish production and ecological status regulation however important caveats must be given here as this paper reports a global evaluation of the carrying capacity through the use of characteristic times or depletion index that might vary in time and space dame and prins 1998 guyondet et al 2014 further work is necessary to alleviate this time varying control of the carrying capacity where characteristic times or even depletion index are used to identify seasonal effects and sensitive periods to be confronted to shellfish production performances and potential ecological impacts this ongoing work shall help management of shellfish culture practices in this context of maintaining good ecological status a perspective use of this numerical tool resides in a theoretical approach that would involve large variations of nutrient loadings to seek for tipping points where depletion or ecological indicators may drastically change with strong impacts on the whole ecosystem functioning short term development of this tool would address the question of anoxic crisis which had sporadically occurred in the thau lagoon when temperature increases and weather conditions are calm these anoxic crises have led to dramatic loss of cultured bivalves hence temporarily damaging ecological conditions of the lagoon further developments of this management tool should address questions related to climate change where the frequency and or the intensity of meteorological events such as temperature increase or the modification of rainfall regimes should be considered concomitantly with increase in population in turn increasing watershed loadings subsequent refit of wwtp and sustainability of uses in the thau lagoon credit authorship contribution statement romain pete conceptualization methodology software formal
