13640,the previous models that replicated primary sedimentation units assumed that all the total settleable solids tss components settled at the same velocities these assumptions resulted in poor predictions of primary sludge characteristics and anaerobic digestion ad model with the accurate knowledge of ps compositions the settled wastewater that leads to the activated sludge as system can be determined using the principles of material mass balance the mass balance is achieved by consolidating the known compositions of raw wastewater and primary sludge ps hereby allow accurate tracking of elements along the entire wrrf when using the model for design and optimised operation of wrrf systems in this investigation the raw wastewater entering the water and resource recovery facility wrrf via the pst is comprehensively characterising the tss the tss was categorised into inorganic settleable solids iss biodegradable particulate organics bpo and unbiodegradable particulate organics upo each with five settling velocity distribution profiles the bpo is further defined in terms of its elemental composition and hydrolysis rate kinetic constants to allow for accurate prediction of the ad system performance when linked to the virtual pst to achieve this the study introduced the i modification of the university of cape town primary sedimentation unit uctpsu model of polorigni et al 2021

wastewater treatment is the removal of excessive organics and nutrients to ensure effluent quality that meets the required environmental criterion 1 2 however the growing population in the globe has led to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant genes pharmaceuticals and heavy metals hereby calling for more efficient wastewater treat plants 3 this connotes that wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been struggling to meet the strict effluent discharge regulations required to protect the regions water resources one of the unit controls in wwtp that can enhance the effluent quality is the primary settling tank pst which reduces the organic loads subsequently fed to the activated sludge the pst performance is therefore vital in achieving the desired effluent specification 4 by reducing the quantity of solids fed to the as systems where the biological conversions of influent sewage occurs moreover the biodegradable organics in ps are often channeled to ad systems where their stabilization process results in the generation of biogas however predicting the recovered resources that correspond to the elemental mass compositions of the digested ps has been the major challenge this is due to the characterization of ps in terms of biodegradable and unbiodegradable particulate as well as inorganic suspended solids is not being achievable through previous pst models to address this challenge a tss based pst model was developed to include correct proportions of upo bpo including the bpo characteristic empirical formula i e x y z a and b of cxhyoznapb and inorganic iss in correct proportions 5 to optimize the performance of pst and its overall impact on wwtp globally shifting paradigms have necessitated re thinking the strategy behind waste treatment processes towards the recovery of water nutrients n and p and energy steady state and dynamic mathematical modelling procedures have been introduced to further improve the pst performance and enhance decision making processes on its operation s√∂temann et al 6 and ekama 7 developed an integrated steady state model for wwtp and included the anaerobic digestion of primary sludge ikumi 8 also established the significant contribution of psts towards the development of waste resource recovery facilities wrrfs by anaerobically digesting the biodegradable organics fed through the pst underflow to the anaerobic digestion ad reactor a wide range of models have been developed through various studies 45 9 47 43 46 10 each model developed has its advantages and disadvantages some models simply made use of retention time with a single variable 47 or address scouring with the hydraulic behavior of the primary clarifier 45 in an empirical fashion other models comprised of combined physical and biological processes 45 43 11 and computational fluid dynamics 12 that were it extremely complex to develop and calibrate hence there is a need to redefine the development of primary settling tank models with the objective of a better wrrf processes description and a holistic plant wide optimization this led to a new generation of promising models using the particle settling velocity theory 48 13 10 however these models were based on total solids removal tss not accounting for the tss composition and how the compositions influence the ad and as biological processes 10 the primary sludge ps has been experimentally revealed to settle in different proportions of 70 80 of the upo 80 90 of the iss and 40 60 of the bpo 14 16 to obtain these proportions it then follows that these components should settle in the pst at different velocities the accurate characterization of ps and settled wastewater in application of plant wide models is essential to simulate strategies for optimization of energy and nutrient recovery from the influent wastewater the objective of this paper is to therefore calibrate the realistic uctpsu model developed by polorigni et al 5 in terms of its measured settling velocity groups by i including bioprocesses of hydrolysis and fermentation ii performance of a parameter determination using experimentally generated data iii determine the fractions of unbiodegradable organics and iv determine the most important uctpsu model output variables and parameters using general sensitivity analysis the research paper hence presents the calibration methodology of a modified pst model in terms of settling velocities tss fractionations and underflow sludge biological processes 2 materials and methods an experimental investigation together with implementation of mathematical modelling was required in this study to achieve the research objectives the three experiments conducted for the study are a settleometer tests b an abmp test to determine the biodegradability and composition of the solids in the different settling velocity groups and c an ad test at steady state conditions ad ss to generate inoculum seed sludge for the abmp experiment the experimental results were analyzed using mathematical modelling procedures these procedures include i non linear regression to determine kinetics of hydrolysis of the sludge degraded during the abmp tests and ii parameter estimation to determine the elemental composition of the biodegradable solids in the sludge collected by the settleometer fig 1 2 1 settleometer description operation and sampling a settleometer fig 2 is a developed instrument that separates influent raw wastewater into suspended particles based on innate settling velocities vs and hence generate the distribution of their settling velocities the design principle for the settleometer was established by moosbrugger et al 17 the apparatus consists of five vertical transparent interconnected plastic tubes made of polyvinyl chloride pvc with equal height 1 m tall and increasing internal diameters 45 2 mm to 134 4 mm operating at a controlled flow rate the fastest settling particles settle in the first column which has the smallest diameter and the highest vs the slowest settling particles settle in the last column with the largest diameter and lowest vs as the vs decreases between the successive columns sludge samples generated from the settling within the columns are divided according to particle size and density 18 prior to operation the settleometer was primed with water to service and ensure maximal operation following this the upflow velocity for each cylinder was calculated by sucking fresh water through the system at flow rates ranging from 0 6 l min to 1 2 l min using eq 1 once the settleometer was proved to be fully functional raw wastewater flowing from the inlet works of potsdam wastewater treatment works pdwwtw in cape town south africa was fed through the settleometer 1 v u p q a i n where q is the input flow rate a i n is the internal cross sectional area of the cylinder v u p is the calculated up flow velocity inside the cylinder two successful runs were conducted under steady state conditions of the settleometer system the collected influent samples for each run procedure were thoroughly mixed and a 5 l sample fetched while the setup was running 1 l sample of the raw wastewater were taken at approximately 20 mins intervals till each run was completed 2 h the effluent wastewater was discharged into a 200 l collection drum and the discharge started just after the influent raw wastewater had flowed through the interconnected 5 pvc columns the effluent flow rate was estimated by recording the time taken for a 3000 ml volumetric flask to fill up a 3000 ml volumetric flask was used in place of the 200 l collection drum to get more accurate timing of the flow rate and verified by repeating the flow rate measurement about 3 times the first run was completed after running the settleometer for 135 mins and the sewage content in each column was emptied into separate 25 l containers the columns were emptied from the largest to the smallest cylinder to prevent supernatant overflow and sludge influx from a larger column to smaller column pipe clamp at the top of each column was loosened while emptying the columns to enhance the discharge of retained wastewater down the column each of the 5 column samples in their receiving containers were thoroughly mixed before being collected into their respective 5 l containers to ensure that all solids are flushed out of the system clean water is pumped through the settleometer until all columns are completely saturated with water altogether 14 samples from the 2 successful settleometer runs were transported to water quality laboratory wql at the university of cape town uct and were stored in the walk in refrigerator cold room maintained at 4 c 2 2 steady state mesophilic anaerobic digestion operation the ad is a completely sealed and continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with a gas outlet and an average operating temperature of 35 c fig 3 as required for mesophilic anaerobic digestion 19 the reactor tank was manufactured from perspex and cylindrical stainless steel rods for structural support to ensure a gas tight seal the ad operating temperature 35 c is controlled by means of heating rods dipped inside the ad reactor and connected to a temperature controller with a temperature probe in the reactor mixed liquor the total volume of the ad reactor tank is 25 l however the operating volume of ad is set at 20 l and the reactor was operated with 20 d sludge age the municipal sludge also contains organically bound nitrogen which during hydrolysis gets released as nh3 and acts as a buffer due to the uptake of hydrogen ions from the aqueous phase resulting in generation of hco3 ikumi 2020 20 further the system was monitored carefully to ensure that the volatile fatty acids generation was not significant and the alkalinity was stable throughout also it was observed that the system stayed methanogenic by checking that methane gas was generated by retaining the acetoclastic methanogens in the ad reactor the in situ ph is measured through its access point and other general tests are done to estimate its volatile fatty acids vfas and alkalinity concentrations the sludge inlet outlet pipe at the base of the ad controlled by a valve is only opened during the feeding process when waste sludge is drawn and feed sludge equivalent to the wasted is added thereby maintaining a flow rate of 1 l d the ad system is fed ps obtained from the underflow of the primary settling tank pst at the potsdam wastewater treatment works pdwwtw this ps is collected in about 50 l batches and stored in the 4 c cold room of the uct wql it is possible for the ps to undergo considerable anaerobic fermentation causing increased short chain fatty acid scfa concentrations even at low temperatures of 4 c to limit the prospect of such characteristic alterations ps storage is limited to a maximum of three months before the slurry ps was fed to the ad it is macerated to reduce its particle size and viscosity the continuously stirred rod in the ad reactor contributed to the fluidity of the macerated ps these prevented blockages in the experimental systems the system was also heated to above 35 c to avoid causing a temperature shock to the temperature sensitive methanogenic biomass the feed microorganism f m ratio for the steady state ad reactor was kept below 0 70 to prevent acidic inhibition this was done by observing low biogas methane yield production and was controlled by dosing the plant with lime the growth rate of the mesophilic organisms used in the ad reactor are shown in table 1 2 3 augmented bio methane potential test the bio methane potential bmp test fig 4 is used to measure the potential yield of biogas from the digestion of organic material in anaerobic batch conditions the augmented bio methane potential abmp test is run the same way as the bmp test but also including few basic measurements of the chemical oxygen demand cod filtered and unfiltered total volatile and inorganic suspended solids tss vss and iss aqueous phase volatile fatty acids vfa h2co3 alkalinity free and saline ammonia fsa concentration orthophosphate op concentration and the ph 21 this shall be in the attempt to characterize the settled raw wastewater particles which has been divided into various settling velocity groups the abmp test uses a transparent glass bottle with a sample placed inside and the produced gas escapes through tubing connected at the top of each bottle and is bubbled through a barrier solution into a measuring cylinder before the start of the test water is sucked into the measuring cylinder using a vacuum pump the gas produced displaces the water volume therefore by measuring the change in water level the volume of gas produced over time by the sample can be determined various methods are being explored to measure the water level in the column continuously however on line measurement using ultrasound and pressure sensors was the method applied in this project this biomass is added to the abmp reactor by a process known as seeding in which a measured sample was drawn from the steady state methanogenic reactor and placed into the abmp reactor vessel at the start of the experiment the test samples collected from the settleometer columns were utilized by the seed inoculum present inside the abmp reactor the control containing ad biomass seed and test containing both biomass seed and substrate abmp reactors were subjected to a long sludge age 40 d in the abmp reactors the initial starting concentrations of the abmp reactor contents were sampled and measured also sample is drawn from each reactor every 24 h for the first 12 d after which a sample is taken every second day this is done to ensure that enough mass remained inside the reactor until the end of the test reaction endpoint will be observed the moment gas production stops 2 4 analytical tests performed on experimental set up analytical tests table 2 were performed on the examined samples collected from the settleometer ad modular reactor and batches of the abmp reactors 2 5 closure the process of generating data that could be used towards calibrating the uctpsu model required linking the settleometer and steady state ad experiments to the abmp experiment the settleometer supplied the test substrates while ad system effluent supplied the cultured seed inoculum to be used in the control abmp reactor these substrates and the seed inoculum in equal proportion were used to determine tss fractionations elemental mass compositions emcs hydrolysis rate constants and the unbiodegradable particulate organic fraction fs up from these integrated experimental systems the data that comprehensively characterizes the ps i e the estimated component settling velocities biodegradability bpo hydrolysis rate constants and bpo elemental composition are used to calibrate the uctpsu model 3 model implementation the uctpsu model was developed as an extension of the uct three phase plant wide model developed in west simulation platform 22 this was done to ensure simulation of the virtual pst within a plant wide context pwm sa 23 the current pwm sa sub models include 1 the asm2 3p model 8 2 the uctsdm3p model 8 24 and 3 the uctpsu model 5 all these unit operation sub models contain the same comprehensive set of model components 25 each component is parameterised based on its cod and molar concentrations the organic components and their various biomass that mediate the biological treatment processes have been allocated parameterized elemental formulations these elemental formulations are based on the varying compositions of the organic components and are therefore included as model parameters for example the x y z a and b of the organic structure cxhyoznapb represents its elemental mass compositions emcs all the model components and parameters were defined and named according to the standard notational framework proposed by corominas et al 26 the three sub models also share the same ionic speciation model of brouckaert et al 27 that includes pairing of ionic components and inter phase transfers of component species this ionic speciation was coded in a separate c file that is linked to the west simulation platform library 28 to initiate the evaluation of the pwm sa model the systematic method proposed by hauduc et al 29 was applied to verify that material cod c h o n p mg k and ca balances were achieved in the determination of all stoichiometric processes contained in the three sub models further description of the models and their current evaluation processes is given below 1 the asm2 3 p model is the activated sludge model no

up and failure 24 the uctsdm3p model was also recently extended to include biological sulphate reduction bsr processes 24 3 the uctpsu model was developed by polorigni et al 5 the details of its extension and evaluation are the focus of this paper and are described in the section below 3 1 uctpsu model description the uctpsu model was developed in two phases 1 discrete pst model and 2 flocculent pst model focussing on discrete conditions of a virtual pst the influent settleable solids removals were developed in microsoft excel this was performed for steady state conditions and were aimed at mimicking correct proportions and removals of upo bpo and iss 14 16 using raw and settled wastewater characteristics from wrc 34 and ekama 35 the particle settling velocity distribution psvd concept of bachis et al 10 was adapted to this discrete model the model was verified through strict material mass balances between its inputs and outputs 5 furthermore the simulation results of polorigni et al 2020 matched the given data at steady state these results reflected the percentage removals observed in the experimental studies conducted by 14 15 and ikumi et al 16 towards describing the pst reality the uctpsu model 5 has currently been extended to include two biological processes i hydrolysis and ii fermentation i hydrolysis hydrolysis processes are surface reactions that occur when the slowly biodegradable substrates are enmeshed with facultative organisms hereby providing hydrolytic enzymes 36 30 that breaks it down to fermentable biodegradable soluble organics fso or sf the addition of this process to the uctpsu model involved ensuring that a cod balance is maintained between the reactant bpops or xb inf and the product fso despite its possibility of having different emcs during hydrolysis the release or uptake of carbonates co3 2 ammonia nh4 phosphates po4 3 water h2o and protons h was similarly included by using the principle of strict mass balance for c n p o and h respectively this resulted in the following molar stoichiometry shown in eq 2 the stoichiometric coefficients are multiplied with their component molar masses to convert the equation to mass concentration stoichiometry that is fitting with the units used in the pwm sa model 2 c x p s h y p s o z p s n a p s p b p s g a m p s g a m f z f 3 x f 4 b f z p s 3 x p s 4 b p s h 2 o g a m p

f y f 4 a f g a m p s g a m f h where gamps and gamf are the electron donating capacities for ps and fso respectively the kinetics rate at which this hydrolysis process occurs is modelled using the saturation kinetics formulation eq 3 3 r h y d k m c x b i n f z a d k s c x b i n f z a d z a d g c o d l d the kinetic formulation includes acidogenic biomass concentration zad and a maximum rate of hydrolysis km under conditions of high substrate biomass concentration ratio xb inf zad it is based on the quantity of bpo xb inf attached to the organic biomass active sites whereby the rate of hydrolysis reaches a maximum at saturation of the active sites of the acidogens the ks parameter is the substrate and acidogenic biomass concentration ratio at which the specific hydrolysis rate is half its upper limit km at saturation hence the kinetic constants km and ks must be determined experimentally to use the above process formulations ii fermentation the fermentation process is modelled to involve the conversion of fermentable biodegradable soluble organics fso to acetate svfa accompanied with the release of excess nutrients n and p like the hydrolysis process a cod mass balance is observed such that the cod of fso used is equitable to the cod of acetate generated thereafter the co3 2 nh4 po4 3 h2o and h produced are determined using c n p o and h mass balances respectively over the stoichiometric reaction the molar stoichiometric process is as shown by the eq 4 below 4 c x f h y f o z f n a f p b f g a m f 64 y h c h 3 c o o a f n h 4 b f p o 4 3 x f 2 g a m f 64 c o 3 2 z f

order kinetic formulation this is a simple kinetic formulation that assumes the process kinetic rate i e fermentation is directly proportional to the concentration of available substrate i e 5 s t a t e k i n e t i c s f s o h y d k h f s c s f where khfs is the first order kinetic rate constant for fermentation 1 d and c sf is the mass concentration mg l of fso 3 2 determination of kinetic constants of ad sludge hydrolysis with sbpe zad and rhyd calculated for each time interval the hydrolysis rate kinetic constants eq 6 was obtained through non linear regression methods 37 this was achieved via the utilization of curve fitting software r studio software 6 r h y d k m s b p z a d k s s b p z a d z a d g cod l d the model to be fitted the saturation hydrolysis kinetic formulation and the model parameters to be estimated km and ks values are first specified thereafter the r software determines the best parameter values by calculating fitted values for all the data points of the fitting regression model together with the residuals such that the minimum residual sum of squares is obtained from this process the kinetic rate constants that would provide the closest predictions are selected for application to the ad reactor once the kinetic constants have been determined the calibrated hydrolysis rate equation can be applied to calculate the residual biodegradable organics at a given time sbp t 3 3 determination of control and test masses prior to parameter estimation the uctsdm3p model was used to simulate a virtual replica of the abmp test as shown by gaszynski et al 38 the abmp test that virtually replicates the ones run experimentally are simulated these experiments include the control with inoculum only sample and test with both inoculum and organics samples the volume of seed and substrate used in the abmp test for both main and duplicate samples were recorded prior to calculating the control and test masses to be initialized for parameter estimation the test simulation is subsequent to the control to allow for the initial parameters i e the determined emc values of cxhyoznapb to be determined from the control simulation prior to the test abmp simulation performance of pe using the actual test output data allows for determination of the hydrolysis rate and composition of the feed organics like the actual bmp test procedure the difference in methane production or cod removal by the test and control simulations is attributed to the organics in the feed 3 4 parameter estimation for abmp experiment parameter estimation is a process that compares the experimentally measured variables with the corresponding model predicted variables until the observed experimental data is achieved at the same time steps to find a composition that better fits the observed experimental data parameter estimation pe was conducted on a virtual abmp experimental reactor that was simulated using the uctsdm3p model therefore the observed experimental data from the abmp experiments were set as the objective variables for the parameter estimation procedure the parameters that were used as the unknowns were the h o n and p terms of the biodegradable particulate organics in the pss five known variables were set as the simulation objectives i e the total cod fsa op vss and the h2co3 alk concentrations the pe tool in west software ran hundreds of iterations until the correct combination of parameters that achieved the desired results with the lowest error was determined 3 5 global sensitivity analysis gsa using standard regression coefficient src method the gsa was performed using the standardised regression coefficients src method the theory behind this method and its results was based on the objectives proposed by neumann 39 hence src method was performed to identify significant parameters and highlight those required for experimental determination as it relates to uctpsu model the selected uctpsu model output variables are iss under out x b inf out x iss out x u inf out x vss tss under s under x b inf under x u inf under x vss and vss under s the mode of selection for these variables was subject to steady state condition to estimate the uncertainties of the tss fractionations iss upo and bpo at different locations in the uctpsu model the values specified for each of the uctpsu model parameters were determined using the method proposed by brun et al 40 4 results and discussions 4 1 standard regression coefficient src results using neumann 39 proposed interpretation the analysed parameters were classified into kinetics process rate parameters and stoichiometric the discussion of the src results will be centred on the uctpsu model parameters whose coefficient of determination r2 exceeds 0 7 this implies that for the given virtual experiment other non influential parameters can be placed anywhere within their value range without causing any significant change in the variable outputs table 3 gives a summary of the influential parameters on each of the selected model variables showing their corresponding coefficients r2 for the most and the least important parameters of the uctpsu selected variables mean kinetic sum stoichiometry sum standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation the results show that the relevant uctpsu model output variables and the model parameters identified to be of importance include i inorganic settleable solids in the underflow ii sub component total settleable solids in the underflow and iii sub component volatile settleable solids in the underflow i inorganic settleable solids in the underflow iss under fig 5 a shows how iss under has various important model parameters that affect its output in decreasing order of influence the identified key parameters are stoichiometric and positively influence the model output variable iss under these parameters are vs s x iss 1 vs s x iss 3 alpha i vs s x iss 4 vs s x iss 2 vs s x iss 5 beta i and gamma i the vs s x iss 2 parameter out of the 5 sub components iss settling velocities shows to have retained more iss under however there is no clear cut explanation on why vs s x iss 1 the lowest settling velocity was of less significance also x t i o xuorg mol perc and alpha b add up to the important parameters that influence iss under with more focus on x t as the significant parameter with the most negative influence intuitively it can be established that certain tss concentration must be set below which possibly retained iss under will reduce this can be practically influenced by the wastewater source and pst operating conditions on site ii sub component total settleable solids in the underflow tss under s the settling velocity groups for influent biodegradable particulate organics in sub components 3 5 vs s x b inf 3 vs s x b inf 4 and vs s x b inf 5 are highlighted as the top parameters that positively affect tss under s however the 5th sub component which had the largest settling velocity vs s x b inf 5 was the most significant these parameters are stoichiometric and inform more on careful parameter setting in the uctpsu model it implies that the largest tss under s is achieved at a settling velocity that does not disrupt the settling of tss at the pst underflow fig 5b it also infers that tss concentration decreased as the settling velocities decreased from sub components 5 to 3 iii sub component volatile settleable solids in the underflow vss under s kinetic parameters are indicated to grossly influence the vss under s model output variable these parameters are hydrolysis rate constants of biomass km borg ad hyd influent biodegradable particulate organics km binf ad hyd and fermentable soluble organics kh f ad hyd when km borg ad hyd is high it means the hydrolysis of the bio organics will be slow since little inherent organisms initially existed see fig 5c this hydrolyzing organism readily sequesters the fermentable soluble but slowly hydrolyze bpo ps the biomass also facilitates the tracking of the ad products including biogas production soluble components orthophosphate fsa and h2co3 alk and charge produced the biomass death and degradation has also been modelled to occur via death regeneration 16 4 2 settleometer results the influent wastewater density was fractionated and settling velocities reduced across the settleometer system from 54 41 m h to 5 82 m h the percentage sludge mass tss retained in each column appeared to reduce from second column to the last largest column but was not consistent as the 3rd column retained tss lower than the 4th column however for vss and iss masses it was observed to record consistent increment except in column 5 the determined cod tkn tp tss and vss mass balance are consistent and within the acceptable range 80 120 fig 6 a b can be described to show the settling profile of the sludge at different hydraulic settling velocities 4 3 steady state anaerobic digestion ad system results as a source of the required seed inoculum for the proposed abmp test the operated steady state ad system provided the average measured data for the ad system this data was necessary to determine the characteristics of the seed inoculum used for the abmp test table 4 4 4 augmented bio methane potential abmp test results the abmp reactors ran for 52 days after which there was no further biogas production and the only organics left in the test batches are unbiodegradable particulate organics upo a naming configuration was applied to simplify discussion by representing each column and its duplicate with alpha numeric symbols such as t1a and t1b where t means test 1 means pvc poly vinyl chloride column number with sample a and duplicate b high cod removal trend was observed from control reactors up to the pvc column 2 reactors the fsa concentration measured from 0 to 52 d increased this fsa increment implies the release of the organic n bound in the substrates fbso and bpo as fsa during the substrate digestion process at the 1st day of digestion op concentration increased from inoculum batch to the last test batch pvc column 5 samples and subsequently reduced the organic bound p for pss bio organics are usually very small resulting in a low chance of accurately capturing the release trend therefore molar p fraction in sewage is assumed to be zero due to its low values the measured iss concentration was found to be internally consistent per sample type also the iss concentration difference with respect to the inoculum sample was observed to be less than 350 mg l except for pvc column 4 sample that recorded the highest iss concentration this implies that the settling velocity in pvc column 4 settled more iss proportions the trend line in fig 7 a shows that the fraction of unbiodegradable particulate organic cod f sup slowly declines with the increased column diameter this could possibly mean that upo proportions of tss are lower for the tss with reduced settling velocities the tss fractionations iss upo and bpo was calculated in percentage to show the proportions represented in each pvc columns of settleometer device table 5a and 5b it shows the proportions of tss components in each pvc columns with upo and iss components respectively having the largest and smallest proportion although the settling velocity does not assert if there is meant to be a clear cut increase or decrease in tss components from pvc columns 1 5 however the computed tss proportion can be accepted to imitate a real primary settling tank in terms of settling tss components 4 5 parameter estimation pe for abmp experiments results the pe procedure was implemented using the tools in west simulation software the virtually replicated abmp reactors were simulated using the uctsdm3p model for hundreds of iterations until the correct combination of parameters that achieved the desired results with the lowest error was determined the results from this pe process indicate that the calculated n composition in the organics appeared accurate since both the generated alkalinity and the released ammonia in the experiment increased fig 8 a b the drop in the measured ammonia concentration in the abmp control experiment may be due to experimental error such as a new mixture of boric acid or a different normality of the acid used for titration the op release is not well predicted as the chosen p value appears too low fig 8c the simulated vss concentration utilized during the experiment appears to match the observed change in vss relatively well fig 8d as predicted due to the gas measurement error associated with the experimental bmp the simulated ch4 release was higher than the observed ch4 release fig 8e besides the vfa s inconsistent trend its accumulation did not match the observed abmp data well the rate can be adjusted in the abmp model and inputted back into the steady state model to check for consistency the worst prediction of the abmp simulation was the operating ph fig 8f the simulated ph dropped far below the observed ph values this indicated that the elemental composition determined was incorrect this issue was resolved by conducting a parameter estimation on the abmp control reactor such that a new elemental composition that matched the measured data was determined the same procedures followed for the abmp control experiment were relatively applied to the abmp test experiment except for two differences unlike in the control experiments where the equivalent of actual concentrations is used the whole concentration for each of the variables is used up also since the mixture of both control and test samples will be required for the abmp test the actual substrate concentration at time t 0 is estimated by subtracting the equivalent biomass variables from the test batches also at time t 0 for example initial condition time t 0 h cod biomass inoculum concentration in control batch 1 6720 mgcod l cod test concentration in test batch 1 i e in pvc 1a 16 900 mgcod l cod substrate in test batch 1 cod test cod biomass concentration 10 180 mgcod l similar calculations were done per time steps as observed in the tables from time 0 h to desired end time and that was how the actual variable concentrations across all the pvc columns 1 5 were determined except for the ph values fig 9 a c below also show the plots of the experimentally determined versus predicted hydrolysis rate curve the hydrolysis rate constants emcs f sup of these 23 successful tested samples along with pre determined gsa analysis done by using the src method can now be used to calibrate the university of cape town primary sedimentation unit uctpsu model 4 6 implementation of uctsdm3p for abmp parameter estimation having followed the pe procedures used by botha and ekama 2015 the unbiodegradable fraction of the substrate and the elemental composition of its bpo were determined from the abmp test simulation this was done by using iteration method to achieve the best match between the model predicted and measured abmp test output variable data the compositions determined by the pe see section 4

binf ad hyd and 1 95 for km borg hyd following the experimentally measured hydrolysis rate and predicted rate constants over 60 of the trials gave matching curve trends across the 5 columns and controls samples this means over 60 of the trials from the predictions matched the measured experimental data which is usually the qualitative method used for narrow based calibration procedures however the rigour in the overall calibration procedure is showcased from the observation of good modelling practice that involves performance of a sensitivity analysis prior to this parameter estimation process also the determined f sup showed that larger portion of the settled vss was unbiodegrable and will therefore increase should ps retention time increase the biodegradable vss are the portion of the vss affected by these two kinetic constants hydrolysis rate constant for bpo ps km and half saturation coefficient for bpo ps ks it was observed that the rate constants varied across the trial runs done on the samples and sludge composition not concentration in each trial was reason to have influenced the hydrolysis rates hence the reached findings hydrolysis rate constants f sup and emcs along with the sensitivity analysis can now be consolidated to calibrate the uctpsu model 5 conclusion in a plant wide context the iss under tss under s and vss under s had a minimum coefficient of determination r2 of 0 7 and therefore defined as key variables of the calibrated uctpsu model the key parameters that influenced these three model variables are highlighted in table 6a also the tss components fs up and their elemental mass compositions emcs were categorised in terms of their settling velocity groups and highlighted in table 6b these results are system oriented and not universal as wastewater characteristics universally vary as influenced by sources and human activities the determined fractions of unbiodegradable particulate organic cod f sup slowly declined with the increasing column diameter ranging from 0 6019 to 0 5179 this could possibly mean that upo proportions of tss are lower for the tss with reduced settling velocities and that connotes less dense settleable solids the predicted hydrolysis rate constants for each control and batch test were observed to show similar trends like the experimentally measured rates with negligible error margin these findings when consolidated with the determined uctpsu model variables and key parameters helped to achieve the calibration of the uctpsu model declaration of competing interest the authors

13640,the previous models that replicated primary sedimentation units assumed that all the total settleable solids tss components settled at the same velocities these assumptions resulted in poor predictions of primary sludge characteristics and anaerobic digestion ad model with the accurate knowledge of ps compositions the settled wastewater that leads to the activated sludge as system can be determined using the principles of material mass balance the mass balance is achieved by consolidating the known compositions of raw wastewater and primary sludge ps hereby allow accurate tracking of elements along the entire wrrf when using the model for design and optimised operation of wrrf systems in this investigation the raw wastewater entering the water and resource recovery facility wrrf via the pst is comprehensively characterising the tss the tss was categorised into inorganic settleable solids iss biodegradable particulate organics bpo and unbiodegradable particulate organics upo

wastewater treatment is the removal of excessive organics and nutrients to ensure effluent quality that meets the required environmental criterion 1 2 however the growing population in the globe has led to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant genes pharmaceuticals and heavy metals hereby calling for more efficient wastewater treat plants 3 this connotes that wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been struggling to meet the strict effluent discharge regulations required to protect the regions water resources one of the unit controls in wwtp that can enhance the effluent quality is the primary settling tank pst which reduces the organic loads subsequently fed to the activated sludge the pst performance is therefore vital in achieving the desired effluent specification 4 by reducing the quantity of solids fed to the as systems where the biological conversions of influent sewage occurs moreover the biodegradable organics in ps are often channeled to ad systems where their stabilization process results in the generation of biogas however predicting the recovered resources that correspond to the elemental mass compositions of the digested ps has been the major challenge this is due to the characterization of ps in terms of biodegradable and unbiodegradable particulate as well as inorganic suspended solids is not being achievable through previous pst models to address this challenge a tss based pst model was developed to include correct proportions of upo bpo including the bpo characteristic empirical formula i e x y z a and b of cxhyoznapb and inorganic iss in correct proportions 5 to optimize the performance of pst and its overall impact on wwtp globally shifting paradigms have necessitated re thinking the strategy behind waste treatment processes towards the recovery of water nutrients n and p and energy steady state and dynamic mathematical modelling procedures have been introduced to further improve the pst performance and enhance decision making processes on its operation s√∂temann et al 6 and ekama 7 developed an integrated steady state model for wwtp and included the anaerobic digestion of primary sludge ikumi 8 also established the significant contribution of psts towards the development of waste resource recovery facilities wrrfs by anaerobically digesting the biodegradable organics fed through the pst underflow to the anaerobic digestion ad reactor a wide range of models have been developed through various studies 45 9 47 43 46 10 each model developed has its advantages and disadvantages some models simply made use of retention time with a single variable 47 or address scouring with the hydraulic behavior of the primary clarifier 45 in an empirical fashion other models comprised of combined physical and biological processes 45 43 11 and computational fluid dynamics 12 that were it extremely complex to develop and calibrate hence there is a need to redefine the development of primary settling tank models with the objective of a better wrrf processes description and a holistic plant wide optimization this led to a new generation of promising models using the particle settling velocity theory 48 13 10 however these models were based on total solids removal tss not accounting for the tss composition and how the compositions influence the ad and as biological processes 10 the primary sludge ps has been experimentally revealed to settle in different proportions of 70 80 of the upo 80 90 of the iss and 40 60 of the bpo 14 16 to obtain these proportions it then follows that these components should settle in the pst at different velocities the accurate characterization of ps and settled wastewater in application of plant wide models is essential to simulate strategies for optimization of energy and nutrient recovery from the influent wastewater the objective of this paper is to therefore calibrate the realistic uctpsu model developed by polorigni et al 5 in terms of its measured settling velocity groups by i including bioprocesses of hydrolysis and fermentation ii performance of a parameter determination using experimentally generated data iii determine the fractions of unbiodegradable organics and iv determine the most important uctpsu model output variables and parameters using general sensitivity analysis the research paper hence presents the calibration methodology of a modified pst model in terms of settling velocities tss fractionations and underflow sludge biological processes 2 materials and methods an experimental investigation together with implementation of mathematical modelling was required in this study to achieve the research objectives the three experiments conducted for the study are a settleometer tests b an abmp test to determine the biodegradability and composition of the solids in the different settling velocity groups and c an ad test at steady state conditions ad ss to generate inoculum seed sludge for the abmp experiment the experimental results were analyzed using mathematical modelling procedures these procedures include i non linear regression to determine kinetics of hydrolysis of the sludge degraded during the abmp tests and ii parameter estimation to determine the elemental composition of the biodegradable solids in the sludge collected by the settleometer fig 1 2 1 settleometer description operation and sampling a settleometer fig 2 is a developed instrument that separates influent raw wastewater into suspended particles based on innate settling velocities vs and hence generate the distribution of their settling velocities the design principle for the settleometer was established by moosbrugger et al 17 the apparatus consists of five vertical transparent interconnected plastic tubes made of polyvinyl chloride pvc with equal height 1 m tall and increasing internal diameters 45 2 mm to 134 4 mm operating at a controlled flow rate the fastest settling particles settle in the first column which has the smallest diameter and the highest vs the slowest settling particles settle in the last column with the largest diameter and lowest vs as the vs decreases between the successive columns sludge samples generated from the settling within the columns are divided according to particle size and density 18 prior to operation the settleometer was primed with water to service and ensure maximal operation following this the upflow velocity for each cylinder was calculated by sucking fresh water through the system at flow rates ranging from 0 6 l min to 1 2 l min using eq 1 once the settleometer was proved to be fully functional raw wastewater flowing from the inlet works of potsdam wastewater treatment works pdwwtw in cape town south africa was fed through the settleometer 1 v u p q a i n where q is the input flow rate a i n is the internal cross sectional area of the cylinder v u p is the calculated up flow velocity inside the cylinder two successful runs were conducted under steady state conditions of the settleometer system the collected influent samples for each run procedure were thoroughly mixed and a 5 l sample fetched while the setup was running 1 l sample of the raw wastewater were taken at approximately 20 mins intervals till each run was completed 2 h the effluent wastewater was discharged into a 200 l collection drum and the discharge started just after the influent raw wastewater had flowed through the interconnected 5 pvc columns the effluent flow rate was estimated by recording the time taken for a 3000 ml volumetric flask to fill up a 3000 ml volumetric flask was used in place of the 200 l collection drum to get more accurate timing of the flow rate and verified by repeating the flow rate measurement about 3 times the first run was completed after running the settleometer for 135 mins and the sewage content in each column was emptied into separate 25 l containers the columns were emptied from the largest to the smallest cylinder to prevent supernatant overflow and sludge influx from a larger column to smaller column pipe clamp at the top of each column was loosened while emptying the columns to enhance the discharge of retained wastewater down the column each of the 5 column samples in their receiving containers were thoroughly mixed before being collected into their respective 5 l containers to ensure that all solids are flushed out of the system clean water is pumped through the settleometer until all columns are completely saturated with water altogether 14 samples from the 2 successful settleometer runs were transported to water quality laboratory wql at the university of cape town uct and were stored in the walk in refrigerator cold room maintained at 4 c 2 2 steady state mesophilic anaerobic digestion operation the ad is a completely sealed and continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with a gas outlet and an average operating temperature of 35 c fig 3 as required for mesophilic anaerobic digestion 19 the reactor tank was manufactured from perspex and cylindrical stainless steel rods for structural support to ensure a gas tight seal the ad operating temperature 35 c is controlled by means of heating rods dipped inside the ad reactor and connected to a temperature controller with a temperature probe in the reactor mixed liquor the total volume of the ad reactor tank is 25 l however the operating volume of ad is set at 20 l and the reactor was operated with 20 d sludge age the municipal sludge also contains organically bound nitrogen which during hydrolysis gets released as nh3 and acts as a buffer due to the uptake of hydrogen ions from the aqueous phase resulting in generation of hco3 ikumi 2020 20 further the system was monitored carefully to ensure that the volatile fatty acids generation was not significant and the alkalinity was stable throughout also it was observed that the system stayed methanogenic by checking that methane gas was generated by retaining the acetoclastic methanogens in the ad reactor the in situ ph is measured through its access point and other general tests are done to estimate its volatile fatty acids vfas and alkalinity concentrations the sludge inlet outlet pipe at the base of the ad controlled by a valve is only opened during the feeding process when waste sludge is drawn and feed sludge equivalent to the wasted is added thereby maintaining a flow rate of 1 l d the ad system is fed ps obtained from the underflow of the primary settling tank pst at the potsdam wastewater treatment works pdwwtw this ps is collected in about 50 l batches and stored in the 4 c cold room of the uct wql it is possible for the ps to undergo considerable anaerobic fermentation causing increased short chain fatty acid scfa concentrations even at low temperatures of 4 c to limit the prospect of such characteristic alterations ps storage is limited to a maximum of three months before the slurry ps was fed to the ad it is macerated to reduce its particle size and viscosity the continuously stirred rod in the ad reactor contributed to the fluidity of the macerated ps these prevented blockages in the experimental systems the system was also heated to above 35 c to avoid causing a temperature shock to the temperature sensitive methanogenic biomass the feed microorganism f m ratio for the steady state ad reactor was kept below 0 70 to prevent acidic inhibition this was done by observing low biogas methane yield production and was controlled by dosing the plant with lime the growth rate of the mesophilic organisms used in the ad reactor are shown in table 1 2 3 augmented bio methane potential test the bio methane potential bmp test fig 4 is used to measure the potential yield of biogas from the digestion of organic material in anaerobic batch conditions the augmented bio methane potential abmp test is run the same way as the bmp test but also including few basic measurements of the chemical oxygen demand cod filtered and unfiltered total volatile and inorganic suspended solids tss vss and iss aqueous phase volatile fatty acids vfa h2co3 alkalinity free and saline ammonia fsa concentration orthophosphate op concentration and the ph 21 this shall be in the attempt to characterize the settled raw wastewater particles which has been divided into various settling velocity groups the abmp test uses a transparent glass bottle with a sample placed inside and the produced gas escapes through tubing connected at the top of each bottle and is bubbled through a barrier solution into a measuring cylinder before the start of the test water is sucked into the measuring cylinder using a vacuum pump the gas produced displaces the water volume therefore by measuring the change in water level the volume of gas produced over time by the sample can be determined various methods are being explored to measure the water level in the column continuously however on line measurement using ultrasound and pressure sensors was the method applied in this project this biomass is added to the abmp reactor by a process known as seeding in which a measured sample was drawn from the steady state methanogenic reactor and placed into the abmp reactor vessel at the start of the experiment the test samples collected from the settleometer columns were utilized by the seed inoculum present inside the abmp reactor the control containing ad biomass seed and test containing both biomass seed and substrate abmp reactors were subjected to a long sludge age 40 d in the abmp reactors the initial starting concentrations of the abmp reactor contents were sampled and measured also sample is drawn from each reactor every 24 h for the first 12 d after which a sample is taken every second day this is done to ensure that enough mass remained inside the reactor until the end of the test reaction endpoint will be observed the moment gas production stops 2 4 analytical tests performed on experimental set up analytical tests table 2 were performed on the examined samples collected from the settleometer ad modular reactor and batches of the abmp reactors 2 5 closure the process of generating data that could be used towards calibrating the uctpsu model required linking the settleometer and steady state ad experiments to the abmp experiment the settleometer supplied the test substrates while ad system effluent supplied the cultured seed inoculum to be used in the control abmp reactor these substrates and the seed inoculum in equal proportion were used to determine tss fractionations elemental mass compositions emcs hydrolysis rate constants and the unbiodegradable particulate organic fraction fs up from these integrated experimental systems the data that comprehensively characterizes the ps i e the estimated component settling velocities biodegradability bpo hydrolysis rate constants and bpo elemental composition are used to calibrate the uctpsu model 3 model implementation the uctpsu model was developed as an extension of the uct three phase plant wide model developed in west simulation platform 22 this was done to ensure simulation of the virtual pst within a plant wide context pwm sa 23 the current pwm sa sub models include 1 the asm2 3p model 8 2 the uctsdm3p model 8 24 and 3 the uctpsu model 5 all these unit operation sub models contain the same comprehensive set of model components 25 each component is parameterised based on its cod and molar concentrations the organic components and their various biomass that mediate the biological treatment processes have been allocated parameterized elemental formulations these elemental formulations are based on the varying compositions of the organic components and are therefore included as model parameters for example the x y z a and b of the organic structure cxhyoznapb represents its elemental mass compositions emcs all the model components and parameters were defined and named according to the standard notational framework proposed by corominas et al 26 the three sub models also share the same ionic speciation model of brouckaert et al 27 that includes pairing of ionic components and inter phase transfers of component species this ionic speciation was coded in a separate c file that is linked to the west simulation platform library 28 to initiate the evaluation of the pwm sa model the systematic method proposed by hauduc et al 29 was applied to verify that material cod c h o n p mg k and ca balances were achieved in the determination of all stoichiometric processes contained in the three sub models further description of the models and their current evaluation processes is given below 1 the asm2 3 p model is the activated sludge model no

extension and evaluation are the focus of this paper and are described in the section below 3 1 uctpsu model description the uctpsu model was developed in two phases 1 discrete pst model and 2 flocculent pst model focussing on discrete conditions of a virtual pst the influent settleable solids removals were developed in microsoft excel this was performed for steady state conditions and were aimed at mimicking correct proportions and removals of upo bpo and iss 14 16 using raw and settled wastewater characteristics from wrc 34 and ekama 35 the particle settling velocity distribution psvd concept of bachis et al 10 was adapted to this discrete model the model was verified through strict material mass balances between its inputs and outputs 5 furthermore the simulation results of polorigni et al 2020 matched the given data at steady state these results reflected the percentage removals observed in the experimental studies conducted by 14 15 and ikumi et al 16 towards describing the pst reality the uctpsu model 5 has currently been extended to include two biological processes i hydrolysis and ii fermentation i hydrolysis hydrolysis processes are surface reactions that occur when the slowly biodegradable substrates are enmeshed with facultative organisms hereby providing hydrolytic enzymes 36 30 that breaks it down to fermentable biodegradable soluble organics fso or sf the addition of this process to the uctpsu model involved ensuring that a cod balance is maintained between the reactant bpops or xb inf and the product fso despite its possibility of having different emcs during hydrolysis the release or uptake of carbonates co3 2 ammonia nh4 phosphates po4 3 water h2o and protons h was similarly included by using the principle of strict mass balance for c n p o and h respectively this resulted in the following molar stoichiometry shown in eq 2 the stoichiometric coefficients are multiplied with their component molar masses to convert the equation to mass concentration stoichiometry that is fitting with the units used in the pwm sa model 2 c x p s h y p s o z p s n a p s p b p s g a m p s g a m f z f 3 x f 4 b f z p s 3 x p s 4 b p s h 2 o g a m p

f y f 4 a f g a m p s g a m f h where gamps and gamf are the electron donating capacities for ps and fso respectively the kinetics rate at which this hydrolysis process occurs is modelled using the saturation kinetics formulation eq 3 3 r h y d k m c x b i n f z a d k s c x b i n f z a d z a d g c o d l d the kinetic formulation includes acidogenic biomass concentration zad and a maximum rate of hydrolysis km under conditions of high substrate biomass concentration ratio xb inf zad it is based on the quantity of bpo xb inf attached to the organic biomass active sites whereby the rate of hydrolysis reaches a maximum at saturation of the active sites of the acidogens the ks parameter is the substrate and acidogenic biomass concentration ratio at which the specific hydrolysis rate is half its upper limit km at saturation hence the kinetic constants km and ks must be determined experimentally to use the above process formulations ii fermentation the fermentation process is modelled to involve the conversion of fermentable biodegradable soluble organics fso to acetate svfa accompanied with the release of excess nutrients n and p like the hydrolysis process a cod mass balance is observed such that the cod of fso used is equitable to the cod of acetate generated thereafter the co3 2 nh4 po4 3 h2o and h produced are determined using c n p o and h mass balances respectively over the stoichiometric reaction the molar stoichiometric process is as shown by the eq 4 below 4 c x f h y f o z f n a f p b f g a m f 64 y h c h 3 c o o a f n h 4 b f p o 4 3 x f 2 g a m f 64 c o 3 2 z f

constants of ad sludge hydrolysis with sbpe zad and rhyd calculated for each time interval the hydrolysis rate kinetic constants eq 6 was obtained through non linear regression methods 37 this was achieved via the utilization of curve fitting software r studio software 6 r h y d k m s b p z a d k s s b p z a d z a d g cod l d the model to be fitted the saturation hydrolysis kinetic formulation and the model parameters to be estimated km and ks values are first specified thereafter the r software determines the best parameter values by calculating fitted values for all the data points of the fitting regression model together with the residuals such that the minimum residual sum of squares is obtained from this process the kinetic rate constants that would provide the closest predictions are selected for application to the ad reactor once the kinetic constants have been determined the calibrated hydrolysis rate equation can be applied to calculate the residual biodegradable organics at a given time sbp t 3 3 determination of control and test masses prior to parameter estimation the uctsdm3p model was used to simulate a virtual replica of the abmp test as shown by gaszynski et al 38 the abmp test that virtually replicates the ones run experimentally are simulated these experiments include the control with inoculum only sample and test with both inoculum and organics samples the volume of seed and substrate used in the abmp test for both main and duplicate samples were recorded prior to calculating the control and test masses to be initialized for parameter estimation the test simulation is subsequent to the control to allow for the initial parameters i e the determined emc values of cxhyoznapb to be determined from the control simulation prior to the test abmp simulation performance of pe using the actual test output data allows for determination of the hydrolysis rate and composition of the feed organics like the actual bmp test procedure the difference in methane production or cod removal by the test and control simulations is attributed to the organics in the feed 3 4 parameter estimation for abmp experiment parameter estimation is a process that compares the experimentally measured variables with the corresponding model predicted variables until the observed experimental data is achieved at the same time steps to find a composition that better fits the observed experimental data parameter estimation pe was conducted on a virtual abmp experimental reactor that was simulated using the uctsdm3p model therefore the observed experimental data from the abmp experiments were set as the objective variables for the parameter estimation procedure the parameters that were used as the unknowns were the h o n and p terms of the biodegradable particulate organics in the pss five known variables were set as the simulation objectives i e the total cod fsa op vss and the h2co3 alk concentrations the pe tool in west software ran hundreds of iterations until the correct combination of parameters that achieved the desired results with the lowest error was determined 3 5 global sensitivity analysis gsa using standard regression coefficient src method the gsa was performed using the standardised regression coefficients src method the theory behind this method and its results was based on the objectives proposed by neumann 39 hence src method was performed to identify significant parameters and highlight those required for experimental determination as it relates to uctpsu model the selected uctpsu model output variables are iss under out x b inf out x iss out x u inf out x vss tss under s under x b inf under x u inf under x vss and vss under s the mode of selection for these variables was subject to steady state condition to estimate the uncertainties of the tss fractionations iss upo and bpo at different locations in the uctpsu model the values specified for each of the uctpsu model parameters were determined using the method proposed by brun et al 40 4 results and discussions 4 1 standard regression coefficient src results using neumann 39 proposed interpretation the analysed parameters were classified into kinetics process rate parameters and stoichiometric the discussion of the src results will be centred on the uctpsu model parameters whose coefficient of determination r2 exceeds 0 7 this implies that for the given virtual experiment other non influential parameters can be placed anywhere within their value range without causing any significant change in the variable outputs table 3 gives a summary of the influential parameters on each of the selected model variables showing their corresponding coefficients r2 for the most and the least important parameters of the uctpsu selected variables mean kinetic sum stoichiometry sum standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation the results show that the relevant uctpsu model output variables and the model parameters identified to be of importance include i inorganic settleable solids in the underflow ii sub component total settleable solids in the underflow and iii sub component volatile settleable solids in the underflow i inorganic settleable solids in the underflow iss under fig 5 a shows how iss under has various important model parameters that affect its output in decreasing order of influence the identified key parameters are stoichiometric and positively influence the model output variable iss under these parameters are vs s x iss 1 vs s x iss 3 alpha i vs s x iss 4 vs s x iss 2 vs s x iss 5 beta i and gamma i the vs s x iss 2 parameter out of the 5 sub components iss settling velocities shows to have retained more iss under however there is no clear cut explanation on why vs s x iss 1 the lowest settling velocity was of less significance also x t i o xuorg mol perc and alpha b add up to the important parameters that influence iss under with more focus on x t as the significant parameter with the most negative influence intuitively it can be established that certain tss concentration must be set below which possibly retained iss under will reduce this can be practically influenced by the wastewater source and pst operating conditions on site ii sub component total settleable solids in the underflow tss under s the settling velocity groups for influent biodegradable particulate organics in sub components 3 5 vs s x b inf 3 vs s x b inf 4 and vs s x b inf 5 are highlighted as the top parameters that positively affect tss under s however the 5th sub component which had the largest settling velocity vs s x b inf 5 was the most significant these parameters are stoichiometric and inform more on careful parameter setting in the uctpsu model it implies that the largest tss under s is achieved at a settling velocity that does not disrupt the settling of tss at the pst underflow fig 5b it also infers that tss concentration decreased as the settling velocities decreased from sub components 5 to 3 iii sub component volatile settleable solids in the underflow vss under s kinetic parameters are indicated to grossly influence the vss under s model output variable these parameters are hydrolysis rate constants of biomass km borg ad hyd influent biodegradable particulate organics km binf ad hyd and fermentable soluble organics kh f ad hyd when km borg ad hyd is high it means the hydrolysis of the bio organics will be slow since little inherent organisms initially existed see fig 5c this hydrolyzing organism readily sequesters the fermentable soluble but slowly hydrolyze bpo ps the biomass also facilitates the tracking of the ad products including biogas production soluble components orthophosphate fsa and h2co3 alk and charge produced the biomass death and degradation has also been modelled to occur via death regeneration 16 4 2 settleometer results the influent wastewater density was fractionated and settling velocities reduced across the settleometer system from 54 41 m h to 5 82 m h the percentage sludge mass tss retained in each column appeared to reduce from second column to the last largest column but was not consistent as the 3rd column retained tss lower than the 4th column however for vss and iss masses it was observed to record consistent increment except in column 5 the determined cod tkn tp tss and vss mass balance are consistent and within the acceptable range 80 120 fig 6 a b can be described to show the settling profile of the sludge at different hydraulic settling velocities 4 3 steady state anaerobic digestion ad system results as a source of the required seed inoculum for the proposed abmp test the operated steady state ad system provided the average measured data for the ad system this data was necessary to determine the characteristics of the seed inoculum used for the abmp test table 4 4 4 augmented bio methane potential abmp test results the abmp reactors ran for 52 days after which there was no further biogas production and the only organics left in the test batches are unbiodegradable particulate organics upo a naming configuration was applied to simplify discussion by representing each column and its duplicate with alpha numeric symbols such as t1a and t1b where t means test 1 means pvc poly vinyl chloride column number with sample a and duplicate b high cod removal trend was observed from control reactors up to the pvc column 2 reactors the fsa concentration measured from 0 to 52 d increased this fsa increment implies the release of the organic n bound in the substrates fbso and bpo as fsa during the substrate digestion process at the 1st day of digestion op concentration increased from inoculum batch to the last test batch pvc column 5 samples and subsequently reduced the organic bound p for pss bio organics are usually very small resulting in a low chance of accurately capturing the release trend therefore molar p fraction in sewage is assumed to be zero due to its low values the measured iss concentration was found to be internally consistent per sample type also the iss concentration difference with respect to the inoculum sample was observed to be less than 350 mg l except for pvc column 4 sample that recorded the highest iss concentration this implies that the settling velocity in pvc column 4 settled more iss proportions the trend line in fig 7 a shows that the fraction of unbiodegradable particulate organic cod f sup slowly declines with the increased column diameter this could possibly mean that upo proportions of tss are lower for the tss with reduced settling velocities the tss fractionations iss upo and bpo was calculated in percentage to show the proportions represented in each pvc columns of settleometer device table 5a and 5b it shows the proportions of tss components in each pvc columns with upo and iss components respectively having the largest and smallest proportion although the settling velocity does not assert if there is meant to be a clear cut increase or decrease in tss components from pvc columns 1 5 however the computed tss proportion can be accepted to imitate a real primary settling tank in terms of settling tss components 4 5 parameter estimation pe for abmp experiments results the pe procedure was implemented using the tools in west simulation software the virtually replicated abmp reactors were simulated using the uctsdm3p model for hundreds of iterations until the correct combination of parameters that achieved the desired results with the lowest error was determined the results from this pe process indicate that the calculated n composition in the organics appeared accurate since both the generated alkalinity and the released ammonia in the experiment increased fig 8 a b the drop in the measured ammonia concentration in the abmp control experiment may be due to experimental error such as a new mixture of boric acid or a different normality of the acid used for titration the op release is not well predicted as the chosen p value appears too low fig 8c the simulated vss concentration utilized during the experiment appears to match the observed change in vss relatively well fig 8d as predicted due to the gas measurement error associated with the experimental bmp the simulated ch4 release was higher than the observed ch4 release fig 8e besides the vfa s inconsistent trend its accumulation did not match the observed abmp data well the rate can be adjusted in the abmp model and inputted back into the steady state model to check for consistency the worst prediction of the abmp simulation was the operating ph fig 8f the simulated ph dropped far below the observed ph values this indicated that the elemental composition determined was incorrect this issue was resolved by conducting a parameter estimation on the abmp control reactor such that a new elemental composition that matched the measured data was determined the same procedures followed for the abmp control experiment were relatively applied to the abmp test experiment except for two differences unlike in the control experiments where the equivalent of actual concentrations is used the whole concentration for each of the variables is used up also since the mixture of both control and test samples will be required for the abmp test the actual substrate concentration at time t 0 is estimated by subtracting the equivalent biomass variables from the test batches also at time t 0 for example initial condition time t 0 h cod biomass inoculum concentration in control batch 1 6720 mgcod l cod test concentration in test batch 1 i e in pvc 1a 16 900 mgcod l cod substrate in test batch 1 cod test cod biomass concentration 10 180 mgcod l similar calculations were done per time steps as observed in the tables from time 0 h to desired end time and that was how the actual variable concentrations across all the pvc columns 1 5 were determined except for the ph values fig 9 a c below also show the plots of the experimentally determined versus predicted hydrolysis rate curve the hydrolysis rate constants emcs f sup of these 23 successful tested samples along with pre determined gsa analysis done by using the src method can now be used to calibrate the university of cape town primary sedimentation unit uctpsu model 4 6 implementation of uctsdm3p for abmp parameter estimation having followed the pe procedures used by botha and ekama 2015 the unbiodegradable fraction of the substrate and the elemental composition of its bpo were determined from the abmp test simulation this was done by using iteration method to achieve the best match between the model predicted and measured abmp test output variable data the compositions determined by the pe see section 4 5 for the biodegradable particulate organics in control sample and each settleometer column samples are c2 193h7o0 440n0 215p0 029 c2 883h7o1 870n0 372p0 0701 c2 909h7o1 843n0 339p0 0004 c2 834h7o1 841n0 286p0 00001 c2 868h7o1 850n0 312p0 00053 c2 881h7o1 848n0 291p0 094 the default values for hydrolysis rate constants used in the model development tool west are 10 for kh f ad hyd 2 004 for km binf ad hyd and 1 95 for km borg hyd following the experimentally measured hydrolysis rate and predicted rate constants over 60 of the trials gave matching curve trends across the 5 columns and controls samples this means over 60 of the trials from the predictions matched the measured experimental data which is usually the qualitative method used for narrow based calibration procedures however the rigour in the overall calibration procedure is showcased from the observation of good modelling practice that involves performance of a sensitivity analysis prior to this parameter estimation process also the determined f sup showed that larger portion of the settled vss was unbiodegrable and will therefore increase should ps retention time increase the biodegradable vss are the portion of the vss affected by these two kinetic constants hydrolysis rate constant for bpo ps km and half saturation coefficient for bpo ps ks it was observed that the rate constants varied across the trial runs done on the samples and sludge composition not concentration in each trial was reason to have influenced the hydrolysis rates hence the reached findings hydrolysis rate constants f sup and emcs along with the sensitivity analysis can now be consolidated to calibrate the uctpsu model 5 conclusion in a plant wide context the iss under tss under s and vss under s had a minimum coefficient of determination r2 of 0 7 and therefore defined as key variables of the calibrated uctpsu model the key parameters that influenced these three model variables are highlighted in table 6a also the tss components fs up and their elemental mass compositions emcs were categorised in terms of their settling velocity groups and highlighted in table 6b these results are system oriented and not universal as wastewater characteristics universally vary as influenced by sources and human activities the determined fractions of unbiodegradable particulate organic cod f sup slowly declined with the increasing column diameter ranging from 0 6019 to 0 5179 this could possibly mean that upo proportions of tss are lower for the tss with reduced settling velocities and that connotes less dense settleable solids the predicted hydrolysis rate constants for each control and batch test were observed to show similar trends like the experimentally measured rates with negligible error margin these findings when consolidated with the determined uctpsu model variables and key parameters helped to achieve the calibration of the uctpsu model declaration of competing interest the authors

13641,ozone based microbubble aided technology has been gaining popularity as a new potential alternative method for the oxidation of organic pollutants present in water wastewater in this work the potential of the ozone microbubbles ombs for the oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was investigated and the results were compared with those of the conventional ozone millibubbles omlbs keeping constant other operational parameters the omlbs needed a longer time for complete removal of dmso and hence a higher consumption of ozone took place therefore a higher stoichiometric ratios of ozone

improved the oxidation of dmso by enhancing the formation of oh conversely a large dosage of h2o2 had a negative effect the degradation of dmso to methane sulfonic acid msa was achieved via two paths

diverse technologies for meeting the ever increasing human needs have led to the emergence of new pollutants in the effluent streams of the process industries conventional wastewater treatment wwt methods are not effective in degrading such persistent emerging pollutants 1 2 new technologies have been developed in the last couple of decades to degrade such contaminants due to the inadequacies of the conventional wastewater treatment methods ozone which has a high redox potential i e 2 07 v is known for its considerable potential for water and wastewater treatments wwwt since it is a potent eco friendly i e residue free oxidant 3 4 it can react with several organic chemicals except a few which react very slowly with molecular ozone e g chloro alkanes 5 for those chemicals more effective advanced oxidation processes aops are used some of which consist of a combination of single oxidants and involve the generation of the hydroxyl radicals oh the oh is a powerful and nonselective oxidant with a high redox potential i e 2 80 v 6 and reacts with several organic compounds 7 it has been reported by various researchers 8 9 that ozonation in the wwwt systems is controlled by mass transfer transfer of sparingly soluble ozone to water 10 11 is a very important step in the wwwt reactors such as the bubble column reactors usually ozone is introduced into the reactor as a dilute mixture in oxygen because of their less ability to dissolve ozone in water 11 the millibubbles used in the conventional ozonation reactors require a substantial amount of ozone which requires high energy consumption 12 14 microbubbles can offer an alternative to the conventional millibubbles as they improve the solubility of ozone in water and decrease its loss 15 16 a small amount of ozone is sufficient to produce a large number of microbubbles that are capable of oxidizing the organic pollutants present in water 17 the dissolved ozone in the dispersion of ozone microbubbles ombs generates oh that effectively decomposes the organic molecules 18 in the omb system the oh are formed by the self shrinkage and collapse of the microbubbles 17 19 and by the self decomposition of ozone to the oh due to the negative surface charge of the microbubbles 20 21 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is a widely used detergent and photoresist stripping solvent in semiconductor manufacturing and liquid crystal displays its suitable solvent property stability and water miscibility have increased its industrial use as a result of these numerous applications wastewater containing large dmso quantities is released from several industries 22 23 degradation of dmso by the conventional biological methods is known to be difficult because of the odor problems caused by intermediate products such as dimethyl sulfide dms methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide which makes it difficult to carry out the treatment process 24 incubation of activated sludge with the dmso concentration in the range of 0 013 0 128 mol m 3 produces the odorous dms gas at concentrations exceeding the odor threshold by approximately four orders of magnitude 23 the annual worldwide industrial production of dmso is about 5 107 kilograms 25 cheng et al 26 have reported that the amount of dmso discharged from the industry can exceed the handling capacity of the wastewater treatment plants this could result in the canned corn like odor when the dmso concentration exceeds 0 5 mg dm 3 in the incoming wastewater the maximum allowable concentration of dmso in the discharge wastewater set by the united states environmental protection agency is less than 0 05 mg dm 3 27 the conventional biological treatment methods are not effective to remove dmso to a reasonable extent scientists in their effort to develop a cost efficient treatment of wastewater containing dmso have studied a combination of conventional biological processes and the aops dmso is oxidized promptly by chemical oxidation such as the aops and becomes dimethyl sulfone dmso2 i e ch3 2 so2 as shown by eq 1 28 1 c h 3 so c h 3 o c h 3 s o 2 c h 3 in this oxidation process no noxious compound is generated nevertheless an additional method is needed to oxidize the dmso2 further due to its stability against chemical oxidation ozone based aops such as o3 uv and o3 h2o2 and photochemical degradation i e uv h2o2 have been reported as effective methods for dmso removal 2 28 29 in the photochemical degradation uv h2o2 system first dmso is decomposed to methane sulfonic acid msa by the oh generated in situ and the msa is further degraded easily by conventional biological treatment without producing any noxious intermediate gases 28 oxidation of dmso by oh primarily gives methane sulfonic acid 30 dmso is very stable in pure water or in solutions containing h2o2 and it reacts very rapidly with oh k 4 5 109 dm3 mol 1 s 1 31 treatment of organic compounds with uv irradiation in large scale is disadvantageous due to their quite high cost the feasibility of the fenton oxidation process was studied for the removal of dmso from aqueous solutions 32 a fluidized bed fenton process was reported as an effective method for the degradation of dmso in synthetic wastewater 27 wu et al 22 have proposed a combination of hydrogen peroxide and goethite a heterogeneous catalyst as an alternative for the expensive fenton type degradation of dmso lee et al 33 have demonstrated a streamer corona discharge process which produced locally concentrated oh for the oxidative degradation of dmso and reported a high efficiency for dmso removal albeit less toc reduction fig s1 shows the comparison of some aops for the degradation and mineralization of dmso in water wastewater 2 24 29 34 from these works it is observed that the removal of dmso could be achieved through most of aops nevertheless the rate of mineralization of dmso was too slow and it required long oxidation times therefore more efficient methods are required for faster mineralization of dmso recently ozone based microbubble aided technology has been gaining popularity as a new potential alternative method for purification of water wastewater for instance ombs have been used for degradation of phenol 9 35 atrazine 20 benzo a pyrene and toxicity reduction 36 decolorization of practical textile wastewater 37 sludge solubilization 19 removal of residual

high concentration acid plasticizer wastewater 47 and petrochemical wastewater 14 48 li et al 49 have reported that dmso could be oxidized into msa by the ombs without producing any noxious sulfur containing by product they have suggested that the stimulant enhanced ozonation is an effective treatment method for the dmso containing wastewater their result has shown that the reaction between dmso and ozone is mass transfer controlled and the experimental results fitted the first order reaction model in general the hydroxyl radicals are believed to be the main oxidizing species in the aops which are responsible for the decomposition of the pollutants the free radicals generated in situ provide efficient degradation and they are responsible for the decomposition of dmso into biodegradable intermediates the present work is aimed to investigate the potential of the ombs for the oxidation of dmso in detail and compare the results with those of the conventional ozonation process using millibubbles i e omlbs the main operational parameters that influence the removal of dmso have been studied ozone utilization and the stoichiometric ratio of ozone consumed to dmso removed were computed and compared formation and depletion of the two main oxidation intermediates of dmso i e dmso2 and msa were investigated for both ombs and omlbs the overall kinetic parameters such as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient the rate constant of the reaction between dmso and ozone and the enhancement factor have been computed from the experimental results and the results have been compared 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals used dmso 99 purity dmso2 99 5 purity and msa 98 purity were obtained from alfa aesar england hydrochloric acid 35 purity hydrogen peroxide 50

oxygen from air generation of ozone and its destruction and controlling the temperature of the aqueous solution within the reactor were the same as that for the ombs the oxygen was concentrated from the air by the pressure swing adsorption technique 50 51 this oxygen was sent to the ozone generator which converted oxygen to ozone by the corona discharge method 52 a rotameter 1114c instrumentation engineers pvt ltd india was used to measure the flow rate of the gas mixture coming out of the ozone generator its range was 8 80 cm3 s 1 as shown in fig 1 the gas mixture coming out from the ozone

whose ion content was negligibly low there was no significant difference in the results obtained by using the filtered tap water and the milli q water thus the effect of the ions present in the filtered tap water was negligible to affect the ozonation reactions 2 3 analysis methods to determine the optimum wavelength for uv detection in the ultra fast liquid chromatography uflc the uv vis

207 nm 185 s and 450 Œºmol m 3 respectively the standard deviation of the retention time was less than 5 s the toc of the samples before and during the ozonation were monitored by using a toc analyzer aurora 1030 o i analytical usa the toc standards for calibration were prepared from high purity potassium hydrogen phthalate for every new experiment the toc content of the filtered tap water was checked the toc varied within the range of 0 1 to 0 7 mg dm 3 these values were subtracted from the respective toc readings of the samples and the corrected values are reported concentrations of the two major oxidation intermediates of dmso i e msa and dmso2 in the aqueous samples were measured by a gas chromatograph 450 gc bruker germany equipped with a cp sil 8 cb 60 m 0 32 mm 0 45 mm column

the flow rate of 170 mm3 s 1 the filament temperature was 323 k with the limit of 663 k the oven temperature was in the range of 323 493 k with ramping at 0 17 k s calibration curves were plotted from known standard solutions of the compounds for the quantitative determination a colorimeter c 105 eutech singapore was used to monitor the dissolved ozone concentration in the reactor using the ozone specific reagent i e dpd method 42 53 54 the excess ozone coming out of the reactor was monitored for selected experimental conditions to determine the stoichiometry of the ozone consumed and dmso oxidized by using the iodometric method 55 56 then it was sent to the ozone destructor ozone traps containing 20 g dm 3 ki solution were used as per the standard procedure 55 the standardized 10 mol m

medium was 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 determinations of stoichiometric ratio and ozone utilization efficiency ozone consumption and ozone utilization efficiency are the vital parameters for evaluating the oxidation performance of the ozone based aops these parameters need to be determined and optimized for high ozone utilization that would involve high mass transfer of ozone and a large amount of generation of oh from the mass balance the amount of ozone absorbed during ozonation which refers to the total ozone transferred to the aqueous solution per unit reactor volume can be determined from eq 2 58 2 o 3 abs 0 t d v g o 3 v r o 3 o 3 eff o 3 res dt in our experimental setup all parameters in the integral of eq 2 can be directly determined at the desired ozonation time t d accordingly eq 2 can be integrated and o 3 abs can be computed from eq 3 59 3 o 3 abs o 3 o 3 eff o 3 res v g o 3 t d v r 4 o 3 v g o 3 1 m œÅ v r t d 5 v g o 3 g o 3 r t p 1 m the stoichiometric ratio of moles of the ozone consumed per mole of dmso removed during the reaction can be presented as a function of the dmso removed at the desired ozonation time the stoichiometric ratio s r at t d was computed by using eq 6 6 s r o 3 abs dmso rem for both ombs and omlbs eq 6 computes the stoichiometric ratio for the complete removal of dmso at different ph of the medium and the values are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively for dmso 0 1 5 mol m 3 the values of s r were 0 056 0 055 and 0 049 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively for the ombs on the other hand the corresponding values of s r for the omlbs were 0 648 0 481 and 0 335 at the same initial concentration of dmso from these results it is apparent that the ozone consumption was ten times lower for the ombs the higher values of s r for the omlbs could be due to the long ozonation time required to achieve complete removal of dmso in such extended ozonation processes ozone may be consumed by the oxidation intermediates of dmso resulting in a higher value of s r for the ombs the ozonation time required for the complete removal of dmso was in the range of 0 72 1 8 ks whereas the same was in the range of 3 24 7 2 ks for the omlbs the ombs enhanced the mass transfer of ozone since the oxidation of dmso took place in the aqueous phase a higher concentration of ozone facilitated the oxidation of dmso therefore the ombs played a significant role in lowering the value of s r the effectiveness of both processes was further investigated by determining the utilization efficiency of ozone Œ∑u from eq 7 based on the mass balance of ozone in the gas and liquid phases 7 Œ∑ u o 3 abs o 3 100 the values of Œ∑ u are summarized in tables 1 and 2 the range of ozone utilization efficiency for complete removal of dmso by the ombs i e 65 9 79 1 is substantially higher than that for the omlbs i e 27 8 48 4 from these results it is clear that the ombs considerably improved the utilization of ozone by enhancing its mass transfer in the aqueous solution and forming the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals the values of the ozone utilization efficiency obtained in this work for the ombs are in accordance with those reported by li et al 49 as the microbubbles enhanced mass transfer more than that by the millibubbles the omb process is anticipated to improve the oxidation of dmso and its intermediates at the same time the amount of ozone required for oxidation and the loss of ozone could be reduced significantly by the ombs 3 2 effects of initial concentration of dmso and ogr on the removal of dmso both the initial concentration of dmso and ogr which is equivalent to the concentration of ozone in the feed gas had a significant effect on the removal of dmso by the ombs and omlbs it is observed from fig 3 that increase in the dmso 0 from 0 5 to 2 5 mol m 3 had a negative effect on its removal by both the ombs and omlbs for both systems as the dmso 0 was increased the concentration of dissolved ozone in the solution decreased resulting in the decrease of the molar ratio of ozone to dmso furthermore it is also apparent that the concentration of the oxidative intermediates increased with the increasing dmso 0 which resulted in a higher consumption of the ozone present in the aqueous medium as shown in tables 1 and 2 as well as the oh consequently the rate of removal of dmso was slowed at ph 7 and ogr of 1 67 mg s 1 when the dmso 0 increased from 0 5 to 2 5 mol m 3 the stoichiometric ratio of moles of ozone consumed to dmso removed increased from 0 055 to 0 082 for the ombs and from 0 469 to 0 779 for the omlbs see tables 1 and 2 nevertheless as the dmso 0 increased the utilization efficiency of ozone was improved for both the omb and omlb processes kusvuran and yildirim 60 have reported a similar trend for the conventional ozonation of bisphenol a the stoichiometric ratio of bisphenol a removed to ozone consumed increased with increasing initial concentration of bisphenol a on the other hand increase in the ogr from 0 56 to 2 78 mg s 1 profoundly enhanced the oxidation of dmso for both the ombs and omlbs fig 4 this is expected because an increase in the ogr increased the concentration of dissolved ozone in the solution 2 49 which either oxidized the dmso directly or produced the oh which reacted with dmso and its oxidative intermediates similar results were reported by li et al 49 and wu et al 2 3 3 effects of the ph of the medium and reactions with the hydroxyl radicals the ph of the medium has a substantial role on ozone decomposition and its stability in the solution which can affect the ozonation of organic pollutants and their oxidation by products 46 61 experiments were conducted with both the ombs and omlbs in the ph range of 5 9 from fig 5 a it is observed that the variation in the ph had a rather trivial effect on the oxidation of dmso by the ombs slight improvements were observed at ph 5 and 9 as compared to ph 7 the removal of dmso was slightly increased with the ph of the solution for the omlbs the decrease in the ph of the medium during the course of ozonation as shown in fig 5 b could be due to the formation of acidic intermediates chou and chang 62 have reported a similar decrease in ph with time during the oxidation of dmso by conventional ozonation this finding also corroborates the works of chu et al 37 chen et al 63 and zhang et al 64 who have reported similar trends for the ozonation of textile wastewater by the microbubbles oxidation of dimethyl phthalate by conventional ozonation and degradation of 17Œ± ethinylestradiol by conventional ozonation respectively all have concluded that the decrease in ph during ozonation was due to the production of intermediates containing acidic substances the decrease in the ph of the solutions was more pronounced for the omlb process to examine the effect of the indirect oxidation of dmso by the oh experiments were conducted by using h2o2 which is a promoter for this reaction for oxidation of dmso by the ombs the optimal ratio of h 2 o 2 dmso 0 was 1 0 1 3 the removal efficiency did not change if the h2o2 concentration was lower but it decreased if the concentration was higher fig 6 a these observations signify that the contribution of oh from h2o2 was insignificant as compared to the existing concentration of oh in the aqueous medium when the concentration of h2o2 was low on the other hand when the latter was high the available oh was consumed by the reaction with h2o2 itself 28 this result is in agreement with the previous works 28 and corroborate our earlier works on the removal of diethyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate by the ombs 43 44 for the omlbs the h 2 o 2 dmso 0 ratio was 1 2 a similar trend was observed for the high concentration of h2o2 fig 6 b however a low concentration of h2o2 had also shown a positive effect on the removal of dmso therefore for 1 5 mol m 3 dmso a dosage of 0 3 mol m 3 h2o2 had a positive effect on the removal of dmso for the omlb system further increase of the dosage of h2o2 had a negative effect on the oxidation efficiency of dmso similar to that observed for the ombs experiments were also conducted with t buoh which is a well known oh inhibitor the rate constant for the reaction of t buoh with ozone is extremely small i e 3 10 3 mol 1 dm3 s 1 as compared to that with oh i e 6 108 mol 1 dm3 s 1 65 thus the presence of t buoh in the aqueous solution has substantially hinders the reactivity of oh towards dmso and its oxidation intermediates fig 7 depicts the contribution of oh on the oxidation of dmso and its reaction intermediates by both ombs and omlbs at ph 5 and 9 from fig 7 a it can be observed that the contribution of oh was significant at ph 5 and 9 for the ombs however its effect was rather trivial for the omlbs at ph 5 while some effect was noticed at ph 9 the significant and insignificant effects of oh at ph 5 for the ombs and omlbs respectively imply that the formation of oh was enhanced by the microbubbles and hardly any oh was generated by the omlbs at this ph 3 4 formation and depletion of oxidation intermediates of dmso the formation and decay of the two major oxidative intermediates of dmso were monitored for the experimental condition of dmso 0 1 5 mol m 3 ogr 1 67 mg s 1 and ph 9 it was observed that dmso2 was formed during both the processes fig 8 nevertheless the concentration of dmso2 formed by the ombs was very less and it started depleting after reaching the peak concentration at about 1 8 ks of ozonation time in contrary to this for the omlbs dmso2 started forming late i e after 1 2 ks of ozonation time and its concentration went on increasing for more than 5 4 ks of ozonation time besides the simultaneous formation of msa was observed for the ombs after about 600 s of ozonation time which went on increasing until the formation of dmso2 reached its maximum and then its concentration started depleting slowly this shows that msa was more resistant to the ombs and needed a longer reaction time to be removed totally it has been reported 28 30 that dmso could be directly decomposed to msa by the oh in the aops where oxidation mainly takes place through the reaction with the oh and the msa could be further degraded easily by the conventional biological treatment without generating any harmful reaction intermediate for the omlbs formation of msa was not detected the proposed oxidation mechanism in the omlb system is shown in fig 9 b this route i e the oxidation of dmso by conventional ozonation as per eq 1 is in agreement with the work of chou and chang 62 from our experimental results it is evident that the msa was formed through two paths in the omb system fig 9 a the first path is the prompt conversion of dmso to msa by the reaction with oh without formation of the intermediate dmso2 the other path is via the formation of dmso2 by the oxidation of dmso by molecular ozone followed by further oxidation of dmso2 to msa by the oh present in the solution as shown in fig 9 a microbubbles promoted the self decomposition of ozone to the oh due to their negative surface charge as a result of the hydroxyl ions accumulating at the microbubble surface which promoted the self decomposition of ozone and formed the oh 20 besides oh were also generated by the self shrinkage and collapse of the microbubbles 17 19 the path of self decomposition of ozone in the millibubble system is different from that of the microbubble system due to the instability of ozone it quickly decomposed to oxygen and a small amount of oh was formed when the solution was highly alkaline the amount of oh formed was less for the millibubble system 3 5 extent of mineralization of dmso by ombs and omlbs in order to assess the efficiency of the ombs and omlbs towards the degradation of dmso and their respective extents of mineralization the ozonation was studied at different ph of the aqueous solution fig 10 a depicts the toc removal profiles by both ozonation processes as a function of ozonation time at different ph of the medium for the ombs it was observed that the toc removal was slightly more favorable at ph 5 as compared to ph 7 and 9 fig 10 a this can be attributed to the favorable oxidation of the intermediates in the acidic medium this possibility was checked by separately carrying out the oxidation of dmso2 in water by the ombs at ph 5 and 9 fig 10 b depicts that the oxidation of dmso2 was slightly more favored at ph 5 than at ph 9 moreover a huge difference between the removal rates of dmso and its corresponding toc were observed particularly for the omlbs for the omlbs after 2 16 ks of ozonation the removal of dmso was 62 5 70 4 and 78 4 at ph 5 7 and 10 respectively and the corresponding toc removal were 1 9 5 5 and 8 9 fig 10 c the better dmso removal efficiencies as compared to the corresponding toc removal at all ph show that the oxidation of dmso could be achieved via the direct oxidation by the ozone molecules in contrast toc reduction i e further oxidation of the reaction intermediates was mainly achieved through the indirect oxidation by the oh the low toc reduction at all ph suggests that the available concentration of the oh was not enough to degrade the intermediates produced during the ozonation of dmso the overall removal efficiency of dmso in the alkaline solution was better than that in the acidic solution for the omlbs these results corroborate the literature 2 in the conventional ozonation the chain reactions leading to the decomposition of ozone to the oh are not favorable in the acidic medium whereas oh are favorably generated in the alkaline medium 5 66 in general direct reaction with the ozone molecule is known to occur under acidic conditions and in the presence of radical scavengers that inhibit the chain reactions responsible for the decomposition of ozone to the reactive oh 67 69 in the alkaline medium or in the presence of solutes that promote radical type chain reaction and formation of oh the indirect reaction predominates due to the extremely rapid and indiscriminate nature of the oh 67 furthermore the contribution of oh on the toc removal was further investigated by using a promoter h2o2 and an inhibitor t buoh of the oh coupling h2o2 with both the ozonation systems i e ombs and omlbs had a significant effect on the toc reduction by augmenting the generation of oh however the impact was more pronounced for the omlbs fig 11 a the addition of the oh scavenger i e t buoh also proved that the indirect reaction was the main pathway for the mineralization of dmso and its oxidative intermediates fig 11 b the effectiveness of the four processes i e sole omlbs omlbs coupled with h2o2 sole ombs and ombs coupled with h2o2 was compared in terms of the dmso removal and the extent of mineralization a long ozonation time i e 5 4 ks was considered for comparison at this extended ozonation time all four processes were equally effective for the complete removal of dmso nevertheless a wide variation was observed in terms of the toc removal fig 11 c the sole omlb process exhibited a very poor efficiency for toc removal whereas the sole omb process was more effective for toc removal than the omlb h2o2 process 3 6 overall kinetics for the oxidation of dmso by the ombs in the semi batch reactor of our experimental setup ozone was supplied continuously during the entire ozonation it gradually dissolved in water and reacted with dmso eq 8 expresses the kinetics of the reaction between dmso and ozone 8 d dmso d t k dmso m o 3 n during the oxidation of dmso by the ombs the overall mass balance of ozone contains three terms i e the rate of reaction of dmso with ozone directly and indirectly the rate of mass transfer of ozone from the gas to the liquid phase and the first order self decomposition of ozone for the reactor of our experimental setup the self decomposition of ozone in water depended on the ph of the medium and it followed a first order kinetics 44 which is in agreement with the literature 70 72 in such a system where ozone gradually dissolves in the aqueous solution simultaneously undergoes self decomposition and reacts with dmso eq 9 gives the general mass balance 9 d o 3 d t k l a k d o 3 ss o 3 k dmso m o 3 n the polymath version 6 10 which employs the runge kutta method was used to solve the two simultaneous odes i e eqs 8 and 9 the best fit values r 2 0 98 of the kinetic parameters obtained by fitting the experimental data are presented in table 3 the fit of the kinetic model to the concentration profiles of dmso and ozone is shown in fig 12 at different ph of the medium the values of k d used in these computations were obtained from our previous work 44 the overall rate constant for the reaction of dmso with ozone k increased with the ph of the medium to some extent the oxidation of dmso by ozone followed a first order kinetics with respect to both dmso and ozone and an overall second order kinetics table 3 the volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone k l a slightly increased in the acidic and alkaline solutions the enhancement factor e was calculated from the ratio of the volumetric mass transfer coefficients in the reacting i e in the presence of dmso and non reacting systems i e e k l a k l a 0 40 it estimates the increase in the rate of mass transfer of ozone due to chemical reaction the values of the k l a 0 for the same experimental setup i e omb setup at different ph of the aqueous mediums were reported elsewhere 42 3 7 overall kinetic study for the oxidation of dmso by the omlbs on the contrary to the ombs oxidation of dmso by omlbs did not fit the second order reaction model assuming the first order kinetics the reaction rate between dmso and ozone is given by eq 10 49 10 d dmso d t k l a d dmso d o 3 dmso where d dmso and d o 3 are the diffusivities of dmso and ozone in water respectively assuming that these diffusivities and k l a remain constant during the ozonation by re arranging and integrating eq 10 we get 11 ln dmso 0 dmso k l a d dmso d o 3 t k obs t where 12 k l a k obs d o 3 d dmso if there is a linear relationship between ln dmso 0 dmso and the ozonation time t k obs may be determined from the slope of the line fig 13 the dependence of d o 3 on temperature can be expressed by the arrhenius equation given below 10 13 d o 3 1 1 10 6 exp 1896 t at the temperature of the aqueous solution in the reactor i e 298 k the value of d o 3 computed from eq 13 is 1 89 10 9 m2 s 1 the value of d dmso is 6 1 10 10 m 2 s 1 73 the values of k obs and the corresponding values of k l a computed from eq 12 are given in table 4 3 7 1 mass transfer of ozone by the millibubbles in this section studies on the mass transfer of ozone in the millibubble systems is reported for a non reacting system i e in the absence of dmso the concentration profiles of dissolved ozone in water for the omlb system at different ph of the solution are depicted in fig 14 a the saturation concentration of dissolved ozone o3 ss decreased with increasing ph of the solution this is because ozone decomposes into the oh rapidly in the alkaline medium which reduces the o3 ss in the solution nevertheless the alkaline condition may result in a higher gradient in the ozone concentration between the two phases i e gas and liquid which is the main driving force for the mass transfer of ozone 12 eq 14 can be used for our thoroughly mixed semi batch reactor to estimate the k l a 0 42 14 d o 3 d t k l a 0 k d o 3 ss o 3 this mass balance equation can be integrated with the initial condition i e at t 0 o3 ss 0 which gives eq 15 15 ln o 3 ss o 3 ss o 3 k l a 0 k d t therefore if the plot of ln o 3 ss o 3 ss o 3 versus t is a straight line passing through the origin as shown in fig 14 b the slope of this line would give k l a 0 k d 42 for the omlb system the value of k d is determined later in this section the values of k l a 0 which are given in table 4 are in agreement with the earlier reports 74 as shown later in this section k d increased with the ph of the medium thereby enhancing the rate of mass transfer of ozone i e increased k l a 0 the values of k d for the non reacting omb system have been reported in our earlier work 44 in this work the k d for the omlb system was determined by following a similar procedure several works have reported that the self decomposition of ozone in water follows a first order kinetics and it mainly depends on the ph of the medium 70 72 eq 16 gives the rate equation for the self decomposition reaction 74 75 integration of this equation with the initial condition o 3 o 3 ss at t 0 gives eq 17 16 d o 3 d t k d o 3 17 ln o 3 ss o 3 k d t therefore if the plot of ln o 3 ss o 3 versus t is a straight line passing through the origin as shown in fig 15 the slope of this line would give k d the fit of the first order kinetic model to the experimental data is shown in fig 15 the values of k d given in table 4 show that they increased with the ph of the medium corroborating with the literature 70 and our earlier work using the ombs 44 table 5 presents a summary of the values of k d reported in the literature the values of k d obtained in this study fall within the range of the values given in table 5 and they are slightly higher than our earlier results 44 for the ombs as the microbubbles improve the stability of ozone in the solution ombs are more persistent in the solution as compared to the omlbs ozone is less stable in the omlb system and it quickly decomposes to oxygen resulting in the higher values of k d it has been reported 76 that the average half life for the omlb system was 60 s whereas it was 600 s for the omb system the volumetric ozone transfer rate votr which was obtained from the product of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient and the steady state concentration of ozone i e votr k l a o 3 ss 17 37 at different ph of the solutions were higher for the omb system this is shown in fig 16 this result is in agreement with the work of chu et al 37 who have reported that the microbubble generators exhibited a higher gas transfer rate as compared to conventional bubble diffusers as the effectiveness of ozonation is dependent on the ozone transfer rate from gas to liquid phase and the concentration of dissolved ozone in the aqueous solution 78 the higher votr and k l a obtained in this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the omb system for the ozonation of dmso 4 conclusions dmso present in water was effectively removed by the ombs and a longer time was required for the omlbs keeping other operational parameters i e initial concentration of dmso ogr and initial ph of the medium constant for both the omb and omlb systems the latter needed a longer time for the complete removal of dmso and consequently a higher consumption of ozone therefore a higher stoichiometric ratio of ozone consumed to dmso removed i e a ratio of 10 was obtained for the omlbs higher ozone utilization efficiencies i e 65 79 were observed for the ombs whereas the same for the omlbs was only 21 48 the addition of h2o2 slightly increased the rate of removal of dmso by augmenting the generation of the oh radicals however a large dosage of h2o2 had an adverse effect on the rate of removal of dmso for both ozonation systems the optimal ratio i e h 2 o 2 dmso 0 was 2 0 and 3 0 for the ombs and omlbs respectively for the ombs the contribution of oh was significant at ph 5 and 9 indicating that the microbubbles enhanced the generation of oh both in the acidic and alkaline solutions addition of t buoh proved that there was no contribution of oh at ph 5 for the omlb system and very little effect was observed at ph 9 the degradation of dmso to msa was achieved via two possible pathways the first pathway was the direct conversion by the reaction with the oh in the second pathway dmso was first converted to dmso2 by direct oxidation with the ozone molecule and then dmso2 was further oxidized to msa by the oh during the ozonation using the omlbs hardly any formation of msa was observed omlbs displayed a very poor efficiency in toc removal in terms of toc removal efficiency the order of effectiveness was as follows omlbs omlbs h2o2 ombs ombs h2o2 oxidation of dmso by ozone followed the second order kinetics for the omb system and the first order kinetics was observed for the omlb system higher values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone enhancement factor and volumetric ozone transfer rate were observed for the ombs than the omlbs in general it can be concluded that the ombs were more efficient than the omlbs in terms of ozone utilization efficiency

13641,ozone based microbubble aided technology has been gaining popularity as a new potential alternative method for the oxidation of organic pollutants present in water wastewater in this work the potential of the ozone microbubbles ombs for the oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was investigated and the results were compared with those of the conventional ozone millibubbles omlbs keeping constant other operational parameters the omlbs needed a longer time for complete removal of dmso and hence a higher consumption of ozone took place therefore a higher stoichiometric ratios of ozone consumed to the dmso removed was obtained for the omlbs higher ozone utilization efficiencies were observed for the ombs i e 65 79 than the omlbs i e 21 48 coupling of h2o2 with the ozonation systems improved the oxidation of dmso by enhancing the formation of oh conversely a large dosage of h2o2 had a negative effect the degradation of dmso to methane sulfonic acid msa was achieved via two paths

methods are not effective in degrading such persistent emerging pollutants 1 2 new technologies have been developed in the last couple of decades to degrade such contaminants due to the inadequacies of the conventional wastewater treatment methods ozone which has a high redox potential i e 2 07 v is known for its considerable potential for water and wastewater treatments wwwt since it is a potent eco friendly i e residue free oxidant 3 4 it can react with several organic chemicals except a few which react very slowly with molecular ozone e g chloro alkanes 5 for those chemicals more effective advanced oxidation processes aops are used some of which consist of a combination of single oxidants and involve the generation of the hydroxyl radicals oh the oh is a powerful and nonselective oxidant with a high redox potential i e 2 80 v 6 and reacts with several organic compounds 7 it has been reported by various researchers 8 9 that ozonation in the wwwt systems is controlled by mass transfer transfer of sparingly soluble ozone to water 10 11 is a very important step in the wwwt reactors such as the bubble column reactors usually ozone is introduced into the reactor as a dilute mixture in oxygen because of their less ability to dissolve ozone in water 11 the millibubbles used in the conventional ozonation reactors require a substantial amount of ozone which requires high energy consumption 12 14 microbubbles can offer an alternative to the conventional millibubbles as they improve the solubility of ozone in water and decrease its loss 15 16 a small amount of ozone is sufficient to produce a large number of microbubbles that are capable of oxidizing the organic pollutants present in water 17 the dissolved ozone in the dispersion of ozone microbubbles ombs generates oh that effectively decomposes the organic molecules 18 in the omb system the oh are formed by the self shrinkage and collapse of the microbubbles 17 19 and by the self decomposition of ozone to the oh due to the negative surface charge of the microbubbles 20 21 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is a widely used detergent and photoresist stripping solvent in semiconductor manufacturing and liquid crystal displays its suitable solvent property stability and water miscibility have increased its industrial use as a result of these numerous applications wastewater containing large dmso quantities is released from several industries 22 23 degradation of dmso by the conventional biological methods is known to be difficult because of the odor problems caused by intermediate products such as dimethyl sulfide dms methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide which makes it difficult to carry out the treatment process 24 incubation of activated sludge with the dmso concentration in the range of 0 013 0 128 mol m 3 produces the odorous dms gas at concentrations exceeding the odor threshold by approximately four orders of magnitude 23 the annual worldwide industrial production of dmso is about 5 107 kilograms 25 cheng et al 26 have reported that the amount of dmso discharged from the industry can exceed the handling capacity of the wastewater treatment plants this could result in the canned corn like odor when the dmso concentration exceeds 0 5 mg dm 3 in the incoming wastewater the maximum allowable concentration of dmso in the discharge wastewater set by the united states environmental protection agency is less than 0 05 mg dm 3 27 the conventional biological treatment methods are not effective to remove dmso to a reasonable extent scientists in their effort to develop a cost efficient treatment of wastewater containing dmso have studied a combination of conventional biological processes and the aops dmso is oxidized promptly by chemical oxidation such as the aops and becomes dimethyl sulfone dmso2 i e ch3 2 so2 as shown by eq 1 28 1 c h 3 so c h 3 o c h 3 s o 2 c h 3 in this oxidation process no noxious compound is generated nevertheless an additional method is needed to oxidize the dmso2 further due to its stability against chemical oxidation ozone based aops such as o3 uv and o3 h2o2 and photochemical degradation i e uv h2o2 have been reported as effective methods for dmso removal 2 28 29 in the photochemical degradation uv h2o2 system first dmso is decomposed to methane sulfonic acid msa by the oh generated in situ and the msa is further degraded easily by conventional biological treatment without producing any noxious intermediate gases 28 oxidation of dmso by oh primarily gives methane sulfonic acid 30 dmso is very stable in pure water or in solutions containing h2o2 and it reacts very rapidly with oh k 4 5 109 dm3 mol 1 s 1 31 treatment of organic compounds with uv irradiation in large scale is disadvantageous due to their quite high cost the feasibility of the fenton oxidation process was studied for the removal of dmso from aqueous solutions 32 a fluidized bed fenton process was reported as an effective method for the degradation of dmso in synthetic wastewater 27 wu et al 22 have proposed a combination of hydrogen peroxide and goethite a heterogeneous catalyst as an alternative for the expensive fenton type degradation of dmso lee et al 33 have demonstrated a streamer corona discharge process which produced locally concentrated oh for the oxidative degradation of dmso and reported a high efficiency for dmso removal albeit less toc reduction fig s1 shows the comparison of some aops for the degradation and mineralization of dmso in water wastewater 2 24 29 34 from these works it is observed that the removal of dmso could be achieved through most of aops nevertheless the rate of mineralization of dmso was too slow and it required long oxidation times therefore more efficient methods are required for faster mineralization of dmso recently ozone based microbubble aided technology has been gaining popularity as a new potential alternative method for purification of water wastewater for instance ombs have been used for degradation of phenol 9 35 atrazine 20 benzo a pyrene and toxicity reduction 36 decolorization of practical textile wastewater 37 sludge solubilization 19 removal of residual

high concentration acid plasticizer wastewater 47 and petrochemical wastewater 14 48 li et al 49 have reported that dmso could be oxidized into msa by the ombs without producing any noxious sulfur containing by product they have suggested that the stimulant enhanced ozonation is an effective treatment method for the dmso containing wastewater their result has shown that the reaction between dmso and ozone is mass transfer controlled and the experimental results fitted the first order reaction model in general the hydroxyl radicals are believed to be the main oxidizing species in the aops which are responsible for the decomposition of the pollutants the free radicals generated in situ provide efficient degradation and they are responsible for the decomposition of dmso into biodegradable intermediates the present work is aimed to investigate the potential of the ombs for the oxidation of dmso in detail and compare the results with those of the conventional ozonation process using millibubbles i e omlbs the main operational parameters that influence the removal of dmso have been studied ozone utilization and the stoichiometric ratio of ozone consumed to dmso removed were computed and compared formation and depletion of the two main oxidation intermediates of dmso i e dmso2 and msa were investigated for both ombs and omlbs the overall kinetic parameters such as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient the rate constant of the reaction between dmso and ozone and the enhancement factor have been computed from the experimental results and the results

in the reactor were prepared using tap water the tap water was filtered using an iron removal cartridge iron nil eureka forbes india controlled experiments were also conducted using milli q water whose ion content was negligibly low there was no significant difference in the results obtained by using the filtered tap water and the milli q water thus the effect of the ions present in the filtered tap water was negligible to affect the ozonation reactions 2 3 analysis methods to determine the optimum wavelength for uv detection in the ultra fast liquid chromatography uflc the uv vis spectrum of dmso in a mixture of acetonitrile and milli q water acetonitrile water 80 20 v v was generated in the wavelength range of 200 400 nm by using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu singapore the uv absorption spectrum of dmso is shown in fig 2 a uflc lc 20ad shimadzu japan system equipped with a ternary pump and uv detector was used to measure the concentration of dmso 0 02 cm3 sample was injected into the eclipse xdb c18 column agilent usa having the dimensions of 250 mm 4 6 mm packed with 5 Œºm particles a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of acetonitrile acn and milli q water in the 80 20 v v ratio was used for the detection of dmso at the flow rate of 13 mm3 s 1 in isocratic elution the detection wavelength retention time and lower limit of detection of dmso were 207 nm 185 s and 450 Œºmol m 3 respectively the standard deviation of the retention time was less than 5 s the toc of the samples before and during the ozonation were monitored by using a toc analyzer aurora 1030 o i analytical usa the toc standards for calibration were prepared from high purity potassium hydrogen phthalate for every new experiment the toc content of the filtered tap water was checked the toc varied within the range of 0 1 to 0 7 mg dm 3 these values were subtracted from the respective toc readings of the samples and the corrected values are reported concentrations of the two major oxidation intermediates of dmso i e msa and dmso2 in the aqueous samples were measured by a gas chromatograph 450 gc bruker germany equipped with a cp sil 8 cb 60 m 0 32 mm 0 45 mm column and a pulsed flame photometric detector the gc was operated at 333 473 k the injection volume in the gc was 1 mm3 with 1 80 split ratio helium hydrogen and nitrogen were used as the carrier gases at the flow rate of 170 mm3 s 1 the filament temperature was 323 k with the limit of 663 k the oven temperature was in the range of 323 493 k with ramping at 0 17 k s calibration curves were plotted from known standard solutions of the compounds for the quantitative determination a colorimeter c 105 eutech singapore was used to monitor the dissolved ozone concentration in the reactor using the ozone specific reagent i e dpd method 42 53 54 the excess ozone coming out of the reactor was monitored for selected experimental conditions to determine the stoichiometry of the ozone consumed and dmso oxidized by using the iodometric method 55 56 then it was sent to the ozone destructor ozone traps containing 20 g dm 3 ki solution were used as per the standard procedure 55 the standardized 10 mol m 3 sodium thiosulfate solution was used to titrate the content of the ozone trap the excess ozone concentration was determined from the volume of the titrant na2s2o3 57 the ph of the reaction medium was monitored by a calibrated ph meter ph 2700 electrode 93x218819 eutech singapore necessary ph adjustment of the solution in the reactor before starting the experiment was made by using 0 5 Œºmol m 3 naoh and 1 0 Œºmol m 3 hcl solutions the ozonation experiments and analyses of the samples were repeated at least thrice and their mean values are reported in section 3 the relative standard deviation of most of the average data reported in this work were less than 1 5 unless stated otherwise dmso 0 1 5 mol m 3 the ozone generation rate ogr 1 67 mg s 1 and the initial ph of the aqueous medium was 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 determinations of stoichiometric ratio and ozone utilization efficiency ozone consumption and ozone utilization efficiency are the vital parameters for evaluating the oxidation performance of the ozone based aops these parameters need to be determined and optimized for high ozone utilization that would involve high mass transfer of ozone and a large amount of generation of oh from the mass balance the amount of ozone absorbed during ozonation which refers to the total ozone transferred to the aqueous solution per unit reactor volume can be determined from eq 2 58 2 o 3 abs 0 t d v g o 3 v r o 3 o 3 eff o 3 res dt in our experimental setup all parameters in the integral of eq 2 can be directly determined at the desired ozonation time t d accordingly eq 2 can be integrated and o 3 abs can be computed from eq 3 59 3 o 3 abs o 3 o 3 eff o 3 res v g o 3 t d v r 4 o 3 v g o 3 1 m œÅ v r t d 5 v g o 3 g o 3 r t p 1 m the stoichiometric ratio of moles of the ozone consumed per mole of dmso removed during the reaction can be presented as a function of the dmso removed at the desired ozonation time the stoichiometric ratio s r at t d was computed by using eq 6 6 s r o 3 abs dmso rem for both ombs and omlbs eq 6 computes the stoichiometric ratio for the complete removal of dmso at different ph of the medium and the values are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively for dmso 0 1 5 mol m 3 the values of s r were 0 056 0 055 and 0 049 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively for the ombs on the other hand the corresponding values of s r for the omlbs were 0 648 0 481 and 0 335 at the same initial concentration of dmso from these results it is apparent that the ozone consumption was ten times lower for the ombs the higher values of s r for the omlbs could be due to the long ozonation time required to achieve complete removal of dmso in such extended ozonation processes ozone may be consumed by the oxidation intermediates of dmso resulting in a higher value of s r for the ombs the ozonation time required for the complete removal of dmso was in the range of 0 72 1 8 ks whereas the same was in the range of 3 24 7 2 ks for the omlbs the ombs enhanced the mass transfer of ozone since the oxidation of dmso took place in the aqueous phase a higher concentration of ozone facilitated the oxidation of dmso therefore the ombs played a significant role in lowering the value of s r the effectiveness of both processes was further investigated by determining the utilization efficiency of ozone Œ∑u from eq 7 based on the mass balance of ozone in the gas and liquid phases 7 Œ∑ u o 3 abs o 3 100 the values of Œ∑ u are summarized in tables 1 and 2 the range of ozone utilization efficiency for complete removal of dmso by the ombs i e 65 9 79 1 is substantially higher than that for the omlbs i e 27 8 48 4 from these results it is clear that the ombs considerably improved the utilization of ozone by enhancing its mass transfer in the aqueous solution and forming the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals the values of the ozone utilization efficiency obtained in this work for the ombs are in accordance with those reported by li et al 49 as the microbubbles enhanced mass transfer more than that by the millibubbles the omb process is anticipated to improve the oxidation of dmso and its intermediates at the same time the amount of ozone required for oxidation and the loss of ozone could be reduced significantly by the ombs 3 2 effects of initial concentration of dmso and ogr on the removal of dmso both the initial concentration of dmso and ogr which is equivalent to the concentration of ozone in the feed gas had a significant effect on the removal of dmso by the ombs and omlbs it is observed from fig 3 that increase in the dmso 0 from 0 5 to 2 5 mol m 3 had a negative effect on its removal by both the ombs and omlbs for both systems as the dmso 0 was increased the concentration of dissolved ozone in the solution decreased resulting in the decrease of the molar ratio of ozone to dmso furthermore it is also apparent that the concentration of the oxidative intermediates increased with the increasing dmso 0 which resulted in a higher consumption of the ozone present in the aqueous medium as shown in tables 1 and 2 as well as the oh consequently the rate of removal of dmso was slowed at ph 7 and ogr of 1 67 mg s 1 when the dmso 0 increased from 0 5 to 2 5 mol m 3 the stoichiometric ratio of moles of ozone consumed to dmso removed increased from 0 055 to 0 082 for the ombs and from 0 469 to 0 779 for the omlbs see tables 1 and 2 nevertheless as the dmso 0 increased the utilization efficiency of ozone was improved for both the omb and omlb processes kusvuran and yildirim 60 have reported a similar trend for the conventional ozonation of bisphenol a the stoichiometric ratio of bisphenol a removed to ozone consumed increased with increasing initial concentration of bisphenol a on the other hand increase in the ogr from 0 56 to 2 78 mg s 1 profoundly enhanced the oxidation of dmso for both the ombs and omlbs fig 4 this is expected because an increase in the ogr increased the concentration of dissolved ozone in the solution 2 49 which either oxidized the dmso directly or produced the oh which reacted with dmso and its oxidative intermediates similar results were reported by li et al 49 and wu et al 2 3 3 effects of the ph of the medium and reactions with the hydroxyl radicals the ph of the medium has a substantial role on ozone decomposition and its stability in the solution which can affect the ozonation of organic pollutants and their oxidation by products 46 61 experiments were conducted with both the ombs and omlbs in the ph range of 5 9 from fig 5 a it is observed that the variation in the ph had a rather trivial effect on the oxidation of dmso by the ombs slight improvements were observed at ph 5 and 9 as compared to ph 7 the removal of dmso was slightly increased with the ph of the solution for the omlbs the decrease in the ph of the medium during the course of ozonation as shown in fig 5 b could be due to the formation of acidic intermediates chou and chang 62 have reported a similar decrease in ph with time during the oxidation of dmso by conventional ozonation this finding also corroborates the works of chu et al 37 chen et al 63 and zhang et al 64 who have reported similar trends for the ozonation of textile wastewater by the microbubbles oxidation of dimethyl phthalate by conventional ozonation and degradation of 17Œ± ethinylestradiol by conventional ozonation respectively all have concluded that the decrease in ph during ozonation was due to the production of intermediates containing acidic substances the decrease in the ph of the solutions was more pronounced for the omlb process to examine the effect of the indirect oxidation of dmso by the oh experiments were conducted by using h2o2 which is a promoter for this reaction for oxidation of dmso by the ombs the optimal ratio of h 2 o 2 dmso 0 was 1 0 1 3 the removal efficiency did not change if the h2o2 concentration was lower but it decreased if the concentration was higher fig 6 a these observations signify that the contribution of oh from h2o2 was insignificant as compared to the existing concentration of oh in the aqueous medium when the concentration of h2o2 was low on the other hand when the latter was high the available oh was consumed by the reaction with h2o2 itself 28 this result is in agreement with the previous works 28 and corroborate our earlier works on the removal of diethyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate by the ombs 43 44 for the omlbs the h 2 o 2 dmso 0 ratio was 1 2 a similar trend was observed for the high concentration of h2o2 fig 6 b however a low concentration of h2o2 had also shown a positive effect on the removal of dmso therefore for 1 5 mol m 3 dmso a dosage of 0 3 mol m 3 h2o2 had a positive effect on the removal of dmso for the omlb system further increase of the dosage of h2o2 had a negative effect on the oxidation efficiency of dmso similar to that observed for the ombs experiments were also conducted with t buoh which is a well known oh inhibitor the rate constant for the reaction of t buoh with ozone is extremely small i e 3 10 3 mol 1 dm3 s 1 as compared to that with oh i e 6 108 mol 1 dm3 s 1 65 thus the presence of t buoh in the aqueous solution has substantially hinders the reactivity of oh towards dmso and its oxidation intermediates fig 7 depicts the contribution of oh on the oxidation of dmso and its reaction intermediates by both ombs and omlbs at ph 5 and 9 from fig 7 a it can be observed that the contribution of oh was significant at ph 5 and 9 for the ombs however its effect was rather trivial for the omlbs at ph 5 while some effect was noticed at ph 9 the significant and insignificant effects of oh at ph 5 for the ombs and omlbs respectively imply that the formation of oh was enhanced by the microbubbles and hardly any oh was generated by the omlbs at this ph 3 4 formation and depletion of oxidation intermediates of dmso the formation and decay of the two major oxidative intermediates of dmso were monitored for the experimental condition of dmso 0 1 5 mol m 3 ogr 1 67 mg s 1 and ph 9 it was observed that dmso2 was formed during both the processes fig 8 nevertheless the concentration of dmso2 formed by the ombs was very less and it started depleting after reaching the peak concentration at about 1 8 ks of ozonation time in contrary to this for the omlbs dmso2 started forming late i e after 1 2 ks of ozonation time and its concentration went on increasing for more than 5 4 ks of ozonation time besides the simultaneous formation of msa was observed for the ombs after about 600 s of ozonation time which went on increasing until the formation of dmso2 reached its maximum and then its concentration started depleting slowly this shows that msa was more resistant to the ombs and needed a longer reaction time to be removed totally it has been reported 28 30 that dmso could be directly decomposed to msa by the oh in the aops where oxidation mainly takes place through the reaction with the oh and the msa could be further degraded easily by the conventional biological treatment without generating any harmful reaction intermediate for the omlbs formation of msa was not detected the proposed oxidation mechanism in the omlb system is shown in fig 9 b this route i e the oxidation of dmso by conventional ozonation as per eq 1 is in agreement with the work of chou and chang 62 from our experimental results it is evident that the msa was formed through two paths in the omb system fig 9 a the first path is the prompt conversion of dmso to msa by the reaction with oh without formation of the intermediate dmso2 the other path is via the formation of dmso2 by the oxidation of dmso by molecular ozone followed by further oxidation of dmso2 to msa by the oh present in the solution as shown in fig 9 a microbubbles promoted the self decomposition of ozone to the oh due to their negative surface charge as a result of the hydroxyl ions accumulating at the microbubble surface which promoted the self decomposition of ozone and formed the oh 20 besides oh were also generated by the self shrinkage and collapse of the microbubbles 17 19 the path of self decomposition of ozone in the millibubble system is different from that of the microbubble system due to the instability of ozone it quickly decomposed to oxygen and a small amount of oh was formed when the solution was highly alkaline the amount of oh formed was less for the millibubble system 3 5 extent of mineralization of dmso by ombs and omlbs in order to assess the efficiency of the ombs and omlbs towards the degradation of dmso and their respective extents of mineralization the ozonation was studied at different ph of the aqueous solution fig 10 a depicts the toc removal profiles by both ozonation processes as a function of ozonation time at different ph of the medium for the ombs it was observed that the toc removal was slightly more favorable at ph 5 as compared to ph 7 and 9 fig 10 a this can be attributed to the favorable oxidation of the intermediates in the acidic medium this possibility was checked by separately carrying out the oxidation of dmso2 in water by the ombs at ph 5 and 9 fig 10 b depicts that the oxidation of dmso2 was slightly more favored at ph 5 than at ph 9 moreover a huge difference between the removal rates of dmso and its corresponding toc were observed particularly for the omlbs for the omlbs after 2 16 ks of ozonation the removal of dmso was 62 5 70 4 and 78 4 at ph 5 7 and 10 respectively and the corresponding toc removal were 1 9 5 5 and 8 9 fig 10 c the better dmso removal efficiencies as compared to the corresponding toc removal at all ph show that the oxidation of dmso could be achieved via the direct oxidation by the ozone molecules in contrast toc reduction i e further oxidation of the reaction intermediates was mainly achieved through the indirect oxidation by the oh the low toc reduction at all ph suggests that the available concentration of the oh was not enough to degrade the intermediates produced during the ozonation of dmso the overall removal efficiency of dmso in the alkaline solution was better than that in the acidic solution for the omlbs these results corroborate the literature 2 in the conventional ozonation the chain reactions leading to the decomposition of ozone to the oh are not favorable in the acidic medium whereas oh are favorably generated in the alkaline medium 5 66 in general direct reaction with the ozone molecule is known to occur under acidic conditions and in the presence of radical scavengers that inhibit the chain reactions responsible for the decomposition of ozone to the reactive oh 67 69 in the alkaline medium or in the presence of solutes that promote radical type chain reaction and formation of oh the indirect reaction predominates due to the extremely rapid and indiscriminate nature of the oh 67 furthermore the contribution of oh on the toc removal was further investigated by using a promoter h2o2 and an inhibitor t buoh of the oh coupling h2o2 with both the ozonation systems i e ombs and omlbs had a significant effect on the toc reduction by augmenting the generation of oh however the impact was more pronounced for the omlbs fig 11 a the addition of the oh scavenger i e t buoh also proved that the indirect reaction was the main pathway for the mineralization of dmso and its oxidative intermediates fig 11 b the effectiveness of the four processes i e sole omlbs omlbs coupled with h2o2 sole ombs and ombs coupled with h2o2 was compared in terms of the dmso removal and the extent of mineralization a long ozonation time i e 5 4 ks was considered for comparison at this extended ozonation time all four processes were equally effective for the complete removal of dmso nevertheless a wide variation was observed in terms of the toc removal fig 11 c the sole omlb process exhibited a very poor efficiency for toc removal whereas the sole omb process was more effective for toc removal than the omlb h2o2 process 3 6 overall kinetics for the oxidation of dmso by the ombs in the semi batch reactor of our experimental setup ozone was supplied continuously during the entire ozonation it gradually dissolved in water and reacted with dmso eq 8 expresses the kinetics of the reaction between dmso and ozone 8 d dmso d t k dmso m o 3 n during the oxidation of dmso by the ombs the overall mass balance of ozone contains three terms i e the rate of reaction of dmso with ozone directly and indirectly the rate of mass transfer of ozone from the gas to the liquid phase and the first order self decomposition of ozone for the reactor of our experimental setup the self decomposition of ozone in water depended on the ph of the medium and it followed a first order kinetics 44 which is in agreement with the literature 70 72 in such a system where ozone gradually dissolves in the aqueous solution simultaneously undergoes self decomposition and reacts with dmso eq 9 gives the general mass balance 9 d o 3 d t k l a k d o 3 ss o 3 k dmso m o 3 n the polymath version 6 10 which employs the runge kutta method was used to solve the two simultaneous odes i e eqs 8 and 9 the best fit values r 2 0 98 of the kinetic parameters obtained by fitting the experimental data are presented in table 3 the fit of the kinetic model to the concentration profiles of dmso and ozone is shown in fig 12 at different ph of the medium the values of k d used in these computations were obtained from our previous work 44 the overall rate constant for the reaction of dmso with ozone k increased with the ph of the medium to some extent the oxidation of dmso by ozone followed a first order kinetics with respect to both dmso and ozone and an overall second order kinetics table 3 the volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone k l a slightly increased in the acidic and alkaline solutions the enhancement factor e was calculated from the ratio of the volumetric mass transfer coefficients in the reacting i e in the presence of dmso and non reacting systems i e e k l a k l a 0 40 it estimates the increase in the rate of mass transfer of ozone due to chemical reaction the values of the k l a 0 for the same experimental setup i e omb setup at different ph of the aqueous mediums were reported elsewhere 42 3 7 overall kinetic study for the oxidation of dmso by the omlbs on the contrary to the ombs oxidation of dmso by omlbs did not fit the second order reaction model assuming the first order kinetics the reaction rate between dmso and ozone is given by eq 10 49 10 d dmso d t k l a d dmso d o 3 dmso where d dmso and d o 3 are the diffusivities of dmso and ozone in water respectively assuming that these diffusivities and k l a remain constant during the ozonation by re arranging and integrating eq 10 we get 11 ln dmso 0 dmso k l a d dmso d o 3 t k obs t where 12 k l a k obs d o 3 d dmso if there is a linear relationship between ln dmso 0 dmso and the ozonation time t k obs may be determined from the slope of the line fig 13 the dependence of d o 3 on temperature can be expressed by the arrhenius equation given below 10 13 d o 3 1 1 10 6 exp 1896 t at the temperature of the aqueous solution in the reactor i e 298 k the value of d o 3 computed from eq 13 is 1 89 10 9 m2 s 1 the value of d dmso is 6 1 10 10 m 2 s 1 73 the values of k obs and the corresponding values of k l a computed from eq 12 are given in table 4 3 7 1 mass transfer of ozone by the millibubbles in this section studies on the mass transfer of ozone in the millibubble systems is reported for a non reacting system i e in the absence of dmso the concentration profiles of dissolved ozone in water for the omlb system at different ph of the solution are depicted in fig 14 a the saturation concentration of dissolved ozone o3 ss decreased with increasing ph of the solution this is because ozone decomposes into the oh rapidly in the alkaline medium which reduces the o3 ss in the solution nevertheless the alkaline condition may result in a higher gradient in the ozone concentration between the two phases i e gas and liquid which is the main driving force for the mass transfer of ozone 12 eq 14 can be used for our thoroughly mixed semi batch reactor to estimate the k l a 0 42 14 d o 3 d t k l a 0 k d o 3 ss o 3 this mass balance equation can be integrated with the initial condition i e at t 0 o3 ss 0 which gives eq 15 15 ln o 3 ss o 3 ss o 3 k l a 0 k d t therefore if the plot of ln o 3 ss o 3 ss o 3 versus t is a straight line passing through the origin as shown in fig 14 b the slope of this line would give k l a 0 k d 42 for the omlb system the value of k d is determined later in this section the values of k l a 0 which are given in table 4 are in agreement with the earlier reports 74 as shown later in this section k d increased with the ph of the medium thereby enhancing the rate of mass transfer of ozone i e increased k l a 0 the values of k d for the non reacting omb system have been reported in our earlier work 44 in this work the k d for the omlb system was determined by following a similar procedure several works have reported that the self decomposition of ozone in water follows a first order kinetics and it mainly depends on the ph of the medium 70 72 eq 16 gives the rate equation for the self decomposition reaction 74 75 integration of this equation with the initial condition o 3 o 3 ss at t 0 gives eq 17 16 d o 3 d t k d o 3 17 ln o 3 ss o 3 k d t therefore if the plot of ln o 3 ss o 3 versus t is a straight line passing through the origin as shown in fig 15 the slope of this line would give k d the fit of the first order kinetic model to the experimental data is shown in fig 15 the values of k d given in table 4 show that they increased with the ph of the medium corroborating with the literature 70 and our earlier work using the ombs 44 table 5 presents a summary of the values of k d reported in the literature the values of k d obtained in this study fall within the range of the values given in table 5 and they are slightly higher than our earlier results 44 for the ombs as the microbubbles improve the stability of ozone in the solution ombs are more persistent in the solution as compared to the omlbs ozone is less stable in the omlb system and it quickly decomposes to oxygen resulting in the higher values of k d it has been reported 76 that the average half life for the omlb system was 60 s whereas it was 600 s for the omb system the volumetric ozone transfer rate votr which was obtained from the product of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient and the steady state concentration of ozone i e votr k l a o 3 ss 17 37 at different ph of the solutions were higher for the omb system this is shown in fig 16 this result is in agreement with the work of chu et al 37 who have reported that the microbubble generators exhibited a higher gas transfer rate as compared to conventional bubble diffusers as the effectiveness of ozonation is dependent on the ozone transfer rate from gas to liquid phase and the concentration of dissolved ozone in the aqueous solution 78 the higher votr and k l a obtained in this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the omb system for the ozonation of dmso 4 conclusions dmso present in water was effectively removed by the ombs and a longer time was required for the omlbs keeping other operational parameters i e initial concentration of dmso ogr and initial ph of the medium constant for both the omb and omlb systems the latter needed a longer time for the complete removal of dmso and consequently a higher consumption of ozone therefore a higher stoichiometric ratio of ozone consumed to dmso removed i e a ratio of 10 was obtained for the omlbs higher ozone utilization efficiencies i e 65 79 were observed for the ombs whereas the same for the omlbs was only 21 48 the addition of h2o2 slightly increased the rate of removal of dmso by augmenting the generation of the oh radicals however a large dosage of h2o2 had an adverse effect on the rate of removal of dmso for both ozonation systems the optimal ratio i e h 2 o 2 dmso 0 was 2 0 and 3 0 for the ombs and omlbs respectively for the ombs the contribution of oh was significant at ph 5 and 9 indicating that the microbubbles enhanced the generation of oh both in the acidic and alkaline solutions addition of t buoh proved that there was no contribution of oh at ph 5 for the omlb system and very little effect was observed at ph 9 the degradation of dmso to msa was achieved via two possible pathways the first pathway was the direct conversion by the reaction with the oh in the second pathway dmso was first converted to dmso2 by direct oxidation with the ozone molecule and then dmso2 was further oxidized to msa by the oh during the ozonation using the omlbs hardly any formation of msa was observed omlbs displayed a very poor efficiency in toc removal in terms of toc removal efficiency the order of effectiveness was as follows omlbs omlbs h2o2 ombs ombs h2o2 oxidation of dmso by ozone followed the second order kinetics for the omb system and the first order kinetics was observed for the omlb system higher values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone enhancement factor and volumetric ozone transfer rate were observed for the ombs than the omlbs in general it can be concluded that the ombs were more efficient than the omlbs in terms of ozone utilization efficiency

13642,currently sars cov 2 has been detected in the influent of wastewater treatment plants wwtp pumping stations manholes sewer networks and sludge of wwtp and facilities of countries as france spain italy netherlands united states australia ecuador brazil and japan although this virus has been detected in the wastewater streams there is no robust method for its detection and quantification in wastewater this review compiled and analyzed the virus concentration approaches applied to detect the sars cov 2 besides to provide insights about the methodology for viral concentration limit of detection occurrence persistence and perspectives post covid 19 related with the implications of the virus presence in wastewater the sars cov 2 detection in wastewater has been related to virus concentration methods which present different recovery rates of the virus the most used viral concentration methods have been the polyethylene glycol peg for precipitation of viral material and the ultrafiltration at molecular weight level after viral concentration the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater are mainly via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr which is the clinical assay adapted for environmental purposes although in some experiments the positive control during rt qpcr is running a surrogated virus e g mengovirus or dengue virus rt qpcr or reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr targeting the gene encoding nucleocapsid n1 n2 and n3 of sars cov 2 are highly recommended to calculate the limit of detection in wastewater samples current results suggest that a rigorous methodology to elucidate the positive cases in a region from genomic copies in wastewater is needed keywords covid 19 coronavirus wastewater treatment plant detection virus concentration wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction the disease caused by the new coronavirus sars cov 2 is officially called covid 19 which has caused a pandemic worldwide with deep impacts on aspects of human life 1 currently october 1st 2020 there are 33 842 281 confirmed cases for covid 19 around the world and 1 010 634 accumulated deaths in 188 territories 1 the high rate of infected people the longtime that takes for the human host to develop antibodies against the virus 2 and the mortality rate 3 are characteristics of the covid 19 which are not common in some other viral diseases detection of sars cov 2 in the sewer networks is essential in the initial stages of community spread moreover early detection in a community reduces the rate of contagion and prevents over saturation of health systems at this time the most common tests to diagnose a person with covid 19 are chest computed tomography ct and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr this last test is based on the multiplication of nucleic acids present in the virus which make the test accurate due to it confirms the genetic presence of sars cov 2 in a person a medium or an object moreover applying rt qpcr can be quantified the genomic units of sars cov 2 this assay is performed to detect different regions of the sars cov 2 genome in human fluids such as rhino pharyngeal oropharyngeal as well as fecal samples surfaces and wastewater the genetic regions of sars cov 2 detected include the envelope protein gene e gene nucleocapsid protein gene n gene or rna dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp gene 4 5 comparative assays among different primer probe sets from those genes showed to be highly specific with no false positive but with different sensitivities regarding to the quantitative presence and fluids 6 the reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr is another technique which has also been applied to quantify the sars cov 2 in wastewater 7 9 in terms of sensitivity falzone et al 10 found that the ddpcr technique has shown higher sensitivity and specificity compared to rt qpcr for the diagnosis of covid 19 in false negative rhino pharyngeal swab samples with low viral load the persistence of sars cov 2 in humans includes its presence in fluids such as urine 11 and feces 12 14 that arrive to the wastewater streams by these excretions in a recent study it was reported that sars cov 2 presence is more common in feces than in urine 15 hence stool can be considered as main contributor of genomic units of the virus in the wastewater streams indistinctly to the source of the excretion of the virus its detection in wastewater streams via surveillance of wastewater is an opportunity to track the pandemic in a covered area by monitoring the sewer networks which may potentially prevent a fast spread of the covid 19 16 17 in fact surveillance of wastewater streams can be considered as an early warning tool this approach is known as wastewater based epidemiology wbe which has been proposed for surveillance of viral diseases such as poliovirus and to track the use of illicit drugs in a determined area 18 19 currently nearly a dozen research groups around the world have performed tests to detect the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater 20 their findings have confirmed the presence of the virus in wastewater and in some cities the sars cov 2 has been detected in wastewater before confirming the first case by the health authorities 21 from the wastewater treatment point of view the road map will include the next milestones i the development of robust methodologies for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater ii application of wastewater based epidemiology wbe as a covid 19 monitoring tool iii analysis and response for possible impacts on the wwtp operation process and technology and iv development of protocols to response to the new diseases including virus or bacterial pandemics this review is focused on the first milestone but the wbe and wastewater treatment post covid 19 are also reviewed the systematic detection of the sars cov 2 in wastewater is needed to set the wbe which can provide useful information on the level of spread of covid 19 in a community in addition to the research needs on the subject of detection of sars cov 2 already compiled by kitajima et al 17 and research needs about of sars cov 2 in the public health already reported by farkas et al 16 there is a basic research need for selecting the most suitable method for viral concentration in wastewater prior its detection by molecular techniques based on pcr the concentration of virus in wastewater samples provides higher resolution when a molecular technique for detection is applied several studies reported via formal peer reviewed publication the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater and related their findings to the epidemiological behavior however the methodologies applied to detect the virus have not been standardized in a robust one hence to generate a robust method for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater the methodologies applied for viral concentration before its detection must be analyzed in formal studies moreover facing the new normality perspectives about the presence on the virus in wastewater in a post covid 19 scenario are also demanded this review compiles and analyze the sars cov 2 approaches and protocols for viral concentration detection occurrence and persistence in wastewater in order to provide insights and best practices as well as needs and perspectives for the wastewater treatment post covid 19 2 detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater one of the major challenges in sars cov 2 detection and quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol 22 however there are overall considerations in the protocols already applied for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater these considerations can be categorized as steps for virus detection in wastewater which include the sampling timing and conditions virus inactivation e g heat treatment pasteurization of the sample the correct use of protective equipment for virus handle grit and solids removal in some samples concentration of the virus detection of the virus and quantification of the genetic units of the virus all these steps will be discussed in this section 2 1 sample collection handling and storing of the wastewater samples according to the population based health management analysis proposed by thompson et al 23 the upstream sampling of multiple locations may provide higher spatial resolution related to positive cases per inhabitants when compared to downstream sampling e g influent of wwtp which presents higher travel time of the wastewater and may present signal degradation although sample collection could be random through collection of single samples at an arbitrary time the timing of sampling has influenced the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater sherchan et al 24 found that the sampling method is critical and that composite samples of 24 h may provide the most reliable daily average of viral concentration in wastewater moreover sampling protocols should consider the inactivation time of the coronavirus in wastewater that could be between 2 3 and 3 5 days at 23 c 25 however the temperature during collection and preservation may play an important role in virus degradation in recently reported studies the preservation temperature of collected samples for has been 4 c or 20 c table 1 without a clear trend toward lower rna signals when the samples are stored at 4 c for almost two weeks 26 ahmed et al 27 demonstrated that the sars cov 2 rna signal is unlikely to degrade significantly at the temperatures of storing 4 c for at least 10 d nevertheless the decay in rna signal is influenced by the temperatures 15 c 25 c and 37 c water matrix tap water or wastewater and thermal treating of the samples by autoclaving 27 sherchan et al 24 processed wastewater samples stored at 80 c between 1 and 2 months before the pandemic which tested negative since first case was reported a month later although the majority of samples are processed within 12 h after collection reprocessing stored samples under different temperatures is needed in order to determine the potential bias in the detection and sensitivity during storage regarding the handling of samples potentially containing sars cov 2 they should be handled according to the subsequent use of samples for example since infectious sars cov 2 is classified as a biosafety level 3 bsl 3 culturing of samples that potentially contain sars cov 2 requires bsl 3 guidelines 4 nevertheless procedures that concentrate viruses such as precipitation or membrane filtration can be performed in a bsl 2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow although there is no evidence that infectious sars cov 2 is present in wastewater streams samples can be submitted to heat treatment e g 30 min at 60 c before opening containers to increase the safety of the workers who perform the analysis 28 29 since this procedure can inactivate the potentially infectious agents present in the samples the effect of heat treatment of wastewater samples e g pasteurization or autoclaving on rna signal intensity of coronaviruses is a topic with few insights and contradictory findings that represents a research need while the high persistence of rna signal intensity of sars cov 2 over time up to 10 d in autoclaved wastewater samples has been attributed to changes in the physicochemical characteristics of wastewater after the autoclaving them 27 the recovery rate of rna of coronaviruses can decrease after heat treatment due to its weak resistance and high sensitivity to the environmental factors such as temperature 30 and chlorine ions 31 as well as to the presence of rnases which are present even in autoclaved samples 32 in addition special care must take into account during virus inactivation and virus concentration some bsl 3 precautions are recommended some studies removed the grit and solids from the matrix before and after to viral rna concentration and isolation from wastewater samples which mainly consisted in two ways for removing larger and dense particles from wastewater table 1 filtration 0 45 0 20 Œºm 33 and centrifugation 8 24 28 it should be highlighted that when filtration and centrifugation are applied the biomass retained in filters or pellets can be analyzed to quantify the presence of rna which will allow to consider that value for full quantitative purposes 2 2 concentration of the virus in wastewater the viral concentration is a key step for detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater due to its concentration decreases by dilution in wastewater streams the approaches applied for this purpose are multiple and include the one used for poliovirus concentration based on two phase separation method 36 precipitation 21 centrifugation 37 38 ultrafiltration 8 38 conventional filtration 33 and filtration by negatively charged membranes 39 and a combination of these approaches table 1 although there are efficient methods to concentrate enveloped virus such as coronaviruses from wastewater 40 and tap water 41 the specific efficiency in recovering sars cov 2 may perform differently therefore it is highly recommended to determine the recovery rate of the virus for the concentration method applied in this review the methods for sars cov 2 concentration are grouped in two categories the physicochemical based and the strictly physical based methods fig 1 the physicochemical based methods incorporate the use of chemical reagents in some steps of physical separation for the extraction and concentration of the virus chemical reagents include the combined used of the polymer polyethylene glycol peg with nacl dextran or alum in order to perform a liquid liquid fractionation aqueous two phase technique with potential for the extraction separation purification and enrichment of viruses the miscibility of solutions containing polymers results in the formation of two phases separating the solute selectively in one phase 42 the use of al oh 3 and alcl3 with ph adjustment by addition of hcl has been addressed in order to precipitate the viral content due to the modification of surface charge in the virus in general the incorporation of chemicals reagents considers reaction and incubation time which even can be for overnight periods for phases separation fig 1 finally the extraction and amplification of genetic information are performed in the extracted or precipitated phase according to the reported studies most of the physicochemical approaches for virus concentration take more time up to 15 5 h and they involve more steps than the strictly physical methods although the physicochemical based approaches can include some physical steps such as filtration and centrifugation their effectiveness for virus concentration is attributed to the chemical adsorption 36 43 the strictly physical based methods for viral concentration mainly applied a combination of centrifugation and filtration or ultracentrifugation and resuspension fig 1 although the reported physical based protocols for sars cov 2 concentration take less than 1 4 h to be completed centrifugal ultrafilters with cut off up to 100 kda units for centrifugation of high volume equipment for ultracentrifugation or ultrafiltration units may be required some studies have tested the effectiveness of methods for viral concentration of sars cov 2 in wastewater ahmed et al 27 found inconsistent results in sars cov 2 concentration and recovery when they compared the electronegative membranes with the ultrafiltration tubes with a cut off at 10 kda of molecular weight mw in the same study it was used murine hepatitis virus mhv as surrogate of sars cov 2 and it was found that adsorption extraction methods for viral concentration could recover up to 65 of mhv 43 it is important to highlight that mhv and sars cov 2 are enveloped virus from the same genus betacoronavirus 44 share similar genomic structure and envelope glycoproteins spike 45 hence the recovery rates could be close between both virus even though as the recovery rate depends on the wastewater matrix high recoveries may not be observed at all times thus variations on the recovery are expected randazzo et al 21 validate the al oh 3 adsorption precipitation method using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and mengovirus mgv reporting recovery efficiencies of 11 of both virus in influent samples in the same sense using mengovirus as surrogate virus no significant loss of rna was reported for heat treating the wastewater samples 28 medema et al 8 validated the purification and concentration steps using the ultrafiltration method 100 kda membranes reporting a recovery efficiency of 73 50 n 16 of f specific rna phages meanwhile the rna extraction and rt qpcr steps showed a recovery efficiency of 30 4 22 3 using an internal control rna validate the methods for sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater is a current need for analytical protocols and to strengthen the wastewater based epidemiology studies also the need of reference materials for rt qpcr quantification has been recommended to allow intra and interlaboratory comparison of rt qpcr results for sars cov 2 surveillance in wastewater 8 2 3 detection and quantification of the virus the method more used to detect and quantify the sars cov 2 in wastewater has been rt qpcr table 1 which is part of the second generation of pcr although this method can detect the regions orf1a orf1b e and n of the sars cov 2 genome n or nucleocapsids have been the most used target during assays after rna extraction of viral concentrated from wastewater 8 46 the commercial availability of nucleocapsids n1 and n2 primer probe sets has facilitated their use during detection assays in wastewater even when some reagents for covid 19 detection have limited availability to conduct tests 20 nucleocapsid region has also been used to determine the limit of detection lod during quantitative analysis that has ranged from 2 log10 7 to 4 45 log10 copies per liter of wastewater 21 these quantitative results for sars cov 2 have been validated theoretically for lod regarding to the spiked concentration in addition to the quality controls to measure the recovery efficiency during the rna concentration and isolation steps some studies have included other controls during the quantification as internal reference and indicators of pcr inhibition like sketa 22 assa oncorhynchus keta and Œ≤ actin 39 as well human crassphage was used by green et al 47 pre print as internal control for normalizing sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater samples similarly pepper mild mottle virus has been used as internal control for detection of sars cov 2 35 48 since positives and internal control assays follow different targets even with different nucleocapsids the determination of limit of detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater is unclear and not rigorous in terms of analytical protocols the use of noninfectious sars cov 2 or a positive fecal samples in wastewater in order to set the limit of detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater could be an approach that increase the reliability of the quantitative methods 21 besides rt qpcr rt ddpcr could be used to detect and quantify sars cov 2 in wastewater gonzalez et al 7 this last tool has presented higher sensitivity in human samples than rt qpcr 10 49 gonzalez et al 7 used a rt ddpcr assay and determined theoretical lod in wastewater of n1 n2 and n3 which were 14 6 2 and 2 18 copies per reaction respectively the n2 assay results were used in the work performed by gonzalez et al 7 as they were the most sensitive and presented sars cov 2 concentrations in wastewater samples between 101 and 104 copies per 100 m l 1 during the 21 week study in southeastern virginia in another study falzone et al 10 performed a comparison between rt qpcr and ddpcr sensivity in human positive rhino pharyngeal swab samples and found that sensitivity of ddpcr permitted the identification of positive signals in undiluted samples and in the 10 fold dilution demonstrating that ddpcr is effective in the detection of very low viral load although rt ddpcr has been more sensitive in rhino pharyngeal samples 10 49 research is needed to compare the sensitivity of various methods including rt qpcr and rt ddpcr in wastewater samples table 2 shows the advantages and disadvantages of rt ddpcr and rt qpcr 3 occurrence of sars cov 2 in wastewater the virus that causes covid 19 has been detected in the wastewater of several cities and regions around the world table 3 although the majority of samples were collected at the influent of the wwtp sampling points in the sewer network manholes hospital wastewater and pumping stations were also monitored to delimit the scope of the study the sampling dates were different for all experiments but ranged from february 3rd to april 25th for samples collected in some municipalities of murcia spain such as lorca cieza and totana positive results of sars cov 2 in wastewater alerted covid 19 cases 12 16 days before first cases were declared 21 the same was reported for amersfoort netherlands where wastewater samples on march 5th resulted positive few days before the first case in the city was confirmed 8 these findings strongly suggest that surveillance of the untreated wastewater streams may contribute to monitoring the pandemic however the limited availability of the reagents for covid 19 detection should be considered to avoid a shortage of the reagents for clinical purposes nonetheless it is important to mention that reagents used for research are commonly tag as research use only and they should not be utilized for clinical diagnose although the sars cov 2 has been detected in untreated wastewater this virus has also been detected in 2 18 samples of treated effluent after wastewater passed throughout the activated sludge process as secondary treatment moreover all samples after tertiary treatment e g coagulation flocculation uv or naclo resulted as negative 21 this highlights the relevance of disinfection processes with physicochemical technologies as chlorine based ones to eliminate the presence of genetic material of the virus as previously reported for sars cov 31 utilities appear to identify their important role in water treatment and disinfection 53 given that there is the possibility of finding sars cov 2 rna in the secondary effluent and considering that is unclear whether the virus is potentially infectious at this stage of treatment a disinfection process is recommended for those systems with only secondary treatment to prevent the circulation of sars cov 2 titers in secondary effluent water the presence of sars cov 2 rna in the primary sludge and waste activated sludge was recently detected in 7 wwtp of istanbul turkey 54 pre print titers of sars cov 2 rna in primary sludge and waste activated sludge ranged from 1 17 104 to 4 02 104 per liter of sludge these concentrations may vary depending on the solids concentration in samples and on the sources of the samples for example the of sars cov 2 rna copy number detected in the suspended solids of raw wastewater 55 were lower than those reported previously for waste sludge 54 pre print westhaus et al 55 filtered 45 ml of raw wastewater and compared the sars cov 2 rna copy number present in the wastewater phase and in the pellet that resulted of the ultrafiltration by 10 kda the experiment indicated that the solid phase of samples of raw wastewater are one log unit higher of sars cov 2 rna copy number per ml 25 copies ml 1 than to the aqueous phase of the inflow sample 1 8 copies ml 1 cheung et al 56 detected sars cov 2 rna in fecal matter and found median fecal viral load of 5 1 log10 copies per ml in patients with diarrhea while for patients without diarrhea was 3 9 log10 copies per ml these results support that the titers of the virus could remain in the fecal matter and other suspended solids present in the wastewater these findings also suggest the presence of titers of sars cov 2 in the disposed sludge from wwtps hence further disinfection of the waste sludge could be needed before sludge disposal while occurrence studies of the virus in the waste sludge are still under research nevertheless comprehensive studies related to the fate of sars cov 2 rna in waste sludge digested sludge or biosolids 57 as well as studies determining whether or not the virus in the sludge may be infectious are also needed 4 persistence of sars cov 2 in wastewater the environmental conditions e g temperature humidity particulate material among others related to the sars cov 2 spread have recently considered in some studies 22 25 58 59 since they affect the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 and its rna signal the physicochemical conditions of the wastewater streams may influence the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 and its rna signal 60 some ions in the wastewater may alter the membrane protein of sars cov 2 as ions altered the membrane of the sars cov which is a virus from the same subgenus sarbecovirus as sars cov 2 and has hydrophobic and selective for monovalent cations membrane protein 61 although sars cov 2 has been less resistant than bacteria to chlorine concentration in water 46 some coronavirus can persist in wastewater up to 3 5 days at 23 c 25 wang et al 31 suggest that sars cov persists in fecal samples for 3 days and in urine samples for 17 days and that sars cov is more vulnerable to disinfectants than e coli and f2 phage although this virus from the same subgenus than sars cov 2 may persist for some time in water the potential transmission of infectious sars cov 2 through wastewater streams has not been confirmed 8 46 it means that the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater does not imply that the virus is able to infect humans 62 since the transmission is linked to the viability of the virus in wastewater research focused in virus stability in the environmental matrices distinguishing infectious and noninfectious virus and determination of the persistence factors of sars cov 2 in wastewater are needed regarding waste solids sars cov rna has been detected in the feces of infected individuals sars cov rna levels showed a maximum in fecal samples up to 14 days after the onset of the illness in one case fecal samples tested positive for the virus for up to 73 days after the illness onset 63 therefore it is probable that sewage sludge from an area with infected people can contain sars cov 2 rna 15 however the survival of sars cov 2 in biosolids would be very low at temperatures higher than 20 c 25 actually there is no evidence for transmission of sars cov 2 via solid waste 64 5 wastewater based epidemiology of the sars cov 2 the study of the several compounds in wastewater such as illicit drugs and biological agents as hepatitis a virus and norovirus have provided early warnings of outbreaks 18 62 for this reason the quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of the virus among the population via wbe 39 which is a promising strategy for monitoring the spread of sars cov 2 or resurgence the basic principle of wbe is that sewage can be used as an indicator of the scale of infected inhabitants and their use will boost worldwide attention and interest in wbe however there are some limitations in the wbe application for covid 19 pandemic specially the related to the rna excretion assumptions of the virus an example is that not all covid 19 positive patients excrete sars cov 2 in feces 21 another issue is that concentration of the titers in stool varies between patients and there is no evidence that such concentrations are potentially infectious 12 estimates of viral load in stool from positive patients are also unclear a couple of recent publications suggest levels of 600 000 genomic units per ml of fecal material 65 and 30 000 000 genomic units per ml of fecal material 66 hence to strengthen the wbe of the covid 19 insights about the rate of excretion of genomic units via feces per patient as well as the persistence of the titer in the wastewater media is demanded another concern for the validation of wbe for covid 19 spread is the sars cov 2 rna prevalence in the wastewater the time for 90 titer reduction of rna quantification t90 in wastewater is dependent on temperature with 27 8 20 4 12 6 8 04 days at 4 15 25 and 37 c respectively 27 a similar t90 value of 26 days resulted at low rna titers at 20 c 60 in those studies the decay rate constant k of sars cov 2 rna ranged from 0 08 to 0 29 day 1 when the k values were log10 transformed and linear regression was used to characterize the relationship between temperature from 4 to 37 c and first order decay rate constant 27 60 these k values imply that rna could be detected at least 4 days after its shedding in sewage in addition to the decay rate of the virus proper sampling and sample preserving and transportation temperature the hydraulic retention time of the sewer distribution system should be considered in the wbe studies therefore the wbe application s key factor will be the development of a robust protocol for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater focusing on the effective concentration methods before the subsequent rna extraction and rt qpcr detection 67 wbe has demonstrated the feasibility of being used as an inexpensive technique to monitor and manage the health and behavior of human populations simulations with data from 2017 obtained in 13 940 wwtp of usa demonstrated the potential sensitivity of wbe for generating skewed data 68 wbe has also been used as a tool to monitor drugs consumption or exposure to environmental and food contaminants for example it has been applied to estimate tobacco consumption in seven regions of spain reporting the differences in regional consumption however no conclusive correlation was found between those values and the prevalence data taken from two different national surveys nor sociodemographic and health data 69 wbe can be a powerful tool for specific cases as the covid 19 using wwtp data but need to be complemented with other indicators to assess the disease accurately including the correct characterization of the sewage system maps flows etc and the existing clinical results few studies present consistent results of covid 19 surveillance using wbe for instance in southeastern virginia usa the rna data from weekly samples of nine wwtps presented spatially and temporally with regional loading estimates over time were considered as viable way to describe the occurrence and trends onset in sars cov 2 infection 7 however the lack of a reliable sars cov 2 stool shedding rate is the current limitation in the use of wbe to estimate total infection within a community 7 the authors recommend future work to examine the lead lag association between sars cov 2 wastewater data and regional confirmed clinical data with a similar aim a technical bulletin of sars cov 2 rna surveillance from sewage at belo horizonte brazil correlated the reported covid 19 cases with the estimated cases using the typical viral load from sick individuals and the genomic viral copies from sewage 70 the trend of rna concentration in sewage allowed to infer that prevalence of covid 19 was higher than the confirmed cases by local health authorities furthermore percentage of infected people were estimated by regional maps delimited by the 15 monitored sewage sub basins where concern areas were identified due to the increasing rna concentration in the sewage 70 another study in the new haven connecticut usa metropolitan area showed that sars cov 2 rna concentration in primary sludge of wwtp wastewater treatment facilities was up to 8 days ahead from the sars cov 2 positive test results by reporting date 71 6 perspectives for the wastewater treatment post covid 19 the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater generates concerns for the wwtp in the future i occurrence of new pollutants in wwtp ii efficient disinfection and sanitary concerns for the presence of the virus in wwtp iii wastewater management to protect public health and environment and iv implementation of wwtp results in the wbe for monitor of covid 19 the development of new drugs and treatments for the covid 19 e g remdesivir hydroxychloroquine hcq chloroquine cq among others will increase their occurrence in wastewater treatment facilities cq and hcq compounds could be risky for the environment and should be classified as harmful to aquatic organisms 72 73 in the case of cq there are not reports about the occurrence or fate of this compound in the conventional wastewater treatment plants however lindroos et al 74 reported the degradation of cq as a pharmaceutical compound model with efficiencies higher than 98 in 20 h using a membrane bioreactor for the case of anti viral drugs the european medicines evaluation agency has recommended for compassionate use of the remdesivir although information on the related environmental risk such as ecotoxicity and degradability in the environment is lacking 72 this means that research related to the persistence of this drug in wastewater will be an important topic to consider facing the new normality it is also necessary to evaluate the role of the sars cov 2 as an environmental contaminant and its relation to other viral contaminants water management should consider the presence of enteric viruses such as sars cov 2 to protect public health though the water supply and the environment the sars cov 2 is a serious concern for the irrigation industry particularly for the wastewater stakeholders of the world the irrigation with treated wastewater has low risk since gundy et al 30 for the case of sars cov reported that survival of the coronaviruses in wastewater is between 2 4 d and survival in primary wastewater was only slightly longer than secondary wastewater probably due to the higher level of suspended solids that offer protection from inactivation regarding sars cov 2 prevalence in wastewater half life mean was 0 64 day and 4 3 days required for 99 reduction of infectious virus titers 60 it should be noted that in developing countries the unregulated use of wastewater for irrigation needs to be considered for the wbe in this case methods for irrigation with wastewater without proper treatment may be advised to operate with caution to avoid contact of sars cov 2 currently there is no evidence confirming the survival of sars cov 2 virus after the disinfection process for both drinking water treatment plant and centralized wwtp 21 24 75 however a recent study performed by zhang et al 76 reported the presence of sars cov 2 rna in septic tanks after disinfection with 800 g m 3 of sodium hypochlorite in medical wastewater since medical wastewater may concentrate the sars cov 2 rna disinfection of treated effluent in medical wwtp should follow specific guidelines that include the concentration of sars cov 2 rna copy number in such water matrix the existing disinfection guideline for centralized disinfection of the world health organization 75 suggests a concentration of free chlorine 0 5 mg l 1 after at least 30 min of contact time at ph 8 0 75 in order to ensure a complete inactivation of sars cov 2 in all the centralized treatment systems as it was reported for the medical wwtp the disinfection process must be tested and optimized for the sars cov 2 efficient inactivation depending on the wastewater source the disinfection process in the conventional wwtps e g adsorption advanced oxidation processes ozonation chlorination ultraviolet light and membrane from ultrafiltration to reverse osmosis applied previously to inactivate other coronaviruses can be applied but better understanding of the efficacy of such technologies for sars cov 2 inactivation is needed 77 membrane technology has been applied from long time to remove the virus from water 78 currently membrane technology has been combined with catalytic electrospun 79 and electrocoagulation 80 for virus capture control and remediation from water at lab scale experiments there are also approaches that focus in the adsorption of the virus through cell culture 81 and polysaccharide based resins 82 however protocols during drinking water treatment focused on disinfecting from sars cov 2 are missing 83 the disinfection step in wwtp and drinking water treatment could be the key process to assure the removal or inactivation of sars cov 2 in wastewater and drinking water respectively the implementation of wbe will be a key tool for surveillance assessing and managing the pandemic besides the enhancements in virus concentration and molecular analysis for the detection of sars cov 2 the wbe will employ computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility economy opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally 59 wbe can contribute to solve the pressing problem of insufficient diagnostic testing and provide a cheap and early warning method for future covid 19 outbreaks 22 wbe can also be used as a tool for the decision of the post isolation phase restarting activities and finishing the isolation if the population reinstatement of isolation facing a rebound or seasonal re emergence as earlier alert tool without random diagnostic testing 84 and as a pre screening tool to better target clinical testing needs in communities with limited resources 7 wbe may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance for low income regions 59 such as latin american caribbean central and south africa regions which are emerging as the epicenter of the pandemic 1 in addition the majority of these countries present low coverage in sanitation facilities 34 hence wbe can also be addressed by monitoring surface water such as urban rivers interdisciplinary studies that include epidemiological environmental social and economic interaction as well as transformative innovation are necessary to create strategies to new challenges in the new normality including the current second wave for some countries finally the improvement of the sensitivity of techniques for the detection and quantification of the virus in wastewater especially the concentration methods and pcr amplification and their international validation are key factors to implement the wbe credit authorship contribution statement pabel cervantes avil√©s

13642,currently sars cov 2 has been detected in the influent of wastewater treatment plants wwtp pumping stations manholes sewer networks and sludge of wwtp and facilities of countries as france spain italy netherlands united states australia ecuador brazil and japan although this virus has been detected in the wastewater streams there is no robust method for its detection and quantification in wastewater this review compiled and analyzed the virus concentration approaches applied to detect the sars cov 2 besides to provide insights about the methodology for viral concentration limit of detection occurrence persistence and perspectives post covid 19 related with the implications of the virus presence in wastewater the sars cov 2 detection in wastewater has been related to virus concentration methods which present different recovery rates of the virus the most used viral concentration methods have been the polyethylene glycol peg for precipitation of viral material and the ultrafiltration at molecular weight level after viral concentration the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater are mainly via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr which is the clinical assay adapted for environmental purposes although in some experiments the positive control during rt qpcr is running a surrogated virus e g mengovirus or dengue virus rt qpcr or reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr targeting the gene encoding nucleocapsid n1 n2 and n3 of sars cov 2 are highly recommended to calculate the limit of detection in wastewater samples current results suggest that a rigorous methodology to elucidate the positive cases in a region from genomic copies in wastewater is needed keywords covid 19 coronavirus wastewater treatment plant detection virus concentration wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction the disease caused by the new coronavirus sars cov 2 is officially called covid 19 which has caused a pandemic worldwide with deep impacts on aspects of human life 1 currently october 1st 2020 there are 33 842 281 confirmed cases for covid 19 around the world and 1 010 634 accumulated deaths in 188 territories 1 the high rate of infected people the longtime that takes for the human host to develop antibodies against the virus 2 and the mortality rate 3 are characteristics of the covid 19 which are not common in some other viral diseases detection of sars cov 2 in the sewer networks is essential in the initial stages of community spread moreover early detection in a community reduces the rate of contagion and prevents over saturation of health systems at this time the most common tests to diagnose a person with covid 19 are chest computed tomography ct and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr this last test is based on the multiplication of nucleic acids present in the virus which make the test accurate due to it confirms the genetic presence of sars cov 2 in a person a medium or an object moreover applying rt qpcr can be quantified the genomic units of sars cov 2 this assay is performed to detect different regions of the sars cov 2 genome in human fluids such as rhino pharyngeal oropharyngeal as well as fecal samples surfaces and wastewater the genetic regions of sars cov 2 detected include the envelope protein gene e gene nucleocapsid protein gene n gene or rna dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp gene 4 5 comparative assays among different primer probe sets from those genes showed to be highly specific with no false positive but with different sensitivities regarding to the quantitative presence and fluids 6 the reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr is another technique which has also been applied to quantify the sars cov 2 in wastewater 7 9 in terms of sensitivity falzone et al 10 found that the ddpcr technique has shown higher sensitivity and specificity compared to rt qpcr for the diagnosis of covid 19 in false negative rhino pharyngeal swab samples with low viral load the persistence of sars cov 2 in humans includes its presence in fluids such as urine 11 and feces 12 14 that arrive to the wastewater streams by these excretions in a recent study it was reported that sars cov 2 presence is more common in feces than in urine 15 hence stool can be considered as main contributor of genomic units of the virus in the wastewater streams indistinctly to the source of the excretion of the virus its detection in wastewater streams via surveillance of wastewater is an opportunity to track the pandemic in a covered area by monitoring the sewer networks which may potentially prevent a fast spread of the covid 19 16 17 in fact surveillance of wastewater streams can be considered as an early warning tool this approach is known as wastewater based epidemiology wbe which has been proposed for surveillance of viral diseases such as poliovirus and to track the use of illicit drugs in a determined area 18 19 currently nearly a dozen research groups around the world have performed tests to detect the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater 20 their findings have confirmed the presence of the virus in wastewater and in some cities the sars cov 2 has been detected in wastewater before confirming the first case by the health authorities 21 from the wastewater treatment point of view the road map will include the next milestones i the development of robust methodologies for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater ii application of wastewater based epidemiology wbe as a covid 19 monitoring tool iii analysis and response for possible impacts on the wwtp operation process and technology and iv development of protocols to response to the new diseases including virus or bacterial pandemics this review is focused on the first milestone but the wbe and wastewater treatment post covid 19 are also reviewed the systematic detection of the sars cov 2 in wastewater is needed to set the wbe which can provide useful information on the level of spread of covid 19 in a community in addition to the research needs on the subject of detection of sars cov 2 already compiled by kitajima et al 17 and research needs about of sars cov 2 in the public health already reported by farkas et al 16 there is a basic research need for selecting the most suitable method for viral concentration in wastewater prior its detection by molecular techniques based on pcr the concentration of virus in wastewater samples provides higher resolution when a molecular technique for detection is applied several studies reported via formal peer reviewed publication the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater and related their findings to the epidemiological behavior however the methodologies applied to detect the virus have not been standardized in a robust one hence to generate a robust method for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater the methodologies applied for viral concentration before its detection must be analyzed in formal studies moreover facing the new normality perspectives about the presence on the virus in wastewater in a post covid 19 scenario are also demanded this review compiles and analyze the sars cov 2 approaches and protocols for viral concentration detection occurrence and persistence in wastewater in order to provide insights and best practices as well as needs and perspectives for the wastewater treatment post covid 19 2 detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater one of the major challenges in sars cov 2 detection and quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol 22 however there are overall considerations in the protocols already applied for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater these considerations can be categorized as steps for virus detection in wastewater which include the sampling timing and conditions virus inactivation e g heat treatment pasteurization of the sample the correct use of protective equipment for virus handle grit and solids removal in some samples concentration of the virus detection of the virus and quantification of the genetic units of the virus all these steps will be discussed in this section 2 1 sample collection handling and storing of the wastewater samples according to the population based health management analysis proposed by thompson et al 23 the upstream sampling of multiple locations may provide higher spatial resolution related to positive cases per inhabitants when compared to downstream sampling e g influent of wwtp which presents higher travel time of the wastewater and may present signal degradation although sample collection could be random through collection of single samples at an arbitrary time the timing of sampling has influenced the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater sherchan et al 24 found that the sampling method is critical and that composite samples of 24 h may provide the most reliable daily average of viral concentration in wastewater moreover sampling protocols should consider the inactivation time of the coronavirus in wastewater that could be between 2 3 and 3 5 days at 23 c 25 however the temperature during collection and preservation may play an important role in virus degradation in recently reported studies the preservation temperature of collected samples for has been 4 c or 20 c table 1 without a clear trend toward lower rna signals when the samples are stored at 4 c for almost two weeks 26 ahmed et al 27 demonstrated that the sars cov 2 rna signal is unlikely to degrade significantly at the temperatures of storing 4 c for at least 10 d nevertheless the decay in rna signal is influenced by the temperatures 15 c 25 c and 37 c water matrix tap water or wastewater and thermal treating of the samples by autoclaving 27 sherchan et al 24 processed wastewater samples stored at 80 c between 1 and 2 months before the pandemic which tested negative since first case was reported a month later although the majority of samples are processed within 12 h after collection reprocessing stored samples under different temperatures is needed in order to determine the potential bias in the detection and sensitivity during storage regarding the handling of samples potentially containing sars cov 2 they should be handled according to the subsequent use of samples for example since infectious sars cov 2 is classified as a biosafety level 3 bsl 3 culturing of samples that potentially contain sars cov 2 requires bsl 3 guidelines 4 nevertheless procedures that concentrate viruses such as precipitation or membrane filtration can be performed in a bsl 2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow although there is no evidence that infectious sars cov 2 is present in wastewater streams samples can be submitted to heat treatment e g 30 min at 60 c before opening containers to increase the safety of the workers who perform the analysis 28 29 since this procedure can inactivate the potentially infectious agents present in the samples the effect of heat treatment of wastewater samples e g pasteurization or autoclaving on rna signal intensity of coronaviruses is a topic with few insights and contradictory findings that represents a research need while the high persistence of rna signal intensity of sars cov 2 over time up to 10 d in autoclaved wastewater samples has been attributed to changes in the physicochemical characteristics of wastewater after the autoclaving them 27 the recovery rate of rna of coronaviruses can decrease after heat treatment due to its weak resistance and high sensitivity to the environmental factors such as temperature 30 and chlorine ions 31 as well as to the presence of rnases which are present even in autoclaved samples 32 in addition special care must take into account during virus inactivation and virus concentration some bsl 3 precautions are recommended some studies removed the grit and solids from the matrix before and after to viral rna concentration and isolation from wastewater samples which mainly consisted in two ways for removing larger and dense particles from wastewater table 1 filtration 0 45 0 20 Œºm 33 and centrifugation 8 24 28 it should be highlighted that when filtration and centrifugation are applied the biomass retained in filters or pellets can be analyzed to quantify the presence of rna which will allow to consider that value for full quantitative purposes 2 2 concentration of the virus in wastewater the viral concentration is a key step for detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater due to its concentration decreases by dilution in wastewater streams the approaches applied for this purpose are multiple and include the one used for poliovirus concentration based on two phase separation method 36 precipitation 21 centrifugation 37 38 ultrafiltration 8 38 conventional filtration 33 and filtration by negatively charged membranes 39 and a combination of these approaches table 1 although there are efficient methods to concentrate enveloped virus such as coronaviruses from wastewater 40 and tap water 41 the specific efficiency in recovering sars cov 2 may perform differently therefore it is highly recommended to determine the recovery rate of the virus for the concentration method applied in this review the methods for sars cov 2 concentration are grouped in two categories the physicochemical based and the strictly physical based methods fig 1 the physicochemical based methods incorporate the use of chemical reagents in some steps of physical separation for the extraction and concentration of the virus chemical reagents include the combined used of the polymer polyethylene glycol peg with nacl dextran or alum in order to perform a liquid liquid fractionation aqueous two phase technique with potential for the extraction separation purification and enrichment of viruses the miscibility of solutions containing polymers results in the formation of two phases separating the solute selectively in one phase 42 the use of al oh 3 and alcl3 with ph adjustment by addition of hcl has been addressed in order to precipitate the viral content due to the modification of surface charge in the virus in general the incorporation of chemicals reagents considers reaction and incubation time which even can be for overnight periods for phases separation fig 1 finally the extraction and amplification of genetic information are performed in the extracted or precipitated phase according to the reported studies most of the physicochemical approaches for virus concentration take more time up to 15 5 h and they involve more steps than the strictly physical methods although the physicochemical based approaches can include some physical steps such as filtration and centrifugation their effectiveness for virus concentration is attributed to the chemical adsorption 36 43 the strictly physical based methods for viral concentration mainly applied a combination of centrifugation and filtration or ultracentrifugation and resuspension fig 1 although the reported physical based protocols for sars cov 2 concentration take less than 1 4 h to be completed centrifugal ultrafilters with cut off up to 100 kda units for centrifugation of high volume equipment for ultracentrifugation or ultrafiltration units may be required some studies have tested the effectiveness of methods for viral concentration of sars cov 2 in wastewater ahmed et al 27 found inconsistent results in sars cov 2 concentration and recovery when they compared the electronegative membranes with the ultrafiltration tubes with a cut off at 10 kda of molecular weight mw in the same study it was used murine hepatitis virus mhv as surrogate of sars cov 2 and it was found that adsorption extraction methods for viral concentration could recover up to 65 of mhv 43 it is important to highlight that mhv and sars cov 2 are enveloped virus from the same genus betacoronavirus 44 share similar genomic structure and envelope glycoproteins spike 45 hence the recovery rates could be close between both virus even though as the recovery rate depends on the wastewater matrix high recoveries may not be observed at all times thus variations on the recovery are expected randazzo et al 21 validate the al oh 3 adsorption precipitation method using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and mengovirus mgv reporting recovery efficiencies of 11 of both virus in influent samples in the same sense using mengovirus as surrogate virus no significant loss of rna was reported for heat treating the wastewater samples 28 medema et al 8 validated the purification and concentration steps using the ultrafiltration method 100 kda membranes reporting a recovery efficiency of 73 50 n 16 of f specific rna phages meanwhile the rna extraction and rt qpcr steps showed a recovery efficiency of 30 4 22 3 using an internal control rna validate the methods for sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater is a current need for analytical protocols and to strengthen the wastewater based epidemiology studies also the need of reference materials for rt qpcr quantification has been recommended to allow intra and interlaboratory comparison of rt qpcr results for sars cov 2 surveillance in wastewater 8 2 3 detection and quantification of the virus the method more used to detect and quantify the sars cov 2 in wastewater has been rt qpcr table 1 which is part of the second generation of pcr although this method can detect the regions orf1a orf1b e and n of the sars cov 2 genome n or nucleocapsids have been the most used target during assays after rna extraction of viral concentrated from wastewater 8 46 the commercial availability of nucleocapsids n1 and n2 primer probe sets has facilitated their use during detection assays in wastewater even when some reagents for covid 19 detection have limited availability to conduct tests 20 nucleocapsid region has also been used to determine the limit of detection lod during quantitative analysis that has ranged from 2 log10 7 to 4 45 log10 copies per liter of wastewater 21 these quantitative results for sars cov 2 have been validated theoretically for lod regarding to the spiked concentration in addition to the quality controls to measure the recovery efficiency during the rna concentration and isolation steps some studies have included other controls during the quantification as internal reference and indicators of pcr inhibition like sketa 22 assa oncorhynchus keta and Œ≤ actin 39 as well human crassphage was used by green et al 47 pre print as internal control for normalizing sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater samples similarly pepper mild mottle virus has been used as internal control for detection of sars cov 2 35 48 since positives and internal control assays follow different targets even with different nucleocapsids the determination of limit of detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater is unclear and not rigorous in terms of analytical protocols the use of noninfectious sars cov 2 or a positive fecal samples in wastewater in order to set the limit of detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater could be an approach that increase the reliability of the quantitative methods 21 besides rt qpcr rt ddpcr could be used to detect and quantify sars cov 2 in wastewater gonzalez et al 7 this last tool has presented higher sensitivity in human samples than rt qpcr 10 49 gonzalez et al 7 used a rt ddpcr assay and determined theoretical lod in wastewater of n1 n2 and n3 which were 14 6 2 and 2 18 copies per reaction respectively the n2 assay results were used in the work performed by gonzalez et al 7 as they were the most sensitive and presented sars cov 2 concentrations in wastewater samples between 101 and 104 copies per 100 m l 1 during the 21 week study in southeastern virginia in another study falzone et al 10 performed a comparison between rt qpcr and ddpcr sensivity in human positive rhino pharyngeal swab samples and found that sensitivity of ddpcr permitted the identification of positive signals in undiluted samples and in the 10 fold dilution demonstrating that ddpcr is effective in the detection of very low viral load although rt ddpcr has been more sensitive in rhino pharyngeal samples 10 49 research is needed to compare the sensitivity of various methods including rt qpcr and rt ddpcr in wastewater samples table 2 shows the advantages and disadvantages of rt ddpcr and rt qpcr 3 occurrence of sars cov 2 in wastewater the virus that causes covid 19 has been detected in the wastewater of several cities and regions around the world table 3 although the majority of samples were collected at the influent of the wwtp sampling points in the sewer network manholes hospital wastewater and pumping stations were also monitored to delimit the scope of the study the sampling dates were different for all experiments but ranged from february 3rd to april 25th for samples collected in some municipalities of murcia spain such as lorca cieza and totana positive results of sars cov 2 in wastewater alerted covid 19 cases 12 16 days before first cases were declared 21 the same was reported for amersfoort netherlands where wastewater samples on march 5th resulted positive few days before the first case in the city was confirmed 8 these findings strongly suggest that surveillance of the untreated wastewater streams may contribute to monitoring the pandemic however the limited availability of the reagents for covid 19 detection should be considered to avoid a shortage of the reagents for clinical purposes nonetheless it is important to mention that reagents used for research are commonly tag as research use only and they should not be utilized for clinical diagnose although the sars cov 2 has been detected in untreated wastewater this virus has also been detected in 2 18 samples of treated effluent after wastewater passed throughout the activated sludge process as secondary treatment moreover all samples after tertiary treatment e g coagulation flocculation uv or naclo resulted as negative 21 this highlights the relevance of disinfection processes with physicochemical technologies as chlorine based ones to eliminate the presence of genetic material of the virus as previously reported for sars cov 31 utilities appear to identify their important role in water treatment and disinfection 53 given that there is the possibility of finding sars cov 2 rna in the secondary effluent and considering that is unclear whether the virus is potentially infectious at this stage of treatment a disinfection process is recommended for those systems with only secondary treatment to prevent the circulation of sars cov 2 titers in secondary effluent water the presence of sars cov 2 rna in the primary sludge and waste activated sludge was recently detected in 7 wwtp of istanbul turkey 54 pre print titers of sars cov 2 rna in primary sludge and waste activated sludge ranged from 1 17 104 to 4 02 104 per liter of sludge these concentrations may vary depending on the solids concentration in samples and on the sources of the samples for example the of sars cov 2 rna copy number detected in the suspended solids of raw wastewater 55 were lower than those reported previously for waste sludge 54 pre print westhaus et al 55 filtered 45 ml of raw wastewater and compared the sars cov 2 rna copy number present in the wastewater phase and in the pellet that resulted of the ultrafiltration by 10 kda the experiment indicated that the solid phase of samples of raw wastewater are one log unit higher of sars cov 2 rna copy number per ml 25 copies ml 1 than to the aqueous phase of the inflow sample 1 8 copies ml 1 cheung et al 56 detected sars cov 2 rna in fecal matter and found median fecal viral load of 5 1 log10 copies per ml in patients with diarrhea while for patients without diarrhea was 3 9 log10 copies per ml these results support that the titers of the virus could remain in the fecal matter and other suspended solids present in the wastewater these findings also suggest the presence of titers of sars cov 2 in the disposed sludge from wwtps hence further disinfection of the waste sludge could be needed before sludge disposal while occurrence studies of the virus in the waste sludge are still under research nevertheless comprehensive studies related to the fate of sars cov 2 rna in waste sludge digested sludge or biosolids 57 as well as studies determining whether or not the virus in the sludge may be infectious are also needed 4 persistence of sars cov 2 in wastewater the environmental conditions e g temperature humidity particulate material among others related to the sars cov 2 spread have recently considered in some studies 22 25 58 59 since they affect the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 and its rna signal the physicochemical conditions of the wastewater streams may influence the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 and its rna signal 60 some ions in the wastewater may alter the membrane protein of sars cov 2 as ions altered the membrane of the sars cov which is a virus from the same subgenus sarbecovirus as sars cov 2 and has hydrophobic and selective for monovalent cations membrane protein 61 although sars cov 2 has been less resistant than bacteria to chlorine concentration in water 46 some coronavirus can persist in wastewater up to 3 5 days at 23 c 25 wang et al 31 suggest that sars cov persists in fecal samples for 3 days and in urine samples for 17 days and that sars cov is more vulnerable to disinfectants than e coli and f2 phage although this virus from the same subgenus than sars cov 2 may persist for some time in water the potential transmission of infectious sars cov 2 through wastewater streams has not been confirmed 8 46 it means that the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater does not imply that the virus is able to infect humans 62 since the transmission is linked to the viability of the virus in wastewater research focused in virus stability in the environmental matrices distinguishing infectious and noninfectious virus and determination of the persistence factors of sars cov 2 in wastewater are needed regarding waste solids sars cov rna has been detected in the feces of infected individuals sars cov rna levels showed a maximum in fecal samples up to 14 days after the onset of the illness in one case fecal samples tested positive for the virus for up to 73 days after the illness onset 63 therefore it is probable that sewage sludge from an area with infected people can contain sars cov 2 rna 15 however the survival of sars cov 2 in biosolids would be very low at temperatures higher than 20 c 25 actually there is no evidence for transmission of sars cov 2 via solid waste 64 5 wastewater based epidemiology of the sars cov 2 the study of the several compounds in wastewater such as illicit drugs and biological agents as hepatitis a virus and norovirus have provided early warnings of outbreaks 18 62 for this reason the quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of the virus among the population via wbe 39 which is a promising strategy for monitoring the spread of sars cov 2 or resurgence the basic principle of wbe is that sewage can be used as an indicator of the scale of infected inhabitants and their use will boost worldwide attention and interest in wbe however there are some limitations in the wbe application for covid 19 pandemic specially the related to the rna excretion assumptions of the virus an example is that not all covid 19 positive patients excrete sars cov 2 in feces 21 another issue is that concentration of the titers in stool varies between patients and there is no evidence that such concentrations are potentially infectious 12 estimates of viral load in stool from positive patients are also unclear a couple of recent publications suggest levels of 600 000 genomic units per ml of fecal material 65 and 30 000 000 genomic units per ml of fecal material 66 hence to strengthen the wbe of the covid 19 insights about the rate of excretion of genomic units via feces per patient as well as the persistence of the titer in the wastewater media is demanded another concern for the validation of wbe for covid 19 spread is the sars cov 2 rna prevalence in the wastewater the time for 90 titer reduction of rna quantification t90 in wastewater is dependent on temperature with 27 8 20 4 12 6 8 04 days at 4 15 25 and 37 c respectively 27 a similar t90 value of 26 days resulted at low rna titers at 20 c 60 in those studies the decay rate constant k of sars cov 2 rna ranged from 0 08 to 0 29 day 1 when the k values were log10 transformed and linear regression was used to characterize the relationship between temperature from 4 to 37 c and first order decay rate constant 27 60 these k values imply that rna could be detected at least 4 days after its shedding in sewage in addition to the decay rate of the virus proper sampling and sample preserving and transportation temperature the hydraulic retention time of the sewer distribution system should be considered in the wbe studies therefore the wbe application s key factor will be the development of a robust protocol for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater focusing on the effective concentration methods before the subsequent rna extraction and rt qpcr detection 67 wbe has demonstrated the feasibility of being used as an inexpensive technique to monitor and manage the health and behavior of human populations simulations with data from 2017 obtained in 13 940 wwtp of usa demonstrated the potential sensitivity of wbe for generating skewed data 68 wbe has also been used as a tool to monitor drugs consumption or exposure to environmental and food contaminants for example it has been applied to estimate tobacco consumption in seven regions of spain reporting the differences in regional consumption however no conclusive correlation was found between those values and the prevalence data taken from two different national surveys nor sociodemographic and health data 69 wbe can be a powerful tool for specific cases as the covid 19 using wwtp data but need to be complemented with other indicators to assess the disease accurately including the correct characterization of the sewage system maps flows etc and the existing clinical results few studies present consistent results of covid 19 surveillance using wbe for instance in southeastern virginia usa the rna data from weekly samples of nine wwtps presented spatially and temporally with regional loading estimates over time were considered as viable way to describe the occurrence and trends onset in sars cov 2 infection 7 however the lack of a reliable sars cov 2 stool shedding rate is the current limitation in the use of wbe to estimate total infection within a community 7 the authors recommend future work to examine the lead lag association between sars cov 2 wastewater data and regional confirmed clinical data with a similar aim a technical bulletin of sars cov 2 rna surveillance from sewage at belo horizonte brazil correlated the reported covid 19 cases with the estimated cases using the typical viral load from sick individuals and the genomic viral copies from sewage 70 the trend of rna concentration in sewage allowed to infer that prevalence of covid 19 was higher than the confirmed cases by local health authorities furthermore percentage of infected people were estimated by regional maps delimited by the 15 monitored sewage sub basins where concern areas were identified due to the increasing rna concentration in the sewage 70 another study in the new haven connecticut usa metropolitan area showed that sars cov 2 rna concentration in primary sludge of wwtp wastewater treatment facilities was up to 8 days ahead from the sars cov 2 positive test results by reporting date 71 6 perspectives for the wastewater treatment post covid 19 the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater generates concerns for the wwtp in the future i occurrence of new pollutants in wwtp ii efficient disinfection and sanitary concerns for the presence of the virus in wwtp iii wastewater management to protect public health and environment and iv implementation of wwtp results in the wbe for monitor of covid 19 the development of new drugs and treatments for the covid 19 e g remdesivir hydroxychloroquine hcq chloroquine cq among others will increase their occurrence in wastewater treatment facilities cq and hcq compounds could be risky for the environment and should be classified as harmful to aquatic organisms 72 73 in the case of cq there are not reports about the occurrence or fate of this compound in the conventional wastewater treatment plants however lindroos et al 74 reported the degradation of cq as a pharmaceutical compound model with efficiencies higher than 98 in 20 h using a membrane bioreactor for the case of anti viral drugs the european medicines evaluation agency has recommended for compassionate use of the remdesivir although information on the related environmental risk such as ecotoxicity and degradability in the environment is lacking 72 this means that research related to the persistence of this drug in wastewater will be an important topic to consider facing the new normality it is also necessary to evaluate the role of the sars cov 2 as an environmental contaminant and its relation to other viral contaminants water management should consider the presence of enteric viruses such as sars cov 2 to protect public health though the water supply and the environment the sars cov 2 is a serious concern for the irrigation industry particularly for the wastewater stakeholders of the world the irrigation with treated wastewater has low risk since gundy et al 30 for the case of sars cov reported that survival of the coronaviruses in wastewater is between 2 4 d and survival in primary wastewater was only slightly longer than secondary wastewater probably due to the higher level of suspended solids that offer protection from inactivation regarding sars cov 2 prevalence in wastewater half life mean was 0 64 day and 4 3 days required for 99 reduction of infectious virus titers 60 it should be noted that in developing countries the unregulated use of wastewater for irrigation needs to be considered for the wbe in this case methods for irrigation with wastewater without proper treatment may be advised to operate with caution to avoid contact of sars cov 2 currently there is no evidence confirming the survival of sars cov 2 virus after the disinfection process for both drinking water treatment plant and centralized wwtp 21 24 75 however a recent study performed by zhang et al 76 reported the presence of sars cov 2 rna in septic tanks after disinfection with 800 g m 3 of sodium hypochlorite in medical wastewater since medical wastewater may concentrate the sars cov 2 rna disinfection of treated effluent in medical wwtp should follow specific guidelines that include the concentration of sars cov 2 rna copy number in such water matrix the existing disinfection guideline for centralized disinfection of the world health organization 75 suggests a concentration of free chlorine 0 5 mg l 1 after at least 30 min of contact time at ph 8 0 75 in order to ensure a complete inactivation of sars cov 2 in all the centralized treatment systems as it was reported for the medical wwtp the disinfection process must be tested and optimized for the sars cov 2 efficient inactivation depending on the wastewater source the disinfection process in the conventional wwtps e g adsorption advanced oxidation processes ozonation chlorination ultraviolet light and membrane from ultrafiltration to reverse osmosis applied previously to inactivate other coronaviruses can be applied but better understanding of the efficacy of such technologies for sars cov 2 inactivation is needed 77 membrane technology has been applied from long time to remove the virus from water 78 currently membrane technology has been combined with catalytic electrospun 79 and electrocoagulation 80 for virus capture control and remediation from water at lab scale experiments there are also approaches that focus in the adsorption of the virus through cell culture 81 and polysaccharide based resins 82 however protocols during drinking water treatment focused on disinfecting from sars cov 2 are missing 83 the disinfection step in wwtp and drinking water treatment could be the key process to assure the removal or inactivation of sars cov 2 in wastewater and drinking water respectively the implementation of wbe will be a key tool for surveillance assessing and managing the pandemic besides the enhancements in virus concentration and molecular analysis for the detection of sars cov 2 the wbe will employ computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility economy opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally 59 wbe can contribute to solve the pressing problem of insufficient diagnostic testing and provide a cheap and early warning method for future covid 19 outbreaks 22 wbe can also be used as a tool for the decision of the post isolation phase restarting activities and finishing the isolation if the population reinstatement of isolation facing a rebound or seasonal re emergence as earlier alert tool without random diagnostic testing 84 and as a pre screening tool to better target clinical testing needs in communities with limited resources 7 wbe may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance for low income regions 59 such as latin american caribbean central and south africa regions which are emerging as the epicenter of the pandemic 1 in addition the majority of these countries present low coverage in sanitation facilities 34 hence wbe can also be addressed by monitoring surface water such as urban rivers interdisciplinary studies that include epidemiological environmental social and economic interaction as well as transformative innovation are necessary to create strategies to new challenges in the new normality including the current second wave for some countries finally the improvement of the sensitivity of techniques for the detection and quantification of the virus in wastewater especially the concentration methods and pcr amplification and their international validation are key factors to implement the wbe credit authorship contribution statement pabel cervantes avil√©s

13643,the unique properties of nanomaterials provide a promising solution for environmental applications thus three nanomaterials based on manganese birnessite type in the form of well structured nanowires and nanoflowers were synthesized by soft hydrothermal treatment simple economical and without adding reagents or any other processes interlayer alkali cations k h and na inserted in the birnessite structure have demonstrated their effect on the structural and morphological properties of the nanomaterials and consequently on their metal ions removal efficiency k mno2 nanowires with inserted k ions were characterized by high performance in short processing time 5 min compared to other nanomaterials the maximum adsorption quantities were respectively for pb ii k mno2 300 mg g na

adsorption capacity x ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the heavy metal ions got adsorbed onto the nanomaterials as pbo and cd oh 2 these results confirm the performance of non agglomerated nanowires and nanoflowers nanomaterials based on manganese in an efficient kinetically fast metal ions removal with important stability and adsorption capacity keywords manganese oxide mesoporous nanomaterials alkali cations heavy metals adsorption regeneration 1 introduction heavy metals are considered one of the most toxic elements and a major source of water and environmental pollution 1 the accumulation of these heavy metals in the human body can cause subsequent health problems 2 3 heavy metals are also characterized by their non biological degradability presented a serious problem for living organisms 4 as a result there was a strong requirement for techniques to reduce or eliminate some heavy metals such as membrane filtration 5 6 chemical precipitation 7 flocculation 8 ion exchange 9 the methods universally adopted by industries to treat effluents are limited due to various economic and technological factors such as the complexity of process implementation high cost and limited capacity 10 due to the limited application of these techniques adsorption technology is considered to be one of the most appropriate processes for the heavy metals removal from wastewater 11 among the adsorbents used are activated carbon 12 polymers 13 inorganic materials 14 zeolite 15 and clay 16 17 the use of most adsorbents can represent several disadvantages such as low selectivity and adsorption capacity long equilibrium time complicated conception and high investment cost 18 several studies have used ligands for metal ions detection such as pb ii m rahman et al 19 synthesized ligands based on benzo d 1 3 dioxole carbaldehyde benzenesulfonylhydrazine bsh and 4 methyl benzenesulphonylhydrazine 4 mbsh were used to selectively detect heavy metal ions indeed other organic ligands were grafted onto the mesoporous silica 20 21 composite materials were also used to detect pb ii ions such as materials functionalized by organic ligands 22 nanosheets integrated cuo zno 23 surfactant assisted graphene oxide methylaniline 24 graphene oxide carbon nanotube poly o toluidine 25 sno2 sb2o3 26 and ni zno nanoparticles 27 the cadmium ions detection was also investigated by several research works rabiul awual et al 28 developed nanocomposites based on mesoporous silica monoliths by a method of direct templating of the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase nanomaterials were also used based on functionalized polyethersulfone and conjugated ternary znycdo 29 and zinc oxide nanosheets 30 the electrochemical detection of cadmium ions was achieved using materials as electrode based on carbon 31 e 4 methyl n 1 pyridin 2 yl ethylidene benzenesulfonohydrazide 32 and poly n methylaniline ce2 wo4 3 cnt nanocomposites 33 probes based on manganese were fabricated to detect some toxic compounds such as probes based on cuo mno2 gd2o3 synthesized by hydrothermal approach 34 indeed m asiri et al developed a sensor based on e n chlorobenzylidene benzenesulfonohydrazide cbbsh molecules for monitoring toxic heavy metal ions such as ag2 au3 cd2 co2 cr3 cu2 others sensors based on manganese mno2 sno2 35 and Œ± mno2 co3o4 36 exhibited their performance to detect gold iii and chloride ions respectively in recent years nanotechnology has attracted much attention due to its ability to the nanoparticle size control of some nanomaterials characterized by a variety of relatively unique properties not found in higher sized materials 1 that are transformed from micro to nano scale 37 these developed nanomaterials are used in several fields such as wastewater treatment power production and catalytic degradation 38 41 this is due to their small size high reactivity and high specific surface indeed the use of nanomaterials has displayed a high efficiency compared to previously studied adsorbents due to their high specific surface area 42 in effect several nano sized adsorbents developed in the form of ceo2 nanoparticles 43 graphene oxide nanosheets 44 carbon nanotubes 45 silica nanospheres 46 mgo and al2o3 nanoparticles 47 indeed despite the development of these nanomaterials they pose further problems related to wastewater separation and the complexity of preparation etc moreover the use of these nanomaterials can cause aggregation or agglomeration of their nanoparticles in the study medium and therefore provoke a loss of sorption capacity 48 to solve these problems several studies have used nanometric metal oxides such as bentonite 49 sand 50 diatomite 51 or supports such as polymers with a porous nature such as cation exchange resin to inhibit agglomeration and to improve the dispersion of these nanoparticles and also to increase the diffusion speed of metal ions however the use of this type of support requires a high investment cost as well as the addition of toxic agents and reagents can cause significant secondary pollution 52 one of the nanometric materials attracting great interest is manganese oxides characterized by its large specific surface area environmental friendliness and its high oxidation and adsorption capacity 53 54 the family of manganese oxide more precisely the lamellar structures is characterized by ordered octahedral layers mno6 55 and separated by water layers as well as alkali alkaline earth cations na k ca2 mg2 ect this space is 7 √• and 10 √• for birnessite and buserite respectively 56 indeed the materials surface is covered by surface hydroxyl groups oh making their surface negatively charged 57 these groups are considered as the sites responsible for the retention metal ions positively charged by electrostatic interactions 58 these properties make these manganese oxide materials as efficient adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in an aqueous medium several works have focused on developing different types of manganese oxide with a nanometric structure and better porosity to achieve better adsorption in the shortest possible equilibrium time indeed kamel et al 59 reported manganese oxide mn3o4 type allows the adsorption of 0 34 mg g of as v maliyekkal et al 60 developed a composite material based on cellulose and manganese oxide to adsorb a quantity of 80 1 mg g pb ii in an aqueous medium at a ph 5 other studies used hydrated manganese oxide supported by biochar to remove cd ii ions recording an adsorbed quantity of 150 mg g 48 however the use of these nanometric nanomaterials has proven to be sensitive to agglomerate in the aqueous medium causing a change in morphology and consequently a decrease in disposal efficiency as well as being difficult to reuse for possible cycles 61 little work was realized to study the stability and effect of inserted cations alkali alkaline earth during the nanomaterials elaboration on their morphology porosity and performance for the metal ions removal this work aims to i synthesis manganese oxide nanomaterials named k mno2 and h mno2 birnessite type structure using simple soft and non toxic methods the adopted protocol was performed in order to form nanoscale nanomaterials in the form of non agglomerated nanowires and nanoflowers to avoid the problem of reduced performance due to agglomeration of these nanoparticles ii study of the effect of k and h interlayer alkali cations on the structural morphological and adsorption capacity of nanomaterials iii investigate the feasibility of k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials for removal of pb ii and cd ii from aqueous solutions iv examine the effect of several parameters such as ph metal ion concentration on the removal

hydrochloric acid solution hcl 4 m was added dropwise to potassium permanganate solution kmno4 0 2 m 250 ml previously heated at 80 c the reaction mixture was kept heated at 80 c under continuous stirring 250 rpm for one hour the resulting brown solution was maintained under stirring at 50 c for 17 h the black precipitate was vacuum filtered with a membrane porosity of 0 20 Œºm and washed with distilled water until the ph was 6 7 and dried at 60 c for 12 h the h mno2 nanomaterial was elaborated by exchanging k ions inserted in the k mno2 nanomaterial by h ions 2 g of k mno2 nanomaterial was treated by nitric acid solution hno3 0 1 m 100 ml under stirring 500 rpm at room temperature for 2 days the product was isolated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min and washed with distilled water until the ph of the supernatant was neutral the black powder was dried at 60 c for 12 h the na mno2 nanomaterial was prepared according to the redox method in an alkaline solution described in the literature 63 2 3 chemical analysis the chemical composition of the elaborated nanomaterials was determined by the powder dissolution 0 1 g into a hydroxylamine hydrochloride reagent solution

line at 284 8 ev the spectra processing was performed with the casa xps software 2 5 sorption experiment studies of metal ion removal by the elaborated nanomaterials were carried out by introducing 0 1 g of k mno2 or h mno2 nanomaterial into pb ii or cd ii ions solution 30 mg l 50 ml at room temperature the interaction time effect was investigated by monitoring metal ion removal efficiencies from the first 5 min to 6 h the effect of ph on adsorption performance was examined by adjusting the ph of solutions in a range of 2 0 9 0 by sulfuric acid h2so4 0 1 m or sodium hydroxide naoh 0 1 m

plasma atomic emission spectrometry icpaes 65 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 66 etc indeed several advantages were proved by these techniques such as high precision sensitivity and simultaneous determination of the metal ion concentration for a wide range of elements 67 recent work has developed other techniques to detect trace metal ions in contaminated mediums in this present work we adopted atomic absorption spectrophotometry as a technique for the metal ions detection pb ii and cd ii in aqueous medium the detection of metal ions by atomic absorption spectroscopy requires the conversion of the sample into gaseous atoms which absorbed radiation the solution was drawn through a small tube and transported to the nebulizer which transformed the liquid or gaseous samples into a fine mist the samples were then mixed with a transport gas which produces a flame decomposing and atomizing the sample for analysis before analyzing the contaminated solutions a calibration curve was prepared using 4 5 different concentrations by diluting a stock standard solution 1000 ppm the metal ion concentration detection was performed using atomic absorption

diffraction fig 1 presents xrd measurements recorded on the k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials the diffractograms of the k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials fig 1 illustrated a high crystallinity with defined peaks at specified positions the two nanomaterials were identified as a lamellar structure characterized by four peaks attributed to manganese oxide birnessite type jcpds 52 0556 68 69 this type of manganese oxide has also identified in our previous studies having different structure and chemical formula jcpds 01 073 9669 named na mno2 63 the elaborated nanomaterials belong to the family of two dimensional layered pure birnessite composed by alternate stacking of alkali cations such as k h or na and octahedral layers mno6 separated by interlayer distances of 7 178 7 049 7 14 √• for k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively table 1 according to fig 1 a decrease in the peak crystallinity of h mno2 nanomaterial was detected and specifically the peak located at 2Œ∏ 12 based on these results the cation inserted k h in the formed structures has an effect on the nanomaterials crystallinity thus possibly affecting their behavior towards metal ions the decrease in the peak crystallinity of h mno2 was due to the acidification process of the nanomaterial k mno2 by hno3 allowing cation exchange to be performed without changing the birnessite structure 69 3 2 mn average oxidation state and elemental chemical analysis the chemical analysis of the elaborated nanomaterials was carried out to determine their chemical properties table 2 represents the elemental chemical composition the manganese average oxidation state mn aos and the chemical formula for each nanomaterial the chemical analysis table 2 indicated that nanomaterials contained significant manganese total quantities of 376 23 and 367 23 ppm for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively for the two lamellar nanomaterials the potassium ions concentration decreased from 62 11 ppm for k mno2 to 41 96 ppm for h mno2 indeed the molar ratio k mn was 0 165 and 0 114 in k mno2 and h mno2 respectively these results proved that during the synthesis of h mno2 an exchange of k ions present in the interlayer space of the k mno2 nanomaterial was carried out with h ions from added nitric acid hno3 producing a decrease of the k mn ratio the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by a high mn average oxidation state mn aos with 99 and 98 of mn iv recorded for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively table 2 k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials registered mn aos higher than na mno2 lamellar material 3 580 63 3 3 scanning electron microscope the synthesized nanomaterials morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy sem the images obtained are illustrated in fig 2 sem image of k mno2 nanomaterial fig 2a shaped from uniform nanowires or very thin rods whereas the h mno2 nanomaterial fig 2b consists of spheroidal nanoflowers composed of lamellar plates indeed the two nanomaterials revealed they have a non agglomerated nanoscale morphology for the same type of manganese oxide with na ions inserted in the octahedral layers a different morphology was produced in the form of nanoparticles with several micrometers sem characterization proved the cation exchange k to h during synthesis affected the nanomaterials morphology k mno2 nanowires could have relatively large surfaces due to their small size and two dimensional morphologies in this context the diameter distribution of the formed nanoparticles fig 3 was determined by analyzing the scanning electron microscopy images with the software image j according to fig 3 the nanowires and nanoflowers were composed of different diameters the nanowires constituting the k mno2 nanomaterial were characterized by diameters ranging from 0 0196 to 0 096 Œºm while the diameters of the h mno2 nanoflowers were varied from 1 22 to 4 55 Œºm based on these results k mno2 and h mno2 recorded an average diameter of 0 034 and 2 44 Œºm respectively these results demonstrated the conversion of k mno2 nanomaterial to h mno2 cation exchange k to h increased the nanoparticles diameter indicating the nanomaterial k mno2 has small nanowires thus promoting the diffusion phenomenon metal ions on the surface and therefore improving the adsorption process 3 4 specific surface area and pore distribution the specific surface area measurement pore size for k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials were determined using the braunauer emett and teller bet and barrett joyner hanlenda bjh methods the bet isotherm can be described by the eq s1 the graphical representation of 1 q p 0 p 1 as a function of p p 0 has a linear appearance fig 4 table 3 presents the isothermal parameters for bet models according to fig 4 and table 3 the nanomaterials were characterized by a large specific surface area of 44 902 and 40 326 m2 g for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively based on these results it could be noticed a specific surface area reduction of the nanomaterials during cation exchange k to h from 44 902 to 40 326 m2 g hence the effect of inserted ions on the structural properties of nanomaterials the nanomaterials pore size distribution was determined by n2 adsorption desorption studies the resulting isotherms and barrett joyner hanlenda bjh diagrams are represented in fig s1 fig s1 illustrated a progressive increase in the adsorbed gas quantity as a function of the relative equilibrium pressure the curves of both nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 have a type iii shape corresponds to materials with high porosity according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry classification iupac 70 a pore size classification suggested by iupac was used to determine pore size using the bjh method fig s1 revealed a wide pore size distribution and consequently a wide surface area distribution table s1 demonstrated the adsorption and desorption average pore diameters of the bjh model and the cumulative adsorption desorption volume for both nanomaterials pore distribution analysis revealed both nanomaterials were composed of more than 60 mesopores relative to the total pore surface suggesting the nanomaterials have a homogeneous mesoporous character and the total pore size was between 20 and 50 √• these results were consistent with the adopted hypothesis the adsorption isotherms were type iii for k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials attributed to mesoporous materials solids the analysis also indicated that the average pore diameter for the k mno2 was higher than h mno2 table s1 demonstrating the effect of inserted ions on the nanomaterials pore size and textural properties indeed the na mno2 material was also characterized by a large pore diameter of 66 63 √• 63 3 5 raman spectroscopy the raman spectra of the nanomaterials obtained are illustrated in fig 5 in general manganese oxides with its different structures and morphology are characterized by low raman activity 71 the raman spectra of the various nanomaterials illustrate in fig 5 reveal the bands obtained were well defined and exhibited good crystallinity consistent with the structural studies obtained by xrd indeed the two most intense vibrational bands dominated all spectra while the bands in the low frequency region appeared with low intensities a slight variation between the different spectra obtained was recorded according to the crystalline structure of each nanomaterial their morphologies and also the type of ions inserted k h na between the octahedral sheets mno6 indeed the existence of vacant sites in the octahedral layers of manganese oxides could decrease the spectroscopic symmetry and consequently caused a shift in the position of some bands or the variation of their intensities 72 the bands situated at 635 626 and 646 cm 1 for the nanomaterials k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively were attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration ŒΩ 2 mn o of the mno6 octahedrons 73 for the bands located at 552 cm 1 for k mno2 fig 5a 556 cm 1 fig 5b for h mno2 and 569 cm 1 for na mno2 fig 5c were attributed to the ŒΩ3 mn o stretching vibration in the basal plane of the mno6 layers 74 these bands were particularly strong for the two nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 this characteristic is attributed to the materials having a high content of mn iv 72 which is consistent with our studies obtained for determining the mn average oxidation state indicating these two nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 were composed of 98 and 99 of mn iv table 2 the weak bands at 493 377 505 396 cm 1 for the different nanomaterials were attributed to the bending vibrations of the bond mn o mn in the mno6 octahedrons 75 3 6 removal of heavy metals by manganese oxides nanomaterials 3 6 1 effect of contact time one of the most important parameters of the adsorption processes is the control of the processing time and the adsorption speed of metal ions by the nanomaterial solid phase fig 6 illustrates the monitoring of pb ii and cd ii removal efficiencies during time at free ph ph 6 5 according to fig 6 k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials manifested a high affinity towards pb ii ions in fact from the first 5 min of treatment the removal efficiencies achieved 98 67 and 97 6 for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively during treatment the removal efficiencies remained stable over time without the desorption phenomenon detected during the first minutes of the nanomaterials interaction with cd ii ions fig 6 k mno2 disposed a higher removal efficiency than h mno2 after 15 min the efficiencies were 95 45 and 73 96 for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively during 30 min the removal efficiencies remained stable throughout the cd ii removal process this phase was attributed to the equilibrium establishment k mno2 nanomaterial was kinetically faster than h mno2 the two lamellar nanomaterials were able to completely decontaminate synthetic solutions containing metal ions during very short treatment times in addition k mno2 nanomaterial also recorded a significant removal efficiency of 86 higher than that found in our previous studies using the na mno2 nanomaterial achieving 75 63 after 5 min of treatment the reactivity of these nanomaterials can be explained by their homogeneous well defined mesoporous and non agglomerated surface and their pure crystalline structure these properties allowing from the first minutes of solid solution interaction to fix the metal ions in the active sites this strong performance has a practical advantage in terms of reduced processing time during the removal process by birnessite structure metal ions migrate to the nanomaterial surface and occupied the octahedral vacant sites mno6 or are inserted in the interfoliar space 76 these hypotheses can be further reinforced by further characterizations of the nanomaterials after the interaction the equilibrium study between the metal ions and the solid phase was carried out by using the previously found data fig 6 by applying two kinetic models pseudo first order and pseudo second order 77 expressed by the eqs 4 and 5 4 ln q e q t k t ln q e 5 t q t 1 k x q e 2 1 q e t with qt and qe were the adsorbed quantities of metal ions at time t and at equilibrium min k rate constant of the pseudo first order model min 1 k rate constant of the pseudo second order model mg g 1 min 1 fig 7 illustrates the graphical representation of the pseudo second order kinetic model for the removal of metal ions pb ii and cd ii by lamellar nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 the kinetic values determined from these two models such as the adsorbed quantities qe the constants k and the regression coefficients r2 are summarized in table 4 the kinetic models application allowed us to deduce the most suitable model for the adsorption phenomenon description from table 4 the r2 values obtained with the pseudo second order model for both metal ions were greater than 0 99 and exceed those obtained with the pseudo first order model besides the quantities fixed at equilibrium qe were almost similar to those found experimentally in the case of the two nanomaterials interacting with pb ii and cd ii ions according to these results the pseudo second order kinetic model proved to be the most suitable and reliable for determining the adsorption kinetic order of pb ii and cd ii metal ions with k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials 3 6 2 sorption mechanism intraparticle diffusion pattern the intraparticle diffusion mode application was used to describe the adsorption mechanism of the solid nanomaterial liquid metal ion system the intraparticle diffusion was traced using the following eq 6 6 q t k i t 0 5 c with qt mg g 1 sorption quantity at time t min ki mg g 1 min 1 2 speed constant of the intraparticle diffusion model c intercept mg g which is a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer the plots of the intraparticle diffusion model for the two nanomaterials interacting with pb ii and cd ii are represented in fig 8 according to fig 8 double linearity could be discerned in the set of lines obtained indicating the existence of two principal steps the first linearity represented the high adsorption efficiency resulting from the metals ions diffusion through the boundary layer of the adsorbent outer surface the second step was considered to be the step of progressive adsorption controlled by intraparticle diffusion representing the limiting step of the adsorption mechanism accompanied by a decrease in the adsorption speed the two stages were included collectively during the adsorption phenomenon the parameters calculated from the intraparticle diffusion model table s2 noticed during the metal ions interaction with nanomaterials the diffusion speed constants ki1 of the first phase were higher than the second phase constants during the removal process the metal ions were adsorbed on the outer surface with a high adsorption efficiency once the outer surface was completely saturated the metal ions were diffused into the particles internal pores subsequently the metal ions were adsorbed on the inner surface of the nanomaterials during this step the diffusion resistance increased resulting in a decrease in the diffusion speed this could be noticed in the constants ki2 ki1 for both nanomaterials table s2 3 6 3 effect of initial ph on the removal of pb ii and cd ii the ph of the aqueous phase is considered to be one of the most important factors to be controlled during the solid liquid adsorption equilibrium to evaluate whether the removal efficiency of pb ii and cd ii by k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials was dependent on the solution ph a study was conducted in a ph range from 2 0 to 9 0 at room temperature from fig 9 a slight increase in metal ion removal efficiency was recorded for both nanomaterials in the ph range 2 0 6 5 at ph 2 the nanomaterial k mno2 possessed a very high affinity towards metal ions with efficiencies of 93 and 92 for pb ii and cd ii respectively above this ph ph 2 a slight increase in efficiency was recorded to stabilize at 98 indeed this nanomaterial manifested a high efficiency at low ph ph 2 compared to the na mno2 material with an efficiency of 83 and 71 for pb ii and cd ii respectively 63 these results demonstrated the high stability and performance of k mno2 nanomaterial in this large ph range the removal efficiency recorded by the h mno2 nanomaterial was influenced by the initial solution ph in fact at low ph example ph 2 removal efficiencies were 46 for cd ii and 83 for pb ii these values increased proportionally with the ph to stabilize towards a ph 6 5 with a percentage of 97 and 97 6 for pb ii and cd ii respectively the decreased removal efficiency detected at acidic ph and in particular for h mno2 nanomaterial was probably due to the large quantities of protons competing with metal ions for adsorption sites 78 indeed it can be said the metal ions removal by h mno2 depended on the ph of the medium suggesting the adsorption process of pb ii and cd ii ions can be controlled by the surface complexation mechanism 79 3 6 4 effect of the initial concentration of pb ii and cd ii fig 10 represents the evolution of pb ii and cd ii removal efficiencies by k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials as a function initial concentration of metal ions 30 800 mg l fig 10 exhibited the quantity adsorbed mg g of pb ii and cd ii by the nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 were increased proportionally with the initial concentration of metal ions the highest adsorbed quantity of pb ii was recorded for the nanomaterial k mno2 with 185 mg g while an amount of 175 mg g was attributed to h mno2 in the case of cd ii the adsorbed quantities for k mno2 and h mno2 were 160 and 157 mg g respectively these high capacities recorded reflected the high capacity of these nanomaterials for the removal of pb ii and cd ii 3 6 5 sorption isotherm the isotherm models were applied in the equilibrium time t 30 min at different concentrations of the metal ion 30 800 mg l the results obtained were modeled by two empirical models langmuir and freundlich these two models constituted a widely used method for the adsorption mechanism elucidation and the quantification of the adsorbent adsorbate affinity as well as for the maximum sorption capacities evaluation the two equations used to represent the two models 7 l a n g m u i r c e q e 1 b x q m c e 1 q m 8 f r e u n d l i c h l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e with ce equilibrium concentration of substrates in the solution mg l

parameters calculated for the langmuir and freundlich models from fig 11 the metal ions adsorption by k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials was successfully described by the langmuir model r2 0 99 reflecting the homogeneous nature of the solid surface table 5 represents the various parameters calculated from the langmuir and freundlich model according to these results the k mno2 nanomaterial was the best adsorbent of the metal ions pb ii and cd ii with an adsorption capacity of 300 and 228 83 mg g 1 respectively followed by h mno2 with an adsorption capacity of 268 75 and 228 83 mg g 1 for pb ii and cd ii respectively the maximum adsorbed capacity for the different nanomaterials elaborated and the adsorbents from various previous studies are summarized in table 6 it was evident the two nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 had a relatively high metal ion adsorption capacity compared to the different adsorbents used in addition the use of this type of k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterial appeared to be effective and less expensive compared to tourmaline materials based on graphene or titanium as well as complicated synthesis protocols 80 in contrast the two nanomaterials were elaborated by a simple chemical process based on a soft hydrothermal treatment without adding expensive reagents or additional processes these results indicate k mno2 nanowires and h mno2 nanoflowers are considered as potential nanomaterials for the efficient and less expensive removal of pb ii and cd ii in an aqueous medium indeed the na mno2 nanomaterial was also proven to be highly reactive with a capacity of 297 62 and 199 mg g for pb ii and cd ii respectively 63 moreover the removal efficiency proceeded in the following order k mno2 na mno2 h mno2 table 6 the highest adsorption capacities were attributed to k mno2 and na mno2 nanomaterials k mno2 was characterized by a high specific surface area 44 m2 g large pore diameter and also a high mn average oxidation sate mn aos 3 99 compared to nanomaterial h mno2 these factors improve its removal capacity in fact wang et al 90 proved that the adsorption capacity of heavy metals increased proportionally with the mn aos b bartos et al 91 demonstrated manganese oxides k mno2 type have an excellent ion exchange selectivity due to their well defined structure this parameter explained the high selectivity towards metal ions such as pb ii 1 19 √• and cd ii 0 95 √• having ionic radius close to the potassium k radius 1 38 √• as a result it was demonstrated ion exchange was susceptible to be further enhanced by the use of k mno2 nanomaterial however in the case of na mno2 the ion exchange may be less important than k mno2 due to the size of the ion radius such as pb ii 1 19 √• that is higher than the na cation 1 02 √• inserted into the nanomaterial indeed exchange cations with a large size large ion radius cannot easily access the sites presented in the material structure thus blocking access to these metal ion 92 3 7 nanomaterials stability fig 12 represents mn released by nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 during pb ii and cd ii removal as a function of ph 2 0 9 0 during the metal ions removal by nanomaterials the manganese ions release may provide information on the stability of these oxides the percentage of mn released decreased with increasing ph during the removal of pb ii and cd ii fig 12 for ph 2 h mno2 nanomaterial released 3 8 and 3 of total mn during the removal of pb ii and cd ii ions respectively for ph 9 the percentages were very low with 0 016 and 0 3 for pb ii and cd ii respectively whereas k mno2 nanomaterial was characterized by high stability in a wide ph range 2 0 9 0 with a negligible mn percentage released of 0 42 for ph 2 and 0 009 for ph 7 and 9 during interaction with pb ii ions the nanomaterial proved to be very stable during cd ii removal with 0 3 and 0 05 of manganese released at ph 3 and 9 respectively during the metal removal process by na mno2 this material can also release a very low manganese content 63 the na mno2 and k mno2 nanomaterials have proven to be a promising solution for the heavy metals removal compared to h mno2 due to their high capacity to remove pb ii and cd ii metal ions at different ph and stability in different mediums acid neutral and basic 3 8 proposed sorption mechanism according to the obtained results we concluded that the two nanomaterials k mno2 and na mno2 are the best adsorbents for pb ii and cd ii ions in this context the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies were carried out by selecting the na mno2 nanomaterial as a model adsorbent interacting with pb ii and cd ii ions the survey spectrum analysis of the nanomaterial na mno2 fig 13 a presented the peaks of the principal constituent elements such as mn o and na the mn 2p core level spectrum fig 13b illustrated the mn2p3 2 peak at 641 5 ev corresponding to mno2 the mn2p3 2 peak has clearly identifiable and narrow shape 93 after the interaction of na mno2 with pb ii ions the pb 4f peak was appeared fig 13a indicating pb ii ions were adsorbed onto the na mno2 nanomaterial indeed according to the literature it was evident to identify the two peaks around 138 and 142 9 ev attributed to pb 4f7 2and pb 4f5 2 respectively fig 13c reveals the interaction between pb ii ions and the nanomaterial was more specific than the electrostatic interaction 94 besides the peak observed at 138 ev was attributed to the binding energy of the pb o bond 60 95 these results confirmed the removal of pb ii ions by the na mno2 nanomaterial were principally achieved by the formation of an inner sphere complex the results obtained were in accordance with previous studies suggesting an interaction of the pb ii ions with materials based on manganese can form an inner sphere complex 96 98 in addition during this study and from the xps analysis neither oxidation of pb ii ions to pb iv or the formation of new solid phases was detected suggesting the elimination of pb ii ions by na mno2 was principally attributed to adsorption concerning the cd ii ions adsorption the survey spectrum displayed the cd 3d fig 13a from the cd 3d core level spectrum fig 13 d cd 3d5 2 at 404 9 ev was attributed to the formation of cd oh 2 99 previous studies indicated the metal ions removal was achieved principally by the metal oxide hydroxide formation 100 majumder et al 99 showed that the o 1s signal at 531 ev fig 13e attributed to the oxidation state of oh to form cd oh 2 based on the nanomaterials structure birnessite and their characterization after the interaction by xps we proposed that ion removal can be achieved either by insertion of the metal ions pb ii and cd ii into the interfolar space or by insertion into the vacant sites in the octahedral layers mno6 indeed the formation of pbo and cd oh 2 after the interaction suggests that the retention of metal ions by these nanomaterials is possibly related to inner sphere complex formation 90 the detailed study of the structure of the different nanomaterials elaborated as well as their behavior with metal ions suggests that the retention of metal ions m2 on the manganese oxide surface may be represented as follows 96 1 mn oh m2 mn o m h 2 mn oh m2 mn o 2 m 2h the surface of elaborated nanomaterials mnoh is negatively charged allowing to attract metal ions positively charged by electrostatic interactions these results suggested that the removal capacity of metal ions was less important at lower ph values corresponds to the results illustrated in fig 9 3 9 regeneration and reusability of manganese oxide nanomaterials it was essential to find a method to recycle these nanomaterials using an easy implement method this parameter is important to control the nanomaterials efficiency and the adsorption system cost since the three nanomaterials k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 exhibited a high adsorption capacity and stability in acidic ph therefore their treatment with an acid solution was probably an appropriate approach for nanomaterials regeneration the adsorption desorption experiments for the nanomaterials were performed in five successive cycles after the adsorption cycles the resulting nanomaterials were dried at 50 c and then used for desorption cycles to evaluate the nanomaterials regeneration desorption experiments were conducted using hno3 0 1 m as the regeneration agent for 30 min at room temperature subsequently the regenerated nanomaterials were washed several times with distilled water to neutralize the supernatant ph separated by filtration through a membrane 0 45 Œºm dried at 50 c and stored for further utilization according to fig 14 the successive adsorption desorption cycles did not significantly modify the metal ions adsorption capacities by the three nanomaterials indeed the removal efficiencies recorded for k mno2 were 98 58 97 23 97 1 96 95 in the case of pb ii and 98 2 96 45 96 2 94 56 94 in the case of cd ii during five cycles fig 14 a h mno2 fig 14b and na mno2 fig 14c nanomaterials were also proved to have a very high removal capacity during regeneration cycles in our previous studies 63 na mno2 material manifested a high capacity for reuse without loss in efficiency and stability after five reuse cycles the removal efficiencies for h mno2 fig 14b were slightly reduced from 98 48 to 91 and from 98 69 to 92 in the case of pb ii and cd ii respectively similarly the removal efficiencies recorded for na mno2 fig 14c revealed a slight decrease in capacity from 97 26 to 94 for pb ii and from 97 44 to 93 for cd ii during the 5 recycling cycles of the three adsorbents a simultaneous control of their stability was achieved fig 15 illustrates the percentage of released mn by the three nanomaterials k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 during 5 recycling cycles the results demonstrated the high stability of the three nanomaterials reflected by a low percentage of released mn fig 15 during the first regeneration cycle the three nanomaterials release a very negligible percentage which does not exceed 0 07 after five recycling cycles in the case of pb ii removal the nanomaterials released 0 2 0 3 and 0 25 of total mn for k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively while in the case of cd ii removal the nanomaterials released 0 22 0 28 and 0 3 of total mn for k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively the results obtained indicated the mesoporous nanomaterials based on manganese k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 could be reused more than 5 cycles without significant loss of metal ion removal efficiency with high stability during regeneration cycles 4 conclusion in this work a simple soft hydrothermal process allowed the synthesis of k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials the exchange process in the second phase of synthesis produced two varieties of manganese oxide with different proprieties k mno2 and h mno2 characterization demonstrated the effect of interlayer alkali cations k and h on the crystalline and morphological structure of both nanomaterials they exhibited a great removal rate of more than 97 of pb ii during a short time kinetics of 5 min cd ii ions got also removed to achieve total decontamination of the solution the adsorption kinetics description was compatible with the pseudo second order model the maximum adsorption quantities for pb ii occurred in the following order k mno2 300 mg g na mno2 297 62 mg g h mno2 286 75 mg g and cd ii k mno2 228 mg g na mno2 199 mg g h mno2 189 84 mg g in addition to the high stability of k mno2 in a wide ph range its high capacity to remove pb ii and cd ii metals is due to the small size of the nanoparticles the large specific surface area the mn average oxidation state 3 99 the mesoporous surface area and the insertion of the cation k size into the lamellar structure these parameters ensured a better diffusion of metal ions onto k mno2 surface that resulted in a significant quantity of adsorbed metal ions determination of the metal ions removal mechanism by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that the metal ions were achieved by the formation of pbo and cd oh 2 recycling of k mno2 h mno2 and na

13643,the unique properties of nanomaterials provide a promising solution for environmental applications thus three nanomaterials based on manganese birnessite type in the form of well structured nanowires and nanoflowers were synthesized by soft hydrothermal treatment simple economical and without adding reagents or any other processes interlayer alkali cations k h and na inserted in the birnessite structure have demonstrated their effect on the structural and morphological properties of the nanomaterials and consequently on their metal ions removal efficiency k mno2 nanowires with inserted k ions were characterized by high performance in short processing time 5 min compared to other nanomaterials the maximum adsorption quantities were respectively for pb ii k mno2 300 mg g na

adsorption capacity x ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the heavy metal ions got adsorbed onto the nanomaterials as pbo and cd oh 2 these results confirm the performance of non agglomerated nanowires and nanoflowers nanomaterials based on manganese in an efficient kinetically fast metal ions removal with important stability and adsorption capacity keywords manganese oxide mesoporous nanomaterials alkali cations heavy metals adsorption regeneration 1 introduction heavy metals are considered one of the most toxic elements and a major source of water and environmental pollution 1 the accumulation of these heavy metals in the human body can cause subsequent health problems 2 3 heavy metals are also characterized by their non biological degradability presented a serious problem for living organisms 4 as a result there was a strong requirement for techniques to reduce or eliminate some heavy metals such as membrane filtration 5 6 chemical precipitation 7 flocculation 8 ion exchange 9 the methods universally adopted by industries to treat effluents are limited due to various economic and technological factors such as the complexity of process implementation high cost and limited capacity 10 due to the limited application of these techniques adsorption technology is considered to be one of the most appropriate processes for the heavy metals removal from wastewater 11 among the adsorbents used are activated carbon 12 polymers 13 inorganic materials 14 zeolite 15 and clay 16 17 the use of most adsorbents can represent several disadvantages such as low selectivity and adsorption capacity long equilibrium time complicated conception and high investment cost 18 several studies have used ligands for metal ions detection such as pb ii m rahman et al 19 synthesized ligands based on benzo d 1 3 dioxole carbaldehyde benzenesulfonylhydrazine bsh and 4 methyl benzenesulphonylhydrazine 4 mbsh were used to selectively detect heavy metal ions indeed other organic ligands were grafted onto the mesoporous silica 20 21 composite materials were also used to detect pb ii ions such as materials functionalized by organic ligands 22 nanosheets integrated cuo zno 23 surfactant assisted graphene oxide methylaniline 24 graphene oxide carbon nanotube poly o toluidine 25 sno2 sb2o3 26 and ni zno nanoparticles 27 the cadmium ions detection was also investigated by several research works rabiul awual et al 28 developed nanocomposites based on mesoporous silica monoliths by a method of direct templating of the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase nanomaterials were also used based on functionalized polyethersulfone and conjugated ternary znycdo 29 and zinc oxide nanosheets 30 the electrochemical detection of cadmium ions was achieved using materials as electrode based on carbon 31 e 4 methyl n 1 pyridin 2 yl ethylidene benzenesulfonohydrazide 32 and poly n methylaniline ce2 wo4 3 cnt nanocomposites 33 probes based on manganese were fabricated to detect some toxic compounds such as probes based on cuo mno2 gd2o3 synthesized by hydrothermal approach 34 indeed m asiri et al developed a sensor based on e n chlorobenzylidene benzenesulfonohydrazide cbbsh molecules for monitoring toxic heavy metal ions such as ag2 au3 cd2 co2 cr3 cu2 others sensors based on manganese mno2 sno2 35 and Œ± mno2 co3o4 36 exhibited their performance to detect gold iii and chloride ions respectively in recent years nanotechnology has attracted much attention due to its ability to the nanoparticle size control of some nanomaterials characterized by a variety of relatively unique properties not found in higher sized materials 1 that are transformed from micro to nano scale 37 these developed nanomaterials are used in several fields such as wastewater treatment power production and catalytic degradation 38 41 this is due to their small size high reactivity and high specific surface indeed the use of nanomaterials has displayed a high efficiency compared to previously studied adsorbents due to their high specific surface area 42 in effect several nano sized adsorbents developed in the form of ceo2 nanoparticles 43 graphene oxide nanosheets 44 carbon nanotubes 45 silica nanospheres 46 mgo and al2o3 nanoparticles 47 indeed despite the development of these nanomaterials they pose further problems related to wastewater separation and the complexity of preparation etc moreover the use of these nanomaterials can cause aggregation or agglomeration of their nanoparticles in the study medium and therefore provoke a loss of sorption capacity 48 to solve these problems several studies have used nanometric metal oxides such as bentonite 49 sand 50 diatomite 51 or supports such as polymers with a porous nature such as cation exchange resin to inhibit agglomeration and to improve the dispersion of these nanoparticles and also to increase the diffusion speed of metal ions however the use of this type of support requires a high investment cost as well as the addition of toxic agents and reagents can cause significant secondary pollution 52 one of the nanometric materials attracting great interest is manganese oxides characterized by its large specific surface area environmental friendliness and its high oxidation and adsorption capacity 53 54 the family of manganese oxide more precisely the lamellar structures is characterized by ordered octahedral layers mno6 55 and separated by water layers as well as alkali alkaline earth cations na k ca2 mg2 ect this space is 7 √• and 10 √• for birnessite and buserite respectively 56 indeed the materials surface is covered by surface hydroxyl groups oh making their surface negatively charged 57 these groups are considered as the sites responsible for the retention metal ions positively charged by electrostatic interactions 58 these properties make these manganese oxide materials as efficient adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in an aqueous medium several works have focused on developing different types of manganese oxide with a nanometric structure and better porosity to achieve better adsorption in the shortest possible equilibrium time indeed kamel et al 59 reported manganese oxide mn3o4 type allows the adsorption of 0 34 mg g of as v maliyekkal et al 60 developed a composite material based on cellulose and manganese oxide to adsorb a quantity of 80 1 mg g pb ii in an aqueous medium at a ph 5 other studies used hydrated manganese oxide supported by biochar to remove cd ii ions recording an adsorbed quantity of 150 mg g 48 however the use of these nanometric nanomaterials has proven to be sensitive to agglomerate in the aqueous medium causing a change in morphology and consequently a decrease in disposal efficiency as well as being difficult to reuse for possible cycles 61 little work was realized to study the stability and effect of inserted cations alkali alkaline earth during the nanomaterials elaboration on their morphology porosity and performance for the metal ions removal this work aims to i synthesis manganese oxide nanomaterials named k mno2 and h mno2 birnessite type structure using simple soft and non toxic methods the adopted protocol was performed in order to form nanoscale nanomaterials in the form of non agglomerated nanowires and nanoflowers to avoid the problem of reduced performance due to agglomeration of these nanoparticles ii study of the effect of k and h interlayer alkali cations on the structural morphological and adsorption capacity of nanomaterials iii investigate the feasibility of k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials for removal of pb ii and cd ii from aqueous solutions iv examine the effect of several parameters such as ph metal ion concentration on the removal

purification solutions were prepared using milli q deionized water 2 2 synthesis of nanomaterials the synthesis of k mno2 nanomaterial was based on a simple and soft hydrothermal process 62 50 ml of a hydrochloric acid solution hcl 4 m was added dropwise to potassium permanganate solution kmno4 0 2 m 250 ml previously heated at 80 c the reaction mixture was kept heated at 80 c under continuous stirring 250 rpm for one hour the resulting brown solution was maintained under stirring at 50 c for 17 h the black precipitate was vacuum filtered with a membrane porosity of 0 20 Œºm and washed with distilled water until the ph was 6 7 and dried at 60 c for 12 h the h mno2 nanomaterial was elaborated by exchanging k ions inserted in the k mno2 nanomaterial by h ions 2 g of k mno2 nanomaterial was treated by nitric acid solution hno3 0 1 m 100 ml under stirring 500 rpm at room temperature for 2 days the product was isolated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min and washed with distilled water until the ph of the supernatant was neutral the black powder was dried at 60 c for 12 h the na mno2 nanomaterial was prepared according to the redox method in an alkaline solution described in the literature 63 2 3 chemical analysis the chemical composition of the elaborated nanomaterials was determined by the powder dissolution 0 1 g into a hydroxylamine hydrochloride reagent solution nh2oh hcl 0 05 m 250 ml under continuous stirring after dissolution the solution obtained was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas shimadzu corporation japon to determine the total

were examined by scanning electron microscopy sem jeol ltd gemini 15 25 japan the distribution of the resulting nanoparticles was determined by the image j software measurement of the specific surface area pore distribution and porosity of nanomaterials was achieved with a surface analyzer bet micromeritics instruments corporation usa the raman spectra of the elaborated nanomaterials were analyzed on a dxr2 raman spectrometer thermo fisher usa with a helium neon he ne laser source Œª 633 nm 8 mw in order to determine the chemical bonds of the nanomaterials surface we performed x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses using a kratos axis ultra dld spectrometer shimadzu corporation japan with a monochromatic al kŒ± excitation 1486 6 ev and a charge compensation system the xps

line at 284 8 ev the spectra processing was performed with the casa xps software 2 5 sorption experiment studies of metal ion removal by the elaborated nanomaterials were carried out by introducing 0 1 g of k mno2 or h mno2 nanomaterial into pb ii or cd ii ions solution 30 mg l 50 ml at room temperature the interaction time effect was investigated by monitoring metal ion removal efficiencies from the first 5 min to 6 h the effect of ph on adsorption performance was examined by adjusting the ph of solutions in a range of 2 0 9 0 by sulfuric acid h2so4 0 1 m or sodium hydroxide naoh 0 1 m

plasma atomic emission spectrometry icpaes 65 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 66 etc indeed several advantages were proved by these techniques such as high precision sensitivity and simultaneous determination of the metal ion concentration for a wide range of elements 67 recent work has developed other techniques to detect trace metal ions in contaminated mediums in this present work we adopted atomic absorption spectrophotometry as a technique for the metal ions detection pb ii and cd ii in aqueous medium the detection of metal ions by atomic absorption spectroscopy requires the conversion of the sample into gaseous atoms which absorbed radiation the solution was drawn through a small tube and transported to the nebulizer which transformed the liquid or gaseous samples into a fine mist the samples were then mixed with a transport gas which produces a flame decomposing and atomizing the sample for analysis before analyzing the contaminated solutions a calibration curve was prepared using 4 5 different concentrations by diluting a stock standard solution 1000 ppm the metal ion concentration detection was performed using atomic absorption

diffraction fig 1 presents xrd measurements recorded on the k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials the diffractograms of the k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials fig 1 illustrated a high crystallinity with defined peaks at specified positions the two nanomaterials were identified as a lamellar structure characterized by four peaks attributed to manganese oxide birnessite type jcpds 52 0556 68 69 this type of manganese oxide has also identified in our previous studies having different structure and chemical formula jcpds 01 073 9669 named na mno2 63 the elaborated nanomaterials belong to the family of two dimensional layered pure birnessite composed by alternate stacking of alkali cations such as k h or na and octahedral layers mno6 separated by interlayer distances of 7 178 7 049 7 14 √• for k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively table 1 according to fig 1 a decrease in the peak crystallinity of h mno2 nanomaterial was detected and specifically the peak located at 2Œ∏ 12 based on these results the cation inserted k h in the formed structures has an effect on the nanomaterials crystallinity thus possibly affecting their behavior towards metal ions the decrease in the peak crystallinity of h mno2 was due to the acidification process of the nanomaterial k mno2 by hno3 allowing cation exchange to be performed without changing the birnessite structure 69 3 2 mn average oxidation state and elemental chemical analysis the chemical analysis of the elaborated nanomaterials was carried out to determine their chemical properties table 2 represents the elemental chemical composition the manganese average oxidation state mn aos and the chemical formula for each nanomaterial the chemical analysis table 2 indicated that nanomaterials contained significant manganese total quantities of 376 23 and 367 23 ppm for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively for the two lamellar nanomaterials the potassium ions concentration decreased from 62 11 ppm for k mno2 to 41 96 ppm for h mno2 indeed the molar ratio k mn was 0 165 and 0 114 in k mno2 and h mno2 respectively these results proved that during the synthesis of h mno2 an exchange of k ions present in the interlayer space of the k mno2 nanomaterial was carried out with h ions from added nitric acid hno3 producing a decrease of the k mn ratio the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by a high mn average oxidation state mn aos with 99 and 98 of mn iv recorded for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively table 2 k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials registered mn aos higher than na mno2 lamellar material 3 580 63 3 3 scanning electron microscope the synthesized nanomaterials morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy sem the images obtained are illustrated in fig 2 sem image of k mno2 nanomaterial fig 2a shaped from uniform nanowires or very thin rods whereas the h mno2 nanomaterial fig 2b consists of spheroidal nanoflowers composed of lamellar plates indeed the two nanomaterials revealed they have a non agglomerated nanoscale morphology for the same type of manganese oxide with na ions inserted in the octahedral layers a different morphology was produced in the form of nanoparticles with several micrometers sem characterization proved the cation exchange k to h during synthesis affected the nanomaterials morphology k mno2 nanowires could have relatively large surfaces due to their small size and two dimensional morphologies in this context the diameter distribution of the formed nanoparticles fig 3 was determined by analyzing the scanning electron microscopy images with the software image j according to fig 3 the nanowires and nanoflowers were composed of different diameters the nanowires constituting the k mno2 nanomaterial were characterized by diameters ranging from 0 0196 to 0 096 Œºm while the diameters of the h mno2 nanoflowers were varied from 1 22 to 4 55 Œºm based on these results k mno2 and h mno2 recorded an average diameter of 0 034 and 2 44 Œºm respectively these results demonstrated the conversion of k mno2 nanomaterial to h mno2 cation exchange k to h increased the nanoparticles diameter indicating the nanomaterial k mno2 has small nanowires thus promoting the diffusion phenomenon metal ions on the surface and therefore improving the adsorption process 3 4 specific surface area and pore distribution the specific surface area measurement pore size for k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials were determined using the braunauer emett and teller bet and barrett joyner hanlenda bjh methods the bet isotherm can be described by the eq s1 the graphical representation of 1 q p 0 p 1 as a function of p p 0 has a linear appearance fig 4 table 3 presents the isothermal parameters for bet models according to fig 4 and table 3 the nanomaterials were characterized by a large specific surface area of 44 902 and 40 326 m2 g for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively based on these results it could be noticed a specific surface area reduction of the nanomaterials during cation exchange k to h from 44 902 to 40 326 m2 g hence the effect of inserted ions on the structural properties of nanomaterials the nanomaterials pore size distribution was determined by n2 adsorption desorption studies the resulting isotherms and barrett joyner hanlenda bjh diagrams are represented in fig s1 fig s1 illustrated a progressive increase in the adsorbed gas quantity as a function of the relative equilibrium pressure the curves of both nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 have a type iii shape corresponds to materials with high porosity according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry classification iupac 70 a pore size classification suggested by iupac was used to determine pore size using the bjh method fig s1 revealed a wide pore size distribution and consequently a wide surface area distribution table s1 demonstrated the adsorption and desorption average pore diameters of the bjh model and the cumulative adsorption desorption volume for both nanomaterials pore distribution analysis revealed both nanomaterials were composed of more than 60 mesopores relative to the total pore surface suggesting the nanomaterials have a homogeneous mesoporous character and the total pore size was between 20 and 50 √• these results were consistent with the adopted hypothesis the adsorption isotherms were type iii for k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials attributed to mesoporous materials solids the analysis also indicated that the average pore diameter for the k mno2 was higher than h mno2 table s1 demonstrating the effect of inserted ions on the nanomaterials pore size and textural properties indeed the na mno2 material was also characterized by a large pore diameter of 66 63 √• 63 3 5 raman spectroscopy the raman spectra of the nanomaterials obtained are illustrated in fig 5 in general manganese oxides with its different structures and morphology are characterized by low raman activity 71 the raman spectra of the various nanomaterials illustrate in fig 5 reveal the bands obtained were well defined and exhibited good crystallinity consistent with the structural studies obtained by xrd indeed the two most intense vibrational bands dominated all spectra while the bands in the low frequency region appeared with low intensities a slight variation between the different spectra obtained was recorded according to the crystalline structure of each nanomaterial their morphologies and also the type of ions inserted k h na between the octahedral sheets mno6 indeed the existence of vacant sites in the octahedral layers of manganese oxides could decrease the spectroscopic symmetry and consequently caused a shift in the position of some bands or the variation of their intensities 72 the bands situated at 635 626 and 646 cm 1 for the nanomaterials k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively were attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration ŒΩ 2 mn o of the mno6 octahedrons 73 for the bands located at 552 cm 1 for k mno2 fig 5a 556 cm 1 fig 5b for h mno2 and 569 cm 1 for na mno2 fig 5c were attributed to the ŒΩ3 mn o stretching vibration in the basal plane of the mno6 layers 74 these bands were particularly strong for the two nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 this characteristic is attributed to the materials having a high content of mn iv 72 which is consistent with our studies obtained for determining the mn average oxidation state indicating these two nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 were composed of 98 and 99 of mn iv table 2 the weak bands at 493 377 505 396 cm 1 for the different nanomaterials were attributed to the bending vibrations of the bond mn o mn in the mno6 octahedrons 75 3 6 removal of heavy metals by manganese oxides nanomaterials 3 6 1 effect of contact time one of the most important parameters of the adsorption processes is the control of the processing time and the adsorption speed of metal ions by the nanomaterial solid phase fig 6 illustrates the monitoring of pb ii and cd ii removal efficiencies during time at free ph ph 6 5 according to fig 6 k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials manifested a high affinity towards pb ii ions in fact from the first 5 min of treatment the removal efficiencies achieved 98 67 and 97 6 for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively during treatment the removal efficiencies remained stable over time without the desorption phenomenon detected during the first minutes of the nanomaterials interaction with cd ii ions fig 6 k mno2 disposed a higher removal efficiency than h mno2 after 15 min the efficiencies were 95 45 and 73 96 for k mno2 and h mno2 respectively during 30 min the removal efficiencies remained stable throughout the cd ii removal process this phase was attributed to the equilibrium establishment k mno2 nanomaterial was kinetically faster than h mno2 the two lamellar nanomaterials were able to completely decontaminate synthetic solutions containing metal ions during very short treatment times in addition k mno2 nanomaterial also recorded a significant removal efficiency of 86 higher than that found in our previous studies using the na mno2 nanomaterial achieving 75 63 after 5 min of treatment the reactivity of these nanomaterials can be explained by their homogeneous well defined mesoporous and non agglomerated surface and their pure crystalline structure these properties allowing from the first minutes of solid solution interaction to fix the metal ions in the active sites this strong performance has a practical advantage in terms of reduced processing time during the removal process by birnessite structure metal ions migrate to the nanomaterial surface and occupied the octahedral vacant sites mno6 or are inserted in the interfoliar space 76 these hypotheses can be further reinforced by further characterizations of the nanomaterials after the interaction the equilibrium study between the metal ions and the solid phase was carried out by using the previously found data fig 6 by applying two kinetic models pseudo first order and pseudo second order 77 expressed by the eqs 4 and 5 4 ln q e q t k t ln q e 5 t q t 1 k x q e 2 1 q e t with qt and qe were the adsorbed quantities of metal ions at time t and at equilibrium min k rate constant of the pseudo first order model min 1 k rate constant of the pseudo second order model mg g 1 min 1 fig 7 illustrates the graphical representation of the pseudo second order kinetic model for the removal of metal ions pb ii and cd ii by lamellar nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 the kinetic values determined from these two models such as the adsorbed quantities qe the constants k and the regression coefficients r2 are summarized in table 4 the kinetic models application allowed us to deduce the most suitable model for the adsorption phenomenon description from table 4 the r2 values obtained with the pseudo second order model for both metal ions were greater than 0 99 and exceed those obtained with the pseudo first order model besides the quantities fixed at equilibrium qe were almost similar to those found experimentally in the case of the two nanomaterials interacting with pb ii and cd ii ions according to these results the pseudo second order kinetic model proved to be the most suitable and reliable for determining the adsorption kinetic order of pb ii and cd ii metal ions with k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials 3 6 2 sorption mechanism intraparticle diffusion pattern the intraparticle diffusion mode application was used to describe the adsorption mechanism of the solid nanomaterial liquid metal ion system the intraparticle diffusion was traced using the following eq 6 6 q t k i t 0 5 c with qt mg g 1 sorption quantity at time t min ki mg g 1 min 1 2 speed constant of the intraparticle diffusion model c intercept mg g which is a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer the plots of the intraparticle diffusion model for the two nanomaterials interacting with pb ii and cd ii are represented in fig 8 according to fig 8 double linearity could be discerned in the set of lines obtained indicating the existence of two principal steps the first linearity represented the high adsorption efficiency resulting from the metals ions diffusion through the boundary layer of the adsorbent outer surface the second step was considered to be the step of progressive adsorption controlled by intraparticle diffusion representing the limiting step of the adsorption mechanism accompanied by a decrease in the adsorption speed the two stages were included collectively during the adsorption phenomenon the parameters calculated from the intraparticle diffusion model table s2 noticed during the metal ions interaction with nanomaterials the diffusion speed constants ki1 of the first phase were higher than the second phase constants during the removal process the metal ions were adsorbed on the outer surface with a high adsorption efficiency once the outer surface was completely saturated the metal ions were diffused into the particles internal pores subsequently the metal ions were adsorbed on the inner surface of the nanomaterials during this step the diffusion resistance increased resulting in a decrease in the diffusion speed this could be noticed in the constants ki2 ki1 for both nanomaterials table s2 3 6 3 effect of initial ph on the removal of pb ii and cd ii the ph of the aqueous phase is considered to be one of the most important factors to be controlled during the solid liquid adsorption equilibrium to evaluate whether the removal efficiency of pb ii and cd ii by k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials was dependent on the solution ph a study was conducted in a ph range from 2 0 to 9 0 at room temperature from fig 9 a slight increase in metal ion removal efficiency was recorded for both nanomaterials in the ph range 2 0 6 5 at ph 2 the nanomaterial k mno2 possessed a very high affinity towards metal ions with efficiencies of 93 and 92 for pb ii and cd ii respectively above this ph ph 2 a slight increase in efficiency was recorded to stabilize at 98 indeed this nanomaterial manifested a high efficiency at low ph ph 2 compared to the na mno2 material with an efficiency of 83 and 71 for pb ii and cd ii respectively 63 these results demonstrated the high stability and performance of k mno2 nanomaterial in this large ph range the removal efficiency recorded by the h mno2 nanomaterial was influenced by the initial solution ph in fact at low ph example ph 2 removal efficiencies were 46 for cd ii and 83 for pb ii these values increased proportionally with the ph to stabilize towards a ph 6 5 with a percentage of 97 and 97 6 for pb ii and cd ii respectively the decreased removal efficiency detected at acidic ph and in particular for h mno2 nanomaterial was probably due to the large quantities of protons competing with metal ions for adsorption sites 78 indeed it can be said the metal ions removal by h mno2 depended on the ph of the medium suggesting the adsorption process of pb ii and cd ii ions can be controlled by the surface complexation mechanism 79 3 6 4 effect of the initial concentration of pb ii and cd ii fig 10 represents the evolution of pb ii and cd ii removal efficiencies by k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials as a function initial concentration of metal ions 30 800 mg l fig 10 exhibited the quantity adsorbed mg g of pb ii and cd ii by the nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 were increased proportionally with the initial concentration of metal ions the highest adsorbed quantity of pb ii was recorded for the nanomaterial k mno2 with 185 mg g while an amount of 175 mg g was attributed to h mno2 in the case of cd ii the adsorbed quantities for k mno2 and h mno2 were 160 and 157 mg g respectively these high capacities recorded reflected the high capacity of these nanomaterials for the removal of pb ii and cd ii 3 6 5 sorption isotherm the isotherm models were applied in the equilibrium time t 30 min at different concentrations of the metal ion 30 800 mg l the results obtained were modeled by two empirical models langmuir and freundlich these two models constituted a widely used method for the adsorption mechanism elucidation and the quantification of the adsorbent adsorbate affinity as well as for the maximum sorption capacities evaluation the two equations used

parameters calculated for the langmuir and freundlich models from fig 11 the metal ions adsorption by k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials was successfully described by the langmuir model r2 0 99 reflecting the homogeneous nature of the solid surface table 5 represents the various parameters calculated from the langmuir and freundlich model according to these results the k mno2 nanomaterial was the best adsorbent of the metal ions pb ii and cd ii with an adsorption capacity of 300 and 228 83 mg g 1 respectively followed by h mno2 with an adsorption capacity of 268 75 and 228 83 mg g 1 for pb ii and cd ii respectively the maximum adsorbed capacity for the different nanomaterials elaborated and the adsorbents from various previous studies are summarized in table 6 it was evident the two nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 had a relatively high metal ion adsorption capacity compared to the different adsorbents used in addition the use of this type of k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterial appeared to be effective and less expensive compared to tourmaline materials based on graphene or titanium as well as complicated synthesis protocols 80 in contrast the two nanomaterials were elaborated by a simple chemical process based on a soft hydrothermal treatment without adding expensive reagents or additional processes these results indicate k mno2 nanowires and h mno2 nanoflowers are considered as potential nanomaterials for the efficient and less expensive removal of pb ii and cd ii in an aqueous medium indeed the na mno2 nanomaterial was also proven to be highly reactive with a capacity of 297 62 and 199 mg g for pb ii and cd ii respectively 63 moreover the removal efficiency proceeded in the following order k mno2 na mno2 h mno2 table 6 the highest adsorption capacities were attributed to k mno2 and na mno2 nanomaterials k mno2 was characterized by a high specific surface area 44 m2 g large pore diameter and also a high mn average oxidation sate mn aos 3 99 compared to nanomaterial h mno2 these factors improve its removal capacity in fact wang et al 90 proved that the adsorption capacity of heavy metals increased proportionally with the mn aos b bartos et al 91 demonstrated manganese oxides k mno2 type have an excellent ion exchange selectivity due to their well defined structure this parameter explained the high selectivity towards metal ions such as pb ii 1 19 √• and cd ii 0 95 √• having ionic radius close to the potassium k radius 1 38 √• as a result it was demonstrated ion exchange was susceptible to be further enhanced by the use of k mno2 nanomaterial however in the case of na mno2 the ion exchange may be less important than k mno2 due to the size of the ion radius such as pb ii 1 19 √• that is higher than the na cation 1 02 √• inserted into the nanomaterial indeed exchange cations with a large size large ion radius cannot easily access the sites presented in the material structure thus blocking access to these metal ion 92 3 7 nanomaterials stability fig 12 represents mn released by nanomaterials k mno2 and h mno2 during pb ii and cd ii removal as a function of ph 2 0 9 0 during the metal ions removal by nanomaterials the manganese ions release may provide information on the stability of these oxides the percentage of mn released decreased with increasing ph during the removal of pb ii and cd ii fig 12 for ph 2 h mno2 nanomaterial released 3 8 and 3 of total mn during the removal of pb ii and cd ii ions respectively for ph 9 the percentages were very low with 0 016 and 0 3 for pb ii and cd ii respectively whereas k mno2 nanomaterial was characterized by high stability in a wide ph range 2 0 9 0 with a negligible mn percentage released of 0 42 for ph 2 and 0 009 for ph 7 and 9 during interaction with pb ii ions the nanomaterial proved to be very stable during cd ii removal with 0 3 and 0 05 of manganese released at ph 3 and 9 respectively during the metal removal process by na mno2 this material can also release a very low manganese content 63 the na mno2 and k mno2 nanomaterials have proven to be a promising solution for the heavy metals removal compared to h mno2 due to their high capacity to remove pb ii and cd ii metal ions at different ph and stability in different mediums acid neutral and basic 3 8 proposed sorption mechanism according to the obtained results we concluded that the two nanomaterials k mno2 and na mno2 are the best adsorbents for pb ii and cd ii ions in this context the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies were carried out by selecting the na mno2 nanomaterial as a model adsorbent interacting with pb ii and cd ii ions the survey spectrum analysis of the nanomaterial na mno2 fig 13 a presented the peaks of the principal constituent elements such as mn o and na the mn 2p core level spectrum fig 13b illustrated the mn2p3 2 peak at 641 5 ev corresponding to mno2 the mn2p3 2 peak has clearly identifiable and narrow shape 93 after the interaction of na mno2 with pb ii ions the pb 4f peak was appeared fig 13a indicating pb ii ions were adsorbed onto the na mno2 nanomaterial indeed according to the literature it was evident to identify the two peaks around 138 and 142 9 ev attributed to pb 4f7 2and pb 4f5 2 respectively fig 13c reveals the interaction between pb ii ions and the nanomaterial was more specific than the electrostatic interaction 94 besides the peak observed at 138 ev was attributed to the binding energy of the pb o bond 60 95 these results confirmed the removal of pb ii ions by the na mno2 nanomaterial were principally achieved by the formation of an inner sphere complex the results obtained were in accordance with previous studies suggesting an interaction of the pb ii ions with materials based on manganese can form an inner sphere complex 96 98 in addition during this study and from the xps analysis neither oxidation of pb ii ions to pb iv or the formation of new solid phases was detected suggesting the elimination of pb ii ions by na mno2 was principally attributed to adsorption concerning the cd ii ions adsorption the survey spectrum displayed the cd 3d fig 13a from the cd 3d core level spectrum fig 13 d cd 3d5 2 at 404 9 ev was attributed to the formation of cd oh 2 99 previous studies indicated the metal ions removal was achieved principally by the metal oxide hydroxide formation 100 majumder et al 99 showed that the o 1s signal at 531 ev fig 13e attributed to the oxidation state of oh to form cd oh 2 based on the nanomaterials structure birnessite and their characterization after the interaction by xps we proposed that ion removal can be achieved either by insertion of the metal ions pb ii and cd ii into the interfolar space or by insertion into the vacant sites in the octahedral layers mno6 indeed the formation of pbo and cd oh 2 after the interaction suggests that the retention of metal ions by these nanomaterials is possibly related to inner sphere complex formation 90 the detailed study of the structure of the different nanomaterials elaborated as well as their behavior with metal ions suggests that the retention of metal ions m2 on the manganese oxide surface may be represented as follows 96 1 mn oh m2 mn o m h 2 mn oh m2 mn o 2 m 2h the surface of elaborated nanomaterials mnoh is negatively charged allowing to attract metal ions positively charged by electrostatic interactions these results suggested that the removal capacity of metal ions was less important at lower ph values corresponds to the results illustrated in fig 9 3 9 regeneration and reusability of manganese oxide nanomaterials it was essential to find a method to recycle these nanomaterials using an easy implement method this parameter is important to control the nanomaterials efficiency and the adsorption system cost since the three nanomaterials k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 exhibited a high adsorption capacity and stability in acidic ph therefore their treatment with an acid solution was probably an appropriate approach for nanomaterials regeneration the adsorption desorption experiments for the nanomaterials were performed in five successive cycles after the adsorption cycles the resulting nanomaterials were dried at 50 c and then used for desorption cycles to evaluate the nanomaterials regeneration desorption experiments were conducted using hno3 0 1 m as the regeneration agent for 30 min at room temperature subsequently the regenerated nanomaterials were washed several times with distilled water to neutralize the supernatant ph separated by filtration through a membrane 0 45 Œºm dried at 50 c and stored for further utilization according to fig 14 the successive adsorption desorption cycles did not significantly modify the metal ions adsorption capacities by the three nanomaterials indeed the removal efficiencies recorded for k mno2 were 98 58 97 23 97 1 96 95 in the case of pb ii and 98 2 96 45 96 2 94 56 94 in the case of cd ii during five cycles fig 14 a h mno2 fig 14b and na mno2 fig 14c nanomaterials were also proved to have a very high removal capacity during regeneration cycles in our previous studies 63 na mno2 material manifested a high capacity for reuse without loss in efficiency and stability after five reuse cycles the removal efficiencies for h mno2 fig 14b were slightly reduced from 98 48 to 91 and from 98 69 to 92 in the case of pb ii and cd ii respectively similarly the removal efficiencies recorded for na mno2 fig 14c revealed a slight decrease in capacity from 97 26 to 94 for pb ii and from 97 44 to 93 for cd ii during the 5 recycling cycles of the three adsorbents a simultaneous control of their stability was achieved fig 15 illustrates the percentage of released mn by the three nanomaterials k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 during 5 recycling cycles the results demonstrated the high stability of the three nanomaterials reflected by a low percentage of released mn fig 15 during the first regeneration cycle the three nanomaterials release a very negligible percentage which does not exceed 0 07 after five recycling cycles in the case of pb ii removal the nanomaterials released 0 2 0 3 and 0 25 of total mn for k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively while in the case of cd ii removal the nanomaterials released 0 22 0 28 and 0 3 of total mn for k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 respectively the results obtained indicated the mesoporous nanomaterials based on manganese k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 could be reused more than 5 cycles without significant loss of metal ion removal efficiency with high stability during regeneration cycles 4 conclusion in this work a simple soft hydrothermal process allowed the synthesis of k mno2 and h mno2 nanomaterials the exchange process in the second phase of synthesis produced two varieties of manganese oxide with different proprieties k mno2 and h mno2 characterization demonstrated the effect of interlayer alkali cations k and h on the crystalline and morphological structure of both nanomaterials they exhibited a great removal rate of more than 97 of pb ii during a short time kinetics of 5 min cd ii ions got also removed to achieve total decontamination of the solution the adsorption kinetics description was compatible with the pseudo second order model the maximum adsorption quantities for pb ii occurred in the following order k mno2 300 mg g na mno2 297 62 mg g h mno2 286 75 mg g and cd ii k mno2 228 mg g na mno2 199 mg g h mno2 189 84 mg g in addition to the high stability of k mno2 in a wide ph range its high capacity to remove pb ii and cd ii metals is due to the small size of the nanoparticles the large specific surface area the mn average oxidation state 3 99 the mesoporous surface area and the insertion of the cation k size into the lamellar structure these parameters ensured a better diffusion of metal ions onto k mno2 surface that resulted in a significant quantity of adsorbed metal ions determination of the metal ions removal mechanism by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that the metal ions were achieved by the formation of pbo and cd oh 2 recycling of k mno2 h mno2 and na mno2 proved to be possible for five regeneration cycles without significant performance loss declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work

13644,removing and inactivating cryptosporidium spp oocysts and giardia spp cysts are a challenge for drinking water treatments mainly because of their small sizes and resistance to chlorination moreover protozoan detection methods are expensive and subject to high variability and low reproducibility especially in high turbidity water this research aimed at detecting and inactivating cysts and oocysts in drinking water treatment sludge in jar test treatability assays 110 ntu study water was treated with polyaluminium chloride to obtain the sludge the chosen method for detecting cysts and oocysts was direct centrifugation with icn 7x solution followed by the immunomagnetic separation ims with two acid dissociations the inactivation of cysts and oocysts was identified by the inclusion of propidium iodide as a vital dye when the cell walls were damaged this method s analytical quality control which was performed with the easyseed suspension obtained recovery of 3 3 2 0 and 24 8 8 0 for oocysts and cysts respectively besides the giardia spp recovery met the standards recommended for water by the usepa method 1623 1 magnetic microspheres were found attached to the protozoan in the microscope slides after ims indicating some limitations of this purification method the alkaline treatment tested a dose of 27 mg cao 100 ml for 3 and 5 days obtaining inactivation of 1 85 and 3 0 log for oocysts and 2 05 and 2 14 log for cysts respectively in this context the alkaline treatment may be feasible to reduce the microbiological risk in water treatment sludge considering an economic assessment keywords immunomagnetic separation polyaluminium chloride protozoan propidium iodide calcium oxide drinking water treatment sludge 1 introduction oocysts of cryptosporidium spp and cysts of giardia spp are protozoan infective forms which cause cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis respectively although these diseases may be asymptomatic common manifestations are diarrhoea and dehydration 1 cysts and oocysts have high environmental resistance 2 3 and low infectious dose 1 10 organisms in humans 4 5 giardia spp cysts can survive in water for two months at 8 c 6 while cryptosporidium spp oocysts can remain infectious for six months at 0 20 c 7 8 in brazil water treatment plants wtps generally use conventional technology and decantation for high turbidity water in wtps most oocyst removal occurs in decantation and filtration stages 9 regarding aluminium coagulants polyaluminium chloride pacl has been used in wtps instead of aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 as the former produces fewer residues without demanding ph corrections 10 11 the wtps generate water treatment sludge wts or alum sludge as a by product commonly dewatered and disposed of in landfills 12 however there are sustainable approaches for wts reuse e g metal recovery and agricultural application 12 which reinforces the relevance of protozoan detection and disinfection in this matrix in general oo cysts detection is performed in three steps concentration purification and protozoan visualization counting however these methodologies for aquatic matrices are still subject to high variability and low reproducibility 13 17 methods for evaluating protozoan in water samples must meet the analytical quality control standard proposed by the method 1623 1 18 easyseed suspensions can evaluate initial precision and recovery for each studied matrix with a known number of oo cysts however complex matrices including wts still require standards for validating protozoan detection protocols efstratiou et al 19 surveyed the main concentration methods filtration methods which include membranes ultrafiltration microfiber and nanofiltration flocculation sedimentation with calcium carbonate caco3 al2 so4 3 ferric sulphate fe2 so4 3 and formaldehyde with ethyl acetate or ether and direct centrifugation dc methods batch or continuous flow the calcium carbonate flocculation ccf method is recommended for high turbidity water because of the lower cost procedures 13 14 20 21 however its limitations are the loss of organisms in the supernatant reading errors due to particulates and ph changes 14 17 22 the dc method concentrates particles in a pellet usually performed for larger volumes boni de oliveira 23 obtained greater cleaning wells by applying the detergent dispersion solution icn 7x 1 0 after centrifugation of soil samples with 37 60 and 33 2 recoveries for 500 and 1000 giardia spp cysts respectively giglio and sabogal paz 15 evaluated protozoan detection methods on wtss whereas the ccf presented higher recoveries of 68 17 for c parvum oocysts and 42 7 for giardia spp however the dc icn7x method had less interference in protozoan viability in comparison to ccf al2 so4 3 and fe2 so4 3 protocols 16 the purification step is performed by density gradient cytometry or immunomagnetic separation ims 19 among these methods ims consists of oo cyst attachment on magnetic microspheres then it is followed by the dissociation step which is a process for detaching oo cysts usually by acid or thermal dissociation however the wtps sludge wts usually has significantly higher turbidity a challenge for protozoan detection methods 14 c parvum oocysts recovery can reduce drastically in higher turbidity matrices by applying the ims 24 25 for recovering cryptosporidium spp oocysts by dc followed by ims method ryu et al 26 achieved efficiency between 79 2 and 88 0 for low turbidity water samples and 33 1 for high turbidity for evaluating viability the animal infectivity method is the most reliable however this procedure is unfeasible regarding costs applicability and ethical issues 27 many studies have used vital dyes as propidium iodide pi with dapi 4 6 diamino 2 phenyl indole and fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc vital dyes can be used to identify viable organisms when there is no incorporation into the microorganisms indicating that the cell wall has not been ruptured 28 campbell et al 29 observed that the pi method showed a correlation with viability by the excystation method for oocysts of cryptosporidium spp the overestimated value was an advantage for safety also smith and smith 30 compared pi with fluorescein diacetate for g intestinalis cysts and concluded that pi had a correlation with in vitro excystation assays furthermore olson et al 3 obtained a correlation between rat infectivity tests and pi viability considering water and complex matrices soil and cattle faeces alkaline treatment of wtss consists of adding an alkalinizing compound to increase ph thus breaking down microorganism cell walls thermal and alkaline treatment reduces sludge water percentage minimizing costs incurred by disinfection and final disposal 31 although less research has been carried out on wts 17 there are many studies on wastewater sludge wws alkaline treatment bean et al 32 applied calcium hydroxide for wws treatment raising ph to 12 thus inactivating giardia lamblia cysts while c parvum oocysts remained viable in up to 72 h of experiments capizzi banas et al 33 inactivated helminth eggs which are resistant bioindicators with a ph greater than 12 a temperature of 60 c with a contact time of 8 min allievi et al 34 obtained better disinfection when using ammonium hydroxide solution than potassium hydroxide solution for treating wws on ph 10 with faecal coliforms as indicators monitoring protozoan in brazilian supply sources is still scarce and these analyses are costly and operationally difficult 22 franco 2007 pointed out the underreported protozoan contamination in brazil mainly due to a lack of research and monitoring 35 proper water resources monitoring is crucial since sewage collection and treatment services are inefficient and the intensification of agricultural activities may contribute to faecal contamination 36 37 moreover oocysts also present higher soil survival potential than cysts 3 which may risk runoff contamination to water bodies in this scenario besides oo cyst detection evaluating viability contributes to estimating disinfection efficiency for safely disposing of this residue this paper aimed at detecting and inactivating giardia spp cysts and cryptosporidium spp oocysts in the wts inactivation was performed by the alkaline treatment with calcium oxide cao and the challenges on protozoan detection and disinfection in high turbidity matrices were highlighted moreover the inactivation of oo cysts was identified by the inclusion of pi as a vital dye for damaged cell walls besides the procedure s costs were estimated which is a relevant aspect of selecting detection protocols and disinfection technologies in developing countries 2 materials and methods this research s experimental stages consisted of preparing wts matrices validating oo cyst concentration and detection methods and performing the alkaline treatment with cao the first step included study water preparation by adding 0 16 g l 1 kaolinite sigma aldrich fluka 60609 to non contaminated groundwater in which turbidity was approximately 110 ntu the second step consisted of performing jar test treatability assays to obtain the wts samples fig 1 the pacl used had a specific weight of 1 362 g l 1 and 16 68 content of al2o3 treatability parameters coagulant dosage coagulation ph mixing conditions sedimentation time were optimized based on similar study water from giglio and sabogal paz 15 these selected parameters achieved the highest efficiency regarding the turbidity and colour of filtered water the jars were filled with 2 l of study water and the treatment performed automatically fast mixing of 1000 s 1 for 10 s and slow mixing of 25 s 1 for 30 min then the decantation time was 10 min and 30 s after clarified water removal the remaining volume was considered the wts approximately 80 ml finally 70 ml of deionized water was used for washing each jar and this volume was included in the wts physical chemical and microbiological analyses of the matrices were evaluated according to apha 38 the commercial suspensions used were giardia spp cysts suspension purified at the laboratory of protozoology at the state university of campinas unicamp brazil and cryptosporidium spp oocysts suspension from waterborne new orleans usa all material used was previously washed with a 0 1 tween 80 solution due to the tendency to adhesion the oo cysts to solid surfaces 39 protozoans suspensions were homogenized before each use for counting the average number of oo cysts 5 Œºl of both protozoan suspensions were applied to each well n 3 after drying overnight the microscope slides were prepared following procedures from the merifluor kit meridian bioscience inc and dapi solution sigma aldrich f6057 according to the incorporation of pi sigma aldrich p4170 the viability of protozoan in the oo cysts was evaluated the volume of pi solution 10 Œºl was equivalent to the suspensions added when oo cysts were not stained negative for pi dye they were considered potentially viable a preliminary analytical quality assay n 3 with protozoans commercial suspensions was performed for 100 ml of wts the detection method selected was dc icn 7x followed by ims the 7x solution icn pharmaceuticals inc is neutral and phosphate free and is non toxic for sensitive organisms the aimed initial concentration was 2000 oo cysts l 1 which corresponded to 20 Œºl of the giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp suspensions to reduce losses of target organisms throughout water treatability assays oo cysts were inoculated directly into the wts and the sample was homogenized with a magnetic stirrer for 20 min the volume was then divided into 50 ml falcon tubes n 2 and the centrifugation was carried out at 1500xg for 20 min the resulting pellet 0 5 ml from both tubes was transferred to one besides three 0 5 ml washes with 0 1 tween 80 after another centrifugation the supernatant was removed and 5 ml remaining volume was transferred to a flat sided tube fst in addition to three 1 ml washes with 1 0 icn 7x the fst was homogenized in a rotary agitator at 20 rpm for 1 h then the content was transferred to a falcon tube for the last centrifugation the supernatant was removed and 5 ml residual volume was used for the ims step followed by two acid dissociations followed by the kit dynabeads gc combo idexx the analytical quality control of the dc icn 7x and ims protocol was validated using easyseed btf bio australia whose suspension had 99 1 6 oocysts of cryptosporidium spp and 100 1 9 cysts of giardia spp five samples were processed under the same conditions one of them a negative control blank to verify the absence of cross contamination since there is currently no standard to be followed to validate detection protocols of oo cysts in wts the usepa method 1623 1 18 was used as guidance for the alkaline treatment the mass was 27 mg cao sigma aldrich 248568 which corresponded to 10 of the total fixed solids tfs of the wts sample for each replicate n 4 the target number of oo cysts was approximately 5000 oo cysts l 1 on 100 ml of the wts two tests simulated the alkaline treatment and drying in tropical conditions performed in a temperature controlled oven for 3 and 5 days at 25 c after the centrifugation steps in the dc icn 7x method residual pellets had volumes higher than 0 5 ml thus not compatible with the ims protocol for each treatment and replicate the samples were homogenized divided into two centrifuge tubes and one of them randomly selected for ims processing therefore the recovery rate considered a multiplication factor n 2 due to the high cost of the dynabeads kit the inactivation was calculated according to eq 1 where i inactivation log of oo cysts n average number of oo cysts not stained after the alkaline treatment no average number of non stained oo cysts initially the relative number of inactivated oo cysts was expressed in terms of log reduction in which every log unit corresponds to a 10 reduction factor 1 i log n n o the shapiro wilk normality test was performed to evaluate whether the data were parametric and parametric statistics transformed non normal data then the data were submitted to analysis of variance anova and student s t test with 95 confidence to evaluate statistical differences of the treatments p value 0 05 finally the prices of the merifluor easyseed and dynabeads kits were taken into consideration besides alkaline treatment costs were estimated based on brazilian water treatment plants considering a flow rate of 100 l s 1 the final costs were updated for april 2020 according to the general market price index igp m from the funda√ß√£o get√∫lio vargas and considering 1 brazilian real equal to 0 20 american dollars as of april 2020 3 results and discussion groundwater presented total alkalinity of 15 3 mg caco3 l 1 conductivity of 33 2 Œºs cm 1 turbidity of 0 2 ntu apparent colour of 0 0 hu ph of 6 78 and temperature of 24 3 c for study water after adding 0 16 g l 1 kaolinite the average values were 112 ntu turbidity 114 hu apparent colour 3 3 hu true colour 8 8 mg caco3 l 1 total alkalinity and 53 2 Œºs cm 1 conductivity the filtered water presented 0 32 ntu 0 5 hu apparent colour and 0 0 true colour the procedure for preparing the study water eliminated interferences that may exist in natural samples e g organic matter metals and other microorganisms since the objective was to evaluate the efficiency in the oo cysts detection and inactivation regarding different characteristics natural water samples should have their treatability parameters optimized and thus their oo cyst detection protocol validated 14 the characterization of the study water wts and the treatability parameters are shown in table 1 the high turbidity and concentration of solids in the wts samples were a challenge in terms of detecting giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp oocysts this was also observed by franco et al 2012 and silva and sabogal paz 2020 14 17 in which samples with high turbidity influenced the ims as oo cysts may be adhered to solid particles and thus not be attached by magnetic microspheres for the wts aluminium was 14 960 mg l 1 and iron was 1128 mg l 1 which indicated an increase in metal concentrations resulting from the pacl as a coagulant this process might interfere in oo cyst adhesion to the magnetic microspheres used in the ims step 18 considering the analytical quality control with commercial suspensions the number of protozoans inoculated in the wts was 2224 oocysts l 1 and 2371 cysts l 1 oocyst and cyst recoveries were higher for the second acid dissociations 8 7 and 13 9 respectively additional dissociations would increase the final procedural costs without significantly improving recovery rates 13 the average recovery for oocysts was 13 5 7 6 and it was 17 0 3 8 for cysts while the average viability of oocysts was 23 6 2 5 and it was 18 4 5 6 for cysts in this case after applying the dc icn 7x method the percentage of oo cysts not stained with pi was higher than the initial value in the suspensions on the other hand for the analytical quality control with easyseed the highest average recoveries were obtained by the first dissociations for cryptosporidium spp oocysts 1 8 1 5 and for giardia spp cysts 17 8 6 6 in relation to the recovery of the second for oocysts 1 5 1 7 and cysts 7 0 2 1 the coefficients of variation for cryptosporidium spp both for the first and second dissociation were considerably high 84 5 and 110 5 respectively considering both acid dissociations recoveries were 3 3 2 0 and 24 8 8 0 for oocysts and cysts respectively for cryptosporidium spp these results were less than those required for water which is 32 according to method 1623 1 18 giardia spp presented recovery and coefficient of variation cv within the recommended range for water the results for the analytical quality assays are shown in table 2 recoveries were smaller than those obtained by ryu et al 26 which used the dc protocol followed by ims with 10 l of samples with approximately 1000 oocysts of cryptosporidium spp in which recoveries were between 29 5 and 36 7 for water samples with high turbidity although less than 90 ntu for floated residue with 380 ntu silva and sabogal paz 17 obtained lower recoveries for c parvum 8 16 30 24 and achieved higher values for giardia spp 32 54 46 48 sammarro silva and sabogal paz 16 generated wts with 538 ntu and obtained c parvum recoveries of 30 00 8 78 using the dc icn 7x ims method the high number of organisms inoculated into the samples approximately 2000 oo cysts l 1 might influence the results of viability estimation another factor that may explain the increase in viability was the ims purification method which might help recover more oo cysts with intact cell walls than fragile or compromised ones these observations were also made by zilberman et al 40 in soil samples in which the recovery was directly proportional to the organisms considered viable when working with the water ether separation purification method after adding the cao all samples ph achieved values higher than 12 which was recommended in previous studies 33 41 for the 3 day test 5906 oocysts l 1 and 5158 l 1 cysts were inoculated for the treatment of 27 mg of cao 100 ml wts samples for oocysts the average recovery of the first acid dissociation 3 5 was greater than the second 2 8 while the average recovery of cysts was lower in the first dissociation 2 0 comparing to the second 3 6 however these differences were not significant for both protozoa p 0 38 more non stained oocysts were found in the second dissociation 2 7 1 5 compared to the first 1 7 0 6 this fact was also observed for cysts considering the first 1 0 1 7 and second dissociation 2 0 2 0 for the 5 day test 4980 l 1 oocysts and 4749 l 1 cysts were added to the wts samples for oocysts the average recovery of the first acid dissociation was higher 1 9 than the second 0 6 as well as in the 3 day test but with a lower value however the average recovery of cysts was higher in the first dissociation 4 5 than in the second 2 1 different from the previous assay these differences were statistically significant for both oocysts and cysts p 0 05 non stained cysts were found in the first and second acid dissociations but only one non stained oocyst was found in the second acid dissociation sample the results for the wts alkaline treatment were presented in table 3 there was a total recovery of 4 95 and 12 59 for oocysts and 11 11 and 13 06 for cysts on the 3 and 5 days assays respectively the viability was reduced reaching approximately 2 with a 27 mg cao 100 ml dosage and 5 days even so non stained protozoans were still found in the samples showing evidence of parasite resistance to the treatment for 3 days considering an average of 620 and 681 non

13644,removing and inactivating cryptosporidium spp oocysts and giardia spp cysts are a challenge for drinking water treatments mainly because of their small sizes and resistance to chlorination moreover protozoan detection methods are expensive and subject to high variability and low reproducibility especially in high turbidity water this research aimed at detecting and inactivating cysts and oocysts in drinking water treatment sludge in jar test treatability assays 110 ntu study water was treated with polyaluminium chloride to obtain the sludge the chosen method for detecting cysts and oocysts was direct centrifugation with icn 7x solution followed by the immunomagnetic separation ims with two acid dissociations the inactivation of cysts and oocysts was identified by the inclusion of propidium iodide as a vital dye when the cell walls were damaged this method s analytical quality control which was performed with the easyseed suspension obtained recovery of 3 3 2 0 and 24 8 8 0 for oocysts and cysts respectively besides the giardia spp recovery met the standards recommended for water by the usepa method 1623 1 magnetic microspheres were found attached to the protozoan in the microscope slides after ims indicating some limitations of this purification method the alkaline treatment tested a dose of 27 mg cao 100 ml for 3 and 5 days obtaining inactivation of 1 85 and 3 0 log for oocysts and 2 05 and 2 14 log for cysts respectively in this context the alkaline treatment may be feasible to reduce the microbiological risk in water treatment sludge considering an economic assessment keywords immunomagnetic separation polyaluminium chloride protozoan propidium iodide calcium oxide drinking water treatment sludge 1 introduction oocysts of cryptosporidium spp and cysts of giardia spp are protozoan infective forms which cause cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis respectively although these diseases may be asymptomatic common manifestations are diarrhoea and dehydration 1 cysts and oocysts have high environmental resistance 2 3 and low infectious dose 1 10 organisms in humans 4 5 giardia spp cysts can survive in water for two months at 8 c 6 while cryptosporidium spp oocysts can remain infectious for six months at 0 20 c 7 8 in brazil water treatment plants wtps generally use conventional technology and decantation for high turbidity water in wtps most oocyst removal occurs in decantation and filtration stages 9 regarding aluminium coagulants polyaluminium chloride pacl has been used in wtps instead of aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 as the former produces fewer residues without demanding ph corrections 10 11 the wtps generate water treatment sludge wts or alum sludge as a by product commonly dewatered and disposed of in landfills 12 however there are sustainable approaches for wts reuse e g metal recovery and agricultural application 12 which reinforces the relevance of protozoan detection and disinfection in this matrix in general oo cysts detection is performed in three steps concentration purification and protozoan visualization counting however these methodologies for aquatic matrices are still subject to high variability and low reproducibility 13 17 methods for evaluating protozoan in water samples must meet the analytical quality control standard proposed by the method 1623 1 18 easyseed suspensions can evaluate initial precision and recovery for each studied matrix with a known number of oo cysts however complex matrices including wts still require standards for validating protozoan detection protocols efstratiou et al 19 surveyed the main concentration methods filtration methods which include membranes ultrafiltration microfiber and nanofiltration flocculation sedimentation with calcium carbonate caco3 al2 so4 3 ferric sulphate fe2 so4 3 and formaldehyde with ethyl acetate or ether and direct centrifugation dc methods batch or continuous flow the calcium carbonate flocculation ccf method is recommended for high turbidity water because of the lower cost procedures 13 14 20 21 however its limitations are the loss of organisms in the supernatant reading errors due to particulates and ph changes 14 17 22 the dc method concentrates particles in a pellet usually performed for larger volumes boni de oliveira 23 obtained greater cleaning wells by applying the detergent dispersion solution icn 7x 1 0 after centrifugation of soil samples with 37 60 and 33 2 recoveries for 500 and 1000 giardia spp cysts respectively giglio and sabogal paz 15 evaluated protozoan detection methods on wtss whereas the ccf presented higher recoveries of 68 17 for c parvum oocysts and 42 7 for giardia spp however the dc icn7x method had less interference in protozoan viability in comparison to ccf al2 so4 3 and fe2 so4 3 protocols 16 the purification step is performed by density gradient cytometry or immunomagnetic separation ims 19 among these methods ims consists of oo cyst attachment on magnetic microspheres then it is followed by the dissociation step which is a process for detaching oo cysts usually by acid or thermal dissociation however the wtps sludge wts usually has significantly higher turbidity a challenge for protozoan detection methods 14 c parvum oocysts recovery can reduce drastically in higher turbidity matrices by applying the ims 24 25 for recovering cryptosporidium spp oocysts by dc followed by ims method ryu et al 26 achieved efficiency between 79 2 and 88 0 for low turbidity water samples and 33 1 for high turbidity for evaluating viability the animal infectivity method is the most reliable however this procedure is unfeasible regarding costs applicability and ethical issues 27 many studies have used vital dyes as propidium iodide pi with dapi 4 6 diamino 2 phenyl indole and fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc vital dyes can be used to identify viable organisms when there is no incorporation into the microorganisms indicating that the cell wall has not been ruptured 28 campbell et al 29 observed that the pi method showed a correlation with viability by the excystation method for oocysts of cryptosporidium spp the overestimated value was an advantage for safety also smith and smith 30 compared pi with fluorescein diacetate for g intestinalis cysts and concluded that pi had a correlation with in vitro excystation assays furthermore olson et al 3 obtained a correlation between rat infectivity tests and pi viability considering water and complex matrices soil and cattle faeces alkaline treatment of wtss consists of adding an alkalinizing compound to increase ph thus breaking down microorganism cell walls thermal and alkaline treatment reduces sludge water percentage minimizing costs incurred by disinfection and final disposal 31 although less research has been carried out on wts 17 there are many studies on wastewater sludge wws alkaline treatment bean et al 32 applied calcium hydroxide for wws treatment raising ph to 12 thus inactivating giardia lamblia cysts while c parvum oocysts remained viable in up to 72 h of experiments capizzi banas et al 33 inactivated helminth eggs which are resistant bioindicators with a ph greater than 12 a temperature of 60 c with a contact time of 8 min allievi et al 34 obtained better disinfection when using ammonium hydroxide solution than potassium hydroxide solution for treating wws on ph 10 with faecal coliforms as indicators monitoring protozoan in brazilian supply sources is still scarce and these analyses are costly and operationally difficult 22 franco 2007 pointed out the underreported protozoan contamination in brazil mainly due to a lack of research and monitoring 35 proper water resources monitoring is crucial since sewage collection and treatment services are inefficient and the intensification of agricultural activities may contribute to faecal contamination 36 37 moreover oocysts also present higher soil survival potential than cysts 3 which may risk runoff contamination to water bodies in this scenario besides oo cyst detection evaluating viability contributes to estimating disinfection efficiency for safely disposing of this residue this paper aimed at detecting and inactivating giardia spp cysts and cryptosporidium spp oocysts in the wts inactivation was performed by the alkaline treatment with calcium oxide cao and the challenges on protozoan detection and disinfection in high turbidity matrices were highlighted moreover the inactivation of oo cysts was identified by the inclusion of pi as a vital dye for damaged cell walls besides the procedure s costs were estimated which is a relevant aspect of selecting detection protocols and disinfection technologies in developing countries 2 materials and methods this research s experimental stages consisted of preparing wts matrices validating oo cyst concentration and detection methods and performing the alkaline treatment with cao the first step included study water preparation by adding 0 16 g l 1 kaolinite sigma aldrich fluka 60609 to non contaminated groundwater in which turbidity was approximately 110 ntu the second step consisted of performing jar test treatability assays to obtain the wts samples fig 1 the pacl used had a specific weight of 1 362 g l 1 and 16 68 content of al2o3 treatability parameters coagulant dosage coagulation ph mixing conditions sedimentation time were optimized based on similar study water from giglio and sabogal paz 15 these selected parameters achieved the highest efficiency regarding the turbidity and colour of filtered water the jars were filled with 2 l of study water and the treatment performed automatically fast mixing of 1000 s 1 for 10 s and slow mixing of 25 s 1 for 30 min then the decantation time was 10 min and 30 s after clarified water removal the remaining volume was considered the wts approximately 80 ml finally 70 ml of deionized water was used for washing each jar and this volume was included in the wts physical chemical and microbiological analyses of the matrices were evaluated according to apha 38 the commercial suspensions used were giardia spp cysts suspension purified at the laboratory of protozoology at the state university of campinas unicamp brazil and cryptosporidium spp oocysts suspension from waterborne new orleans usa all material used was previously washed with a 0 1 tween 80 solution due to the tendency to adhesion the oo cysts to solid surfaces 39 protozoans suspensions were homogenized before each use for counting the average number of oo cysts 5 Œºl of both protozoan suspensions were applied to each well n 3 after drying overnight the microscope slides were prepared following procedures from the merifluor kit meridian bioscience inc and dapi solution sigma aldrich f6057 according to the incorporation of pi sigma aldrich p4170 the viability of protozoan in the oo cysts was evaluated the volume of pi solution 10 Œºl was equivalent to the suspensions added when oo cysts were not stained negative for pi dye they were considered potentially viable a preliminary analytical quality assay n 3 with protozoans commercial suspensions was performed for 100 ml of wts the detection method selected was dc icn 7x followed by ims the 7x solution icn pharmaceuticals inc is neutral and phosphate free and is non toxic for sensitive organisms the aimed initial concentration was 2000 oo cysts l 1 which corresponded to 20 Œºl of the giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp suspensions to reduce losses of target organisms throughout water treatability assays oo cysts were inoculated directly into the wts and the sample was homogenized with a magnetic stirrer for 20 min the volume was then divided into 50 ml falcon tubes n 2 and the centrifugation was carried out at 1500xg for 20 min the resulting pellet 0 5 ml from both tubes was transferred to one besides three 0 5 ml washes with 0 1 tween 80 after another centrifugation the supernatant was removed and 5 ml remaining volume was transferred to a flat sided tube fst in addition to three 1 ml washes with 1 0 icn 7x the fst was homogenized in a rotary agitator at 20 rpm for 1 h then the content was transferred to a falcon tube for the last centrifugation the supernatant was removed and 5 ml residual volume was used for the ims step followed by two acid dissociations followed by the kit dynabeads gc combo idexx the analytical quality control of the dc icn 7x and ims protocol was validated using easyseed btf bio australia whose suspension had 99 1 6 oocysts of cryptosporidium spp and 100 1 9 cysts of giardia spp five samples were processed under the same conditions one of them a negative control blank to verify the absence of cross contamination since there is currently no standard to be followed to validate detection protocols of oo cysts in wts the usepa method 1623 1 18 was used as guidance for the alkaline treatment the mass was 27 mg cao sigma aldrich 248568 which corresponded to 10 of the total fixed solids tfs of the wts sample for each replicate n 4 the target number of oo cysts was approximately 5000 oo cysts l 1 on 100 ml of the wts two tests simulated the alkaline treatment and drying in tropical conditions performed in a temperature controlled oven for 3 and 5 days at 25 c after the centrifugation steps in the dc icn 7x method residual pellets had volumes higher than 0 5 ml thus not compatible with the ims protocol for each treatment and replicate the samples were homogenized divided into two centrifuge tubes and one of them randomly selected for ims processing therefore the recovery rate considered a multiplication factor n 2 due to the high cost of the dynabeads kit the inactivation was calculated according to eq 1 where i inactivation log of oo cysts n average number of oo cysts not stained after the alkaline treatment no average number of non stained oo cysts initially the relative number of inactivated oo cysts was expressed in terms of log reduction in which every log unit corresponds to a 10 reduction factor 1 i log n n o the shapiro wilk normality test was performed to evaluate whether the data were parametric and parametric statistics transformed non normal data then the data were submitted to analysis of variance anova and student s t test with 95 confidence to evaluate statistical differences of the treatments p value 0 05 finally the prices of the merifluor easyseed and dynabeads kits were taken into consideration besides alkaline treatment costs were estimated based on brazilian water treatment plants considering a flow rate of 100 l s 1 the final costs were updated for april 2020 according to the general market price index igp m from the funda√ß√£o get√∫lio vargas and considering 1 brazilian real equal to 0 20 american dollars as of april 2020 3 results and discussion groundwater presented total alkalinity of 15 3 mg caco3 l 1 conductivity of 33 2 Œºs cm 1 turbidity of 0 2 ntu apparent colour of 0 0 hu ph of 6 78 and temperature of 24 3 c for study water after adding 0 16 g l 1 kaolinite the average values were 112 ntu turbidity 114 hu apparent colour 3 3 hu true colour 8 8 mg caco3 l 1 total alkalinity and 53 2 Œºs cm 1 conductivity the filtered water presented 0 32 ntu 0 5 hu apparent colour and 0 0 true colour the procedure for preparing the study water eliminated interferences that may exist in natural samples e g organic matter metals and other microorganisms since the objective was to evaluate the efficiency in the oo cysts detection and inactivation regarding different characteristics natural water samples should have their treatability parameters optimized and thus their oo cyst detection protocol validated 14 the characterization of the study water wts and the treatability parameters are shown in table 1 the high turbidity and concentration of solids in the wts samples were a challenge in terms of detecting giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp oocysts this was also observed by franco et al 2012 and silva and sabogal paz 2020 14 17 in which samples with high turbidity influenced the ims as oo cysts may be adhered to solid particles and thus not be attached by magnetic microspheres for the wts aluminium was 14 960 mg l 1 and iron was 1128 mg l 1 which indicated an increase in metal concentrations resulting from the pacl as a coagulant this process might interfere in oo cyst adhesion to the magnetic microspheres used in the ims step 18 considering the analytical quality control with commercial suspensions the number of protozoans inoculated in the wts was 2224 oocysts l 1 and 2371 cysts l 1 oocyst and cyst recoveries were higher for the second acid dissociations 8 7 and 13 9 respectively additional dissociations would increase the final procedural costs without significantly improving recovery rates 13 the average recovery for oocysts was 13 5 7 6 and it was 17 0 3 8 for cysts while the average viability of oocysts was 23 6 2 5 and it was 18 4 5 6 for cysts in this case after applying the dc icn 7x method the percentage of oo cysts not stained with pi was higher than the initial value in the suspensions on the other hand for the analytical quality control with easyseed the highest average recoveries were obtained by the first dissociations for cryptosporidium spp oocysts 1 8 1 5 and for giardia spp cysts 17 8 6 6 in relation to the recovery of the second for oocysts 1 5 1 7 and cysts 7 0 2 1 the coefficients of variation for cryptosporidium spp both for the first and second dissociation were considerably high 84 5 and 110 5 respectively considering both acid dissociations recoveries were 3 3 2 0 and 24 8 8 0 for oocysts and cysts respectively for cryptosporidium spp these results were less than those required for water which is 32 according to method 1623 1 18 giardia spp presented recovery and coefficient of variation cv within the recommended range for water the results for the analytical quality assays are shown in table 2 recoveries were smaller than those obtained by ryu et al 26 which used the dc protocol followed by ims with 10 l of samples with approximately 1000 oocysts of cryptosporidium spp in which recoveries were between 29 5 and 36 7 for water samples with high turbidity although less than 90 ntu for floated residue with 380 ntu silva and sabogal paz 17 obtained lower recoveries for c parvum 8 16 30 24 and achieved higher values for giardia spp 32 54 46 48 sammarro silva and sabogal paz 16 generated wts with 538 ntu and obtained c parvum recoveries of 30 00 8 78 using the dc icn 7x ims method the high number of organisms inoculated into the samples approximately 2000 oo cysts l 1 might influence the results of viability estimation another factor that may explain the increase in viability was the ims purification method which might help recover more oo cysts with intact cell walls than fragile or compromised ones these observations were also made by zilberman et al 40 in soil samples in which the recovery was directly proportional to the organisms considered viable when working with the water ether separation purification method after adding the cao all samples ph achieved values higher than 12 which was recommended in previous studies 33 41 for the 3 day test 5906 oocysts l 1 and 5158 l 1 cysts were inoculated for the treatment of 27 mg of cao 100 ml wts samples for oocysts the average recovery of the first acid dissociation 3 5 was greater than the second 2 8 while the average recovery of cysts was lower in the first dissociation 2 0 comparing to the second 3 6 however these differences were not significant for both protozoa p 0 38 more non stained oocysts were found in the second dissociation 2 7 1 5 compared to the first 1 7 0 6 this fact was also observed for cysts considering the first 1 0 1 7 and second dissociation 2 0 2 0 for the 5 day test 4980 l 1 oocysts and 4749 l 1 cysts were added to the wts samples for oocysts the average recovery of the first acid dissociation was higher 1 9 than the second 0 6 as well as in the 3 day test but with a lower value however the average recovery of cysts was higher in the first dissociation 4 5 than in the second 2 1 different from the previous assay these differences were statistically significant for both oocysts and cysts p 0 05 non stained cysts were found in the first and second acid dissociations but only one non stained oocyst was found in the second acid dissociation sample the results for the wts alkaline treatment were presented in table 3 there was a total recovery of 4 95 and 12 59 for oocysts and 11 11 and 13 06 for cysts on the 3 and 5 days assays respectively the viability was reduced reaching approximately 2 with a 27 mg cao 100 ml dosage and 5 days even so non stained protozoans were still found in the samples showing evidence of parasite resistance to the treatment for 3 days considering an average of 620 and 681 non stained oocysts and cysts respectively alkaline treatment provided 1 85 log of inactivation of cryptosporidium spp and 2 05 log of inactivation of giardia spp for 5 days considering an average of 697
