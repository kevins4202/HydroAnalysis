1670,contamination of groundwater from nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural lands is an important environmental and water quality management issue it is well recognized that in agriculturally intensive areas fertilizers and pesticides may leach through the vadose zone and eventually reach groundwater while numerical models are commonly used to simulate fate and transport of agricultural contaminants few models have considered a controlled field work to investigate the influence of soil heterogeneity and groundwater flow on nitrate n distribution in both root zone and deep vadose zone in this work a numerical model was developed to simulate nitrate n transport and transformation beneath a center pivot irrigated corn field on nebraska management system evaluation area over a three year period the model was based on a realistic three dimensional sediment lithology as well as carefully controlled irrigation and fertilizer application plans in parallel a homogeneous soil domain containing the major sediment type of the site i e sandy loam was developed to conduct the same water flow and nitrate n leaching simulations simulated nitrate n concentrations were compared with the monitored nitrate n concentrations in 10 multi level sampling wells over a three year period although soil heterogeneity was mainly observed from top soil to 3 m below the surface heterogeneity controlled the spatial distribution of nitrate n concentration soil heterogeneity however has minimal impact on the total mass of nitrate n in the domain in the deeper saturated zone short term variations of nitrate n concentration correlated with the groundwater level fluctuations 1 introduction nitrate n leaching due to excessive nitrogen application irrigation and inappropriate soil management practices is a primary cause of groundwater pollution in agricultural regions gärdenäs et al 2005 zhu et al 2005 mitsch and day 2006 in areas of intense farming nitrate n concentrations in groundwater has been reported to exceed the maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg l 1 for drinking water established by the u s environmental protection agency usepa in many areas of the u s elevated nitrate n concentration in drinking water is harmful to pregnant women and elderly people and may cause methemoglobinemia in infants under 6 months spalding and exner 1993 water research center 2014 numerical modeling is an efficient tool for understanding the physical chemical and biological processes affecting nitrate n transport as well as in predicting and managing nitrate n pollution van der laan et al 2014 numerous studies have been published to model the fate and transport of nitrogen in soils focusing either on nitrogen leaching in the root zone nakamura et al 2004 skaggs et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 arbat et al 2013 deb et al 2015 iqbal et al 2016 or on nitrate n transport and transformation in the saturated zone macquarrie et al 2001 lee et al 2006 various models have been applied to simulate soil water and nitrogen dynamics in soils such as soil crop model stics ledoux et al 2007 poch massegú et al 2014 plaza bonilla et al 2015 root zone water quality model rzwqm ma et al 1998 agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 cropping system simulation model cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 soil water balance model swb sci van der laan et al 2014 as well as simple models solving water and nitrate n production functions cabon et al 1991 these modeling efforts have determined the significant impact of various parameters such as fertilizer application rate precipitation pattern irrigation strategies and soil types on nitrate n leaching in soils although these studies generally agree that field non uniformity widely exists however most of them simulated fairly simplified scenarios in the models assuming either one single soil type skaggs et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 deb et al 2015 or layered soil types hassan et al 2008 hu et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 poch massegú et al 2014 wang et al 2014 iqbal et al 2016 baram et al 2017 in a vertical 2d domain in reality soil properties varied spatially across the field which can hardly be captured by point soil samplings soil type and grain size distribution strongly influence soil water content distribution different soil types typically correspond to different soil organic matter and moisture content both of which could affect biodegradation rates furthermore horizontal soil texture variation and surface topography could also affect water content distribution and nutrient leaching pathways for example surface topography can result in surface water ponding which can influence soil water content distribution as well as soil dissolved oxygen concentration heterogeneity may easily influence contaminant biodegradation and leaching rate in the subsurface a few three dimensional 3d models have been developed to analyze water flow and solute transport in a 3d heterogeneous vadose zone groundwater system russo et al 2001 2013 botros et al 2012 russo et al 2013 clearly demonstrated that simple point 1 d modeling could not accurately simulate the spatial pattern of water content and nitrate concentration produced by rather complicated soil water plant atmosphere flow system as with many other studies the model simulated nitrate concentration was not compared against field data russo et al 2013 due to the cost and the need for long term monitoring botros et al 2012 simulated nitrate transport and storage within a 3 d 6 1 m by 6 1 m by 15 86 m heterogeneous vadose zone generated by geostatistical methods and compared the simulated amount of nitrate stored in the vadose zone with field measurements based on seven years of field fertilization data their modeling results suggested that numerical based modeling techniques overestimated the measured nitrogen mass in the deeper part of the vadose zone clearly the effect of fate and transport processes particularly in the deeper part of the vadose zone is not yet adequately quantified most of the available 3d models studied water flow and nitrate n leaching in relatively small field sites 20 m in width and only focused on the unsaturated part typically a constant pressure head boundary condition was imposed at the bottom of the simulation domain potential interactions of groundwater flux on the nitrate n distribution in the deeper part of the vadose zone were rarely investigated in this work we take advantage of a highly dense data set from a field site in nebraska management systems evaluation area msea the site was relatively well characterized so that a 3d lithologic model can be developed which provides realistic spatially varied soil properties on the site for comparison purpose a homogenous soil domain sandy loam soil was also simulated to compare and analyze the influences of soil heterogeneity the site has shallow water table providing ideal condition to study the impact of groundwater flux on the distribution of nitrate n in the deeper part of the vadose zone controlled field implementation of irrigation and fertilizer application was conducted in the 1990s and corresponding groundwater level and nitrate n concentration data were collected these data include the detailed description of lithology at 70 wells and 11 test holes annual irrigation water and fertilizer application rates and changing groundwater levels as well as the nitrate n concentration at 16 screening depths in 41 multilevel samplers three times a year spalding et al 2001 this rich data set allowed us to compare simulated and measured nitrate n concentrations in 10 wells on the site for a three year period strictly following well controlled irrigation and fertilization strategies the goal of this work is to better evaluate the impacts of soil heterogeneity as well as the interactions of groundwater flux on the transport of nitrate n in both root zone and vadose zone down to the water table 2 site description the study area was part of the nebraska msea site which is located within the central platte natural resources district cpnrd of the platte river valley fig 1a schepers et al 1995 spalding et al 2001 the 2 27 km2 msea site is in the southeastern buffalo county between shelton and gibbon nebraska u s a the climate of the study area is continental and temperate with an annual mean temperature and precipitation of 10 c and 623 mm respectively mcguire and kilpatrick 1998 the msea site consists of a buffer area in the up gradient a component research site and a demonstration site spalding et al 2001 during 1993 1995 the demonstration site 914 m long and 823 m wide was divided into four fields to implement and evaluate various agriculture management practices 1 a conventional furrow irrigated corn field 2 a surge irrigated corn field with 60 less water and 31 less n fertilizer application than the conventional field 3 a center pivot irrigated corn field with 66 less water and 37 less n fertilizer application than the conventional field and 4 a center pivot irrigated alfalfa mcguire and kilpatrick 1998 spalding et al 2001 during this period the irrigation and n fertilizer application amounts were controlled and documented changing groundwater levels and nitrate n concentrations were monitored at 41 multilevel samplers fig 1b in the demonstration site three times a year fig 2 presents the monthly precipitation irrigation and average groundwater elevation measured from february 1993 to december 1995 with average nitrate n concentrations between 30 and 32 mg l 1 mcguire and kilpatrick 1998 the shallow and rapidly recharged high plains alluvial aquifer is mainly used for irrigation nitrate n concentrations in the deeper confined cenozoic ogallala formation aquifer are 1 mg l 1 exner and spalding 1990 spalding et al 2001 however continued development of this resource will likely lead to impaired water quality as it has in the southernmost extent of this aquifer mcmahon et al 2006 chaudhuri and ale 2014 in this work nitrate n transport modeling was focused on transport beneath the center pivot irrigated corn field highlighted in fig 1b details on n applications in the center pivot irrigated corn field including pre plant starter and side dress fertilizer applied to the soil on or around the sides of the plant or fertigation injected urea ammonium nitrate solution into the irrigation water during 1993 1995 are provided in table 1 3 methods 3 1 development of a 3 dimentional modeling domain a three dimensional 3 d model of the lithology beneath the demonstration site was created using rockworks15 rockware inc 2016 a software widely used for subsurface data visualization rockworks interpolated the historically available well logging information university of nebraska lincoln 2000 at different locations including coordinates surface elevations total depths as well as lithology and then generated a surface topography map and a continuous lithology model fig 1b rockworks uses advanced geostatistical methods to perform three dimensional interpolation of the borehole data the horizontal lithoblending method with both randomize blending and interpolate outliners options was applied for this case to create the lithology solid model the numerical modeling domain covers the center pivot irrigated corn field which is 458 m long and 410 m wide fig 1c in order to further confirm the actual soil properties soil samples were collected on the site from the location of the wells soil particle size distribution analysis was conducted providing the percentage of silt sand and clay soil categories from historical well log information were more closely matched with recent field measurements and previously described soil categories were corrected based on the measurements and hydrological parameters were estimated using measured soil properties table 1 according to the soil particle size distribution analysis the deeper part of the simulation domain mainly consists of homogenous sandy loam while closer to the ground surface it contains four different types of loam fig 1b a lithology model of the center pivot irrigated corn field was then imported into hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 based on the lithology index of each node in the lithology model in rockworks an index was assigned to the closest node in the hydrus model corresponding soil type labels were then applied to all nodes based on the assigned index covering the unsaturated zone and about half of the shallow groundwater thickness the depth of the modeling domain varied between 8 99 and 9 48 m due to the uneven surface topography in the hydrus 3d model the horizontal mesh element size was 10 m and 20 vertical mesh layers were defined with gradually increased layer density from the surface to the bottom boundary 3 2

samples collected from msea site table 1 when the n parameter for soil samples is smaller than 2 and a considerable portion of the model domain is saturated hydraulic conductivity values based on the van genuchten mualem model can be very sensitive to the shape of the soil water retention curve near saturation for the purpose of confirmation the model was also simulated using a modified van genuchten model with an entry pressure specified ippisch et al 2006 which provided 1 5 differences of the water pressure and nitrate n concentration values across the simulation domain the sink term s

tillotson 1980 were considered for the transformation of nitrogen in this study correspondingly c 1 is urea c 2 is ammonium and c 3 is nitrate n urea nh2 2co was assumed to be rapidly hydrolyzed to ammonium nh4 in water by heterotrophic bacteria and then nitrified to nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 by autotrophic bacteria because the transformation from nitrite to nitrate is much faster than the nitrification of ammonium to nitrite hanson et al 2006 nitrite species was neglected in the simulation denitrification was not considered at this stage of modeling because previous isotope analysis of nitrate n indicated that denitrification was not an important process affecting ground water nitrate n at this location martin et al 1995 spalding et al 2001 nitrate n and urea concentrations were defined in liquid phase only while the sorption of ammonium onto soil was also considered the first order reaction coefficient μ w for urea to ammonium and for ammonium to nitrate were defined as 0 38 1 day and 0 2 1 day respectively based on reported values in literature misra et al 1974 selim and iskandar 1981 lotse et al 1992 ling and el kadi 1998 hanson et al 2006 jansson and karlberg 2010 a linear sorption isotherm model was used to simulate the adsorption of ammonium to solid phase s k k d is the distribution coefficient l3 m 1 which was determined to be 3 5 10 3 m3 kg 1 according to the literature lotse et al 1992 ling and el kadi 1998 hanson et al 2006 root uptake of nutrients in forms of urea ammonium and nitrate n was simulated by multiplying root water uptake s to the dissolved nutrient concentration c r k when c r k is lower than the maximum root solute concentration c max or by multiplying s to c max if c is larger than c max c max was estimated as 0 033 kg m 3 nitrogen based on the maximum corn grain yield 14 mg ha 1 in the demonstration site spalding et al 2001 and the reported nitrogen requirements of corn nitrogen efficiency 2016 3 4 initial conditions the initial pressure head at the bottom of the domain was obtained by interpolating the groundwater level on april 1st 1993 in multilevel samplers in the center pivot irrigated corn field the soil profile was considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with the local groundwater level and initial pressure head was obtained by linear interpolation of the top surface and bottom bottom layer of the domain pressure head values the initial urea and ammonium concentration in the subsurface were considered as zero no n carryover the groundwater nitrate n concentrations measured on april 1st 1993 were used as the initial nitrate n concentration in the saturated zone in the previous field studies the residual nitrate n concentration was measured at each multilevel sampler to a depth of 1 2 m in each spring before planting klocke et al 1999 the initial nitrate n concentration of the domain was obtained by interpolating the measured nitrate n concentration at different screening depths of each multilevel sampler 3 5 boundary conditions an atmospheric boundary condition was implemented at the surface which required daily precipitation irrigation and potential evaporation and transpiration rates daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data et for reference crop alfalfa from 1993 to 1996 were collected from shelton weather station high plains regional climate center website 2016 located about 2 8 km south from msea site which is the closest weather station to the study site the total yearly irrigation amount table 1 was applied daily on days with zero precipitation during the irrigation season late june to end of september spalding et al 2001 the reference et adopted from shelton weather station was calculated using the penman monteith method to separate the potential evaporation and potential transpiration bear s law was applied šimůnek et al 2016 surface cover fraction scf was first calculated from leaf area index lai lai was obtained based on a report from the us ne2 site which is another university of nebraska research field with irrigated maize and soybean rotation ameriflux site and data exploration system 2016 a variable pressure head boundary condition was implemented at the bottom boundary to consider the groundwater elevation fluctuations during the simulation the daily rate of groundwater elevation change was obtained by linearly interpolating the groundwater level measurements at 14 different times after april 1st 1993 for both water flow and solute transport zero flux boundary condition was applied at the vertical boundaries which is the hydrus 3d default boundary condition and assumes that water and solute influx through side boundaries was compensated by outflux symmetry domain skaggs et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2005 iqbal et al 2016 for solute transport the third type cauchy type concentration flux boundary condition was specified along the surface boundary to prescribe nitrogen application nitrogen was applied at various times during 1993 1995 known as pre plant n starter n side dress fertigation n and irrigation n table 1 spalding et al 2001 starter n and side dress fertigation n were assumed to be added during the irrigation season late june to end of september spalding et al 2001 and were mixed with nitrate n in irrigation water 30 mg l 1 pre plant n was assumed to be applied in late march spalding et al 2001 concentration flux boundary condition third type was also applied at the bottom of the domain to prescribe a concentration flux defined by the groundwater nitrate n concentration 30 mg l 1 and groundwater flux along the bottom boundary 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between modeling results and field data fig 3 shows the comparison of simulated and measured vertical profiles of nitrate n concentration on october 1st and april 1st of 1993 to 1995 in ml1 ml5 ml7 and ml19 ml1 ml5 and ml7 are in the western part of the field and ml19 is in the eastern part of the field fig 1 the nitrate n concentration was mostly high near the ground surface due to the application of fertilizer applied nitrate n rapidly infiltrated into the subsurface due to both subsequent precipitation and irrigation which was then sharply reduced from about 20 40 mg l 1 on the surface to 10 mg l 1 at a depth of about 2 4 m from the surface changing groundwater nitrate n concentration measurements were based on multilevel samplers however no comparable data was available to compare with the simulated nitrate n concentration in the unsaturated zone in the saturated zone about 3 m below the ground the measured nitrate n concentrations in three multilevel sampler close to the western boundary of the field i e ml1 ml5 and ml7 were closely matched with the simulated results at different screening depths across the whole investigation period with the coefficient of determination r2 ranged between 0 69 and 0 98 the good agreement indicated that the mathematical model has accounted for the important processes controlling nitrate n transport in the area including soil heterogeneity despite good agreement for ml1 5 and 7 simulated nitrate n concentrations in a multilevel sampler close to the eastern boundary of the domain ml19 were about 1 2 to 3 times higher than the measured values r2 between 0 28 and 0 85 from october 1993 to october 1995 the nitrate n concentration was measured eight times per year in 10 multilevel samplers fig 1c for evaluation of sampling bias each at five to seven screening depths a total of 509 field measurements the overall coefficient of determination for all 509 field measurements is 0 6 with distinctly higher r2 values in the western part of the domain ml1 7 average r2 of 0 87 and much lower r2 values in the eastern part of the domain ml17 19 average r2 of 0 57 possible reasons for this discrepancy could be due to preferential flow paths or local denitrification process in the unsaturated zone for instance there might be preferential or non uniform flow paths in this region i e 2 to 8 m below the ground surface which facilitated nitrate n movement toward the groundwater and reduced the concentration based on uniform nitrogen isotope composition denitrification process was assumed to be limited in the groundwater because dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were too low spalding et al 2001 based on the n2 ar ratios measurements on this site martin et al 1995 also demonstrated that n2 was not in excess of air saturated water values in most of the sampled cluster wells indicating that denitrification was very limited in the shallow groundwater however this does not rule out the possibility of denitrification in local areas particularly in stagnant zones of water flow in a similar nitrate n transport study by botros et al 2012 numerical models were found to overestimate the field measurement nitrate n mass which was partially attributed to spatially variable denitrification more field data and measurements are needed to incorporate a spatially variable denitrification process despite the incorporated soil heterogeneity in the model in this simulation all parameters were either direct field measurements or estimated from measured soil properties no parameter fitting was conducted although the discrepancies exist for some parts of the domain the overall agreement between the modeling and field measured data in most cases on a realistic field site for a 3 year simulation period indicates that the model captured most important processes that control the transport of nitrate n in the area 4 2 impact of groundwater fluctuation on nitrate n in the domain different from commonly reported profiles in literature where nitrate n concentration continuously decreased with increasing depth after reaching a minimum the nitrate n concentration gradually increased in the deeper part of the aquifer and reached a value of about 30 mg l 1 at the bottom of the modeling domain we hypothesize that the higher concentration of nitrate n in the deeper part of the domain was due to the influence of groundwater flux groundwater in this area was contaminated with an average nitrate n concentration of about 32 mg l 1 attributed to over 30 years of excess irrigation water and fertilizer application in furrow irrigated corn up gradient of the site spalding et al 2001 nitrate n in the groundwater was brought into the domain when groundwater elevation was increased previous studies in the same field also hypothesized that induced flux led to seasonal changes of nitrate n concentration lasserre et al 1999 spalding et al 2001 stigter et al 2011 which however was based on the average value of nitrate n concentration at several locations beneath the whole center pivot irrigated corn field in this work a variable pressure head boundary condition was implemented at the bottom boundary to consider the groundwater elevation fluctuations during the simulation period to testify the role of groundwater elevation fluctuation on the distribution of nitrate n in the deeper part of the modeling zone we conducted another simulation by applying a constant pressure head boundary condition at the bottom of the domain fig 4 as illustrated in fig 4 a constant pressure boundary condition predicted a very low nitrate n concentration down to about 6 m from the ground and then a sharp increase close to the bottom boundary furthermore the nitrate n concentration profile predicted by a constant pressure head boundary condition does not change over time a variable pressure head boundary condition was able to produce the gradual increase of the nitrate n concentration with depth as well as the vertical distribution of concentration profile over time which supports the hypothesis that groundwater elevation fluctuations correspond to a flux of nitrate n fig 5 presents the simulated pressure head and nitrate n concentration distribution at the bottom layer of the domain between 8 99 and 9 48 m below the ground surface based on surface topography at six different time during 1993 1995 this layer was right at the bottom boundary of the modeling domain and therefore pressure head values were corresponding to the thickness of the groundwater in the domain from october 1993 to october 1995 the groundwater thickness showed a trend of declining with corresponding pressure head values ranged from 5 2 to 6 2 m in oct 1993 4 5 to 5 5 m in oct 1994 and 3 9 to 5 m in oct 1995 the pressure head was higher in the western part of the field than the eastern part which resulted in a 1 m year horizontal groundwater flow from northwest toward southeast at this layer changing nitrate n concentrations were also sensitive to changing groundwater levels nitrate n concentrations were generally higher in the months with higher groundwater levels fig 5 for example nitrate n concentrations were higher in april of 1994 and 1995 than october of 1994 and 1995 which was consistent with the observed higher pressure head in april of both years fig 5 from april 1993 to october 1995 an overall decreasing trend in the nitrate n concentration in the groundwater was observed which can be attributed to the overall reduction of groundwater elevation in this period in other words a greater amount of nitrate n mass left the domain and reduced the nitrate n concentrations in the saturated part fig 6 presents the bottom layer water and solute flux over time as clearly shown here solute flux variations closely followed the trend of groundwater flux so that nitrate n flux at the bottom was correspondent to the groundwater elevation fluctuation during the simulation period this observation supports our hypothesis that the concentration of nitrate n in the deeper part of the domain was correlated to the groundwater flux this finding demonstrates the importance of coupling of the unsaturated zone and saturated zone in investigating nitrate n transport in the subsurface 4 3 impacts of soil heterogeneity on the nitrate n in the domain as shown in fig 7 four different types of loam were distributed in the top 3 m of the simulation domain below 3 m the domain was homogeneously composed of sandy loam to evaluate the impacts of soil heterogeneity in the first 3 m of the domain a same simulation was conducted in a homogeneous domain composed of only sandy loam across the whole domain fig 8 highlights a comparison of pressure head and nitrate n concentration between homogeneous and heterogeneous domain on oct 1st of 1995 at the depth of 2 m from the ground surface in the homogenous domain water pressure head was higher in the eastern part of the domain than the western part despite the identical soil properties everywhere which was due to uneven surface topography where surface elevation in the eastern part was about 0 5 m lower than in the western part the minimum in the west and maximum in the east water content were about 0 18 and 0 21 in the homogenous domain and 0 11 and 0 31 in the heterogeneous domain respectively moreover the pressure head distribution in the homogenous soil domain was uniform for the heterogeneous domain fig 8 the spatial distribution of pressure head was correlated to the sediment distribution fig 7 particularly loam 1 delineated a zone with varying soil moisture content in the heterogeneous domain with relatively lower pressure head ca 4 8 to 3 2 m in the western part of the domain than the adjacent area ca 2 6 to 2 1 m according to the soil particle size analysis table 1 soil samples from loam1 loam2 and loam 3 have different hydraulic parameters although they all belong to general loam category loam 1 was majorly located between 1 17 m and 3 m from the surface and because the water holding capacity of loam 1 was higher than the sandy loam in the surrounding area water infiltration rate above loam 1 was reduced which led to a decreased water pressure head at the 2 m layer similar to the pressure head distributions the nitrate n distribution at the 2 m soil layer was also impacted by the soil heterogeneity and surface topography fig 8b due to the lower surface elevation in the eastern part of the domain nitrate n reached this level more rapidly therefore higher nitrate n concentration was observed in the eastern part point by point comparisons showed that nitrate n concentrations in the homogenous domain were either equal to or lower than that in the heterogeneous domain fig 8b with the same surface loading and simulation duration higher nitrate n concentration in the heterogeneous domain could be partially attributed to the drier soil condition at the 2 m soil layer fig 8a because the higher soil moisture content in the homogenous soil layer could result in the dilution of nitrate n and reduced concentration in addition less nitrate n was retained in this layer in the homogenous domain due to the promoted infiltration within the sandy loam soil type in the heterogeneous domain nitrate n infiltration rates from high to low followed the order of sandy loam loam 1 loam 2 loam 3 which was the same order for the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and inversely related to residual water content higher hydraulic conductivity and lower soil water holding capacity will lead to higher water flux in the soil and correspondingly increased the nitrate n infiltration assuming a homogenous soil domain composed of sandy loam everywhere the leaching rate of nitrate n was higher across the domain compared to the heterogeneous domain and lower concentration of nitrate n was observed at 2 m from top this observation is consistent with a previous work russo et al 2013 where the modeling results demonstrate that a heterogeneous model with realistic distribution of soil properties is necessary to provide the spatial variability of nitrate n in the field overall the total amount of nitrate n mass was not significantly different in the heterogeneous and homogeneous domains during the simulation period in another study botros et al 2012 nitrate n transport in a 3 d domain was simulated by considering various level of heterogeneities all models resulted in very similar nitrate mass in the deep vadose zone the minimal impact of heterogeneity on the total mass of nitrate n in the domain was attributed to the repeated irrigation and fertilizer application which could also be the case for this study site 5 conclusion we investigated nitrate n transport in a field site by integrating 3 d numerical modeling with comprehensive field measurements the work was based on a data dense site in nebraska where the shallow groundwater beneath was contaminated with nitrate n concentration about 32 mg l 1 primarily as a result of nitrate n leaching from the root zone of nebraska s two million hectares of irrigated corn fields klocke et al 1999 here a realistic 3 d lithology model was first developed based on comprehensive well log information in the nebraska mesa site a 3 d hydrological model was then developed to simulate water flow and nitrate n transport in the site in parallel a homogeneous soil domain containing the major sediment type of the site i e sandy loam was developed to compare the water flow and nitrate n leaching in both domains in this work the 3 d soil and vadose zone lithology profile represented an unsaturated subsurface media combined with a saturated zone at the bottom short term variations of nitrate n concentration at the bottom of the domain in the saturated part are correlated to groundwater elevation fluctuations when groundwater level rose greater mass of nitrate n was added to the system and consequently increased the nitrate n concentration this work highlights the importance of considering groundwater level changes in simulating nitrate n concentration in the deeper vadose zone the soil heterogeneity on the site was mainly observed at the top soil down to 3 m from the surface and deeper parts were relatively homogeneous aquifer matrix heterogeneous soil properties has comprehensively impacted the spatial distribution of nitrate n concentration 3 d modeling was helpful to visualize spatial variations of nitrate n concentration at different screening depths and relate this variability to sediments distribution sediment types with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity and lower residual water content had lower water holding capacity which increased water infiltration rate as well as nitrate n leaching rates soil heterogeneity however has minimal impact on the total mass of nitrate n in the domain acknowledgement this research was supported by a project entitled influence of climate and agricultural clustering on groundwater contamination by trace organics which was sponsored by the united states department of agriculture grant no 2014 67003 22072 we would also like to thank the msea site cooperators for their assistance in collection of additional samples from their fields as well as extensive assistance from previous nebraska msea site investigators 
1670,contamination of groundwater from nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural lands is an important environmental and water quality management issue it is well recognized that in agriculturally intensive areas fertilizers and pesticides may leach through the vadose zone and eventually reach groundwater while numerical models are commonly used to simulate fate and transport of agricultural contaminants few models have considered a controlled field work to investigate the influence of soil heterogeneity and groundwater flow on nitrate n distribution in both root zone and deep vadose zone

year period the model was based on a realistic three dimensional sediment lithology as well as carefully controlled irrigation and fertilizer application plans in parallel a homogeneous soil domain containing the major sediment type of the site i e sandy loam was developed to conduct the same water flow and nitrate n leaching simulations simulated nitrate n concentrations were compared with the monitored nitrate n concentrations in 10 multi level sampling wells over a three year period although soil heterogeneity was mainly observed from top soil to 3 m below the surface heterogeneity controlled the spatial distribution of nitrate n concentration soil heterogeneity however has minimal impact on the total mass of nitrate n in the domain in the deeper saturated zone short term variations of nitrate n concentration correlated with the groundwater level fluctuations 1 introduction nitrate n leaching due to excessive nitrogen application irrigation and inappropriate soil management practices is a primary cause of groundwater pollution in agricultural regions gärdenäs et al 2005 zhu et al 2005 mitsch and day 2006 in areas of intense farming nitrate n concentrations in groundwater has been reported to exceed the maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg l 1 for drinking water established by the u s environmental protection agency usepa in many areas of the u s elevated nitrate n concentration in drinking water is harmful to pregnant women and elderly people and may cause methemoglobinemia in infants under 6 months spalding and exner 1993 water research center 2014 numerical modeling is an efficient tool for understanding the physical chemical and biological processes affecting nitrate n transport as well as in predicting and managing nitrate n pollution van der laan et al 2014 numerous studies have been published to model the fate and transport of nitrogen in soils focusing either on nitrogen leaching in the root zone nakamura et al 2004 skaggs et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 arbat et al 2013 deb et al 2015 iqbal et al 2016 or on nitrate n transport and transformation in the saturated zone macquarrie et al 2001 lee et al 2006 various models have been applied to simulate soil water and nitrogen dynamics in soils such as soil crop model stics ledoux et al 2007 poch massegú et al 2014 plaza bonilla et al 2015 root zone water quality model rzwqm ma et al 1998 agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 cropping system simulation model cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 soil water balance model swb sci van der laan et al 2014 as well as simple models solving water and nitrate n production functions cabon et al 1991 these modeling efforts have determined the significant impact of various parameters such as fertilizer application rate precipitation pattern irrigation strategies and soil types on nitrate n leaching in soils although these studies generally agree that field non uniformity widely exists however most of them simulated fairly simplified scenarios in the models assuming either one single soil type skaggs et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 deb et al 2015 or layered soil types hassan et al 2008 hu et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 poch massegú et al 2014 wang et al 2014 iqbal et al 2016 baram et al 2017 in a vertical 2d domain in reality soil properties varied spatially across the field which can hardly be captured by point soil samplings soil type and grain size distribution strongly influence soil water content distribution different soil types typically correspond to different soil organic matter and moisture content both of which could affect biodegradation rates furthermore horizontal soil texture variation and surface topography could also affect water content distribution and nutrient leaching pathways for example surface topography can result in surface water ponding which can influence soil water content distribution as well as soil dissolved oxygen concentration heterogeneity may easily influence contaminant biodegradation and leaching rate in the subsurface a few three dimensional 3d models have been developed to analyze water flow and solute transport in a 3d heterogeneous vadose zone groundwater system russo et al 2001 2013 botros et al 2012 russo et al 2013 clearly demonstrated that simple point 1 d modeling could not accurately simulate the spatial pattern of water content and nitrate concentration produced by rather complicated soil water plant atmosphere flow system as with many other studies the model simulated nitrate concentration was not compared against field data russo et al 2013 due to the cost and the need for long term monitoring botros et al 2012 simulated nitrate transport and storage within a 3 d 6 1 m by 6 1 m by 15 86 m heterogeneous vadose zone generated by geostatistical methods and compared the simulated amount of nitrate stored in the vadose zone with field measurements based on seven years of field fertilization data their modeling results suggested that numerical based modeling techniques overestimated the measured nitrogen mass in the deeper part of the vadose zone clearly the effect of fate and transport processes particularly in the deeper part of the vadose zone is not yet adequately quantified most of the available 3d models studied water flow and nitrate n leaching in relatively small field sites 20 m in width and only focused on the unsaturated part typically a constant pressure head boundary condition was imposed at the bottom of the simulation domain potential interactions of groundwater flux on the nitrate n distribution in the deeper part of the vadose zone were rarely investigated in this work we take advantage of a highly dense data set from a field site in nebraska management systems evaluation area msea the site was relatively well characterized so that a 3d lithologic model can be developed which provides realistic spatially varied soil properties on the site for comparison purpose a homogenous soil domain sandy loam soil was also simulated to compare and analyze the influences of soil heterogeneity the site has shallow water table providing ideal condition to study the impact of groundwater flux on the distribution of nitrate n in the deeper part of the vadose zone controlled field implementation of irrigation and fertilizer application was conducted in the 1990s and corresponding groundwater level and nitrate n concentration data were collected these data include the detailed description of lithology at 70 wells and 11 test holes annual irrigation water and fertilizer application rates and changing groundwater levels as well as the nitrate n concentration at 16 screening depths in 41 multilevel samplers three times a year spalding et al 2001 this rich data set allowed us to compare simulated and measured nitrate n concentrations in 10 wells on the site for a three year period strictly following well controlled irrigation and fertilization strategies the goal of this work is to better evaluate the impacts of soil heterogeneity as well as the interactions of groundwater flux on the transport of nitrate n in both root zone and vadose zone down to the water table 2 site description the study area was part of the nebraska msea site which is located within the central platte natural resources district cpnrd of the platte river valley fig 1a schepers et al 1995 spalding et al 2001 the 2 27 km2 msea site is in the southeastern buffalo county between shelton and gibbon nebraska u s a the climate of the study area is continental and temperate with an annual mean temperature and precipitation of 10 c and 623 mm respectively mcguire and kilpatrick 1998 the msea site consists of a buffer area in the up gradient a component research site and a demonstration site spalding et al 2001 during 1993 1995 the demonstration site 914 m long and 823 m wide was divided into four fields to implement and evaluate various agriculture management practices 1 a conventional furrow irrigated corn field 2 a surge irrigated corn field with 60 less water and 31 less n fertilizer application than the conventional field 3 a center pivot irrigated corn field with 66 less water and 37 less n fertilizer application than the conventional field and 4 a center pivot irrigated alfalfa mcguire and kilpatrick 1998 spalding et al 2001 during this period the irrigation and n fertilizer application amounts were controlled and documented changing groundwater levels and nitrate n concentrations were monitored at 41 multilevel samplers fig 1b in the demonstration site three times a year fig 2 presents the monthly precipitation irrigation and average groundwater elevation measured from february 1993 to december 1995 with average nitrate n concentrations between 30 and 32 mg l 1 mcguire and kilpatrick 1998 the shallow and rapidly recharged high plains alluvial aquifer is mainly used for irrigation nitrate n concentrations in the deeper confined cenozoic ogallala formation aquifer are 1 mg l 1 exner and spalding 1990 spalding et al 2001 however continued development of this resource will likely lead to impaired water quality as it has in the southernmost extent of this aquifer mcmahon et al 2006 chaudhuri and ale 2014 in this work nitrate n transport modeling was focused on transport beneath the center pivot irrigated corn field highlighted in fig 1b details on n applications in the center pivot irrigated corn field including pre plant starter and side dress fertilizer applied to the soil on or around the sides of the plant or fertigation injected urea ammonium nitrate solution into the irrigation water during 1993 1995 are provided in table 1 3 methods 3 1 development of a 3 dimentional modeling domain a three dimensional 3 d model of the lithology beneath the demonstration site was created using rockworks15 rockware inc 2016 a software widely used for subsurface data visualization rockworks interpolated the historically available well logging information university of nebraska lincoln 2000 at different locations including coordinates surface elevations total depths as well as lithology and then generated a surface topography map and a continuous lithology model fig 1b rockworks uses advanced geostatistical methods to perform three dimensional interpolation of the borehole data the horizontal lithoblending method with both randomize blending and interpolate outliners options was applied for this case to create the lithology solid model the numerical modeling domain covers the center pivot irrigated corn field which is 458 m long and 410 m wide fig 1c in order to further confirm the actual soil properties soil samples were collected on the site from the location of the wells soil particle size distribution analysis was conducted providing the percentage of silt sand and clay soil categories from historical well log information were more closely matched with recent field measurements and previously described soil categories were corrected based on the measurements and hydrological parameters were estimated using measured soil properties table 1 according to the soil particle size distribution analysis the deeper part of the simulation domain mainly consists of homogenous sandy loam while closer to the ground surface it contains four different types of loam fig 1b a lithology model of the center pivot irrigated corn field was then imported into hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 based on the lithology index of each node in the lithology model in rockworks an index was assigned to the closest node in the hydrus model corresponding soil type labels were then applied to all nodes based on the assigned index covering the unsaturated zone and about half of the shallow groundwater thickness the depth of the modeling domain varied between 8 99 and 9 48 m due to the uneven surface topography in the hydrus 3d model the horizontal mesh element size was 10 m and 20 vertical mesh layers were defined with gradually increased layer density from the surface to the bottom boundary 3 2

van genuchten mualem model can be very sensitive to the shape of the soil water retention curve near saturation for the purpose of confirmation the model was also simulated using a modified van genuchten model with an entry pressure specified ippisch et al 2006 which provided 1 5 differences of the water pressure and nitrate n concentration values across the simulation domain the sink term s

tillotson 1980 were considered for the transformation of nitrogen in this study correspondingly c 1 is urea c 2 is ammonium and c 3 is nitrate n urea nh2 2co was assumed to be rapidly hydrolyzed to ammonium nh4 in water by heterotrophic bacteria and then nitrified to nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 by autotrophic bacteria because the transformation from nitrite to nitrate is much faster than the nitrification of ammonium to nitrite hanson et al 2006 nitrite species was neglected in the simulation denitrification was not considered at this stage of modeling because previous isotope analysis of nitrate n indicated that denitrification was not an important process affecting ground water nitrate n at this location martin et al 1995 spalding et al 2001 nitrate n and urea concentrations were defined in liquid phase only while the sorption of ammonium onto soil was also considered the first order reaction coefficient μ w for urea to ammonium and for ammonium to nitrate were defined as 0 38 1 day and 0 2 1 day respectively based on reported values in literature misra et al 1974 selim and iskandar 1981 lotse et al 1992 ling and el kadi 1998 hanson et al 2006 jansson and karlberg 2010 a

the literature lotse et al 1992 ling and el kadi 1998 hanson et al 2006 root uptake of nutrients in forms of urea ammonium and nitrate n was simulated by multiplying root water uptake s to the dissolved nutrient concentration c r k when c r k is lower than the maximum root solute concentration c max or by multiplying s to c max if c is larger than c max c max was estimated as 0 033 kg m 3 nitrogen based on the maximum corn grain yield 14 mg ha 1 in the demonstration site spalding et al 2001 and the reported nitrogen requirements of corn nitrogen efficiency 2016 3 4 initial conditions the initial pressure head at the bottom of the domain was obtained by interpolating the groundwater level on april 1st 1993 in multilevel samplers in the center pivot irrigated corn field the soil profile was considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with the local groundwater level and initial pressure head was obtained by linear interpolation of the top surface and bottom bottom layer of the domain pressure head values the initial urea and ammonium concentration in the subsurface were considered as zero no n carryover the groundwater nitrate n concentrations measured on april 1st 1993 were used as the initial nitrate n concentration in the saturated zone in the previous field studies the residual nitrate n concentration was measured at each multilevel sampler to a depth of 1 2 m in each spring before planting klocke et al 1999 the initial nitrate n concentration of the domain was obtained by interpolating the measured nitrate n concentration at different screening depths of each multilevel sampler 3 5 boundary conditions an atmospheric boundary condition was implemented at the surface which required daily precipitation irrigation and potential evaporation and transpiration rates daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data et for reference crop alfalfa from 1993 to 1996 were collected from shelton weather station high plains regional climate center website 2016 located about 2 8 km south from msea site which is the closest weather station to the study site the total yearly irrigation amount table 1 was applied daily on days with zero precipitation during the irrigation season late june to end of september spalding et al 2001 the reference et adopted from shelton weather station was calculated using the penman monteith method to separate the potential evaporation and potential transpiration bear s law was applied šimůnek et al 2016 surface cover fraction scf was first calculated from leaf area index lai lai was obtained based on a report from the us ne2 site which is another university of nebraska research field with irrigated maize and soybean rotation ameriflux site and data exploration system 2016 a variable pressure head boundary condition was implemented at the bottom boundary to consider the groundwater elevation fluctuations during the simulation the daily rate of groundwater elevation change was obtained by linearly interpolating the groundwater level measurements at 14 different times after april 1st 1993 for both water flow and solute transport zero flux boundary condition was applied at the vertical boundaries which is the hydrus 3d default boundary condition and assumes that water and solute influx through side boundaries was compensated by outflux symmetry domain skaggs et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2005 iqbal et al 2016 for solute transport the third type cauchy type concentration flux boundary condition was specified along the surface boundary to prescribe nitrogen application nitrogen was applied at various times during 1993 1995 known as pre plant n starter n side dress fertigation n and irrigation n table 1 spalding et al 2001 starter n and side dress fertigation n were assumed to be added during the irrigation season late june to end of september spalding et al 2001 and were mixed with nitrate n in irrigation water 30 mg l 1 pre plant n was assumed to be applied in late march spalding et al 2001 concentration flux boundary condition third type was also applied at the bottom of the domain to prescribe a concentration flux defined by the groundwater nitrate n concentration 30 mg l 1 and groundwater flux along the bottom boundary 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between modeling results and field data fig 3 shows the comparison of simulated and measured vertical profiles of nitrate n concentration on october 1st and april 1st of 1993 to 1995 in ml1 ml5 ml7 and ml19 ml1 ml5 and ml7 are in the western part of the field and ml19 is in the eastern part of the field fig 1 the nitrate n concentration was mostly high near the ground surface due to the application of fertilizer applied nitrate n rapidly infiltrated into the subsurface due to both subsequent precipitation and irrigation which was then sharply reduced from about 20 40 mg l 1 on the surface to 10 mg l 1 at a depth of about 2 4 m from the surface changing groundwater nitrate n concentration measurements were based on multilevel samplers however no comparable data was available to compare with the simulated nitrate n concentration in the unsaturated zone in the saturated zone about 3 m below the ground the measured nitrate n concentrations in three multilevel sampler close to the western boundary of the field i e ml1 ml5 and ml7 were closely matched with the simulated results at different screening depths across the whole investigation period with the coefficient of determination r2 ranged between 0 69 and 0 98 the good agreement indicated that the mathematical model has accounted for the important processes controlling nitrate n transport in the area including soil heterogeneity despite good agreement for ml1 5 and 7 simulated nitrate n concentrations in a multilevel sampler close to the eastern boundary of the domain ml19 were about 1 2 to 3 times higher than the measured values r2 between 0 28 and 0 85 from october 1993 to october 1995 the nitrate n concentration was measured eight times per year in 10 multilevel samplers fig 1c for evaluation of sampling bias each at five to seven screening depths a total of 509 field measurements the overall coefficient of determination for all 509 field measurements is 0 6 with distinctly higher r2 values in the western part of the domain ml1 7 average r2 of 0 87 and much lower r2 values in the eastern part of the domain ml17 19 average r2 of 0 57 possible reasons for this discrepancy could be due to preferential flow paths or local denitrification process in the unsaturated zone for instance there might be preferential or non uniform flow paths in this region i e 2 to 8 m below the ground surface which facilitated nitrate n movement toward the groundwater and reduced the concentration based on uniform nitrogen isotope composition denitrification process was assumed to be limited in the groundwater because dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were too low spalding et al 2001 based on the n2 ar ratios measurements on this site martin et al 1995 also demonstrated that n2 was not in excess of air saturated water values in most of the sampled cluster wells indicating that denitrification was very limited in the shallow groundwater however this does not rule out the possibility of denitrification in local areas particularly in stagnant zones of water flow in a similar nitrate n transport study by botros et al 2012 numerical models were found to overestimate the field measurement nitrate n mass which was partially attributed to spatially variable denitrification more field data and measurements are needed to incorporate a spatially variable denitrification process despite the incorporated soil heterogeneity in the model in this simulation all parameters were either direct field measurements or estimated from measured soil properties no parameter fitting was conducted although the discrepancies exist for some parts of the domain the overall agreement between the modeling and field measured data in most cases on a realistic field site for a 3 year simulation period indicates that the model captured most important processes that control the transport of nitrate n in the area 4 2 impact of groundwater fluctuation on nitrate n in the domain different from commonly reported profiles in literature where nitrate n concentration continuously decreased with increasing depth after reaching a minimum the nitrate n concentration gradually increased in the deeper part of the aquifer and reached a value of about 30 mg l 1 at the bottom of the modeling domain we hypothesize that the higher concentration of nitrate n in the deeper part of the domain was due to the influence of groundwater flux groundwater in this area was contaminated with an average nitrate n concentration of about 32 mg l 1 attributed to over 30 years of excess irrigation water and fertilizer application in furrow irrigated corn up gradient of the site spalding et al 2001 nitrate n in the groundwater was brought into the domain when groundwater elevation was increased previous studies in the same field also hypothesized that induced flux led to seasonal changes of nitrate n concentration lasserre et al 1999 spalding et al 2001 stigter et al 2011 which however was based on the average value of nitrate n concentration at several locations beneath the whole center pivot irrigated corn field in this work a variable pressure head boundary condition was implemented at the bottom boundary to consider the groundwater elevation fluctuations during the simulation period to testify the role of groundwater elevation fluctuation on the distribution of nitrate n in the deeper part of the modeling zone we conducted another simulation by applying a constant pressure head boundary condition at the bottom of the domain fig 4 as illustrated in fig 4 a constant pressure boundary condition predicted a very low nitrate n concentration down to about 6 m from the ground and then a sharp increase close to the bottom boundary furthermore the nitrate n concentration profile predicted by a constant pressure head boundary condition does not change over time a variable pressure head boundary condition was able to produce the gradual increase of the nitrate n concentration with depth as well as the vertical distribution of concentration profile over time which supports the hypothesis that groundwater elevation fluctuations correspond to a flux of nitrate n fig 5 presents the simulated pressure head and nitrate n concentration distribution at the bottom layer of the domain between 8 99 and 9 48 m below the ground surface based on surface topography at six different time during 1993 1995 this layer was right at the bottom boundary of the modeling domain and therefore pressure head values were corresponding to the thickness of the groundwater in the domain from october 1993 to october 1995 the groundwater thickness showed a trend of declining with corresponding pressure head values ranged from 5 2 to 6 2 m in oct 1993 4 5 to 5 5 m in oct 1994 and 3 9 to 5 m in oct 1995 the pressure head was higher in the western part of the field than the eastern part which resulted in a 1 m year horizontal groundwater flow from northwest toward southeast at this layer changing nitrate n concentrations were also sensitive to changing groundwater levels nitrate n concentrations were generally higher in the months with higher groundwater levels fig 5 for example nitrate n concentrations were higher in april of 1994 and 1995 than october of 1994 and 1995 which was consistent with the observed higher pressure head in april of both years fig 5 from april 1993 to october 1995 an overall decreasing trend in the nitrate n concentration in the groundwater was observed which can be attributed to the overall reduction of groundwater elevation in this period in other words a greater amount of nitrate n mass left the domain and reduced the nitrate n concentrations in the saturated part fig 6 presents the bottom layer water and solute flux over time as clearly shown here solute flux variations closely followed the trend of groundwater flux so that nitrate n flux at the bottom was correspondent to the groundwater elevation fluctuation during the simulation period this observation supports our hypothesis that the concentration of nitrate n in the deeper part of the domain was correlated to the groundwater flux this finding demonstrates the importance of coupling of the unsaturated zone and saturated zone in investigating nitrate n transport in the subsurface 4 3 impacts of soil heterogeneity on the nitrate n in the domain as shown in fig 7 four different types of loam were distributed in the top 3 m of the simulation domain below 3 m the domain was homogeneously composed of sandy loam to evaluate the impacts of soil heterogeneity in the first 3 m of the domain a same simulation was conducted in a homogeneous domain composed of only sandy loam across the whole domain fig 8 highlights a comparison of pressure head and nitrate n concentration between homogeneous and heterogeneous domain on oct 1st of 1995 at the depth of 2 m from the ground surface in the homogenous domain water pressure head was higher in the eastern part of the domain than the western part despite the identical soil properties everywhere which was due to uneven surface topography where surface elevation in the eastern part was about 0 5 m lower than in the western part the minimum in the west and maximum in the east water content were about 0 18 and 0 21 in the homogenous domain and 0 11 and 0 31 in the heterogeneous domain respectively moreover the pressure head distribution in the homogenous soil domain was uniform for the heterogeneous domain fig 8 the spatial distribution of pressure head was correlated to the sediment distribution fig 7 particularly loam 1 delineated a zone with varying soil moisture content in the heterogeneous domain with relatively lower pressure head ca 4 8 to 3 2 m in the western part of the domain than the adjacent area ca 2 6 to 2 1 m according to the soil particle size analysis table 1 soil samples from loam1 loam2 and loam 3 have different hydraulic parameters although they all belong to general loam category loam 1 was majorly located between 1 17 m and 3 m from the surface and because the water holding capacity of loam 1 was higher than the sandy loam in the surrounding area water infiltration rate above loam 1 was reduced which led to a decreased water pressure head at the 2 m layer similar to the pressure head distributions the nitrate n distribution at the 2 m soil layer was also impacted by the soil heterogeneity and surface topography fig 8b due to the lower surface elevation in the eastern part of the domain nitrate n reached this level more rapidly therefore higher nitrate n concentration was observed in the eastern part point by point comparisons showed that nitrate n concentrations in the homogenous domain were either equal to or lower than that in the heterogeneous domain fig 8b with the same surface loading and simulation duration higher nitrate n concentration in the heterogeneous domain could be partially attributed to the drier soil condition at the 2 m soil layer fig 8a because the higher soil moisture content in the homogenous soil layer could result in the dilution of nitrate n and reduced concentration in addition less nitrate n was retained in this layer in the homogenous domain due to the promoted infiltration within the sandy loam soil type in the heterogeneous domain nitrate n infiltration rates from high to low followed the order of sandy loam loam 1 loam 2 loam 3 which was the same order for the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and inversely related to residual water content higher hydraulic conductivity and lower soil water holding capacity will lead to higher water flux in the soil and correspondingly increased the nitrate n infiltration assuming a homogenous soil domain composed of sandy loam everywhere the leaching rate of nitrate n was higher across the domain compared to the heterogeneous domain and lower concentration of nitrate n was observed at 2 m from top this observation is consistent with a previous work russo et al 2013 where the modeling results demonstrate that a heterogeneous model with realistic distribution of soil properties is necessary to provide the spatial variability of nitrate n in the field overall the total amount of nitrate n mass was not significantly different in the heterogeneous and homogeneous domains during the simulation period in another study botros et al 2012 nitrate n transport in a 3 d domain was simulated by considering various level of heterogeneities all models resulted in very similar nitrate mass in the deep vadose zone the minimal impact of heterogeneity on the total mass of nitrate n in the domain was attributed to the repeated irrigation and fertilizer application which could also be the case for this study site 5 conclusion we investigated nitrate n transport in a field site by integrating 3 d numerical modeling with comprehensive field measurements the work was based on a data dense site in nebraska where the shallow groundwater beneath was contaminated with nitrate n concentration about 32 mg l 1 primarily as a result of nitrate n leaching from the root zone of nebraska s two million hectares of irrigated corn fields klocke et al 1999 here a realistic 3 d lithology model was first developed based on comprehensive well log information in the nebraska mesa site a 3 d hydrological model was then developed to simulate water flow and nitrate n transport in the site in parallel a homogeneous soil domain containing the major sediment type of the site i e sandy loam was developed to compare the water flow and nitrate n leaching in both domains in this work the 3 d soil and vadose zone lithology profile represented an unsaturated subsurface media combined with a saturated zone at the bottom short term variations of nitrate n concentration at the bottom of the domain in the saturated part are correlated to groundwater elevation fluctuations when groundwater level rose greater mass of nitrate n was added to the system and consequently increased the nitrate n concentration this work highlights the importance of considering groundwater level changes in simulating nitrate n concentration in the deeper vadose zone the soil heterogeneity on the site was mainly observed at the top soil down to 3 m from the surface and deeper parts were relatively homogeneous aquifer matrix heterogeneous soil properties has comprehensively impacted the spatial distribution of nitrate n concentration 3 d modeling was helpful to visualize spatial variations of nitrate n concentration at different screening depths and relate this variability to sediments distribution sediment types with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity and lower residual water content had lower water holding capacity which increased water infiltration rate as well as nitrate n leaching rates soil heterogeneity however has minimal impact on the total mass of nitrate n in the domain acknowledgement this research was supported by a project entitled influence of climate and agricultural clustering

1671,in this paper a method for extraction of the behavior parameters of bacterial migration based on the run and tumble conceptual model is described the methodology is applied to the microscopic images representing the motile movement of flagellated azotobacter vinelandii the bacterial cells are considered to change direction during both runs and tumbles as is evident from the movement trajectories an unsupervised cluster analysis was performed to fractionate each bacterial trajectory into run and tumble segments and then the distribution of parameters for each mode were extracted by fitting mathematical distributions best representing the data a gaussian copula was used to model the autocorrelation in swimming velocity for both run and tumble modes gamma distribution was found

the bacteria from a uniform distribution independently from the previous direction wilson et al 2011 used schulz distribution for velocity of motile bacteria to parameterize a normalized intermediate scattering function used to extract bacterial motility parameters from imaging data however few parameters of physical models were derived from the real data in this paper an attempt to extract the run and tumble motility parameters of flagellated azotobacter vinelandii based on microscopic images of a large number of cells is presented the frequency distributions of the following quantities have been extracted from images representing bacterial movement trajectories transition time the time spent in each state of run and tumble deviation angle distribution during run and tumble states the velocity distribution as well as the temporal velocity correlation which is captured using a copula approach it is assumed that the bacterial cells can deviate change direction during both runs and tumbles based on the observation from the movement paths in the images however it is expected that the variance of deviation angles to be larger during the tumble state compared to the run state for the purpose of estimating motility behaviorial distributions an unsupervised cluster analysis has been applied to fractionate each bacterial trajectory into run and tumble states after that the distributions for each mode can be extracted by fitting mathematical distributions which best representing the data a model was then developed to mimic the motility behavior of bacteria at the presence of flow the proposed model was applied to a micro model collector experiment to determine its ability to explain the observed spatial distribution of bacterial deposition on the collector surfaces lu et al 2015a 2 materials and methods the research was conducted in two stages firstly data acquisition and processing image processing and trajectory analysis was used to 1 discriminate the mode of motion i e run tumble and 2 extract the statistical distribution of factors controlling the motility behavior in each mode secondly simulation model development a discrete particle tracking model was developed based on the results of the analysis in the first stage and applied to the hydrodynamic field surrounding a single cylindrical collector the spatial distribution of cells on the collectors were qualitatively compared with the results of a micro model experiment lu et al 2015a 2 1 data collection a soil bacterial strain azotobacter vinelandii was used as our model bacterium the transport and fate of this bacterium has been our continuous research quest in understanding the interplay of bacterial motility transport and horizontal gene transfer massoudieh et al 2013 lu et al 2015a b liang et al 2015 a vinelandii cells were grown on modified no molybdenum burks medium strandberg and wilson 1968 plates with addition of 0 013 m ammonium acetate at 30 c for 2 days and then in liquid media of modified no molybdenum no iron burks medium strandberg and wilson 1968 with addition of 0 013 m ammonium acetate shaking at 170 rpm for 18 to 20 h lu et al 2013 the cell suspension 2 7 107 to 4 2 107 cells ml in 3 mor pholinopropane 1 sulfonic acid mops buffer solution with 100 mm kcl at ph 7 2 was continuously pumped into the micromodel at a darcy s velocity of 200 μm s the experimental conditions used in previous studies massoudieh et al 2013 lu et al 2015a b liang et al 2015 were followed to facilitate comparability across studies to investigate the effects of motility the micromodel consists of a regular array of 1440 cylindrical collectors to mimic the porous structures in the subsurface soil and the bacterial movement around one of the collectors was continuously recorded using an inverted axio observer microscope carl zeiss oberkochen germany and a camera andor technology ixon 897 belfast uk controlled by solis software andor technology each image stack of 1000 pictures were taken per 31 second duration and the stack was obtained with a 0 4 μm per pixel size resolution 2 1 1 image analysis cell locations in each frame were extracted using a particle tracker plugin initially developed by mosaic group sep 2014 release sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 for imagej abràmoff et al 2004 rasband 1997 sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 schneider et al 2012 the bacteria profile in this study are similar to colloidal spheres the estimation of the bacteria location is done by finding the local intensity maxima in the analyzed image for example the location is estimated as the brightest pixel within a distance and if its intensity is in the upper user defined percentile of intensity values of the current frame to refine the location an approximation of offset is given by the distance to the centroid of the noise reduced image brownian motion was treated as a gaussian noise and reduced with filter during image processing visual inspection indicated that the particles were well detected from the background and shadows fig 1 shows an example of original image taken by the inverted axio observer microscope and the detected cells by the particle tracker s particle detection function 2 1 2 extracting cell trajectories the linking algorithm sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 identifies points corresponding to the same physical particle in subsequent frames and links the positions c t t 1 t in order to construct trajectories this involves finding a set of associations between the point location matrices c t t 1 t based on maximization of total likelihood of all trajectories the current implementation is based on a particle matching algorithm sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 using a graph theory to determine the optimal associations between two sets of points fig 2 shows a few examples of the extracted trajectories 2 2 trajectory analysis run tumble mode discrimination the motility behavior of bacteria was classified into two modes run and tumble using an unsupervised clustering approach based on predefined quantitative aggregate measures representing the motion behavior in order to perform the cluster analysis on the computed trajectories quantitative clustering features need to be selected and calculated several features were proposed and used in clustering based on their ability to discriminate between run and tumble modes these features include effective velocity i e movement velocity effective movement area moving average of incremental displacement maid deviation angle variance dav radius of fitted arc rfa the last three features maid dav and rfa were found to have a better discriminatory ability compared to the first two through comparing how they identify run vs tumble modes in a limited number of cases based on what is perceived through visual inspection fig 5 therefore these three features are briefly described in the following 2 2 1 moving average of incremental displacement maid when bacteria tumbles a significant decrease in effective swimming speed and thus a decrease in incremental displacement is expected while the incremental displacements during the run stage is expected to be monotonic increasing therefore we expect the incremental displacements to be different under run and tumble modes and the incremental displacements may provide a clustering quantity to discriminate between run and tumble modes the incremental displacement is defined as the euclidean distance between two consecutive points on the trajectory in preparing the input data for clustering a moving average method was applied to eliminate the effect of possible noise 1 d j t i w 2 1 w 2 d j t i where w is the window size for calculating the moving average d j t is the calculated incremental distance at time t and d j t 1 is the euclidean distance between two consecutive time steps 2 2 2 deviation angle variance dav another feature of the trajectories that can potentially be useful in discriminating between run and tumble modes is how erratically the movement direction changes the dav measure can be used as a surrogate to the rate of directional change over the pathways it should be noted that the noise in the images and the errors in inferred cell locations can distort the perceived local deviation angles obtained based on a single time step on the trajectory therefore an algorithm described as follows was devised to minimize the effects of these errors as is described here to determine dav at a given time step t based on a given window size w the previous w 2 steps or nodes and the following w 2 steps were used the w nodes were all connected to each other and resulted in w w 1 2 segments the angle of each segment with the horizontal line were then used to calculate the variance of the angles as 2 σ 1 n i 0 w w 1 2 α i 2 i 0 w w 1 2 α i n 2 where α i is the angle of segment i with the horizontal axis w is the window size n is the total number of angles captured in the span σ is the variance of the angle a matlabtm code was developed to analyze and extract this feature from the pathways of each cell obtained from the particle tracking module 2 2 3 radius of fitted circular arc rfa this measure is based on finding the radius of the circular arc fitted to the vertexes of each time step on a given window of the trajectory a large radius is an indicator of a straight run whereas a small radius reflects a high variability in the direction or tumble mode a least square approach with a given window size w was used to estimate the circular arc radius for any node on the trajectory the measure of the goodness of fit of the circular arc x a 2 y b 2 r 2 to the points x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n can be computed by summing the squares of the distances from the points to the circle the measure is expressed by 3 s e x o y o r i w 2 1 w 2 r x i x o 2 y i y o 2 2 where x o y o is the center of the fitted circle r is the radius of the fitted circle w is the window size and se is the sum of squared errors of prediction sse to be minimized the best fit can be obtained by setting the derivative of se with respect to x o y o and r equal to zero which can be done using newton raphson approach atkinson 2008 2 2 4 feature normalization the numeric values of these three features have different ranges therefore feature normalization was performed to standardized the range of the features in general two methods were used due to different characteristics of the extracted data dav and maid vary within a smaller range compared to rfa while rfa has values ranging within 0 therefore a linear standard score transformation described in eq 4 was applied to the dav and maid metrics meanwhile a non linear mapping described in eq 5 was applied to the results of the rfa 4 x i x i μ σ 5 x i x i 1 x i the unsupervised learning algorithm k means cluster analysis macqueen 1967 was used to evaluate the best clustering indexes and to perform the clustering analysis using the three proposed features the silhouette criterion kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 was used to evaluate the number of clusters 2 3 extracting statistics of motion behavior parameters the parameters governing the motility behavior were extracted separately for runs and tumble modes a simulation model was built to reproduce the motility behaviors qualitatively our simulation model is based on the following three conceptualizations the movement direction at each time interval is defined in eq 6 and varies by a random number according to a distributions that can be obtained from the observed data 6 θ i 1 θ i u δ θ γ m where u δθ is a random number based on the distribution of deviation angle with its parameters represented by γ m under each mode of motility m i e run tumble the overall marginal distribution of velocity is extracted from the trajectory analysis while the temporal velocity auto correlation is preserved by expressing the joint distribution of consecutive velocities using a copula function 7 v i 1 p v i 1 v i p v i 1 v i p v i where p v i 1 v i is the probability of new velocity v i 1 conditional to the velocity of previous time step v i and p v i v i 1 is the joint distribution of v i and v i 1 p v is the marginal velocity distribution in a given mode of motion in order to preserve the known marginal velocity distribution the joint distribution of v i v i 1 is assumed to follow a gaussian copula durante and sempi 2010 jaworski et al 2010 8 p v i v i 1 p v i p v i 1 c p v i p v i 1 where c is the non cumulative gaussian copula function and p v is the corresponding cumulative probability of v for the case of bi variate gaussian copula c is defined as 9 c r g a u s s u ϕ r ϕ 1 u 1 ϕ 1 u 1 where ϕ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution of standard normal distribution and ϕ r is the bi variate normal distribution with a mean of zero and variance covariance matrix of r and r is the 2 2 rank correlation matrix correlation between velocity ranks of sequential segments of trajectories the transition from a run mode to a tumble mode or from a tumble mode to a run mode is determined based on the probability distribution that can be obtained by analyzing the observed bacterial pathways given the distribution of the duration of staying in a given state represented by f t t the probability of transition in a given time step is 10 p t τ t δ t f t t δ t t 0 f t t t 0 1 f t t t 0 f t t t 0 δ t 1 f t t t 0 where the right hand side is the probability of a change of the motility mode run tumble occurring during the time interval t t δt and t 0 is the time of previous mode transition so t t 0 is the time passed from the previous transition and f t is the cumulative of f t it should be noted that if transition is assumed to be a poisson process i e p t is constant then the transition time distribution becomes exponential and vice versa the aggregate statistics needed to simulate the bacteria motility trajectories include the following a marginal velocity distribution and the rank correlation of sequential velocities b deviation angle distribution of each mode of movement and c the transition time distribution these factors were extracted from the trajectories of cells obtained from image processing 2 4 model development based on the information extracted from the trajectory analysis a mechanistic model to simulate bacterial trajectories in the absence of chemotaxis has been developed the model is based on a random walk governed by 1 hydrodynamic 2 motile movement and 3 brownian diffusion thus bacterial transition in each time step can be simulated using the following equation 11 δ x v m v h δ t d t ϵ where v m represents the motile velocity vector which is obtained from eq 7 for magnitude and eq 6 for direction v h is the hydrodynamic velocity field d is the diffusion coefficient and ϵ is non correlated standard gaussian noise specifically the velocity magnitude is simulated according to v m t δt p v v m t or explicitly v m t δ t c 1 1 p v m t u where c 1 is the integral of the function c r in eq 9 with respect to it s first argument and u is a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 1 for more information on generating correlated random numbers based on a correlation defined by a copula function see massoudieh et al 2017 the deviation angle is extracted as a random number from the parameterized deviation angle distribution depending on the mode of swimming run and tumble at each time step the probability of changing the state from run to tumble or tumble to run is calculated based on eq 10 and the mode is changed when a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 is smaller than this probability if the inertial effects are assumed negligible v h can be considered to be equal to the fluid velocity field at the location of cells v m varies both in direction and magnitude at each time step according to the information obtained from the trajectory analysis the effect of hindered diffusion near the surfaces was considered by applying a correction factor to the diffusion components parallel and perpendicular to the collector surfaces based on goldman et al 1967 12 f n min exp 0 00332 ln δ a 3 0 019251 ln δ a 2 0 18271 ln δ a 0 32747 1 13 f t min exp 0 005768 ln δ a 3 0 092235 ln δ a 2 0 52669 ln δ a 0 76952 1 where f n and f t respectively represent the diffusion correction factor in directions normal and parallel to the collector surface δ is the distance gap between the cell and the surface of the collector and a is the radius of the cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 trajectory analysis the image analysis were done using the images taken from non obstructed experiments no collectors and the trajectories representing bacterial paths were extracted different combinations of the aggregated clustering features have been tested for clustering for example utilizing a single feature a combination of two features and linear combination of features obtained from performing principal component analysis by manually inspecting five trajectories supervised learning it is shown that the k means algorithm distinguished best between run and tumble modes when utilizing maid dav and rfa together as for window sizes sizes of 5 to 25 were tested based on the sum of squared errors of prediction sse for k means method fig 3 a the results show a window size 21 provides the best clustering result in differentiating the run and tumble modes the silhouette method was used to assess the effect of the number of clusters on the variability of the discriminating aggregated statistics within each cluster the silhouette value ranges from 1 to 1 a high silhouette value indicates low variability within the cluster and high variability between clusters if most points have a high silhouette value then the clustering solution is appropriate the number of clusters from 2 to 6 were evaluated and results are shown in fig 3b the number of clusters was determined as 2 which matches the previous experimental observations berg and turner 1990 describing bacterial motion as run and tumble the clustering results using k means method with 3 proposed features are shown in table 1 and fig 4 there were 523 total trajectories detected in the azotobacter vinelandii strain out of the 1000 images in total there were 84410 segments detected for clustering analysis 42 of the segments were clustered as run and 58 were clustered as tumble as it is expected the segments classified as run have higher maid rfa mean and smaller dav mean than the tumble group in fig 4 it can be seen that for the segments identified as being in tumble mode the rfa can vary between 0 and 1 but the segments identified as run typically have larger rfa values this is due to the fact that under tumbling mode the trajectories do not necessarily follow circular arc trajectories sample trajectories with segments color coded based on each clustering feature and clustering results are shown in fig 5 the color coded trajectories can be used as a measure to inspect the clustering results visually 3 2 marginal velocity distribution in each mode run and tumble with the fitted distribution to determine which distribution can best describe the parameters we have estimated a matlab function fitalldist m developed by m sheppard 2012 was used this function fits all valid parametric probability distribution of the data and return the parameter values of all the mathematical distributions fitted ordered by the bayesian information criterion bic bhat and kumar 2010 of the fit several continuous distributions were tested including beta distribution exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value inverse gaussian logistic log logistic lognormal and normal the bic values for the distributions with lower bics are shown in table 2 it can be observed in fig 6 that as it is expected the run mode has a higher mean velocity with parameters α 4 6387 and β 0 2269 i e mean 20 44 μm s for gamma distribution compared to the tumble mode with α 0 6711 and β 0 2889 i e mean 2 32 μm s the velocity and velocity rank auto correlation for each mode are shown in fig 7 overall the auto correlation values are significant in both modes however as expected the tumble mode tends to have a weaker correlation than run mode fig 8 shows the transition time distribution for tumble and run modes tumble mode presents a higher frequency of transitions i e lower mean transition time than the run mode which matched the previous studies turner et al 2000 however the difference is not noteworthy the mean transition time for tumble mode is 0 65 s while the average transition time for run mode is 0 69 s fig 9 shows the distribution of transformed turn angles fitted by the logistic distribution for both run and tumble modes as expected the standard deviation of the deviation angle distribution is significantly larger under tumble mode compared to run mode fig 10 shows modeled vs measured mean bacterial displacement σ 2 r r 0 2 n as a function of time the modeled results are based on simulating 1000 cells all starting at a single position and the measured values are based on all detected trajectories all translated to a single position and assumed to start at time t 0 the value of n is the number of trajectories available at the time of calculations i e with total time length greater than the value in the time axis we suspect the discrepancy at smaller distances are due to the cells that are effectively stuck and at larger times to be due to cells leaving the window biasing the results 3 3 micro model demonstration case the motility model was applied to the images capturing the deposition of bacteria in a micro model experiment lu et al 2015a the rapid movement of cells due to high advective flow in these experiments did not allow for extracting the trajectories accurately but the spatial location of deposition on collectors can be extracted these spatial distributions were used to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the model to reproduce the deposition spatial distribution the purpose of this demonstration was not to quantitatively reproduce the spatial distribution of deposition on the solid phase but to examine whether the motility model can qualitatively explain the deposition distribution and to examine the effect of hydrodynamic passive versus motile active bacterial movement in the experiments silicon micro models were fabricated through a standard photolithography procedure as described by liu et al 2012 within each micromodel a total of 1440 cylindrical collectors 180 μm diameter 114 μm in pore body size 28 μm in pore throat size were etched to 22 μm depth in a si wafer resulting in a porosity of 0 4 similar to that of the packed bed columns for all micro model experiments electrolyte solutions containing bacterial cells were injected into the device continuously with an approach velocity of 200 μm images were collected using a leica microscope connected to a charge coupled device ccd camera qimaging retiga 2000r fast 1394 and image pro 7 0 plus software fig 11 lu et al 2015a shows the configuration of the micro model setup and the deposition distribution of a vinelandii over three of the collectors in three longitudinal locations due to the fact that the distance range of dlvo hermansson 1999 forces are orders of magnitude smaller than the size of bacteria dlvo forces were not directly included in the model and the deposition of bacteria on the surfaces were modeled by assigning a probability of sticking when a bacterium encounters the surfaces bacterial cells were assumed to be spherical with a diameter of 1 μm comsol finite element method was used to obtain the laminar hydrodynamic flow field around a cylindrical collector fig 12 shows the finite element mesh and the resulting velocity field around a single cylindrical collector the approaching velocity was considered to be 200 μm s which is consistent with the experimental conditions the flow direction is from left to right the brownian diffusion coefficient was calculated to be 0 145 μm2 s based on the stokes einstein equation and the size of bacterial cells 10000 cells were released at the same time uniformly along the vertical direction at the left inlet of the simulation model and the simulation was performed over a duration of 10 s so all the non attached cells can exit the left boundary of the model the motility parameters were specified based on the values obtained in the trajectory analysis as explained in the previous section two different sticking probabilities of 0 05 and 5 10 3 were considered it should be noted that the sticking probability represent the probability that an encounter to the surface results in a permanent attachment so if a cell does not attach in the first encounter there is a chance that it may stick in the second encounter also to evaluate the role of hydrodynamic velocity a simulation was performed using a 10 times slower approaching velocity a set of selected simulated trajectories are shown in fig 13 as it can be seen under 200 μm s approaching velocity the trajectories by and large conform to the hydrodynamic streamlines this is expected due to the fact the flow velocity is around 10 times larger than the mean motile velocity the spots representing the attachment locations are shown in fig 14 the four different parameters sets used to generate the results in the four panels of figs 13 and 14 are respectively a the actual motility parameters derived from the image processing with a 0 5 sticking probability b the actual motile parameters with a higher sticking probability of 5 c similar to case a but a 10 times increase in motility i e motility of approximately 200 μm s with a 0 5 attachment rate d no motility effect with 0 5 sticking probability as compared to the experimental results fig 11 the simulated results in case a and b qualitatively match the spatial distribution of attachment in the inlet middle and outlet locations in the sense that it results in concentration of attachment sites at the front side of the collectors and less attachment occurs on the back side of the collectors the case with no motility case d results in a high concentration of attachment sites in the front side with almost no attachments on the sides and the backsides this may be due to the large size of the cells which lead to a small value of brownian diffusion coefficient it should be noted that additional hydrodynamic dispersion may affect real non motile cells due to interaction between the flow and the irregular shape of the cells which was neglected in this study the spatial distribution of the attachment sites are almost similar under the assumption of 0 5 and 5 sticking probability with the exception that a lower sticking probability results in a lower overall attachment rate and a larger relative concentration on the back side of the collector as expected also as expected a smaller hydrodynamic velocity fig 14c results in a much more uniform distribution of attachment sites around the collector which is indicative of the dominance of the motile movement with random directions fig 15 shows the distribution of angular location of attached bacteria on the collector surface by and large the results are consistent although some major discrepancies cannot be overlooked the model predicts attachments mostly occur at the front of the collectors with some occurring on the sides but towards the back of the collector while the observed data show most of the attachments occurring in the front with some major attachments uniformly distributed at the sides of the collector the simulation results are consistent with previous modeling results nelson et al 2007 which shows based on the hypothesized run and tumble parameters that with hydrodynamic velocity dominating the transport bacteria accumulates mostly at the front end of the collectors the simulation results from case a b qualitatively reproduce the experimental observation on motile strain and case d is qualitatively consistent with non motile strain deposition in lu et al 2015a it should be noted that in reality bacteria swim in three dimensions which can affect the effective projected velocities onto the two dimensional plane however since the parameters of the motility model were also determined based on a two dimensional system the effective projected velocities on the two dimensional plane is thought to be applied in the model also it should be pointed out that the motile behavior particularly at the proximity of the surfaces may be affected by the sheer flow though no definitive quantitative understanding of this phenomena is currently available 4 conclusions traditionally in bacterial motility study researchers focused more on single or few microbes and compared modeling results with experimental results other macro scale studies focus on group behaviors without perceiving the behavior of individual bacterium the advancement in image acquisition using digital microscopic imaging techniques has resulted in extraordinary growth in data volume and complexity in bacterial motility research field group behavior tracking and modeling would hardly be possible without an automated method in the first part of this study an automatic pipeline was presented for large scale bacterial motility behavior analysis image processing and pattern recognition techniques were employed to detect the trajectories maid rfa and dav features were used to cluster the trajectory segments into run and tumble modes as further input for the trajectory simulation mode statistical parameters have been extracted for marginal velocity velocity correlation deviation angle and the transition between run and tumble modes for both run and tumble modes gamma distribution fits the marginal velocity best and logistic distribution fits the deviation angle best for the runtime distribution log logistic distribution and log normal distribution were found to be superior than the traditionally agreed exponential distribution respectively for run and tumble modes in the second half of this study a meso scale motility model has been implemented with copula the model has been applied in micro model settings demonstration case and verified qualitatively to reproduce the micro scale model behavior the proposed framework can save laborious work in manually observing the trajectories and make statistical feature extraction of bacteria motility more accurate this framework can also provide a systematic approach to process bacteria images and to extract knowledge and insights of bacteria motility that leads to a better understanding of bacteria behavior once the mystery of bacteria migration is solved the beneficial aspects of bacteria could be further studied and applied in engineering medicine and other fields it could be rapidly replicated in similar studies with different bacteria strains parameters of model inputs might vary in other studies but the work flow would be similar further studies could also be done to address the limitations in this study for example in real world the bacteria swim in a 3d region while in the model discussed previously although the motility has a 3d capability due to the 2d images and limitations to the image processing techniques the motility model was applied in 2d additionally further studies can be done in understanding the transition spectrum between run and tumble modes the different variations of trajectory

1671,in this paper a method for extraction of the behavior parameters of bacterial migration based on the run and tumble conceptual model is described the methodology is applied to the microscopic images representing the motile movement of flagellated azotobacter vinelandii the bacterial cells are considered to change direction during both runs and tumbles as is evident from the movement trajectories an unsupervised cluster analysis was performed to fractionate each bacterial trajectory into run and tumble segments and then the distribution of parameters for each mode were extracted by fitting mathematical distributions best representing the data a gaussian copula was used to model the autocorrelation in swimming velocity for both run and tumble modes gamma distribution was found to fit the marginal velocity best and logistic distribution was found to represent better the deviation angle than other distributions considered for the transition rate distribution log logistic

exponentially distributed run time block et al 1983 also found out that the distributions of run and tumble intervals were exponential zonia and bray 2009 modeled the deviation angle in tumbling events according to a random number generated by a gaussian distribution based on the experimental values described by turner et al 2000 other models e g martens et al 2012 drawn the new direction of the bacteria from a uniform distribution independently from the previous direction wilson et al 2011 used schulz distribution for velocity of motile bacteria to parameterize a normalized intermediate scattering function used to extract bacterial motility parameters from imaging data however few parameters of physical models were derived from the real data in this paper an attempt to extract the run and tumble motility parameters of flagellated azotobacter vinelandii based on microscopic images of a large number of cells is presented the frequency distributions of the following quantities have been extracted from images representing bacterial movement trajectories transition time the time spent in each state of run and tumble deviation angle distribution during run and tumble states the velocity distribution as well as the temporal velocity correlation which is captured using a copula approach it is assumed that the bacterial cells can deviate change direction during both runs and tumbles based on the observation from the movement paths in the images however it is expected that the variance of deviation angles to be larger during the tumble state compared to the run state for the purpose of estimating motility behaviorial distributions an unsupervised cluster analysis has been applied to fractionate each bacterial trajectory into run and tumble states after that the distributions for each mode can be extracted by fitting mathematical distributions which best representing the data a model was then developed to mimic the motility behavior of bacteria at the presence of flow the proposed model was applied to a micro model collector experiment to determine its ability to explain the observed spatial distribution of bacterial deposition on the collector surfaces lu et al 2015a 2 materials and methods the research was conducted in two stages firstly data acquisition and processing image processing and trajectory analysis was used to 1 discriminate the mode of motion i e run tumble and 2 extract the statistical distribution of factors controlling the motility behavior in each mode secondly simulation model development a discrete particle tracking model was developed based on the results of the analysis in the first stage and applied to the hydrodynamic field surrounding a single cylindrical collector the spatial distribution of cells on the collectors were qualitatively compared with the results of a micro model experiment lu et al 2015a 2 1 data collection a soil bacterial strain azotobacter vinelandii was used as our model bacterium the transport and fate of this bacterium has been our continuous research quest in understanding the interplay of bacterial motility transport and horizontal gene transfer massoudieh et al 2013 lu et al 2015a b liang et al 2015 a vinelandii cells were grown on modified no molybdenum burks medium strandberg and wilson 1968 plates with addition of 0 013 m ammonium acetate at 30 c for 2 days and then in liquid media of modified no molybdenum no iron burks medium strandberg and wilson 1968 with addition of 0 013 m ammonium acetate shaking at 170 rpm for 18 to 20 h lu et al 2013 the cell suspension 2 7 107 to 4 2 107 cells ml in 3 mor pholinopropane 1 sulfonic acid mops buffer solution with 100 mm kcl at ph 7 2 was continuously pumped into the micromodel at a darcy s velocity of 200 μm s the experimental conditions used in previous studies massoudieh et al 2013 lu et al 2015a b liang et al 2015 were followed to facilitate comparability across studies to investigate the effects of motility the micromodel consists of a regular array of 1440 cylindrical collectors to mimic the porous structures in the subsurface soil and the bacterial movement around one of the collectors was continuously recorded using an inverted axio observer microscope carl zeiss oberkochen germany and a camera andor technology ixon 897 belfast uk controlled by solis software andor technology each image stack of 1000 pictures were taken per 31 second duration and the stack was obtained with a 0 4 μm per pixel size resolution 2 1 1 image analysis cell locations in each frame were extracted using a particle tracker plugin initially developed by mosaic group sep 2014 release sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 for imagej abràmoff et al 2004 rasband 1997 sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 schneider et al 2012 the bacteria profile in this study are similar to colloidal spheres the estimation of the bacteria location is done by finding the local intensity maxima in the analyzed image for example the location is estimated as the brightest pixel within a distance and if its intensity is in the upper user defined percentile of intensity values of the current frame to refine the location an approximation of offset is given by the distance to the centroid of the noise reduced image brownian motion was treated as a gaussian noise and reduced with filter during image processing visual inspection indicated that the particles were well detected from the background and shadows fig 1 shows an example of original image taken by the inverted axio observer microscope and the detected cells by the particle tracker s particle detection function 2 1 2 extracting cell trajectories the linking algorithm sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 identifies points corresponding to the same physical particle in subsequent frames and links the positions c t t 1 t in order to construct trajectories this involves finding a set of associations between the point location matrices c t t 1 t based on maximization of total likelihood of all trajectories the current implementation is based on a particle matching algorithm sbalzarini and koumoutsakos 2005 using a graph theory to determine the optimal associations between two sets of points fig 2 shows a few examples of the extracted trajectories 2 2 trajectory analysis run tumble mode discrimination the motility behavior of bacteria was classified into two modes run and tumble using an unsupervised clustering approach based on predefined quantitative aggregate measures representing the motion behavior in order to perform the cluster analysis on the computed trajectories quantitative clustering features need to be selected and calculated several features were proposed and used in clustering based on their ability to discriminate between run and tumble modes these features include effective velocity i e movement velocity effective movement area moving average of incremental displacement maid deviation angle variance dav radius of fitted arc rfa the last three features maid dav and rfa were found to have a better discriminatory ability compared to the first two through comparing how they identify run vs tumble modes in a limited number of cases based on what is perceived through visual inspection fig 5 therefore these three features are briefly described in the following 2 2 1 moving average of incremental displacement maid when bacteria tumbles a significant decrease in effective swimming speed and thus a decrease in incremental displacement is expected while the incremental displacements during the run stage is expected to be monotonic increasing therefore we expect the incremental displacements to be different under run and tumble modes and the incremental displacements may provide a clustering quantity to discriminate between run and tumble modes the incremental displacement is defined as the euclidean distance between two consecutive points on the trajectory in preparing the input data for clustering a moving average method was applied to eliminate the effect of possible noise 1 d j t i w 2 1 w 2 d j t i where w is the window size for calculating the moving average d j t is the calculated incremental distance at time t and d j t 1 is the euclidean distance between two consecutive time steps 2 2 2 deviation angle variance dav another feature of the trajectories that can potentially be useful in discriminating between run and tumble modes is how erratically the movement direction changes the dav measure can be used as a surrogate to the rate of directional change over the pathways it should be noted that the noise in the images and the errors in inferred cell locations can distort the perceived local deviation angles obtained based on a single time step on the trajectory therefore an algorithm described as follows was devised to minimize the effects of these errors as is described here to determine dav at a given time step t based on a given window size w the previous w 2 steps or nodes and the following w 2 steps were used the w nodes were all connected to each other and resulted in w w 1 2 segments the angle of each segment with the horizontal line were then used to calculate the variance of the angles as 2 σ 1 n i 0 w w 1 2 α i 2 i 0 w w 1 2 α i n 2 where α i is the angle of segment i with the horizontal axis w is the window size n is the total number of angles captured in the span σ is the variance of the angle a matlabtm code was developed to analyze and extract this feature from the pathways of each cell obtained from the particle tracking module 2 2 3 radius of fitted circular arc rfa this measure is based on finding the radius of the circular arc fitted to the vertexes of each time step on a given window of the trajectory a large radius is an indicator of a straight run whereas a small radius reflects a high variability in the direction or tumble mode a least square approach with a given window size w was used to estimate the circular arc radius for any node on the trajectory the measure of the goodness of fit of the circular arc x a 2 y b 2 r 2 to the points x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n can be computed by summing the squares of the distances from the points to the circle the measure is expressed by 3 s e x o y o r i w 2 1 w 2 r x i x o 2 y i y o 2 2 where x o y o is the center of the fitted circle r is the radius of the fitted circle w is the window size and se is the sum of squared errors of prediction sse to be minimized the best fit can be obtained by setting the derivative of se with respect to x o y o and r equal to zero which can be done using newton raphson approach atkinson 2008 2 2 4 feature normalization the numeric values of these three features have different ranges therefore feature normalization was performed to standardized the range of the features in general two methods were used due to different characteristics of the extracted data dav and maid vary within a smaller range compared to rfa while rfa has values ranging within 0 therefore a linear standard score transformation described in eq 4 was applied to the dav and maid metrics meanwhile a non linear mapping described in eq 5 was applied to the results of the rfa 4 x i x i μ σ 5 x i x i 1 x i the unsupervised learning algorithm k means cluster analysis macqueen 1967 was used to evaluate the best clustering indexes and to perform the clustering analysis using the three proposed features the silhouette criterion kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 was used to evaluate the number of clusters 2 3 extracting statistics of motion behavior parameters the parameters governing the motility behavior were extracted separately for runs and tumble modes a simulation model was built to reproduce the motility behaviors qualitatively our simulation model is based on the following three conceptualizations the movement direction at each time interval is defined in eq 6 and varies by a random number according to a distributions that can be obtained from the observed data 6 θ i 1 θ i u δ θ γ m where u δθ is a random number based on the distribution of deviation angle with its parameters represented by γ m under each mode of motility m i e run tumble the overall marginal distribution of velocity is extracted from the trajectory analysis while the temporal velocity auto correlation is preserved by expressing the joint distribution of consecutive velocities using a copula function 7 v i 1 p v i 1 v i p v i 1 v i p v i where p v i 1 v i is the probability of new velocity v i 1 conditional to the velocity of previous time step v i and p v i v i 1 is the joint distribution of v i and v i 1 p v is the marginal velocity distribution in a given mode of motion in order to preserve the known marginal velocity distribution the joint distribution of v i v i 1 is assumed to follow a gaussian copula durante and sempi 2010 jaworski et al 2010 8 p v i v i 1 p v i p v i 1 c p v i p v i 1 where c is the non cumulative gaussian copula function and p v is the corresponding cumulative probability of v for the case of bi variate gaussian copula c is defined as 9 c r g a u s s u ϕ r ϕ 1 u 1 ϕ 1 u 1 where ϕ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution of standard normal distribution and ϕ r is the bi variate normal distribution with a mean of zero and variance covariance matrix of r and r is the 2 2 rank correlation matrix correlation between velocity ranks of sequential segments of trajectories the transition from a run mode to a tumble mode or from a tumble mode to a run mode is determined based on the probability distribution that can be obtained by analyzing the observed bacterial pathways given the distribution of the duration of staying in a given state represented by f t t the probability of transition in a given time step is 10 p t τ t δ t f t t δ t t 0 f t t t 0 1 f t t t 0 f t t t 0 δ t 1 f t t t 0 where the right hand side is the probability of a change of the motility mode run tumble occurring during the time interval t t δt and t 0 is the time of previous mode transition so t t 0 is the time passed from the previous transition and f t is the cumulative of f t it should be noted that if transition is assumed to be a poisson process i e p t is constant then the transition time distribution becomes exponential and vice versa the aggregate statistics needed to simulate the bacteria motility trajectories include the following a marginal velocity distribution and the rank correlation of sequential velocities b deviation angle distribution of each mode of movement and c the transition time distribution these factors were extracted from the trajectories of cells obtained from image processing 2 4 model development based on the information extracted from the trajectory analysis a mechanistic model to simulate bacterial trajectories in the absence of chemotaxis has been developed the model is based on a random walk governed by 1 hydrodynamic 2 motile movement and 3 brownian diffusion thus bacterial transition in each time step can be simulated using the following equation 11 δ x v m v h δ t d t ϵ where v m represents the motile velocity vector which is obtained from eq 7 for magnitude and eq 6 for direction v h is the hydrodynamic velocity field d is the diffusion coefficient and ϵ is non correlated standard gaussian noise specifically the velocity magnitude is simulated according to v m t δt p v v m t or explicitly v m t δ t c 1 1 p v m t u where c 1 is the integral of the function c r in eq 9 with respect to it s first argument and u is a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 1 for more information on generating correlated random numbers based on a correlation defined by a copula function see massoudieh et al 2017 the deviation angle is extracted as a random number from the parameterized deviation angle distribution depending on the mode of swimming run and tumble at each time step the probability of changing the state from run to tumble or tumble to run is calculated based on eq 10 and the mode is changed when a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 is smaller than this probability if the inertial effects are assumed negligible v h can be considered to be equal to the fluid velocity field at the location of cells v m varies both in direction and magnitude at each time step according to the information obtained from the trajectory analysis the effect of hindered diffusion near the surfaces was considered by applying a correction factor to the diffusion components parallel and perpendicular to the collector surfaces based on goldman et al 1967 12 f n min exp 0 00332 ln δ a 3 0 019251 ln δ a 2 0 18271 ln δ a 0 32747 1 13 f t min exp 0 005768 ln δ a 3 0 092235 ln δ a 2 0 52669 ln δ a 0 76952 1 where f n and f t respectively represent the diffusion correction factor in directions normal and parallel to the collector surface δ is the distance gap between the cell and the surface of the collector and a is the radius of the cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 trajectory analysis the image analysis were done using the images taken from non obstructed experiments no collectors and the trajectories representing bacterial paths were extracted different combinations of the aggregated clustering features have been tested for clustering for example utilizing a single feature a combination of two features and linear combination of features obtained from performing principal component analysis by manually inspecting five trajectories supervised learning it is shown that the k means algorithm distinguished best between run and tumble modes when utilizing maid dav and rfa together as for window sizes sizes of 5 to 25 were tested based on the sum of squared errors of prediction sse for k means method fig 3 a the results show a window size 21 provides the best clustering result in differentiating the run and tumble modes the silhouette method was used to assess the effect of the number of clusters on the variability of the discriminating aggregated statistics within each cluster the silhouette value ranges from 1 to 1 a high silhouette value indicates low variability within the cluster and high variability between clusters if most points have a high silhouette value then the clustering solution is appropriate the number of clusters from 2 to 6 were evaluated and results are shown in fig 3b the number of clusters was determined as 2 which matches the previous experimental observations berg and turner 1990 describing bacterial motion as run and tumble the clustering results using k means method with 3 proposed features are shown in table 1 and fig 4 there were 523 total trajectories detected in the azotobacter vinelandii strain out of the 1000 images in total there were 84410 segments detected for clustering analysis 42 of the segments were clustered as run and 58 were clustered as tumble as it is expected the segments classified as run have higher maid rfa mean and smaller dav mean than the tumble group in fig 4 it can be seen that for the segments identified as being in tumble mode the rfa can vary between 0 and 1 but the segments identified as run typically have larger rfa values this is due to the fact that under tumbling mode the trajectories do not necessarily follow circular arc trajectories sample trajectories with segments color coded based on each clustering feature and clustering results are shown in fig 5 the color coded trajectories can be used as a measure to inspect the clustering results visually 3 2 marginal velocity distribution in each mode run and tumble with the fitted distribution to determine which distribution can best describe the parameters we have estimated a matlab function fitalldist m developed by m sheppard 2012 was used this function fits all valid parametric probability distribution of the data and return the parameter values of all the mathematical distributions fitted ordered by the bayesian information criterion bic bhat and kumar 2010 of the fit several continuous distributions were tested including beta distribution exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value inverse gaussian logistic log logistic lognormal and normal the bic values for the distributions with lower bics are shown in table 2 it can be observed in fig 6 that as it is expected the run mode has a higher mean velocity with parameters α 4 6387 and β 0 2269 i e mean 20 44 μm s for gamma distribution compared to the tumble mode with α 0 6711 and β 0 2889 i e mean 2 32 μm s the velocity and velocity rank auto correlation for each mode are shown in fig 7 overall the auto correlation values are significant in both modes however as expected the tumble mode tends to have a weaker correlation than run mode fig 8 shows the transition time distribution for tumble and run modes tumble mode presents a higher frequency of transitions i e lower mean transition time than the run mode which matched the previous studies turner et al 2000 however the difference is not noteworthy the mean transition time for tumble mode is 0 65 s while the average transition time for run mode is 0 69 s fig 9 shows the distribution of transformed turn angles fitted by the logistic distribution for both run and tumble modes as expected the standard deviation of the deviation angle distribution is significantly larger under tumble mode compared to run mode fig 10 shows modeled vs measured mean bacterial displacement σ 2 r r 0 2 n as a function of time the modeled results are based on simulating 1000 cells all starting at a single position and the measured values are based on all detected trajectories all translated to a single position and assumed to start at time t 0 the value of n is the number of trajectories available at the time of calculations i e with total time length greater than the value in the time axis we suspect the discrepancy at smaller distances are due to the cells that are effectively stuck and at larger times to be due to cells leaving the window biasing the results 3 3 micro model demonstration case the motility model was applied to the images capturing the deposition of bacteria in a micro model experiment lu et al 2015a the rapid movement of cells due to high advective flow in these experiments did not allow for extracting the trajectories accurately but the spatial location of deposition on collectors can be extracted these spatial distributions were used to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the model to reproduce the deposition spatial distribution the purpose of this demonstration was not to quantitatively reproduce the spatial distribution of deposition on the solid phase but to examine whether the motility model can qualitatively explain the deposition distribution and to examine the effect of hydrodynamic passive versus motile active bacterial movement in the experiments silicon micro models were fabricated through a standard photolithography procedure as described by liu et al 2012 within each micromodel a total of 1440 cylindrical collectors 180 μm diameter 114 μm in pore body size 28 μm in pore throat size were etched to 22 μm depth in a si wafer resulting in a porosity of 0 4 similar to that of the packed bed columns for all micro model experiments electrolyte solutions containing bacterial cells were injected into the device continuously with an approach velocity of 200 μm images were collected using a leica microscope connected to a charge coupled device ccd camera qimaging retiga 2000r fast 1394 and image pro 7 0 plus software fig 11 lu et al 2015a shows the configuration of the micro model setup and the deposition distribution of a vinelandii over three of the collectors in three longitudinal locations due to the fact that the distance range of dlvo hermansson 1999 forces are orders of magnitude smaller than the size of bacteria dlvo forces were not directly included in the model and the deposition of bacteria on the surfaces were modeled by assigning a probability of sticking when a bacterium encounters the surfaces bacterial cells were assumed to be spherical with a diameter of 1 μm comsol finite element method was used to obtain the laminar hydrodynamic flow field around a cylindrical collector fig 12 shows the finite element mesh and the resulting velocity field around a single cylindrical collector the approaching velocity was considered to be 200 μm s which is consistent with the experimental conditions the flow direction is from left to right the brownian diffusion coefficient was calculated to be 0 145 μm2 s based on the stokes einstein equation and the size of bacterial cells 10000 cells were released at the same time uniformly along the vertical direction at the left inlet of the simulation model and the simulation was performed over a duration of 10 s so all the non attached cells can exit the left boundary of the model the motility parameters were specified based on the values obtained in the trajectory analysis as explained in the previous section two different sticking probabilities of 0 05 and 5 10 3 were considered it should be noted that the sticking probability represent the probability that an encounter to the surface results in a permanent attachment so if a cell does not attach in the first encounter there is a chance that it may stick in the second encounter also to evaluate the role of hydrodynamic velocity a simulation was performed using a 10 times slower approaching velocity a set of selected simulated trajectories are shown in fig 13 as it can be seen under 200 μm s approaching velocity the trajectories by and large conform to the hydrodynamic streamlines this is expected due to the fact the flow velocity is around 10 times larger than the mean motile velocity the spots representing the attachment locations are shown in fig 14 the four different parameters sets used to generate the results in the four panels of figs 13 and 14 are respectively a the actual motility parameters derived from the image processing with a 0 5 sticking probability b the actual motile parameters with a higher sticking probability of 5 c similar to case a but a 10 times increase in motility i e motility of approximately 200 μm s with a 0 5 attachment rate d no motility effect with 0 5 sticking probability as compared to the experimental results fig 11 the simulated results in case a and b qualitatively match the spatial distribution of attachment in the inlet middle and outlet locations in the sense that it results in concentration of attachment sites at the front side of the collectors and less attachment occurs on the back side of the collectors the case with no motility case d results in a high concentration of attachment sites in the front side with almost no attachments on the sides and the backsides this may be due to the large size of the cells which lead to a small value of brownian diffusion coefficient it should be noted that additional hydrodynamic dispersion may affect real non motile cells due to interaction between the flow and the irregular shape of the cells which was neglected in this study the spatial distribution of the attachment sites are almost similar under the assumption of 0 5 and 5 sticking probability with the exception that a lower sticking probability results in a lower overall attachment rate and a larger relative concentration on the back side of the collector as expected also as expected a smaller hydrodynamic velocity fig 14c results in a much more uniform distribution of attachment sites around the collector which is indicative of the dominance of the motile movement with random directions fig 15 shows the distribution of angular location of attached bacteria on the collector surface by and large the results are consistent although some major discrepancies cannot be overlooked the model predicts attachments mostly occur at the front of the collectors with some occurring on the sides but towards the back of the collector while the observed data show most of the attachments occurring in the front with some major attachments uniformly distributed at the sides of the collector the simulation results are consistent with previous modeling results nelson et al 2007 which shows based on the hypothesized run and tumble parameters that with hydrodynamic velocity dominating the transport bacteria accumulates mostly at the front end of the collectors the simulation results from case a b qualitatively reproduce the experimental observation on motile strain and case d is qualitatively consistent with non motile strain deposition in lu et al 2015a it should be noted that in reality bacteria swim in three dimensions which can affect the effective projected velocities onto the two dimensional plane however since the parameters of the motility model were also determined based on a two dimensional system the effective projected velocities on the two dimensional plane is thought to be applied in the model also it should be pointed out that the motile behavior particularly at the proximity of the surfaces may be affected by the sheer flow though no definitive quantitative understanding of this phenomena is currently available 4 conclusions traditionally in bacterial motility study researchers focused more on single or few microbes and compared modeling results with experimental results other macro scale studies focus on group behaviors without perceiving the behavior of individual bacterium the advancement in image acquisition using digital microscopic imaging techniques has resulted in extraordinary growth in data volume and complexity in bacterial motility research field group behavior tracking and modeling would hardly be possible without an automated method in the first part of this study an automatic pipeline was presented for large scale bacterial motility behavior analysis image processing and pattern recognition techniques were employed to detect the trajectories maid rfa and dav features were used to cluster the trajectory segments into run and tumble modes as further input for the trajectory simulation mode statistical parameters have been extracted for marginal velocity velocity correlation deviation angle and the transition between run and tumble modes for both run and tumble modes gamma distribution fits the marginal velocity best and logistic distribution fits the deviation angle best for the runtime distribution log logistic distribution and log normal distribution were found to be superior than the traditionally agreed exponential distribution respectively for run and tumble modes in the second half of this study a meso scale motility model has been implemented with copula the model has been applied in micro model settings demonstration case and verified qualitatively to reproduce the micro scale model behavior the proposed framework can save laborious work in manually observing the trajectories and make statistical feature extraction of bacteria motility more accurate this framework can also provide a systematic approach to process bacteria images and to extract knowledge and insights of bacteria motility that leads to a better understanding of bacteria behavior once the mystery of bacteria migration is solved the beneficial aspects of bacteria could be further studied and applied in engineering medicine and other fields it could be rapidly replicated in similar studies with different bacteria strains parameters of model inputs might vary in other studies but the work flow would be similar further studies could also be done to address the limitations in this study for example in real world the bacteria swim in a 3d region while in the model discussed previously although the motility has a 3d capability due to the 2d images and limitations to the image processing techniques the motility model was applied in 2d additionally further studies can be done in understanding the transition spectrum between run and tumble modes the different variations of trajectory

1672,the objective of this study was to explore the controlling factors on the migration and transformation of nitrogenous wastes in groundwater using long term observations from a contaminated site on the southwestern edge of the tengger desert in northwestern china contamination was caused by wastewater discharge rich in ammonia two long term groundwater monitoring wells wells 1 and 2 were constructed and 24 water samples were collected five key indicators were tested ammonia nitrate nitrite dissolved oxygen and manganese a numerical method was used to simulate the migration process and to determine the migration stage of the main pollutant plume in groundwater the results showed that at well 1 the nitrogenous waste migration process had essentially been completed while at well 2 ammonia levels were still rising and gradually transitioning to a stable stage the differences for well 1 and well 2 were primarily caused by differences in groundwater flow the change in ammonia concentration was mainly controlled by the migration of the pollution plume under nitrification in groundwater the nitrification rate was likely affected by changes in dissolved oxygen and potentially manganese keywords in situ observation migration transformation nitrogen groundwater contaminated site 1 introduction with the intensive development of human activities such as the use of nitrogen fertilizers the use of sewage for irrigation and the discharging of industrial and domestic wastewater nitrogenous pollutants nh4 n no2 n and no3 n enter aquifers by leaching or direct discharge and cause serious nitrogen pollution in groundwater and environmental and health problems globally brückmann et al 2011 tran et al 2014 research on the migration and transformation of nitrogen contamination in groundwater can be either at the laboratory or field scales laboratory scale studies usually concentrate on the migration mechanism and remediation of nitrogen pollution in groundwater column experiment and batch tests are tools commonly used in the laboratory for research on nitrogenous wastes the basic processes of nitrogen transformation can be divided into two parts nitrification nh3 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 the nitrification process comprises a two step oxidation of nh3 via no2 to no3 involving the metabolic labor of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrification is typically thought to be an obligatory aerobic and chemoautotrophic process kowalchuk and stephen 2001 in contrast denitrification is primarily heterotrophic and facultative and occurs under low oxygen conditions francis et al 2007 zumft 1997 zhao et al 2016 used batch experiments and column experiments to indicate nh4 n adsorb and transfer process in a loose pore geothermal reservoir matrix under low temperature conditions the results showed that the adsorption capacity of nh4 n decreased with the increasing of temperature and nitrification rate increased with temperature vary from 20 c to 60 c mekala and nambi 2017 established two agricultural soil columns to study nitrogen transport and transformation under different saturation and a hydrus 2d model with constructed wetland cw2d module was used to simulate the process of aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification their results indicated that for a sandy soil occurrence of denitrification requires higher water saturations than nitrification furthermore at all saturation studies denitrification is dominant and nitrification is least for loamy sand soil texture in recent years many studies on nitrogen transformation have been conducted at the molecular or gene level several functional genes such as amoa nxra napa narg qnorb nosz and nirs have been detected chon et al 2011 dong and reddy 2012 gómez villalba et al 2006 galloway james et al 2008 juhler et al 2009 yan et al 2008 these laboratory scale studies mostly focus on the micro process and migration mechanism of nitrogen pollution however it is difficult to explain the large scale migration of nitrogenous pollutants at the laboratory scale the studies are economic and flexible but cannot fully reflect how contaminants are transported and transformed in the natural environment which means that the parameters obtained may be different from real values in the real conditions at site smith et al 2006 field studies avoid the disadvantage of being limited by the scale effect studies on large regions are mainly concerned with statistical patterns field scale studies using approaches such as distribution analysis or risk assessment of groundwater nitrogen pollution over a large area and nitrogen transport or transformation have been done in many places such as the united states nolan and hitt 2006 spain chica olmo et al 2014 australia thorburn et al 2003 africa douagui et al 2012 kringel et al 2016 and china gu et al 2013 huang et al 2011 ju et al 2006 regarding the study of nitrogen transport in the field what has been learnt comes mainly from investigations of nitrogen concentration changes in groundwater and their relationship to changes in water quality soldatova et al 2017 investigated the sources of different species of nitrogen in shallow groundwater as well as the control of its behavior in riparian zones of the poyang lake basin based on field observations and associated data analysis the results suggested that nitrification largely affects the balance of nitrogen and manure and domestic sewage are two major sources of nitrogen moreover fertilization significant increased the ph of groundwater judging from the results of simulation isotope monitoring is often used to investigate these processes jahangir et al 2013 extended the use of the in situ push pull method which had previously been used for shallow groundwater addy et al 2002 with 15n labelled nitrate to measure the denitrification rate 1 3 469 5 μgnkg 1 day 1 in groundwater ecosystems and found that it was negatively correlated with ambient dissolved oxygen redox potential and no3 and positively correlated with so4 2 smith et al 2004 measured denitrification by natural gradient tracer tests 15n enriched nitrate tracer the down gradient transport and the distribution of 15n within the various constituents of the denitrification pathway nitrate nitrite nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas was measured and the individual denitrification steps were quantified some studies have focused on the transport and reaction of n in the aquifer is to promote the migration of nitrogen in the groundwater environment böhlke et al 2006 used a combination of chemical and isotopic measurements including in situ isotope tracers and the results showed the clear retardation of nh4 transport in groundwater much of the nh4 in the plume was recharged early in the history of the wastewater disposal the no3 and excess n2 which were related to each other by denitrification were largely unrelated to coexisting nh4 and were moving more rapidly nitrification occurred along the upper boundary of the plume and there were essentially no nh4 consuming reactions in the anoxic core of the plume nitrogen migration and transformation in our study was analyzed by in situ time series monitoring data obtained from the field without any artificially added tracer that may cause additional load to the aquifer our study uses a site contaminated with high ammonia concentrations as the result of wastewater discharge the site is located at the southwestern edge of the tengger desert in western china the objective of our study was to reveal the migration and transformation characteristics of three nitrogenous wastes nh4 no2 and no3 in groundwater by using monitoring data 2 material and methods 2 1 contaminated site the study area is located in the north of the qilian mountains in northwestern china on the southwestern edge of the tengger desert the fourth largest desert in china with an area of about 30 000 km2 geographically located at east longitude 102 54 29 35 and north latitude 38 03 48 11 is a part of the silk road which is geopolitically significant due to major water shortages in the region li et al 2015 howard and howard 2016 the area is situated in the southwest side of alxa left banner of the inner mongolia autonomous region at the central border of gansu province the area has definite continental climate characteristics with a mean annual average temperature of 7 9 c an annual rainfall of 116 148 mm concentrated in july and august and an annual evaporation of 3000 3600 mm the area is located in a cenozoic subsidence zone hundreds of meters in thickness comprised of semi cemented and semi consolidated alluvium and moraine which facilitates the migration and storage of groundwater the regional groundwater structure is divided into unconfined semi unconfined and confined aquifers the underlying aquifer is made up of wind blown sands sandy gravel and sandy loam belonging to the middle and upper pleistocene and the thickness is usually 30 50 m with a maximum thickness of 100 m the aquifer media at the contaminated site is mainly light yellow fine and medium fine sand with a thick sandy gravel layer below because of a lack of wastewater discharge management in the study area the waste water a total of 45 608 m3 was directly discharged into the tengger desert in the period from may 28 2014 to march 6 2015 causing soil and groundwater pollution in the area after pollution was discovered in march 2015 visible pollutant was removed from the surface by means of mechanical digging without any treatment or anti pollution measures the contaminated site is shown in fig 1 and has an area of about 0 11 km2 its elevation decreases from west to east and is about 7 m lower on the eastern side compared with the area at the west of the site the terrain on the eastern side is relatively flat the unconfined aquifer at the contaminated site is mainly composed of pore water in unconsolidated rock the thick unconsolidated quaternary sediment in the region provides good storage and rapid transport for groundwater the middle and upper pleistocene strata are the most water rich aquifers and form a single large unit or a multilayered semi unconfined water system the thickness of the aquifers ranges from 50 to 100 m the depth of groundwater is 5 10 m below surface and the specific yield is 3 30 l s m there is an unstable aquifuge between the lower and the upper pleistocene strata and thus the aquifers have a close hydraulic connection the groundwater flow is from the southwest to the northeast with a hydraulic gradient of 3 6 the groundwater is mainly recharged by infiltration of surface water and agricultural irrigation and lateral runoff from bedrock fissures in the mountainous areas the major pathways for groundwater discharge are artificial exploitation evaporation transpiration and lateral flow the hydrochemical types of groundwater are so4 2 hco3 mg2 ca2 which is sulfate bicarbonate freshwater or brackish water with a mineralization of 300 500 mg l 2 2 sample collection and analysis to better understand the current status of pollution continuous monitoring of groundwater quality indexes was started from june to december in 2015 a total of two pollution monitoring wells well 1 and well 2 were built in the polluted area the details were as seen from table 1 based on the direction of groundwater flow two monitoring wells were sited in the lower reaches of the pollution plume well 1 was closest to the pollution plume and well 2 was the farthest from the pollution plume groundwater samples were collected twice a month on the 1st and 15th the chemical components being analyzed included ammonia nitrate nitrite dissolved oxygen do and manganese nitrogen and manganese pollution was evident from initial tests and they are key components of denitrification so ammonia nitrate nitrite and dissolved oxygen were measured regularly manganese was used as a control to monitor the pollution plume because it is generally unreactive in groundwater to ensure the integrity of these groundwater samples they were strictly collected in accordance with the requirements of the technical specifications for environmental monitoring of groundwater china mep 2004 each sample was taken at least 10 min after pumping commenced to ensure the stability of water quality which was indicated by parameters measured in the field including color ph conductivity redox potential turbidity and water temperature the preservation and transportation of samples was done strictly in accordance with the water quality technical regulation of the preservation and handling of samples mep 2009 delivery was arranged before the start of field work and samples were expedited to the laboratory immediately after sampling to minimize storage time to ensure the representativeness accuracy and comparability of the monitoring data quality assurance and quality control measures were applied all monitoring personnel were trained before they got their monitoring certifications all instruments and gauges were certified by the metrological department or calibrated by analysts all the monitoring and analysis methods used were taken from the national standard or recommended methods the details were as seen from table 2 the results of the recovery of standard additions to all the monitoring items were qualified and standard samples were analyzed as well parallel double field samples nitrate nitrite and manganese production rates were calculated as the slope of nitrate nitrite and manganese concentrations against time respectively and expressed as mgno3 n l d mgno2 n l d and mgmn l d respectively a positive slope represents production rates and a negative slope represents consumption rates mangimbulude et al 2012 the correlation coefficient was calculated using minitab 16 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical model the numerical simulation of groundwater is a useful tool for predicting and calculating the migration characteristics of contaminants in groundwater in a set time in this study numerical modeling was used to simulate the transport of ammonia in groundwater and to determine the stage of migration hydrus 1d and visual modflow 2010 1 were coupled to simulate the transport of ammonia in groundwater hydrus 1d was used to simulate the vertical movement of pollutants in the unsaturated zone and the output of hydrus 1d was used as the input to visual modflow which was used to simulate the horizontal migration of pollutants in the saturated aquifer 3 1 1 conceptual model according to the drilling data the thickness of the unsaturated zone is 13 1 m based on the stratigraphy the unsaturated zone can be divided into two layers the first layer is composed of silty sand with a thickness of 5 0 m and the second layer is composed of fine sand with a thickness of 8 1 m each layer was homogeneous the medium fine sand with a thickness of 50 70 m constitutes the unconfined aquifer at the site area this aquifer has a small hydraulic gradient and thus the horizontal flow is pronounced and the vertical flow is slight the groundwater flow field is in a natural state and stable with fairly small annual and interannual variations the flow direction is consistent with topography the hydrogeological parameters show minimal spatial variation and thus the system is essentially homogeneous as a result the conceptual hydrological model of the groundwater system at the contaminated site could be described by a single layer homogeneous two dimensional steady flow system the simulation area was selected from a large area the west by south and east by north boundaries are parallel to the flow direction and so there is no flux through them these boundaries are defined as streamline boundaries zero flux in the south by east boundary the model is recharged by lateral infiltration in the north by west boundary it is discharged by lateral flow the upper boundary was the phreatic water table and it received recharge from the infiltration of surface water because of the large buried depth of the aquifer system phreatic evaporation can be ignored the flux can be estimated by parameters gained from pumping tests in the field the south by east and north by west boundaries were defined as flux boundaries 3 1 2 mathematic model from the above conditions one dimensional vertical movement in the unsaturated zone can be expressed as xue and wu 2010 1 θ t z d θ θ z k θ z the initial condition is 2 θ z 0 θ 0 z z 0 the surface boundary condition can be expressed as 3 h 0 t h a t t 0 z 0 and the bottom boundary is the water table 4 h l t 0 z l t 0 where θ is the water content d θ is the diffusion coefficient m2 d k θ is the hydraulic conductivity m d and h a t is the depth of surface water the two dimensional steady flow of groundwater can be expressed by the flowing partial differential function 5 x k h x y k h y ε 0 where k is hydraulic conductivity m d h is water head m and ε is a source and sink item 1 d the initial condition is 6 h x y 0 h 0 x y x y ω the boundary condition can be written as 7 t h n q 1 x y t x y ω where t is the transmissivity m2 day the flow region is represented by ω the boundary is denoted by ω n denotes the normal derivative to the boundary h 0 x y is the initial head in the flow domain m and q 1 x y t is the known flow rate m3 day m the governing equation for contaminant transport of a single chemical constituent in groundwater is given by 8 r c t x d xx c x y d yy c y x v x c y v y c i where v x and v y are the seepage velocity m d in the x and y directions respectively d xx and d yy are the components of the dispersion coefficient m2 day tensor in the x and y directions respectively c is the concentration of the dissolved species kg m3 i is source and sink items and r is the retardation factor the initial condition is of the form 9 c x y 0 f 0 x y x y ω the boundary condition is 10 c x y t x y 0 t 0 where f 0 x y is a given function 3 1 3 model calibration and verification the model was validated using the measured water level data from four observation wells in the simulation area the modeled water head must accord with the observed head the model parameters were adjusted iteratively based on the hydrogeological conditions and the field tests table 3 the simulation results show that groundwater flows from south to north fig 2 which corresponds to actual conditions the calculated and observed heads fit well all in the 95 confidence interval fig 3 which means that the model can realistically reflect the groundwater system in the study area 3 1 4 simulation results the ammonia transport simulation results can be seen in fig 4 here only transportation has been considered the deviation of the model from measured data in fig 4 was presumably caused by biological transformation of nitrogen which has been discussed in detail in the discussion analysis of ammonia concentration change section according to the observed results well 1 has essentially completed the whole migration process of nitrogenous waste however well 2 pollutant concentrations were at the increasing stage gradually transitioning to the decreasing stage 3 2 observation results according to the observed results well 1 has essentially completed the whole migration process of nitrogenous waste however well 2 pollutant concentrations were at the increasing stage gradually transitioning to the decreasing stage the test results for the groundwater samples are shown in table 4 in well 1 from june 15th to september 1st in 2015 the ammonia concentration fig 5 increased with some small fluctuations and after september 1st started to decrease values of do remained at a low level and were stable from june 15th to october 1st but rose sharply after that nitrate concentrations showed an upward trend although the increases occurred in an irregular step wise manner nitrite concentrations increased in the period from june 15th to july 1st and gradually declined after that manganese levels were stable from june 15th to august 15th and subsequently showed a slow decreasing trend in well 2 ammonia levels fig 5 rose continuously from june 15th while do displayed relatively low values between june 15th and september 1st and then increased significantly from september 1st to october 15th but dropped after october 15th the concentration of nitrate was lower than the detection limit from june 15th to august 1st and started to increase after that including a sharp rise between november 15th and december 1st nitrite concentrations fluctuated at beginning but in general increased from june 15th to september 1st and then decreased gradually after that manganese concentrations showed a decreasing trend throughout the monitoring period but with some fluctuations 3 3 migration and transformation characteristics of nitrogen from well 1 monitoring well 1 was located on the flank of the main groundwater flow and consequently was not on the main direction of the pollution plume it is therefore not surprising that the monitoring data of contaminant concentrations in this well stabilized at a relatively low level compared with well 2 the peak in ammonia concentration in the migration process for this well reached only 0 788 mg l which was about 15 times lower than that in well 2 the location of well 1 was closer to the contaminant site than well 2 and thus at the end of the monitoring period december 1st 2015 ammonia in well 1 had largely completed the migration process 3 3 1 stage division in the migration process dissolved nitrogen in groundwater is mainly found in the form of three nitrogenous wastes no3 n no2 n and nh4 n their mutual transformation occurs because of nitrification and denitrification under microbial catalysis rivett et al 2008 as shown in fig 6 the migration process that took place can be divided into three stages during stage i from june 15th to august 15th the nitrate concentration stayed at a low level while ammonia levels rose from 0 319 to 0 607 mg l the nitrate concentration was consistently lower than the minimum detection limit 0 08 mg l between june 15th and july 15th and after july 15th a small amount of nitrate could be detected nitrification began gradually at a low rate the nitrate production rate was 4 355 10 3 mgno3 n l d and in a 31 day period from july 15th to august 15th the concentration of nitrate increased marginally by 0 135 mg l during stage ii from august 15th to october 15th the nitrate concentration increased significantly and ammonia reached a peak value 0 788 mg l and remained at that value and nitrification rate increased we speculated that the increased nitrification rate could be due to a change in the geochemical environment or to an increased microbial population the average nitrate production rate was 1 451 10 2 mgno3 n l d and the highest rate was 4 618 10 2 mgno3 n l d from august 15th to september 1st the concentration of nitrate increased sharply from 0 135 to 0 92 mg l and remained at that level from september 1st to october 15th with a slight increase reaching 1 02 mg l on october 15th which was almost eight times higher than its initial value during stage iii after october 15th the concentration of nitrate increased significantly reaching 1 84 mg l an increase of 0 82 mg l the nitrate production rate was 4 824 10 2 mgno3 n l d at the same time the ammonia concentration was falling reducing to 0 311 mg l by december 1st 3 3 2 impact of do the changes in stage iii were considered to have been affected by environmental factors such as do and manganese levels soil pollution treatment took place in september and october 2015 and as a result the do content rose considerably after october 3rd increasing by 2 6 mg l fig 7 and nitrate levels entered stage iii the increase in do enhanced the oxidation environment and may have caused the increase in nitrate concentrations through the microbial community 3 3 3 impact of manganese in addition the manganese in the groundwater environment could also have affected nitrification the manganese content was relatively high in the first stage and remained stable while the nitrate was at a lower level studies have shown that the presence of manganese is not beneficial to the growth and reproduction of nitrifying bacteria and that these bacteria are sensitive to changes in manganese content brown and minges 1916 premi and cornfield 1969 xin et al 2016 in stage ii there was a marked decreasing trend for manganese and this corresponded to the first jump in nitrate concentration the manganese concentration decreased from 0 883 to 0 703 mg l and the consumption rate was 2 954 10 3 mgmn l d after october 15th the manganese content decreased faster with a 9 219 10 3 mgmn l d consumption rate during the 16 day period from october 15th to november 1st the concentration decreased by 0 143 mg l which was essentially equal to the amount of change in the entire second stage a 61 day period fig 8 at the same time as these changes there was a second jump in the concentration of nitrate overall the increasing nitrate concentration was likely the result of the nitrifying bacteria the increase in do and the decrease in manganese affected the nitrification rates through their effects on microbial metabolism 3 3 4 transformation characteristics of ammonia nitrite and nitrate the change in ammonia concentration was mainly controlled by the migration of the pollution plume and was also affected by nitrification in stage ii nitrification consumed the ammonia which slowed the increasing trend of ammonia concentration controlled by the pollution plume migration the ammonia levels reached peak values remained constant and then transitioned smoothly into stage iii where enhanced nitrification resulted in the increased consumption of ammonia and was the matrix of nitrification fig 9 nitrite is the intermediate product of nitrification and is not usually stable but during the monitoring period of this study an accumulation of nitrite was witnessed from june 15th to july 1st the concentration of nitrite increased from 0 026 to 0 185 mg l the correlation coefficient between do and nitrite was 0 823 this negative correlation can also be seen in fig 6 nitrification is the process of oxidizing ammonia into nitrate with the help of autotrophic microorganisms there are two steps involved böhlke et al 2006 dodsworth et al 2011 11 nh 4 1 5 o 2 aob no 2 h 2 o h energy 12 no 2 0 5 o 2 nob no 3 energy in the process of nitrification aob and nob compete for do the affinity of aob to dissolved oxygen is greater than for nob wiesmann 1994 resulting in higher growth rates for aob especially at low do levels wett et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 thus nitrosification nh4 no2 may have occurred first in well 1 and nitrite accumulated corresponding to a drop in do no nitrate production took place during this period presumably nob then became active and consumed the nitrite converting it to nitrate according to the theory of nitrification kinetics the energy generated in the process of converting ammonia to nitrite is more than four times that for the conversion of nitrite to nitrate hagopian and riley 1998 therefore to generate the same amount of energy the amount of oxidized nitrite must be four times that of oxidized ammonia the rate that nob oxidized nitrite in unit time was higher than the rate that anitriteob oxidized ammonia this maybe the reason that nitrite did not readily accumulate in the nitrification process the nitrate was gradually produced after july 15th corresponding to the gradual decrease in nitrite concentration in stage ii nitrification increased which would lead to an increase in the oxidation rate difference between the two kinds of bacteria after august 15th the nitrite concentration dropped continuously the nitrite consumption rate was 3 333 10 4 mgno2 n l d in stage i and 2 016 10 3 mgno2 n l d in stage ii the decreasing rate in stage ii was much larger than that in stage i the do levels rose sharply in the period from october 3rd to october 15th corresponding to a rapid fall in nitrite concentrations with a 5 167 10 3 mgno2 n l d consumption rate reflecting the promoting effect of do on nitrification in stage iii with sufficient do the nitrite concentrations remained at a low but stable level while ammonia was converted into nitrate with less nitrite accumulation 3 4 migration and transformation characteristics of nitrogen from well 2 well 2 was located in the direction of the main groundwater flowline and was therefore on the main pollution plume migration path thus the monitoring results for the concentrations of contaminants in this well were higher than those in well 1 the location of well 2 was farther from the contaminant site than well 1 and thus during the monitoring period from june 15th to december 1st the ammonia in well 2 had not completed the migration process the ammonia concentrations increased continuously and approached their peak value which indicated that it was gradually transitioning from stage i to stage ii fig 10 3 4 1 stage division in the migration process at stage i from june 15th to november 15th the nitrate increased from zero and the ammonia concentrations increased the concentration of ammonia rose from 2 77 to 12 mg l the nitrate concentration was consistently below the minimum detection limit between june 15th and august 1st and only after august 1st could nitrate be detected during the period from august 1st to november 15th the concentration of nitrate increased by 5 12 mg l and the nitrate production rate was 4 830 10 2 mgno3 n l d because of the high content of ammonia which was the matrix of nitrification in well 2 nitrification was stronger and more nitrate was generated than in well 1 in stage ii after november 15th the nitrate concentration showed a significant upward trend increasing from 5 12 to 8 01 mg l an increase of 2 89 mg l fig 10 the concentration of ammonia remained essentially stable manganese in groundwater before november 1st had a slight downward trend fig 8 with a 2 446 10 3 mgmn l d consumption rate however after november 15th the consumption rate increased to 4 271 10 2 mgmn l d which caused a significant decrease in manganese this was consistent with the characteristics of the second stage in monitoring well 1 after well 2 entered stage ii the content of manganese decreased which contributed positively to nitrification and the rise in nitrate concentration fig 11 3 4 2 impact of do the concentration of do in well decreased from 1 38 mg l on july 15th to 0 42 mg l on august 1st fig 9 a decrease of 0 96 mg l and was accompanied with an accumulation of nitrite nitrate began to be generated after that date the change in trends was consistent with the characteristics of well 1 in stage i well 2 was farther from the pollution site than well 1 and thus there was a time lag in the variation in the concentration of components in well 2 compared with well 1 since september 1st the concentration of do increased and the nitrite decreased significantly when 1 g of ammonia is nitrified into nitrate 4 57 g of oxygen is consumed while during the conversion of nh4 n to no2 n the oxygen needed is 3 43 g and the conversion of no2 n to no3 n needs 1 12 g of oxygen losordo and westers 1994 the ammonia concentration in well 2 was relatively high fig 7 the initial concentration was 2 77 mg l and the concentration then rose continuously and peaked at 12 5 mg l under certain conditions of do content more do would be consumed in the process whereby aob oxidized high strength ammonia this would decrease the amount of oxygen available for the second step reaction no2 no3 and therefore make conversion to nitrate difficult therefore the increase in do content was likely beneficial to nitrification and also accelerated the consumption of nitrite however there is a large time delay between the observed do increase and the later concurrent increase in nitrate and decrease in nitrite in monitoring well 2 which does not have an obvious explanation fig 12 4 conclusions unmanaged discharge of wastewater rich in ammonia has created a seriously contaminated site on the edge of the tengger desert in northwestern china two continuous groundwater monitoring wells well 1 and well 2 were established to carry out in situ monitoring in the contaminated site well 1 was located on the flank of the main groundwater flowline and has essentially completed the pollution plume migration process nitrification played an important role in this process the transport and transformation of nitrogenous wastes were divided into three stages in stage i no3 was at a low level and nh4 was rising in stage ii no3 rose sharply for the first time while nh4 reached a peak value and remained constant and in stage iii no3 concentration rose significantly again and nh4 fell well 2 was located on the direction of the main groundwater flowline nitrogenous wastes at well 2 were gradually transitioning from stage i to stage ii at the end of the monitoring period the ammonia concentration increased continuously and approached its peak value the nitrate concentration increased sharply as well there was a time lag in the variation in the concentration of components in well 2 compared with well 1 because of increased distance to the contaminated site the increasing do concentration could facilitate nitrification and the existence of manganese can inhibit the nitrifying bacteria therefore a decrease in manganese concentration could be beneficial to nitrification acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 41402211 and no 41672228 the major science and technology program for water pollution control and treatment of china 2014zx07201 010 
1672,the objective of this study was to explore the controlling factors on the migration and transformation of nitrogenous wastes in groundwater using long term observations from a contaminated site on the southwestern edge of the tengger desert in northwestern china contamination was caused by wastewater discharge rich in ammonia two long term groundwater monitoring wells wells 1 and 2 were constructed and 24 water samples were collected five key indicators were tested ammonia nitrate nitrite dissolved oxygen and manganese a numerical method was used to simulate the migration process and to determine the migration stage of the main pollutant plume in groundwater the results showed that at well 1 the nitrogenous waste migration process had essentially been completed while at well 2 ammonia levels were still rising and gradually transitioning to a stable stage the differences for well 1 and well 2 were primarily caused by differences in groundwater flow the change in ammonia concentration was mainly controlled by the migration of the pollution plume under nitrification in groundwater the nitrification rate was likely affected by changes in dissolved oxygen and potentially manganese keywords in situ observation migration transformation nitrogen groundwater contaminated site 1 introduction with the intensive development of human activities such as the use of nitrogen fertilizers the use of sewage for irrigation and the discharging of industrial and domestic wastewater nitrogenous pollutants nh4 n no2 n and no3 n enter aquifers by leaching or direct discharge and cause serious nitrogen pollution in groundwater and environmental and health problems globally brückmann et al 2011 tran et al 2014 research on the migration and transformation of nitrogen contamination in groundwater can be either at the laboratory or field scales laboratory scale studies usually concentrate on the migration mechanism and remediation of nitrogen pollution in groundwater column experiment and batch tests are tools commonly used in the laboratory for research on nitrogenous wastes the basic processes of nitrogen transformation can be divided into two parts nitrification nh3 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 the nitrification process comprises a two step oxidation of nh3 via no2 to no3 involving the metabolic labor of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrification is typically thought to be an obligatory aerobic and chemoautotrophic process kowalchuk and stephen 2001 in contrast denitrification is primarily heterotrophic and facultative and occurs under low oxygen conditions francis et al 2007 zumft 1997 zhao et al 2016 used batch experiments and column experiments to indicate nh4 n adsorb and transfer process in a loose pore geothermal reservoir matrix under low temperature conditions the results showed that the adsorption capacity of nh4 n decreased with the increasing of temperature and nitrification rate increased with temperature vary from 20 c to 60 c mekala and nambi 2017 established two agricultural soil columns to study nitrogen transport and transformation under different saturation and a hydrus 2d model with constructed wetland cw2d module was used to simulate the process of aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification their results indicated that for a sandy soil occurrence of denitrification requires higher water saturations than nitrification furthermore at all saturation studies denitrification is dominant and nitrification is least for loamy sand soil texture in recent years many studies on nitrogen transformation have been conducted at the molecular or gene level several functional genes such as amoa nxra napa narg qnorb nosz and nirs have been detected chon et al 2011 dong and reddy 2012 gómez villalba et al 2006 galloway james et al 2008 juhler et al 2009 yan et al 2008 these laboratory scale studies mostly focus on the micro process and migration mechanism of nitrogen pollution however it is difficult to explain the large scale migration of nitrogenous pollutants at the laboratory scale the studies are economic and flexible but cannot fully reflect how contaminants are transported and transformed in the natural environment which means that the parameters obtained may be different from real values in the real conditions at site smith et al 2006 field studies avoid the disadvantage of being limited by the scale effect studies on large regions are mainly concerned with statistical patterns field scale studies using approaches such as distribution analysis or risk assessment of groundwater nitrogen pollution over a large area and nitrogen transport or transformation have been done in many places such as the united states nolan and hitt 2006 spain chica olmo et al 2014 australia thorburn et al 2003 africa douagui et al 2012 kringel et al 2016 and china gu et al 2013 huang et al 2011 ju et al 2006 regarding the study of nitrogen transport in the field what has been learnt comes mainly from investigations of nitrogen concentration changes in groundwater and their relationship to changes in water quality soldatova et al 2017 investigated the sources of different species of nitrogen in shallow groundwater as well as the control of its behavior in riparian zones of the poyang lake basin based on field observations and associated data analysis the results suggested that nitrification largely affects the balance of nitrogen and manure and domestic sewage are two major sources of nitrogen moreover fertilization significant increased the ph of groundwater judging from the results of simulation isotope monitoring is often used to investigate these processes jahangir et al 2013 extended the use of the in situ push pull method which had previously been used for shallow groundwater addy et al 2002 with 15n labelled nitrate to measure the denitrification rate 1 3 469 5 μgnkg 1 day 1 in groundwater ecosystems and found that it was negatively correlated with ambient dissolved oxygen redox potential and no3 and positively correlated with so4 2 smith et al 2004 measured denitrification by natural gradient tracer tests 15n enriched nitrate tracer the down gradient transport and the distribution of 15n within the various constituents of the denitrification pathway nitrate nitrite nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas was measured and the individual denitrification steps were quantified some studies have focused on the transport and reaction of n in the aquifer is to promote the migration of nitrogen in the groundwater environment böhlke et al 2006 used a combination of chemical and isotopic measurements including in situ isotope tracers and the results showed the clear retardation of nh4 transport in groundwater much of the nh4 in the plume was recharged early in the history of the wastewater disposal the no3 and excess n2 which were related to each other by denitrification were largely unrelated to coexisting nh4 and were moving more rapidly nitrification occurred along the upper boundary of the plume and there were essentially no nh4 consuming reactions in the anoxic core of the plume nitrogen migration and transformation in our study was analyzed by in situ time series monitoring data obtained from the field without any artificially added tracer that may cause additional load to the aquifer our study uses a site contaminated with high ammonia concentrations as the result of wastewater discharge the site is located at the southwestern edge of the tengger desert in western china the objective of our study was to reveal the migration and transformation characteristics of three nitrogenous wastes nh4 no2 and no3 in groundwater by using monitoring data 2 material and methods 2 1 contaminated site the study area is located in the north of the qilian mountains in northwestern china on the southwestern edge of the tengger desert the fourth largest desert in china with an area of about 30 000 km2 geographically located at east longitude 102 54 29 35 and north latitude 38 03 48 11 is a part of the silk road which is geopolitically significant due to major water shortages in the region li et al 2015 howard and howard 2016 the area is situated in the southwest side of alxa left banner of the inner mongolia autonomous region at the central border of gansu province the area has definite continental climate characteristics with a mean annual average temperature of 7 9 c an annual rainfall of 116 148 mm concentrated in july and august and an annual evaporation of 3000 3600 mm the area is located in a cenozoic subsidence zone hundreds of meters in thickness comprised of semi cemented and semi consolidated alluvium and moraine which facilitates the migration and storage of groundwater the regional groundwater structure is divided into unconfined semi unconfined and confined aquifers the underlying aquifer is made up of wind blown sands sandy gravel and sandy loam belonging to the middle and upper pleistocene and the thickness is usually 30 50 m with a maximum thickness of 100 m the aquifer media at the contaminated site is mainly light yellow fine and medium fine sand with a thick sandy gravel layer below because of a lack of wastewater discharge management in the study area the waste water a total of 45 608 m3 was directly discharged into the tengger desert in the period from may 28 2014 to march 6 2015 causing soil and groundwater pollution in the area after pollution was discovered in march 2015 visible pollutant was removed from the surface by means of mechanical digging without any treatment or anti pollution measures the contaminated site is shown in fig 1 and has an area of about 0 11 km2 its elevation decreases from west to east and is about 7 m lower on the eastern side compared with the area at the west of the site the terrain on the eastern side is relatively flat the unconfined aquifer at the contaminated site is mainly composed of pore water in unconsolidated rock the thick unconsolidated quaternary sediment in the region provides good storage and rapid transport for groundwater the middle and upper pleistocene strata are the most water rich aquifers and form a single large unit or a multilayered semi unconfined water system the thickness of the aquifers ranges from 50 to 100 m the depth of groundwater is 5 10 m below surface and the specific yield is 3 30 l s m there is an unstable aquifuge between the lower and the upper pleistocene strata and thus the aquifers have a close hydraulic connection the groundwater flow is from the southwest to the northeast with a hydraulic gradient of 3 6 the groundwater is mainly recharged by infiltration of surface water and agricultural irrigation and lateral runoff from bedrock fissures in the mountainous areas the major pathways for groundwater discharge are artificial exploitation evaporation transpiration and lateral flow the hydrochemical types of groundwater are so4 2 hco3 mg2 ca2 which is sulfate bicarbonate freshwater or brackish water with a mineralization of 300 500 mg l 2 2 sample collection and analysis to better understand the current status of pollution continuous monitoring of groundwater quality indexes was started from june to december in 2015 a total of two pollution monitoring wells well 1 and well 2 were built in the polluted area the details were as seen from table 1 based on the direction of groundwater flow two monitoring wells were sited in the lower reaches of the pollution plume well 1 was closest to the pollution plume and well 2 was the farthest from the pollution plume groundwater samples were collected twice a month on the 1st and 15th the chemical components being analyzed included ammonia nitrate nitrite dissolved oxygen do and manganese nitrogen and manganese pollution was evident from initial tests and they are key components of denitrification so ammonia nitrate nitrite and dissolved oxygen were measured regularly manganese was used as a control to monitor the pollution plume because it is generally unreactive in groundwater to ensure the integrity of these groundwater samples they were strictly collected in accordance with the requirements of the technical specifications for environmental monitoring of groundwater china mep 2004 each sample was taken at least 10 min after pumping commenced to ensure the stability of water quality which was indicated by parameters measured in the field including color ph conductivity redox potential turbidity and water temperature the preservation and transportation of samples was done strictly in accordance with the water quality technical regulation of the preservation and handling of samples mep 2009 delivery was arranged before the start of field work and samples were expedited to the laboratory immediately after sampling to minimize storage time to ensure the representativeness accuracy and comparability of the monitoring data quality assurance and quality control measures were applied all monitoring personnel were trained before they got their monitoring certifications all instruments and gauges were certified by the metrological department or calibrated by analysts all the monitoring and analysis methods used were taken from the national standard or recommended methods the details were as seen from table 2 the results of the recovery of standard additions to all the monitoring items were qualified and standard samples were analyzed as well parallel double field samples nitrate nitrite and manganese production rates were calculated as the slope of nitrate nitrite and manganese concentrations against time respectively and expressed as mgno3 n l d mgno2 n l d and mgmn l d respectively a positive slope represents production rates and a negative slope represents consumption rates mangimbulude et al 2012 the correlation coefficient was calculated using minitab 16 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical model the numerical simulation of groundwater is a useful tool for predicting and calculating the migration characteristics of contaminants in groundwater in a set time in this study numerical modeling was used to simulate the transport of ammonia in groundwater and to determine the stage of migration hydrus 1d and visual modflow 2010 1 were coupled to simulate the transport of ammonia in groundwater hydrus 1d was used to simulate the vertical movement of pollutants in the unsaturated zone and the output of hydrus 1d was used as the input to visual modflow which was used to simulate the horizontal migration of pollutants in the saturated aquifer 3 1 1 conceptual model according to the drilling data the thickness of the unsaturated zone is 13 1 m based on the stratigraphy the unsaturated zone can be divided into two layers the first layer is composed of silty sand with a thickness of 5 0 m and the second layer is composed of fine sand with a thickness of 8 1 m each layer was homogeneous the medium fine sand with a thickness of 50 70 m constitutes the unconfined aquifer at the site area this aquifer has a small hydraulic gradient and thus the horizontal flow is pronounced and the vertical flow is slight the groundwater flow field is in a natural state and stable with fairly small annual and interannual variations the flow direction is consistent with topography the hydrogeological parameters show minimal spatial variation and thus the system is essentially homogeneous as a result the conceptual hydrological model of the groundwater system at the contaminated site could be described by a single layer homogeneous two dimensional steady flow system the simulation area was selected from a large area the west by south and east by north boundaries are parallel to the flow direction and so there is no flux through them these boundaries are defined as streamline boundaries zero flux in the south by east boundary the model is recharged by lateral infiltration in the north by west boundary it is discharged by lateral flow the upper boundary was the phreatic water table and it received recharge from the infiltration of surface water because of the large buried depth of the aquifer system phreatic evaporation can be ignored the flux can be estimated by parameters gained from pumping tests in the field the south by east and north by west boundaries were defined as flux boundaries 3 1 2 mathematic model from the above conditions one dimensional vertical movement in the unsaturated zone can be expressed as xue and wu 2010 1 θ t z d θ θ z k θ z the initial condition is 2 θ z 0 θ 0 z z 0 the surface boundary condition can be expressed as 3 h 0 t h a t t 0 z 0 and the bottom boundary is the water table 4 h l t 0 z l t 0 where θ is the water content d θ is the diffusion coefficient m2 d k θ is the hydraulic conductivity m d and h a t is the depth of surface water the two dimensional steady flow of groundwater can be expressed by the flowing partial differential function 5 x k h x y k h y ε 0 where k is hydraulic conductivity m d h is water head m and ε is a source and sink item 1 d the initial condition is 6 h x y 0 h 0 x y x y ω the boundary condition can be written as 7 t h n q 1 x y t x y ω where t is the transmissivity m2 day the flow region is represented by ω the boundary is denoted by ω n denotes the normal derivative to the boundary h 0 x y is the initial head in the flow domain m and q 1 x y t is the known flow rate m3 day m the governing equation for contaminant transport of a single chemical constituent in groundwater is given by 8 r c t x d xx c x y d yy c y x v x c y v y c i where v x and v y are the seepage velocity m d in the x and y directions respectively d xx and d yy are the components of the dispersion coefficient m2 day tensor in the x and y directions respectively c is the concentration of the dissolved species kg m3 i is source and sink items and r is the retardation factor the initial condition is of the form 9 c x y 0 f 0 x y x y ω the boundary condition is 10 c x y t x y 0 t 0 where f 0 x y is a given function 3 1 3 model calibration and verification the model was validated using the measured water level data from four observation wells in the simulation area the modeled water head must accord with the observed head the model parameters were adjusted iteratively based on the hydrogeological conditions and the field tests table 3 the simulation results show that groundwater flows from south to north fig 2 which corresponds to actual conditions the calculated and observed heads fit well all in the 95 confidence interval fig 3 which means that the model can realistically reflect the groundwater system in the study area 3 1 4 simulation results the ammonia transport simulation results can be seen in fig 4 here only transportation has been considered the deviation of the model from measured data in fig 4 was presumably caused by biological transformation of nitrogen which has been discussed in detail in the discussion analysis of ammonia concentration change section according to the observed results well 1 has essentially completed the whole migration process of nitrogenous waste however well 2 pollutant concentrations were at the increasing stage gradually transitioning to the decreasing stage 3 2 observation results according to the observed results well 1 has essentially completed the whole migration process of nitrogenous waste however well 2 pollutant concentrations were at the increasing stage gradually transitioning to the decreasing stage the test results for the groundwater samples are shown in table 4 in well 1 from june 15th to september 1st in 2015 the ammonia concentration fig 5 increased with some small fluctuations and after september 1st started to decrease values of do remained at a low level and were stable from june 15th to october 1st but rose sharply after that nitrate concentrations showed an upward trend although the increases occurred in an irregular step wise manner nitrite concentrations increased in the period from june 15th to july 1st and gradually declined after that manganese levels were stable from june 15th to august 15th and subsequently showed a slow decreasing trend in well 2 ammonia levels fig 5 rose continuously from june 15th while do displayed relatively low values between june 15th and september 1st and then increased significantly from september 1st to october 15th but dropped after october 15th the concentration of nitrate was lower than the detection limit from june 15th to august 1st and started to increase after that including a sharp rise between november 15th and december 1st nitrite concentrations fluctuated at beginning but in general increased from june 15th to september 1st and then decreased gradually after that manganese concentrations showed a decreasing trend throughout the monitoring period but with some fluctuations 3 3 migration and transformation characteristics of nitrogen from well 1 monitoring well 1 was located on the flank of the main groundwater flow and consequently was not on the main direction of the pollution plume it is therefore not surprising that the monitoring data of contaminant concentrations in this well stabilized at a relatively low level compared with well 2 the peak in ammonia concentration in the migration process for this well reached only 0 788 mg l which was about 15 times lower than that in well 2 the location of well 1 was closer to the contaminant site than well 2 and thus at the end of the monitoring period december 1st 2015 ammonia in well 1 had largely completed the migration process 3 3 1 stage division in the migration process dissolved nitrogen in groundwater is mainly found in the form of three nitrogenous wastes no3 n no2 n and nh4 n their mutual transformation occurs because of nitrification and denitrification under microbial catalysis rivett et al 2008 as shown in fig 6 the migration process that took place can be divided into three stages during stage i from june 15th to august 15th the nitrate concentration stayed at a low level while ammonia levels rose from 0 319 to 0 607 mg l the nitrate concentration was consistently lower than the minimum detection limit 0 08 mg l between june 15th and july 15th and after july 15th a small amount of nitrate could be detected nitrification began gradually at a low rate the nitrate production rate was 4 355 10 3 mgno3 n l d and in a 31 day period from july 15th to august 15th the concentration of nitrate increased marginally by 0 135 mg l during stage ii from august 15th to october 15th the nitrate concentration increased significantly and ammonia reached a peak value 0 788 mg l and remained at that value and nitrification rate increased we speculated that the increased nitrification rate could be due to a change in the geochemical environment or to an increased microbial population the average nitrate production rate was 1 451 10 2 mgno3 n l d and the highest rate was 4 618 10 2 mgno3 n l d from august 15th to september 1st the concentration of nitrate increased sharply from 0 135 to 0 92 mg l and remained at that level from september 1st to october 15th with a slight increase reaching 1 02 mg l on october 15th which was almost eight times higher than its initial value during stage iii after october 15th the concentration of nitrate increased significantly reaching 1 84 mg l an increase of 0 82 mg l the nitrate production rate was 4 824 10 2 mgno3 n l d at the same time the ammonia concentration was falling reducing to 0 311 mg l by december 1st 3 3 2 impact of do the changes in stage iii were considered to have been affected by environmental factors such as do and manganese levels soil pollution treatment took place in september and october 2015 and as a result the do content rose considerably after october 3rd increasing by 2 6 mg l fig 7 and nitrate levels entered stage iii the increase in do enhanced the oxidation environment and may have caused the increase in nitrate concentrations through the microbial community 3 3 3 impact of manganese in addition the manganese in the groundwater environment could also have affected nitrification the manganese content was relatively high in the first stage and remained stable while the nitrate was at a lower level studies have shown that the presence of manganese is not beneficial to the growth and reproduction of nitrifying bacteria and that these bacteria are sensitive to changes in manganese content brown and minges 1916 premi and cornfield 1969 xin et al 2016 in stage ii there was a marked decreasing trend for manganese and this corresponded to the first jump in nitrate concentration the manganese concentration decreased from 0 883 to 0 703 mg l and the consumption rate was 2 954 10 3 mgmn l d after october 15th the manganese content decreased faster with a 9 219 10 3 mgmn l d consumption rate during the 16 day period from october 15th to november 1st the concentration decreased by 0 143 mg l which was essentially equal to the amount of change in the entire second stage a 61 day period fig 8 at the same time as these changes there was a second jump in the concentration of nitrate overall the increasing nitrate concentration was likely the result of the nitrifying bacteria the increase in do and the decrease in manganese affected the nitrification rates through their effects on microbial metabolism 3 3 4 transformation characteristics of ammonia nitrite and nitrate the change in ammonia concentration was mainly controlled by the migration of the pollution plume and was also affected by nitrification in stage ii nitrification consumed the ammonia which slowed the increasing trend of ammonia concentration controlled by the pollution plume migration the ammonia levels reached peak values remained constant and then transitioned smoothly into stage iii where enhanced nitrification resulted in the increased consumption of ammonia and was the matrix of nitrification fig 9 nitrite is the intermediate product of nitrification and is not usually stable but during the monitoring period of this study an accumulation of nitrite was witnessed from june 15th to july 1st the concentration of nitrite increased from 0 026 to 0 185 mg l the correlation coefficient between do and nitrite was 0 823 this negative correlation can also be seen in fig 6 nitrification is the process of oxidizing ammonia into nitrate with the help of autotrophic microorganisms there are two steps involved böhlke et al 2006 dodsworth et al 2011 11 nh 4 1 5 o 2 aob no 2 h 2 o h energy 12 no 2 0 5 o 2 nob no 3 energy in the process of nitrification aob and nob compete for do the affinity of aob to dissolved oxygen is greater than for nob wiesmann 1994 resulting in higher growth rates for aob especially at low do levels wett et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 thus nitrosification nh4 no2 may have occurred first in well 1 and nitrite accumulated corresponding to a drop in do no nitrate production took place during this period presumably nob then became active and consumed the nitrite converting it to nitrate according to the theory of nitrification kinetics the energy generated in the process of converting ammonia to nitrite is more than four times that for the conversion of nitrite to nitrate hagopian and riley 1998 therefore to generate the same amount of energy the amount of oxidized nitrite must be four times that of oxidized ammonia the rate that nob oxidized nitrite in unit time was higher than the rate that anitriteob oxidized ammonia this maybe the reason that nitrite did not readily accumulate in the nitrification process the nitrate was gradually produced after july 15th corresponding to the gradual decrease in nitrite concentration in stage ii nitrification increased which would lead to an increase in the oxidation rate difference between the two kinds of bacteria after august 15th the nitrite concentration dropped continuously the nitrite consumption rate was 3 333 10 4 mgno2 n l d in stage i and 2 016 10 3 mgno2 n l d in stage ii the decreasing rate in stage ii was much larger than that in stage i the do levels rose sharply in the period from october 3rd to october 15th corresponding to a rapid fall in nitrite concentrations with a 5 167 10 3 mgno2 n l d consumption rate reflecting the promoting effect of do on nitrification in stage iii with sufficient do the nitrite concentrations remained at a low but stable level while ammonia was converted into nitrate with less nitrite accumulation 3 4 migration and transformation characteristics of nitrogen from well 2 well 2 was located in the direction of the main groundwater flowline and was therefore on the main pollution plume migration path thus the monitoring results for the concentrations of contaminants in this well were higher than those in well 1 the location of well 2 was farther from the contaminant site than well 1 and thus during the monitoring period from june 15th to december 1st the ammonia in well 2 had not completed the migration process the ammonia concentrations increased continuously and approached their peak value which indicated that it was gradually transitioning from stage i to stage ii fig 10 3 4 1 stage division in the migration process at stage i from june 15th to november 15th the nitrate increased from zero and the ammonia concentrations increased the concentration of ammonia rose from 2 77 to 12 mg l the nitrate concentration was consistently below the minimum detection limit between june 15th and august 1st and only after august 1st could nitrate be detected during the period from august 1st to november 15th the concentration of nitrate increased by 5 12 mg l and the nitrate production rate was 4 830 10 2 mgno3 n l d because of the high content of ammonia which was the matrix of nitrification in well 2 nitrification was stronger and more nitrate was generated than in well 1 in stage ii after november 15th the nitrate concentration showed a significant upward trend increasing from 5 12 to 8 01 mg l an increase of 2 89 mg l fig 10 the concentration of ammonia remained essentially stable manganese in groundwater before november 1st had a slight downward trend fig 8 with a 2 446 10 3 mgmn l d consumption rate however after november 15th the consumption rate increased to 4 271 10 2 mgmn l d which caused a significant decrease in manganese this was consistent with the characteristics of the second stage in monitoring well 1 after well 2 entered stage ii the content of manganese decreased which contributed positively to nitrification and the rise in nitrate concentration fig 11 3 4 2 impact of do the concentration of do in well decreased from 1 38 mg l on july 15th to 0 42 mg l on august 1st fig 9 a decrease of 0 96 mg l and was accompanied with an accumulation of nitrite nitrate began to be generated after that date the change in trends was consistent with the characteristics of well 1 in stage i well 2 was farther from the pollution site than well 1 and thus there was a time lag in the variation in the concentration of components in well 2 compared with well 1 since september 1st the concentration of do increased and the nitrite decreased significantly when 1 g of ammonia is nitrified into nitrate 4 57 g of oxygen is consumed while during the conversion of nh4 n to no2 n the oxygen needed is 3 43 g and the conversion of no2 n to no3 n needs 1 12 g of oxygen losordo and westers 1994 the ammonia concentration in well 2 was relatively high fig 7 the initial concentration was 2 77 mg l and the concentration then rose continuously and peaked at 12 5 mg l under certain conditions of do content more do would be consumed in the process whereby aob oxidized high strength ammonia this would decrease the amount of oxygen available for the second step reaction no2 no3 and therefore make conversion to nitrate difficult therefore the increase in do content was likely beneficial to nitrification and also accelerated the consumption of nitrite however there is a large time delay between the observed do increase and the later concurrent increase in nitrate and decrease in nitrite in monitoring well 2 which does not have an obvious explanation fig 12 4 conclusions unmanaged discharge of wastewater rich in ammonia has created a seriously contaminated site on the edge of the tengger desert in northwestern china two continuous groundwater monitoring wells well 1 and well 2 were established to carry out in situ monitoring in the contaminated site well 1 was located on the flank of the main groundwater flowline and has essentially completed the pollution plume migration process nitrification played an important role in this process the transport and transformation of nitrogenous wastes were divided into three stages in stage i no3 was at a low level and nh4 was rising in stage ii no3 rose sharply for the first time while nh4 reached a peak value and remained constant and in stage iii no3 concentration rose significantly again and nh4 fell well 2 was located on the direction of the main groundwater flowline nitrogenous wastes at well 2 were gradually transitioning from stage i to stage ii at the end of the monitoring period the ammonia concentration increased continuously and approached its peak value the nitrate concentration increased sharply as well there was a time lag in the variation in the concentration of components in well 2 compared with well 1 because of increased distance to the contaminated site the increasing do concentration could facilitate nitrification and the existence of manganese can inhibit the nitrifying bacteria therefore a decrease in manganese concentration could be beneficial to nitrification acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural

rainfall and its h o isotopic compositions of the nearby taiyuan basin were from the global network of isotopes in precipitation database iaea wmo 2016 additionally data from this site on 26 october and 23 november 2012 including dissolved organic matter dom concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios in groundwater as well as h o and sr isotopes in river water were compiled from our earlier publications pi et al 2015 yu et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry and h o and sr isotopic compositions the reported hydrochemistry was based on the site aquifer monitoring events from 17 march to 16 november 2011 generally the water chemistry behaved similarly in aquifers 1 and 2 which can be ascribed to their identical hydraulic conductivity and lithological features figs 4 s3 s4 and table s1 the groundwater was alkaline with ph values ranging from 7 02 to 8 44 fig 4a the ph values of aquifers 1 and 2 decreased from 17 march medians 7 7 to 15 august medians 7 3 then drastically elevated on 16 september medians 8 0 and fell on 16 october medians 7 6 and 16 november medians 7 7 the ph values in aquifer 3 exhibited similar seasonal variations with but were typically 0 2 0 3 higher than those of aquifers 1 and 2 the decreases in ec values with depth manifest the influence of evapotranspiration on groundwater mineralization the lowest median ec values for aquifers 1 4 5 ms cm 2 4 0 ms cm and 3 3 5 ms cm were found on 14 april fig 4b which is associated with the dissolution effect caused by rwi the reported eh values have been corrected to the standard hydrogen electrode in aquifer

on 16 october median 128 mv and fell on 16 november median 103 mv fig 4c eh values displayed similar seasonal variations for the 3 aquifers and were generally lower in aquifers 2 and 3 than in aquifer 1 reflecting increasingly reducing conditions with depth ca2 concentrations were commonly 30 500 mg l in general they were slightly higher in aquifer 2 than in aquifer 1 and were much higher in aquifers 1 and 2 medians 160 320 mg l compared to aquifer 3 medians 50 7 117 mg l and decreased over time fig 4d hco3 concentrations were generally 200 900 mg l and were higher in aquifer 3 medians 532 886 mg l than in aquifers 1 medians 482 784 mg l and 2 medians 384 695 mg l and increased over time fig 4e sicalcite and sidolomite that were typically 0 20 1 00 and 0 80 2 50 respectively suggested that the groundwater was oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the median sicalcite varied moderately among the 3 aquifers with the minima 0 30 on 15 august and the maxima 0 90 on 16 september fig s3a sidolomite showed similar seasonal variations with those of sicalcite and were commonly higher in aquifer 3 medians 1 34 2 33 than in aquifers 1 medians 0 95 2 10 and 2 medians 0 98 2 03 fig s3b pco2 were mostly in the range of 10 2 60 to 10 1 50 atm and differed marginally among the 3 aquifers fig s3c the median pco2 elevated from 17 march 10 2 30 atm to 15 august 10 1 70 atm then fell on 16 september 10 2 30 atm rose on 16 october 10 1 90 atm and 16 november 10 2 00 atm pco2 was correlated to hco3 e g rmarch 0 597 n 60 p 0 01 which shows that the former regulates the system s carbonate balance ferrihydrite concentrations were calculated as the difference between total fe and fe2 senn and hemond 2002 and were typically 0 1 1 2 mg l in general they were higher in aquifers 1 medians 0 31 0 61 mg l and 2 medians 0 28 0 99 mg l relative to aquifer 3 medians 0 11 0 34 mg l relatively high median hfo concentrations were observed on 15 may 15 august 16 september and 16 november for aquifers 1 and 2 fig s4a fe2 concentrations were mostly below 0 5 mg l and seemed higher in aquifers 1 medians 0 04 0 34 mg l and 2 medians 0 05 0 60 mg l than in aquifer 3 medians 0 04 0 09 mg l for aquifers 1 and 2 the median fe2 concentrations were higher during 15 may 16 november compared to 17 march and 14 april fig s4b fe2 was correlated to eh e g rmarch 0 604 n 60 p 0 01 with indiscernible vertical and seasonal variations s2 concentrations were typically 20 μg l fig s4c on 15 may sifes2 were commonly 2 0 20 0 median 16 9 n 60 and sifes were below 1 7 this together with the existence of fes and fes2 in the natural sediments of datong pi et al 2017 suggests that the reaction of s2 with fe2 and production of iron sulfides may explain the low levels of aqueous s2 and fe2 phosphate concentrations were typically less than analytic detection limit 0 01 mg l na mg cl so4 na mg cl na cl and na ca cl so4 type groundwater predominated during 17 march 15 may while na mg cl hco3 and na cl hco3 types became increasingly dominant from 15 july to 16 november the river water 14 april 2011 had 8 95 ph 263 7 mv eh 749 μs cm ec 16 0 mg l no3 85 7 mg l so4 2 56 5 mg l ca2

rainfall which mainly occurred during may october fig s5a the δ18o were 13 83 to 1 09 δ2h were 94 3 to 10 4 with appreciable seasonal variability fig s5b c those are linked to the difference in monsoon governed water vapor sources as well as temperature and humidity regulated rayleigh type distillation the linear regression of local meteoric water line lmwl was δ2h 6 4δ18o 4 7 r2 0 94 fig 5a such a slope 6 4 of the lmwl results from the continental effect and the arid semiarid climate in inland basins of northern china allison 1982 the river water samples had 54 3 δ2h and 6 39 δ18o in april 2011 whereas 69 9 δ2h and 8 69 δ18o in october 2012 showing precipitation controlled seasonal isotopic variations the groundwater δ2h and δ18o exhibited a linear regression of δ2h 5 9δ18o 17 1 r2 0 93 with average 78 2 δ2h and 10 28 δ18o of meteoric origin the nearly parallel offset of groundwater from the lmwl is mainly attributed to the recharge in the mountain areas through fractures wu and wang 2014 during october november 2012 groundwater 87sr 86sr ratios ranged from 0 710619 to 0 711793 average 0 711168 0 0004 n 9 yu et al 2015 at pre hrs and from 0 710578 to 0 711561 average 0 710980 0 0003 at post hrs the sr concentration and isotopic ratio of the corresponding river water were respectively 1 2 mg l and 0 710341 fig 5b it appeared that the rwi has induced increases in sr concentrations in some wells situated in aquifers 1 and 2 except for d2 2 meanwhile the dilution effect is obvious in aquifer 3 as evidenced by the decreases in 87sr 86sr ratios and sr concentrations appreciably those sr isotopic fingerprints reflect a silicate character of continental crust martelli et al 2004 this is in accordance with the aforementioned predominance of quartz feldspar and amphibole in the sediments of the study area su 2006 3 2 u spatial seasonal variations note that u in the groundwater samples of 14 june and 15 august monitoring events was not measured regarding the whole of the rest 420 samples u concentrations were typically 10 0 μg l with twenty two samples in the range of 10 0 20 4 μg l and only one at 30 2 μg l the concentrations were higher in aquifers 1 medians 3 8 7 2 μg l u and 2 medians 3 5 6 2 μg l than in aquifer 3 medians 0 8 3 2 μg l and displayed similar seasonal variations for the 3 aquifers fig 4f the medium concentrations in aquifer 1 for example decreased from 17 march 5 9 μg l u to 15 may 3 8 μg l elevated on 15 july 7 2 μg l and 16 september 7 0 μg l then slightly fell on 16 october 5 4 μg l and 16 november 5 5 μg l as shown in fig 6 the concentrations seemed to decrease from rows a and e to the central part of the site especially in aquifer 1 this is related to u speciation changes induced primarily by ca2 and hco3 concentration variations and oxidized species e g do nitrate and fe iii consumption along the flow paths it is interesting to find that higher u concentrations were accompanied by higher eh values ca2 and hfo concentrations but by lower ph values and hco3 concentrations this is consistent with the correlations between u and ph r 0 517 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 ca2 r 0 490 p 0 01 hfo r 0 494 n 58 p 0 01 and hco3 r 0 281 p 0 05 while no significant correlation between u and eh was observed at ph 7 9 both ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and cauo2 co3 3 2 were the most dominant species and uo2 co3 3 4 was commonly 20 fig 7 and those three together constituted 99 8 of the total dissolved u additionally ca2 was correlated to ca2uo2 co3 3 0 r 0 631 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 cauo2 co3 3 2 r 0 785 p 0 01 and uo2 co3 3 4 r 0 393 p 0 01 also hco3 was correlated to ca2uo2 co3 3 0 r 0 711 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 cauo2 co3 3 2 r 0 834 p 0 01 and uo2 co3 3 4 r 0 613 p 0 01 3 3 swgm process and effects of do and nitrate the rwi fractions can be calculated using sr isotope binary mixing model proposed by faure 1986 which is 1 87 sr 86 sr m sr m f 87 sr 86 sr em end member 1 sr em1 1 f 87 sr 86 sr em2 sr em2 where 87sr 86sr m and sr m are the isotopic ratio and concentration in the mixture likewise 87sr 86sr em1 and sr em1 and 87sr 86sr em2 and sr em2 are the isotopic ratios concentrations in the first and the second em respectively and f is the fraction of em 1 supposing the post hrs groundwater is a mixture of lrs groundwater and river water the sr scenario shown in fig 5b makes no solution with respect to aquifers 1 and 2 except for the well d2 2 while the mixing fraction of river water is at least 15 4 in aquifer 3 this is due to sr release from the aquifer matrix since silicate chemical weathering is at the bisiallitization monosiallitization stages at this site fig s6 apart from host mineral weathering rwi can also favor addition of do and nitrate which are common constituents in surface water from this standpoint the higher eh values on 17 march may suggest do and nitrate inputs as well it is important to note that the historical 1955 2015 average atmospheric temperatures are higher in march 0 4 c than in november 1 2 c december 8 6 c january 10 8 c and february 6 8 c in datong chen et al 2016 thus beginning in late february the confluence of infiltrating snow and ice meltwater replenishes the site groundwater in march thereby the consumption of oxidized species which is mediated by microbial activities mainly accounts for the decreases in eh values from 15 may to 15 august fig 4c considering groundwater residence time and redox reaction rates as well as rainfall temporal variations similarly the infiltration of rainfall in the wet season is possibly responsible for the rises in eh values from 15 august to 16 october in contact with atmospheric oxygen do concentration in river water should be at a level of several mg l subject to its solubility under standard conditions though it was not measured in the present study the nitrate concentrations in the river and lake water of datong ranged from below analytical detection limit 0 05 mg l to 22 4 mg l average 12 3 7 9 mg l n 6 unpublished data in 2011 and 2012 which has been generally considered to be derived from nitrogen fertilizers the higher nitrate concentrations in the site groundwater up to 47 4 mg l imply the contribution of nitrification there have been many studies concerning u iv abiotic oxidation by oxygen e g campbell et al 2011 lezama pacheco et al 2015 moon et al 2007 ulrich et al 2009 chemical u iv oxidation associated with nitrate is mainly attributed to nitrite senko et al 2005 one of the denitrification intermediates while both aerobic nh4 oxidation and denitrification are common nitrite sources in natural settings its concentrations in the site groundwater were generally below 0 1 mg l uo2 and coffinite u sio4 nh2o are both the most common u minerals in organic rich sediments cumberland et al 2016 it has been proven by several laboratory studies that the preferential reaction of fes with do and nitrite inhibits uo2 oxidation bi and hayes 2014 bi et al 2013 carpenter et al 2015 this inhibition effect depends on the crystallinity of u iv minerals and relative number of oxidized and reduced species since the noncrystalline u iv is susceptible to oxidation bi et al 2016 the prevention of u iv oxidation by biomass has been proposed in a field study as well suzuki et al 2005 in the study site the several months undisturbed reducing conditions very likely generate crystalline u iv species thereby the existence of fes and thriving aerobic microbial communities in the pristine aquifers of datong constrains direct abiotic u iv oxidation by do and nitrite alternatively the indigenous pseudomonas species which can oxidize u iv through transferring electrons to nitrate may be responsible for its enzymatic oxidation weber et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 for fe ii oxidation with o2 supply the microbial pathway linked to aerobic fe ii oxidizing bacteria e g the indigenous gallionella and leptothrix species outcompetes the abiotic pathway substantially at low o2 level and the latter predominates at o2 concentration above 50 μm emerson et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 if the rwi caused dilution effect is appreciable and the influence of silicate weathering on groundwater h o isotopic ratios is negligible it can be concluded that the more incursion the more isotopic consistency of the site groundwater with river water 6 39 δ18o for the rwi of april 2011 in this view the rwi trend is shown based on δ18o label fig 5c the correlations between hfo and δ18o r 0 535 n 58 p 0 01 table s2 and eh r 0 459 p 0 01 denote the formation of fe iii species as a result of fe ii oxidation induced by adding do and nitrate the advantage in addition accounts for the higher hfo concentrations in aquifers 1 and 2 relative to aquifer 3 in the fe iii solutions hfo fe oh 3 is the initial product of hydrolysis caldeira et al 2010 the occurrence of fe oh 3 may be indicated by the sife oh 3 which were 3 4 4 6 median 4 2 n 58 on 14 april 2011 more importantly newly formed fe oh 3 the main type of poor crystalline fe hydr oxides has been identified in the xrd patterns of amended fe ii bearing aquifer sediments by clo injection in datong basin wang et al 2017 a considerable amount of hfo may be mobile because of occurring as nano or colloid particles the correlation between u and hfo demonstrates u iv oxidation by hfo ginder vogel et al 2006 2010 it has been suggested that increases in ca2 hco3 and ph cause elevated extents and accelerated rates of uo2 oxidation by hfo ginder vogel et al 2006 2010 this is mainly because under alkaline conditions higher concentrations of ca2 and hco3 augment u mobility by promoting the ca uo2 co3 complexes 3 4 effects of ph ca2 and hco3 as mentioned above under oxidizing and alkaline conditions aqueous u speciation and concentration are significantly linked to ca2 and hco3 concentrations to model a u c h2o system which can appropriately represent this site in addition to all common u species four parameters were considered those included the average temperature 8 4 c and pco2 10 2 3 atm on 17 march as well as the selected 12 μg l u and 160 mg l ca2 which were comparable to their concentrations in the site groundwater the distribution of u speciation subject to ph fig 7b and the correlations between ca2 hco3 and ca uo2 co3 uo2 co3 complexes denote that ph ca2 and hco3 regulate the shift among the u vi species groundwater ph range was narrow in this site which makes ca2 and hco3 concentrations more effective in manipulating u vi speciation the correlations between ca2 hco3 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 cauo2 co3 3 2 uo2 co3 3 4 suggest that the rises in ca2 and hco3 are conducive to the formation of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and cauo2 co3 3 2 uo2 co3 3 4 respectively the ca uo2 co3 complexes contribute to u mobility whereby they suppress adsorption and hinder biotic reduction of u vi brooks et al 2003 neiss et al 2007 stewart et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 providing the increase of δ18o denotes the rwi trend the correlation between ca2 and δ18o r 0 677 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 indicates that the rises in ca2 concentrations are linked to the dissolution of ca dominant minerals in addition to ca so4 salt in the surficial soils wu et al 2014b those minerals are associated with common calcareous silicates e g amphibole ca2mg5si8o22 oh 2 anorthite caalsi2o8 and pyroxene camgsi2o6 while may not include calcite and dolomite as the river water was saturated with respect to them obviously the infiltration of water e g lower ph rainwater that is unsaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite can facilitate their dissolution intensified weathering and ca so4 salt input caused by swgm are the reasons for the higher ca2 concentrations in aquifers 1 and 2 relative to aquifer 3 nonetheless the oversaturation of groundwater with respect to calcite vary likely leads to u vi incorporation into precipitated calcite catalano et al 2006 wang et al 2005 this is possibly one of the processes responsible for u immobilization in this site as supported by the correlation between u and sicalcite r 0 326 n 60 p 0 05 table s2 the incorporated u vi may release from calcite conversely when it is dissolved besides minerals dissolution and weathering organic matter om degradation that fuels microbes is another important source of groundwater hco3 clark and fritz 1997 there are two pieces of evidence for the om originated hco3 in this site one is the δ13cdic ranging from 6 9 to 22 0 that is indicative of biogenic origin xie et al 2013b the other is the correlation between hco3 and dom r 0 761 n 23 p 0 01 pi et al 2015 those microbes are supposed to be mainly the indigenous geobacter desulfosporosinus and desulfuromonas species which are able to reduce fe iii and sulfate as substantiated by the existence of dissolved fe2 iron sulfides and fe s isotopic indicators in this site wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the activities of those fe iii and sulfate reducing bacteria result in the decrease in the site eh values but increase in hco3 concentrations with depth which is facilitated by dom derived from the endogenous om in the lacustrine sediments the elevation of hco3 related to progressive om degradation increases cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 whereas decreases ca2uo2 co3 3 0 over time also dissolved ca2 depletion because of carbonate precipitation modestly causes those variations the correlations between u and cauo2 co3 3 2 e g rmarch 0 351 n 60 p 0 01 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 r 0 283 p 0 05 show that the augmented prevailing of the anionic form favors u vi adsorption owing to its greater adsorption affinity compared to the neutral species hence for aquifers 1 and 2 besides relatively high eh values the profound predominance of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 e g medians 60 on 17 march caused by higher ca2 concentrations accounts for u desorption 3 5 effects of fluvial lacustrine sediments the atmosphere has access to the vadose zone as a consequence the zone may be under oxic suboxic conditions and lack secondary u iv deposits in the hanford site it has been noted that u vi incorporated in calcite in the surface sediments and adsorbed u vi on the surface of phyllosilicates and quartz was the only u valence state present in the vadose zone and aquifer sediments wang et al 2005 zachara et al 2013 the results of newfoundland island canada and hetao china sediment u sequential extraction procedures showed that u bound to fe mn oxides accounted for 16 83 of the total u and the fractions of carbonate bound or weak acid extractable u were 2 48 alam and cheng 2014 guo et al 2016 in datong sediments the contents of common phyllosilicates like chlorite and illite were 5 15 median 5 n 5 su 2006 and 5 10 median 8 respectively in this site crystalline fe iii hydr oxides accounted for 28 82 median 68 n 18 xie et al 2013a of the total fe in the sediments hence the higher u 3 46 mg kg and fe 26 3 g kg contents in a upper fluvial yellowish silty clay sample fig 3 at the depth of 5 m bls in this site are mainly related to u vi retaining on in clays calcite and fe hydr oxides if higher contents of om and fes can be respectively reflected by the gray and black colors of sediments they two may correspondingly be important hosts for u in the gray clay and black silt samples fig 3 this conclusion is drawn reasonably as 2 37 u were bound to sediment om and sulfides in the nearby hetao basin inner mongolia guo et al 2016 in this site 10 0 337 mg kg exchangeable na median 129 mg kg n 20 unpublished data and 5205 18 578 mg kg exchangeable ca median 8292 mg kg have been detected in the vadose zone this implies that an incursion of na dominant surface water can lead to an elevation of groundwater ca2 via na ca exchange for the vadose zone in alkaline settings providing the pco2 is equivalent to or higher than 10 3 5 atm and ca2 is not substantially available for complexation apparently the adsorbed uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 co3 2 2 are the major u vi species in addition to calcite incorporated u vi fig 8 as a result of swgm calcite dissolution releases its retained u vi and the increase in dissolved ca2 can cause the formation of ca uo2 co3 complexes and subsequent u vi desorption this is evidenced by a previous laboratory study reporting river water induced u vi desorption from hanford site sediments ahmed et al 2012 the isoelectric points of clay minerals are typically ph 2 5 in alkaline environments the adsorption of fe2 on the negatively charged clays contributes to fe2 reaction with s2 and co3 2 and the production of fes fes2 and siderite feco3 also fe3 adsorption favors its complexation with oh and the formation of fe iii hydroxides those secondary minerals may occur as coatings on the clays under reducing conditions the adsorbed u vi is readily reduced by both adsorbed and structural fe ii like fes and feco3 e g hyun et al 2012 regenspurg et al 2009 scott et al 2005 veeramani et al 2013 thereby the profound u immobilization in aquifer 3 gray or black fine sand layer is linked to both u vi reduction and adsorption respectively intensified by higher fe ii and hco3 the active fe ii species for u vi reduction should primarily include fes and adsorbed fe2 the microbial u vi reduction pathway in this site and the discharge areas of datong is most likely associated with the indigenous geobacter species anderson et al 2003 lovley et al 2004 suzuki et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 in other words u vi reduction is coupled to fe iii and sulfate reduction both chemically and microbially this agrees with the modeled results that crystalline uo2 is stable under alkaline and strong reducing conditions fig 7a in addition the abundant si in this site may also favor the alteration of uo2 and the formation of u sio4 nh2o finch and murakami 1999 given higher om contents facilitate fe iii and sulfate reducing bacteria activities those are the reasons why the u iv minerals usually are bound to fe sulfides and om in low temperature sedimentary environments 4 conclusions our study demonstrates spatial seasonal variations of groundwater u in a multi aquifer system influenced by swgm recognizing the site aquifers are under alkaline conditions we ascribe u mobilization to incorporated u vi release from calcite adsorbed u vi desorption induced by addition of dissolved and exchangeable ca2 and u iv oxidation by fe oh 3 u immobilization results from u vi adsorption regulated by hco3 and carbonate solubility constraint u vi incorporation in precipitated calcite and u vi reduction by fe ii the adsorbed u vi species mostly originate from in situ weathering oxidation of the ubiquitous u iv bearing minerals e g uo2 u sio4 nh2o and brannerite u ca ti fe 2o6 finch and murakami 1999 and further complexation of uo2 2 with co3 2 and ca2 when available addition of oxidized species by surface water e g river water rainwater and meltwater infiltration favors u iv oxidation the dissolved ca2 readily adsorbs on clays in neutral alkaline subsurface environments therefore the incursion of na dominant surface water may cause promotion in groundwater ca2 concentrations via dissolution and na ca exchange the subsequent u vi desorption due to the formation of ca uo2 co3 complexes relies on the specific adsorbed species cauo2 co3 3 2 and or uo2 co3 3 4 and their situations in the aquifer system vadose or saturated zone fig 8 this ca uo2 co3 complexes facilitated u desorption mechanism can be used probably with greater efficiency than the traditional co3 2 solution method in leaching u from u ore mining waste for groundwater u levels and domestic purpose shallow wells that are susceptible to addition of do nitrate ca2 and hco3 cannot be sited in the surface water groundwater interaction zone central water supplies from deep wells which are commonly under reducing conditions are appropriate options if artificial induction of oxidizing conditions e g by water table lowering is avoided though the reducing capacity of the deep well buffers the potential risk of vertical cross flow u from shallow aquifers other environmental geology problems e g land subsidence need to be taken into account studies concerning u mineralogy and sequential extraction procedure high resolution groundwater u dynamics and the effects of functional microbes on u mobility are still needed to clarify the behavior and fate of u in the surface water groundwater interaction zone therefore the results of this study improve our understanding of u transport in the multi aquifer systems within surface water groundwater

et al 2007 under oxidizing conditions as a result of oxidation of the sparingly soluble u iv forms uranyl uo2 2 species predominate generally owing to the effects of oxygen nitrate fe iii and u iv oxidizing bacteria campbell et al 2011 ginder vogel et al 2006 2010 senko et al 2005 weber et al 2011 the adsorption of the cationic uo2 2 in particular on fe hydr oxides in aquifer sediments of many settings retards its mobility stewart et al 2010 in alkaline environments and in the presence of carbonate in solution the formation of highly soluble uo2 co3 2 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 impedes u vi adsorption on mineral surface langmuir 1978 this makes alkaline oxidant bearing e g peroxide carbonate solution e g nh4hco3 and nahco3 effective in leaching u from ore deposits and contaminated soils hunkin et al 1979 mason et al 1997 rhoades 1974 the anionic uo2 co3 complexes can also adsorb to some extent on the surface of positively charged minerals with addition of dissolved ca2 however u vi adsorption is suppressed owing to the formation of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and cauo2 co3 3 2 particularly the neutral one meleshyn et al 2009 stewart et al 2010 while the adsorbed negatively charged u vi species may desorb because of their competition with the predominant anions e g no3 for exchange sites in high ionic strength solutions dong and brooks 2008 in the waters with high levels of ca2 and carbonate it is important to note that u vi can incorporate in the secondarily formed calcite as well catalano et al 2006 kelly et al 2003 wang et al 2005 zachara et al 2013 under reducing conditions u vi can be reduced typically to uraninite uo2 due to the effects of adsorbed fe ii iron sulfides and fe iii and sulfate reducing bacteria anderson et al 2003 boland et al 2014 hua and deng 2008 moon et al 2010 veeramani et al 2013 a few studies have demonstrated that the u vi reduction by fe ii is commonly iron oxide e g magnetite surface mediated and thus is accompanied by u vi incorporation in and sorption on the iron oxide and its transformation product e g lu et al 2018 scott et al 2005 that the microbially mediated fe iii and sulfate reduction commonly prevails in the lower lying areas of sedimentary basins bethke et al 2011 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 may raise a consideration of u retaining in the sediments as uo2 from this geochemical perspective and the negative results of occasional water quality test e g u 30 μg l it is tempting to assume that the risk of naturally occurring u mobilization may be ignored in those areas however rivers usually develop in the lower lying areas thus the incursion of dissolved oxygen do and nitrate which is associated with rivers periodic hydrologic fluctuations mostly resulting from the monsoon climate regulated precipitation may mobilize u in the sediments within a surface water groundwater mixing swgm system it is notable that the behavior and fate of u have been intensively studied at the anthropogenically u contaminated hanford 300 area under the influence of columbia river washington state e g ahmed et al 2012 lee et al 2012 nguyen et al 2012 zachara et al 2013 2016 those studies illustrated the transport of u under the impacts of river stage and the combined effects of advection and source term location while it is critical to safe drinking water supply seasonal variations of u concentrations in u pristine aquifers influenced by swgm have not been well studied in the arid semiarid regions of northern china in decades groundwater has been extensively exploited for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes to investigate the transport of geogenic as in principle wang et al 2014 xie et al 2014 yu et al 2015 we constructed a multi level monitoring well site in a river groundwater interaction zone in datong basin northern china in september october 2010 based on our later characterization of the regional geogenic u at high levels in datong groundwater wu et al 2014a this work tries to further analyze the obtained monitoring data of this site it is hypothesized that addition of oxidized species ca2 and hco3 as a result of swgm may mobilize sediment u and cause increases in dissolved u concentrations consequently aiming at investigating the mechanisms of swgm induced mobilization and natural attenuation of u this work studies the spatial and seasonal variations in u concentrations in the aforementioned site concerning the effects of ph ca2 hco3 do nitrate and sediments hydrochemical and h o sr isotopic data geochemical modeling and thermodynamic calculations were used to elucidate how u speciation and concentration respond to the changes of hydrochemistry our results can improve our understanding of aquifer scale u spatial seasonal variations and provide important

discharge areas of regional groundwater system han 2008 sanggan river the main surficial drainage in datong flows through the basin from southwest to northeast fig 1b the river stages well responded to the precipitation before 1970s and showed high river stage hrs in summer autumn and low river stage lrs in winter spring annually dongyulin the reservoir upstream has been in use since 1978 and it only drains water to the downstream plains for irrigation purpose during middle april and late october each year as a result the river is nearly dried up most of the time and only experiences hrs fig s1 of supplementary data during the annual irrigation periods the duration of hrs is about one week the field site with 20 well nests lies on the south bank of sanggan river in the central basin fig

rainfall and its h o isotopic compositions of the nearby taiyuan basin were from the global network of isotopes in precipitation database iaea wmo 2016 additionally data from this site on 26 october and 23 november 2012 including dissolved organic matter dom concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios in groundwater as well as h o and sr isotopes in river water were compiled from our earlier publications pi et al 2015 yu et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry and h o and sr isotopic compositions the reported hydrochemistry was based on the site aquifer monitoring events from 17 march to 16 november 2011 generally the water chemistry behaved similarly in aquifers 1 and 2 which can be ascribed to their identical hydraulic conductivity and lithological features figs 4 s3 s4 and table s1 the groundwater was alkaline with ph values ranging from 7 02 to 8 44 fig 4a the ph values of aquifers 1 and 2 decreased from 17 march medians 7 7 to 15 august medians 7 3 then drastically elevated on 16 september medians 8 0 and fell on 16 october medians 7 6 and 16 november medians 7 7 the ph values in aquifer 3 exhibited similar seasonal variations with but were typically 0 2 0 3 higher than those of aquifers 1 and 2 the decreases in ec values with depth manifest the influence of evapotranspiration on groundwater mineralization the lowest median ec values for aquifers 1 4 5 ms cm 2 4 0 ms cm and 3 3 5 ms cm were found on 14 april fig 4b which is associated with the dissolution effect caused by rwi the reported eh values have been corrected to the standard hydrogen electrode in aquifer 1 the eh values slightly rose higher on 14 april median 207 mv than on 17 march median 200 mv then modestly decreased till 15 august median 27 9 mv and 16 september median 36 1 mv drastically elevated on 16 october median 128 mv and fell on 16 november median 103 mv fig 4c eh values displayed similar seasonal variations for the 3 aquifers and were generally lower in aquifers 2 and 3 than in aquifer 1 reflecting increasingly reducing conditions with depth ca2 concentrations were commonly 30 500 mg l in general they were slightly higher in aquifer 2 than in aquifer 1 and were much higher in aquifers 1 and 2 medians 160 320 mg l compared to aquifer 3 medians 50 7 117 mg l and decreased over time fig 4d hco3 concentrations were generally 200 900 mg l and were higher in aquifer 3 medians 532 886 mg l than in aquifers 1 medians 482 784 mg l and 2 medians 384 695 mg l and increased over time fig 4e sicalcite and sidolomite that were typically 0 20 1 00 and 0 80 2 50 respectively suggested that the groundwater was oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the median sicalcite varied moderately among the 3 aquifers with the minima 0 30 on 15 august and the maxima 0 90 on 16 september fig s3a sidolomite showed similar seasonal variations with those of sicalcite and were commonly higher in aquifer 3 medians 1 34 2 33 than in aquifers 1 medians 0 95 2 10 and 2 medians 0 98 2 03 fig s3b pco2 were mostly in the range of 10 2 60 to 10 1 50 atm and differed marginally among the 3 aquifers fig s3c the median pco2 elevated from 17 march 10 2 30 atm to 15 august 10 1 70 atm then fell on 16 september 10 2 30 atm rose on 16 october 10 1 90 atm and 16 november 10 2 00 atm pco2 was correlated to hco3 e g rmarch 0 597 n 60 p 0 01 which shows that the former regulates the system s carbonate balance ferrihydrite concentrations were calculated as the difference between total fe and fe2 senn and hemond 2002 and were typically 0 1 1 2 mg l in general they were higher in aquifers 1 medians 0 31 0 61 mg l and 2 medians 0 28 0 99 mg l relative to aquifer 3 medians 0 11 0 34 mg l relatively high median hfo concentrations were observed on 15 may 15 august 16 september and 16 november for aquifers 1 and 2 fig s4a fe2 concentrations were mostly below 0 5 mg l and seemed higher in aquifers 1 medians 0 04 0 34 mg l and 2 medians 0 05 0 60 mg l than in aquifer 3 medians 0 04 0 09 mg l for aquifers 1 and 2 the median fe2 concentrations were higher during 15 may 16 november compared to 17 march and 14 april fig s4b fe2 was correlated to eh e g rmarch 0 604 n 60 p 0 01 with indiscernible vertical and seasonal variations s2 concentrations were typically 20 μg l fig s4c on 15 may sifes2 were commonly 2 0 20 0 median 16 9 n 60 and sifes were below 1 7 this together with the existence of fes and fes2 in the natural sediments of datong pi et al 2017 suggests that the reaction of s2 with fe2 and production of iron sulfides may explain the low levels of aqueous s2 and fe2 phosphate concentrations were typically less than analytic detection limit 0 01 mg l na mg cl so4 na mg cl na cl and na ca cl so4 type groundwater predominated during 17 march 15 may while na mg cl hco3 and na cl hco3 types became increasingly dominant from 15 july to 16 november the river water 14 april 2011 had 8 95 ph 263 7 mv eh 749 μs cm ec 16 0 mg l no3 85 7 mg l so4 2 56 5 mg l ca2

rainfall which mainly occurred during may october fig s5a the δ18o were 13 83 to 1 09 δ2h were 94 3 to 10 4 with appreciable seasonal variability fig s5b c those are linked to the difference in monsoon governed water vapor sources as well as temperature and humidity regulated rayleigh type distillation the linear regression of local meteoric water line lmwl was δ2h 6 4δ18o 4 7 r2 0 94 fig 5a such a slope 6 4 of the lmwl results from the continental effect and the arid semiarid climate in inland basins of northern china allison 1982 the river water samples had 54 3 δ2h and 6 39 δ18o in april 2011 whereas 69 9 δ2h and 8 69 δ18o in october 2012 showing precipitation controlled seasonal isotopic variations the groundwater δ2h and δ18o exhibited a linear regression of δ2h 5 9δ18o 17 1 r2 0 93 with average 78 2 δ2h and 10 28 δ18o of meteoric origin the nearly parallel offset of groundwater from the lmwl is mainly attributed to the recharge in the mountain areas through fractures wu and wang 2014 during october november 2012 groundwater 87sr 86sr ratios ranged from 0 710619 to 0 711793 average 0 711168 0 0004 n 9 yu et al 2015 at pre hrs and from 0 710578 to 0 711561 average 0 710980 0 0003 at post hrs the sr concentration and isotopic ratio of the corresponding river water were respectively 1 2 mg l and 0 710341 fig 5b it appeared that the rwi has induced increases in sr concentrations in some wells situated in aquifers 1 and 2 except for d2 2 meanwhile the dilution effect is obvious in aquifer 3 as evidenced by the decreases in 87sr 86sr ratios and sr concentrations appreciably those sr isotopic fingerprints reflect a silicate character of continental crust martelli et al 2004 this is in accordance with the aforementioned predominance of quartz feldspar and amphibole in the sediments of the study area su 2006 3 2 u spatial seasonal variations note that u in the groundwater samples of 14 june and 15 august monitoring events was not measured regarding the whole of the rest 420 samples u concentrations were typically 10 0 μg l with twenty two samples in the range of 10 0 20 4 μg l and only one at 30 2 μg l the concentrations were higher in aquifers 1 medians 3 8 7 2 μg l u and 2 medians 3 5 6 2 μg l than in aquifer 3 medians 0 8 3 2 μg l and displayed similar seasonal variations for the 3 aquifers fig 4f the medium concentrations in aquifer 1 for example decreased from 17 march 5 9 μg l u to 15 may 3 8 μg l elevated on 15 july 7 2 μg l and 16 september 7 0 μg l then slightly fell on 16 october 5 4 μg l and 16 november 5 5 μg l as shown in fig 6 the concentrations seemed to decrease from rows a and e to the central part of the site especially in aquifer 1 this is related to u speciation changes induced primarily by ca2 and hco3 concentration variations and oxidized species e g do nitrate and fe iii consumption along the flow paths it is interesting to find that higher u concentrations were accompanied by higher eh values ca2 and hfo concentrations but by lower ph values and hco3 concentrations this is consistent with the correlations between u and ph r 0 517 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 ca2 r 0 490 p 0 01 hfo r 0 494 n 58 p 0 01 and hco3 r 0 281 p 0 05 while no significant correlation between u and eh was observed at ph 7 9 both ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and cauo2 co3 3 2 were the most dominant species and uo2 co3 3 4 was commonly 20 fig 7 and those three together constituted 99 8 of the total dissolved u additionally ca2 was correlated to ca2uo2 co3 3 0 r 0 631 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 cauo2 co3 3 2 r 0 785 p 0 01 and uo2 co3 3 4 r 0 393 p 0 01 also hco3 was correlated to ca2uo2 co3 3 0 r 0 711 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 cauo2 co3 3 2 r 0 834 p 0 01 and uo2 co3 3 4 r 0 613 p 0 01 3 3 swgm process and effects of do and nitrate the rwi fractions can be calculated using sr isotope binary mixing model proposed by faure 1986 which is 1 87 sr 86 sr m sr m f 87 sr 86 sr em end member 1 sr em1 1 f 87 sr 86 sr em2 sr em2 where 87sr 86sr m and sr m are the isotopic ratio and concentration in the mixture likewise 87sr 86sr em1 and sr em1 and 87sr 86sr em2 and sr em2 are the isotopic ratios concentrations in the first and the second em respectively and f is the fraction of em 1 supposing the post hrs groundwater is a mixture of lrs groundwater and river water the sr scenario shown in fig 5b makes no solution with respect to aquifers 1 and 2 except for the well d2 2 while the mixing fraction of river water is at least 15 4 in aquifer 3 this is due to sr release from the aquifer matrix since silicate chemical weathering is at the bisiallitization monosiallitization stages at this site fig s6 apart from host mineral weathering rwi can also favor addition of do and nitrate which are common constituents in surface water from this standpoint the higher eh values on 17 march may suggest do and nitrate inputs as well it is important to note that the historical 1955 2015 average atmospheric temperatures are higher in march 0 4 c than in november 1 2 c december 8 6 c january 10 8 c and february 6 8 c in datong chen et al 2016 thus beginning in late february the confluence of infiltrating snow and ice meltwater replenishes the site groundwater in march thereby the consumption of oxidized species which is mediated by microbial activities mainly accounts for the decreases in eh values from 15 may to 15 august fig 4c considering groundwater residence time and redox reaction rates as well as rainfall temporal variations similarly the infiltration of rainfall in the wet season is possibly responsible for the rises in eh values from 15 august to 16 october in contact with atmospheric oxygen do concentration in river water should be at a level of several mg l subject to its solubility under standard conditions though it was not measured in the present study the nitrate concentrations in the river and lake water of datong ranged from below analytical detection limit 0 05 mg l to 22 4 mg l average 12 3 7 9 mg l n 6 unpublished data in 2011 and 2012 which has been generally considered to be derived from nitrogen fertilizers the higher nitrate concentrations in the site groundwater up to 47 4 mg l imply the contribution of nitrification there have been many studies concerning u iv abiotic oxidation by oxygen e g campbell et al 2011 lezama pacheco et al 2015 moon et al 2007 ulrich et al 2009 chemical u iv oxidation associated with nitrate is mainly attributed to nitrite senko et al 2005 one of the denitrification intermediates while both aerobic nh4 oxidation and denitrification are common nitrite sources in natural settings its concentrations in the site groundwater were generally below 0 1 mg l uo2 and coffinite u sio4 nh2o are both the most common u minerals in organic rich sediments cumberland et al 2016 it has been proven by several laboratory studies that the preferential reaction of fes with do and nitrite inhibits uo2 oxidation bi and hayes 2014 bi et al 2013 carpenter et al 2015 this inhibition effect depends on the crystallinity of u iv minerals and relative number of oxidized and reduced species since the noncrystalline u iv is susceptible to oxidation bi et al 2016 the prevention of u iv oxidation by biomass has been proposed in a field study as well suzuki et al 2005 in the study site the several months undisturbed reducing conditions very likely generate crystalline u iv species thereby the existence of fes and thriving aerobic microbial communities in the pristine aquifers of datong constrains direct abiotic u iv oxidation by do and nitrite alternatively the indigenous pseudomonas species which can oxidize u iv through transferring electrons to nitrate may be responsible for its enzymatic oxidation weber et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 for fe ii oxidation with o2 supply the microbial pathway linked to aerobic fe ii oxidizing bacteria e g the indigenous gallionella and leptothrix species outcompetes the abiotic pathway substantially at low o2 level and the latter predominates at o2 concentration above 50 μm emerson et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 if the rwi caused dilution effect is appreciable and the influence of silicate weathering on groundwater h o isotopic ratios is negligible it can be concluded that the more incursion the more isotopic consistency of the site groundwater with river water 6 39 δ18o for the rwi of april 2011 in this view the rwi trend is shown based on δ18o label fig 5c the correlations between hfo and δ18o r 0 535 n 58 p 0 01 table s2 and eh r 0 459 p 0 01 denote the formation of fe iii species as a result of fe ii oxidation induced by adding do and nitrate the advantage in addition accounts for the higher hfo concentrations in aquifers 1 and 2 relative to aquifer 3 in the fe iii solutions hfo fe oh 3 is the initial product of hydrolysis caldeira et al 2010 the occurrence of fe oh 3 may be indicated by the sife oh 3 which were 3 4 4 6 median 4 2 n 58 on 14 april 2011 more importantly newly formed fe oh 3 the main type of poor crystalline fe hydr oxides has been identified in the xrd patterns of amended fe ii bearing aquifer sediments by clo injection in datong basin wang et al 2017 a considerable amount of hfo may be mobile because of occurring as nano or colloid particles the correlation between u and hfo demonstrates u iv oxidation by hfo ginder vogel et al 2006 2010 it has been suggested that increases in ca2 hco3 and ph cause elevated extents and accelerated rates of uo2 oxidation by hfo ginder vogel et al 2006 2010 this is mainly because under alkaline conditions higher concentrations of ca2 and hco3 augment u mobility by promoting the ca uo2 co3 complexes 3 4 effects of ph ca2 and hco3 as mentioned above under oxidizing and alkaline conditions aqueous u speciation and concentration are significantly linked to ca2 and hco3 concentrations to model a u c h2o system which can appropriately represent this site in addition to all common u species four parameters were considered those included the average temperature 8 4 c and pco2 10 2 3 atm on 17 march as well as the selected 12 μg l u and 160 mg l ca2 which were comparable to their concentrations in the site groundwater the distribution of u speciation subject to ph fig 7b and the correlations between ca2 hco3 and ca uo2 co3 uo2 co3 complexes denote that ph ca2 and hco3 regulate the shift among the u vi species groundwater ph range was narrow in this site which makes ca2 and hco3 concentrations more effective in manipulating u vi speciation the correlations between ca2 hco3 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 cauo2 co3 3 2 uo2 co3 3 4 suggest that the rises in ca2 and hco3 are conducive to the formation of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and cauo2 co3 3 2 uo2 co3 3 4 respectively the ca uo2 co3 complexes contribute to u mobility whereby they suppress adsorption and hinder biotic reduction of u vi brooks et al 2003 neiss et al 2007 stewart et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 providing the increase of δ18o denotes the rwi trend the correlation between ca2 and δ18o r 0 677 n 60 p 0 01 table s2 indicates that the rises in ca2 concentrations are linked to the dissolution of ca dominant minerals in addition to ca so4 salt in the surficial soils wu et al 2014b those minerals are associated with common calcareous silicates e g amphibole ca2mg5si8o22 oh 2 anorthite caalsi2o8 and pyroxene camgsi2o6 while may not include calcite and dolomite as the river water was saturated with respect to them obviously the infiltration of water e g lower ph rainwater that is unsaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite can facilitate their dissolution intensified weathering and ca so4 salt input caused by swgm are the reasons for the higher ca2 concentrations in aquifers 1 and 2 relative to aquifer 3 nonetheless the oversaturation of groundwater with respect to calcite vary likely leads to u vi incorporation into precipitated calcite catalano et al 2006 wang et al 2005 this is possibly one of the processes responsible for u immobilization in this site as supported by the correlation between u and sicalcite r 0 326 n 60 p 0 05 table s2 the incorporated u vi may release from calcite conversely when it is dissolved besides minerals dissolution and weathering organic matter om degradation that fuels microbes is another important source of groundwater hco3 clark and fritz 1997 there are two pieces of evidence for the om originated hco3 in this site one is the δ13cdic ranging from 6 9 to 22 0 that is indicative of biogenic origin xie et al 2013b the other is the correlation between hco3 and dom r 0 761 n 23 p 0 01 pi et al 2015 those microbes are supposed to be mainly the indigenous geobacter desulfosporosinus and desulfuromonas species which are able to reduce fe iii and sulfate as substantiated by the existence of dissolved fe2 iron sulfides and fe s isotopic indicators in this site wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the activities of those fe iii and sulfate reducing bacteria result in the decrease in the site eh values but increase in hco3 concentrations with depth which is facilitated by dom derived from the endogenous om in the lacustrine sediments the elevation of hco3 related to progressive om degradation increases cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 whereas decreases ca2uo2 co3 3 0 over time also dissolved ca2 depletion because of carbonate precipitation modestly causes those variations the correlations between u and cauo2 co3 3 2 e g rmarch 0 351 n 60 p 0 01 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 r 0 283 p 0 05 show that the augmented prevailing of the anionic form favors u vi adsorption owing to its greater adsorption affinity compared to the neutral species hence for aquifers 1 and 2 besides relatively high eh values the profound predominance of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 e g medians 60 on 17 march caused by higher ca2 concentrations accounts for u desorption 3 5 effects of fluvial lacustrine sediments the atmosphere has access to the vadose zone as a consequence the zone may be under oxic suboxic conditions and lack secondary u iv deposits in the hanford site it has been noted that u vi incorporated in calcite in the surface sediments and adsorbed u vi on the surface of phyllosilicates and quartz was the only u valence state present in the vadose zone and aquifer sediments wang et al 2005 zachara et al 2013 the results of newfoundland island canada and hetao china sediment u sequential extraction procedures showed that u bound to fe mn oxides accounted for 16 83 of the total u and the fractions of carbonate bound or weak acid extractable u were 2 48 alam and cheng 2014 guo et al 2016 in datong sediments the contents of common phyllosilicates like chlorite and illite were 5 15 median 5 n 5 su 2006 and 5 10 median 8 respectively in this site crystalline fe iii hydr oxides accounted for 28 82 median 68 n 18 xie et al 2013a of the total fe in the sediments hence the higher u 3 46 mg kg and fe 26 3 g kg contents in a upper fluvial yellowish silty clay sample fig 3 at the depth of 5 m bls in this site are mainly related to u vi retaining on in clays calcite and fe hydr oxides if higher contents of om and fes can be respectively reflected by the gray and black colors of sediments they two may correspondingly be important hosts for u in the gray clay and black silt samples fig 3 this conclusion is drawn reasonably as 2 37 u were bound to sediment om and sulfides in the nearby hetao basin inner mongolia guo et al 2016 in this site 10 0 337 mg kg exchangeable na median 129 mg kg n 20 unpublished data and 5205 18 578 mg kg exchangeable ca median 8292 mg kg have been detected in the vadose zone this implies that an incursion of na dominant surface water can lead to an elevation of groundwater ca2 via na ca exchange for the vadose zone in alkaline settings providing the pco2 is equivalent to or higher than 10 3 5 atm and ca2 is not substantially available for complexation apparently the adsorbed uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 co3 2 2 are the major u vi species in addition to calcite incorporated u vi fig 8 as a result of swgm calcite dissolution releases its retained u vi and the increase in dissolved ca2 can cause the formation of ca uo2 co3 complexes and subsequent u vi desorption this is evidenced by a previous laboratory study reporting river water induced u vi desorption from hanford site sediments ahmed et al 2012 the isoelectric points of clay minerals are typically ph 2 5 in alkaline environments the adsorption of fe2 on the negatively charged clays contributes to fe2 reaction with s2 and co3 2 and the production of fes fes2 and siderite feco3 also fe3 adsorption favors its complexation with oh and the formation of fe iii hydroxides those secondary minerals may occur as coatings on the clays under reducing conditions the adsorbed u vi is readily reduced by both adsorbed and structural fe ii like fes and feco3 e g hyun et al 2012 regenspurg et al 2009 scott et al 2005 veeramani et al 2013 thereby the profound u immobilization in aquifer 3 gray or black fine sand layer is linked to both u vi reduction and adsorption respectively intensified by higher fe ii and hco3 the active fe ii species for u vi reduction should primarily include fes and adsorbed fe2 the microbial u vi reduction pathway in this site and the discharge areas of datong is most likely associated with the indigenous geobacter species anderson et al 2003 lovley et al 2004 suzuki et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 in other words u vi reduction is coupled to fe iii and sulfate reduction both chemically and microbially this agrees with the modeled results that crystalline uo2 is stable under alkaline and strong reducing conditions fig 7a in addition the abundant si in this site may also favor the alteration of uo2 and the formation of u sio4 nh2o finch and murakami 1999 given higher om contents facilitate fe iii and sulfate reducing bacteria activities those are the reasons why the u iv minerals usually are bound to fe sulfides and om in low temperature sedimentary environments 4 conclusions our study demonstrates spatial seasonal variations of groundwater u in a multi aquifer system influenced by swgm recognizing the site aquifers are under alkaline conditions we ascribe u mobilization to incorporated u vi release from calcite adsorbed u vi desorption induced by addition of dissolved and exchangeable ca2 and u iv oxidation by fe oh 3 u immobilization results from u vi adsorption regulated by hco3 and carbonate solubility constraint u vi incorporation in precipitated calcite and u vi reduction by fe ii the adsorbed u vi species mostly originate from in situ weathering oxidation of the ubiquitous u iv bearing minerals e g uo2 u sio4 nh2o and brannerite u ca ti fe 2o6 finch and murakami 1999 and further complexation of uo2 2 with co3 2 and ca2 when available addition of oxidized species by surface water e g river water rainwater and meltwater infiltration favors u iv oxidation the dissolved ca2 readily adsorbs on clays in neutral alkaline subsurface environments therefore the incursion of na dominant surface water may cause promotion in groundwater ca2 concentrations via dissolution and na ca exchange the subsequent u vi desorption due to the formation of ca uo2 co3 complexes relies on the specific adsorbed species cauo2 co3 3 2 and or uo2 co3 3 4 and their situations in the aquifer system vadose or saturated zone fig 8 this ca uo2 co3 complexes facilitated u desorption mechanism can be used probably with greater efficiency than the traditional co3 2 solution method in leaching u from u ore mining waste for groundwater u levels and domestic purpose shallow wells that are susceptible to addition of do nitrate ca2 and hco3 cannot be sited in the surface water groundwater interaction zone central water supplies from deep wells which are commonly under reducing conditions are appropriate options if artificial induction of oxidizing conditions e g by water table lowering is avoided though the reducing capacity of the deep well buffers the potential risk of vertical cross flow u from shallow aquifers other environmental geology problems e g land subsidence need to be taken into account studies concerning u mineralogy and sequential extraction procedure high resolution groundwater u dynamics and the effects of functional microbes on u mobility are still needed to clarify the behavior and fate of u in the surface water groundwater interaction zone therefore the results of this study improve our understanding of u transport in the multi aquifer systems within surface water groundwater interaction zones with important implications for groundwater resource management acknowledgements this work was funded by national natural science foundation of china nos 41521001 and 41702258 moe

oxide nanoparticles stabilized with paa were collected under similar flow conditions the results show that low concentration slurry of iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with paa can be transported like a tracer without significant retardation the image processing technique was employed to measure the tracer nanoparticle concentration inside the 2 d model filled with glass beads the groundwater

transport characteristics of nanoparticles stabilized with paa in groundwater aquifers keywords magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle fe3o4 poly acrylic acid porous media transport remediation 1 introduction there are many compositions of iron nanoparticles with wide range of applications in environmental engineering especially in contaminant removal processes of soil and groundwater one of the advantages of using iron nanoparticles for in situ processes is that they can be injected directly into the porous media and there is no need for underground installation that makes it economically more affordable gillham and o hannesin 1994 narr et al 2007 furthermore due to the extremely large specific surface area ssa nanoparticles provide a much higher surface reactivity compared to millimetric iron li et al 2005 freyria et al 2011 among available iron nanoparticles inp nano scale zero valent iron nzvi has attracted the attention of many researches because of their ability in remediation of aquifers contaminated by heavy metals nitrate nickel and other hazardous compounds despite its high reactivity observations in laboratory and field scales showed that the application of nzvi in porous media faces critical problems cantrell et al 1997 the magnetic properties leads to aggregation agglomeration and consequent rapid settlement or filtration on the solid phase surface especially when used in high concentrations the influence of magnetic attraction on nzvi agglomeration first addressed by phenrat et al 2007 who proposed an extended theory of dlvo the subject was more fully investigated by zhang et al 2009 previous researches showed that nzvi has some limitation in movement in porous media so that they could be transported only a few centimeters from the injection point under typical groundwater conditions tiraferri et al 2008 dalla vecchia et al 2009 overcoming this limitation and improving their transport in porous media researchers have used electrostatic steric and depletion stabilization mechanisms generating stabilized nzvi colloids by stabilizers like polystyrene sulfonate pss carboxymethyl cellulose cmc triblock xanthan gum and emulsified iron saleh et al 2005 berge and ramsburg 2009 he et al 2007 phenrat et al 2009 phenrat et al 2010a phenrat et al 2011 schrick employed poly acrylic acid paa as a vehicle to deliver nzvi and demonstrated that it can facilitate transport in a glass bead box kanel et al 2008 the majority of these studies used batch experiment or 1d porous media column experiment filled by glass bead or sand to demonstrate the additive s potential to stabilized inp in addition to the methods of stabilizing inp the transport dynamics of stabilized inp under dynamic flow conditions had been studied mostly in one dimensional porous media for example schrick et al 2004 considered stabilized inp and its reactivity in a glass column packed with glass bead kanel et al 2008 studied surfactant tween 20 stabilized inp and paa stabilized inp in a glass column packed with sand he et al 2007 phenrat et al 2010a 2010b studied the transport of polyelectrolyte stabilized nzvi at various particle concentration 0 03 0 3 1 3 and 6 g l in saturated sand column their studies showed that slurries with low concentrations are in agreement with the assumptions of the classical colloid filtration theory tufenkji and elimelech 2004 kim et al 2007 phenrat et al 2010c found that considering the coating property is important to have a reliable estimation of attachment of magnetite and titanium dioxide fine particles transport of stabilized inp under two dimensional flow conditions had been studied in a few researches kanel et al 2008 studied transport of stabilized nzvi in two dimensional porous media they made comparison between results of laboratory experiments and simulation results of numerical modeling in their numerical model they hypothesized that transport dynamics of stabilized inp influenced by small density gradients in addition they neglected of adsorption and chemical reaction they used the numerical model seawat to examine whether the observed s inp plume can be conceptually modeled as a density driven conservative plume in addition to nzvi iron oxide nanoparticles can be used in remedial processes for polluted soil and groundwater although iron oxide nanoparticles have less reactivity than nzvi they can still be employed as pollution absorbers slurry of iron oxide nanoparticles was successfully employed for removal of methylene blue and bromelain mak and chen 2004 chen and huang 2009 hu et al have used iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 in order to remove cr vi from an aqueous media through absorption processes hu et al 2005 babakhani et al 2015 used carboxymethyl cellulose and polystyrene sulfonate modified nzvi to study the aggregation and transport of nanoparticles experimentally and numerically in one dimensional model the results then extended to simulate a 2 d case recently some new approaches used to explain the phenomena more explicitly babakhani et al 2017a 2017b in this study it was hypothesized that two dimensional physical models can be used to unravel the multidimensional transport dynamics of stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles moreover due to low concentration of the slurry of stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles it is not influenced by small density gradients a novel experimental setup was used to measure the concentration of nanoparticles in different points of porous media the two dimensional transport data of stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles was used to demonstrate the efficiency of the stabilization process it was hypothesized that the attachment is only surfaced so the advection dispersion equation based on the classical colloid filtration theory cft was used to simulate experiments finally the numerical model visual modflow was employed to test whether the theory is able to simulate the transport of nanoparticles in porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the chemicals used in these experiments were of laboratory grade iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 were obtained from pasteur institute of iran with average particle size of 44 5 nm and 99 5 purity golzar et al 2014a poly acrylic acid paa mean m w 1 8 kg mol was obtained from sigma aldrich company golzar et al 2014b the porous media selected for this study was glass beads obtained from iran glass beads company the mean diameter of these glass beads was 1 5 mm with a variation of 0 01 mm these experiments were conducted in a two dimensional flow container as shown in fig 1 the dimensions of the flow container are 35 mm thickness 500 mm width 700 mm height in order to establish a uniform flow distribution two perforated pipes 35 mm in diameter covered by geo textile were used at the two ends bottom input and up output the average porosity of the packed container with glass beads was measured 0 37 the hydraulic conductivity was measured 38 88 m day the hydraulic conductivity was measured through primary test when a constant head was applied in both ends the value of longitudinal dispersion was estimated to be 0 0025 m from tracer experiments a non reactive food color blue with color code of e133 was made by mirzayi food industry seyrang nilgun was used as an optical tracer in all the experiments before all tests the filled container was prewashed with 20 l of 0 5 normal hcl and then washed through with distilled water until ph was confirmed in effluent equal with 7 2 2 tracer test after establishing a steady state flow condition in the container 30 ml of colored freshwater with 50 mg l concentration blue dye was injected into the porous media to characterize the movement of freshwater in the physical system by using the tracer test results values of longitudinal dispersion coefficient and its proportion to transverse and vertical dispersion coefficients were calculated the location of the injection point was approximately 20 cm above the bottom of the container and 25 cm from the right end of the container it took approximately 15 s to inject 30 ml of tracer at the rate of 0 002 ml s the transport of the tracer was recorded for about 45 min by a high resolution digital video camera 2 3 preparation of the slurry of iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with paa slurry of iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with paa was synthesized using previously reported methods golzar et al 2014ba b in this study 0 3 g of nanoparticles of fe3o4 and 0 6 g of poly acrylic acid were dissolved in 1000 ml of deionized water finally the concentration of slurry of iron oxide nanoparticle stabilized with paa was 300 mg l after finishing the experiment with tracer solution the container was washed for two times with the method mentioned before similar to the tracer test 30 ml of slurry of iron oxide nanoparticle stabilized with paa was injected separately into the system using the described procedure the video was recorded for a total time of 45 min to capture the movement of the nanoparticle plumes 2 4 image processing system in order to obtain empirical breakthrough curves in different points of the container the digital image processing concept was used two videos were recorded in a dark room at the time of injection and transport of the tracer and nanoparticle slurry the container was placed under a black shield so that in one side there was a light source with uniform distribution and in the other side there was the camera a sony hdr cx290e camera in order to create a uniform light source 6 fluorescent lamps of 600 mm length were installed on a board with a distance of 100 mm from each other the settings of dark room were arranged in a way that the camera received only the light passing through the test section the video was recorded concurrent with injection and movement of tracer solution or nanoparticle slurry fig 2a the recorded videos were converted to jpeg format frame by frame for further processes the interval of 30 s was selected and the km player 3 8 0 118 kmp plus software was employed to capture the frames by extracting the frames the procedure of concentration identification in different points of 2 d container in distinct times began through on digital image processing method in this method the margin spaces of each picture spaces out of the container frame were removed in order to reduce the computer process time and memory in the next step the extracted frames were analyzed and the tendency of color in each pixel was determined a matrix approach was used to assign each pixel to array of the matrix so the numerical values of matrix arrays showed the color concentration of pixel in each picture since the correlation between the color intensity and the concentration was per calculated an equation was derived to convert the value of color to the equation concentration of nanoparticles in the solution so the concentration of the nanoparticles tracer in all points at any time is determined a simple assumption of steady flow between sequent intervals the velocity of the flow and the nanoparticles tracer fluid in the test section could be calculated also as a result of this procedure the empirical breakthrough curve for any point in the container could be obtained in the transport experiments by using this method in three points of 10 20 and 30 cm above place of point of injection and on the symmetry axis of container empirical breakthrough curves were calculated fig 2b shows the position of these points which could be referred as observation wells in order to reach the concentration correction equation cce for experiment of tracer solution injection five tracer solutions of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l were injected into the 2 d porous media test section which the process was recorded after obtain 5 videos of injection tracer solutions with different concentrations one picture frame of the each video in certain time intervals 1 s was extracted by the km player plus software the maximum values of matrix elements an indication of the concentration in the injection point and the minimum values of matrix elements an indication of zero concentration were determined to obtain the equation of concentration correction for each experiment by placing these data in a 2 d coordinate system horizontal axis concentration of pixel read by the program vertical axis concentration of colored solution injected and by fitting a no linear equation the best concentration correction equation was obtained the same method was performed to obtain cce for slurry of iron oxide nanoparticle stabilized with poly acrylic acid so the slurries of nanoparticle with concentration of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l were injected into the 2 d porous media and the other above mentioned stages were repeated as well 2 5 modeling tracer and nanoparticle slurry transport processes computer modeling of the data sets obtained from the experiments described above requires the capability to solve both the groundwater flow and transport equations since the concentrations of tracer and slurry of nanoparticles were so low it was assumed that changes in the concentration field have no effect on density of the flow field thus as a result the flow and transport problems are solved independently in this study the visual modflow software was used for simulation of transport of tracer and slurry of nanoparticle the visual modflow use modflow2000 code to solve groundwater flow equations and the mt3dms code to solve the transport equations in simulation of tracer it is assumed that transport of tracer happened without adsorption and chemical reaction but in simulating transport of slurry of nanoparticles it is assumed that there was a non equilibrium adsorption the classical filtration theory cft in this theory detachment of the particle sticking to the surface of collector ingredients is neglected and without chemical reaction to perform the simulation in visual modflow it is necessary to enter some experimental information to the model for solving the equations of groundwater flow and transport numerically we chose a constant grid size 1 cm in our numerical model the model discretization and other general transport parameters are summarized in table 1 constant head boundaries 3 5 cm were specified for the cells in the last row of grid constant flux boundary condition was set up on the cells of the first row in the grid of the model wells with constant injection rate the number of wells is 50 and the rate for all the wells is equal to 0 02 of total rate of passing flow a boundary condition with constant flux was ascribed to a cell with peculiarities of x 0 195 m y 0 245 m to determine the entrance point of tracer solution also slurry of nanoparticle other boundaries upper and lower boundaries were considered as no flow boundaries three stress periods were employed to simulate 1 the initial steady state before injection 2 injection of tracer or nanoparticles in the porous media and 3 transport of tracer and nanoparticles through the porous media to obtain the steady state flow conditions the first stress period was run with above boundary conditions for 25 s the second stress period was run for 15 s during this period 30 ml of tracer or slurry of nanoparticles was injected into the porous media through a well assuming a constant flow rate of 2 ml s the well that injects tracer or slurry of nanoparticles to porous media was turned off in the third stress period to simulate the transport of tracer or nanoparticles regarding the short duration of injection and its failure to disrupt the condition in 2 d container all three stress periods of flow simulation 0 25 s 25 40s 40 2835 s were considered as permanent with time intervals of 10s and increasing coefficient of 1 2 the values for rate and operation time of the wells are presented in table 1 pcg solver was selected for the model modflow 2000 the model layer was considered as a confined layer zero type since the transport was highly advection dominated in these experiments the advection part of the transport equation was solved this technique helps to minimize numerical dispersion effects in the settings of mt3dms code the total variation diminishing tvd technique that it is a fine difference method was performed to solve the advection part of the transport equation zheng and wang 1999 simulation time was considered to be equal to the duration of each experiment 2835 s intervals of output obtaining were assumed to be 30 s the initial concentration in all areas of the model was equal to zero as mentioned earlier cft was used to simulate the transfer of nanoparticle therefore entering the two coefficients of attachment and detachment as inputs are necessary a great value was entered as an input for coefficient of detachment in order to neglect the second term of adsorption in this way the conditions of classic filtration theory are met but in case of attachment coefficient its real value was calculated calibration of the model is mandatory to calculate the real values of qualitative parameters such as dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient since the visual modflow is not able to calibrate the qualitative parameters manual calibration was performed to calculate these parameters in order to calculate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the results of trace experiment and in order to calculate the attachment coefficient the results of slurry experiment of nanoparticles were used respectively in manual calibration an initial value was set for the qualitative parameter then manual calibration through sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain the real values of parameters in this method the value of initial guess for longitudinal dispersion coefficient was multiplied by 0 5 0 75 1 1 5 and 2 regarding the new obtained values for longitudinal dispersion coefficient simulation of tracing solution transport was repeated and values for sum of squared errors were calculated longitudinal dispersion coefficient with the least value of sum of squared error was selected as the best value in order to calculate attachment coefficient the initial guess was multiplied by 0 8 0 9 1 1 1 and 1 2 regarding the new obtained values simulation of transport of slurry of nanoparticle was repeated and the values for sum of squared errors were calculated attachment coefficient with the least value of sum of squared error was selected as the best value finally simulation of tracer solution transport and slurry of nanoparticle transport were performed after calculation of the best values for attachment coefficient and longitudinal dispersion coefficient by using two numerical models modflow 2000 and mt3dms in the visual modflow software 3 results and discussion fig 3 show digital pictures of 2 d container during injection of tracer solution and injection of slurry of nanoparticle respectively the pictures of the first column time 0 min in fig 3 present the location of the plumes just before injection into porous media the other pictures in the figure were taken at 7 14 21 and 28 min for tracer experiment and 8 16 24 and 30 min for experiment of slurry of nanoparticle the pictures show the tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticles are dispersed and moved vertically and reached the exit boundary under influence of water flow as mentioned before image processing method was used to determine the concentration of tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticle during different time intervals in distinct points of container therefore the cce was calculated both experiments tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticles in fig 4 the data and diagrams collected form injection of tracer solution with different concentrations and slurry of nanoparticles with different concentrations are shown the experimental observations were simulated using the visiual modflow as previously stated longitudinal dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient were calculated through manual calibration based on sensitivity analysis a summary of calculations for the mentioned coefficients performed through manual calibration is presented in table 2 as seen the value 0 0025 m for longitudinal dispersion coefficient and value 4 79 10 5 l s for attachment coefficient had least squared error therefore these two values were chosen as the best values for longitudinal dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient the final simulations of tracer solution transport and nanoparticle slurry transport were performed based on these values the results the patterns of transport and breakthrough curves obtained from the numerical model are compared with the experimental results in figs 5 and 8 fig 5 compares transport pattern obtained from visual modflow with the tracer data and the results show that the model was able to capture the transport patterns very well fig 6 compares the breakthrough curves obtained from visual modflow with the breakthrough obtained from tracer experiment also the results show that model able to simulate the breakthrough curves very well fig 7 compares transport pattern obtained from visual modflow with the nanoparticle slurry transport data the figure shows that the numerical model was able to accurately predict the transport pattern of the plume these results indicate that our assumption of modeling nanoparticle slurry transport as an adsorption method based classical filtration theory was indeed correct fig 8 compares the breakthrough curves obtained from visual modflow with the breakthrough obtained from nanoparticle slurry experiment this figure shows that numerical model able to simulate the breakthrough curves very well finally these figures show the numerical model of mt3dms is able to simulate transports of tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticle moreover manual calibration has a desirable potential to calculate real values of longitudinal dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient 4 conclusion in brief from the findings of this study one can conclude that using image processing technique in identification of tracer concentration or slurry concentration inside the 2 d container filled with glass beads returnes reliable results also by using this useful method one can obtain concentration maps and empirical breakthrough curves in different points of the container therefore it can be used in other studies on transport of groundwater for example interference of fresh and salt water transport of soluble and suspended substances in groundwater under specific circumstances existence of barrier in the substrate of porous media moreover outcomes show using the results of tracer solution transport experiment is a considerable help for calculation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient due to the lack of absorption by substrate particles in porous media the other outcome that we can mention is those qualitative and quantitative groundwater simulator software such as visual modflow which are not able to estimate qualitative parameters using manual calibration based on sensitivity analysis method can be a great help for calculation of real values for attachment coefficient and dispersion coefficient our modeling results show that the numerical model of mt3dms available in visual modflow is able to simulate transport of nanoparticle slurry iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with poly acrylic acid under conditions of classical filtration theory of colloids a specific case of first order kinetic non equilibrium adsorption mechanism this method of simulation in visual modflow made a desirable adjustment between the calculation and empirical results for 1 d 2 d and 3 d porous media however it is necessary to consider that the physical and chemical heterogeneities innately present in field soils can effect on filtration and clogging of the nanoparticles hence before any field scale nanoparticles injection experiments cautiously designed feasibility studies should be completed using site soils acknowledgement this work was conducted in the nanofluids in porous media laboratory of shahrood university of technology shahrood iran the authors are thankful to

be conceptually modeled as a density driven conservative plume in addition to nzvi iron oxide nanoparticles can be used in remedial processes for polluted soil and groundwater although iron oxide nanoparticles have less reactivity than nzvi they can still be employed as pollution absorbers slurry of iron oxide nanoparticles was successfully employed for removal of methylene blue and bromelain mak and chen 2004 chen and huang 2009 hu et al have used iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 in order to remove cr vi from an aqueous media through absorption processes hu et al 2005 babakhani et al 2015 used carboxymethyl cellulose and polystyrene sulfonate modified nzvi to study the aggregation and transport of nanoparticles experimentally and numerically in one dimensional model the results then extended to simulate a 2 d case recently some new approaches used to explain the phenomena more explicitly babakhani et al 2017a 2017b in this study it was hypothesized that two dimensional physical models can be used to unravel the multidimensional transport dynamics of stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles moreover due to low concentration of the slurry of stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles it is not influenced by small density gradients a novel experimental setup was used to measure the concentration of nanoparticles in different points of porous media the two dimensional transport data of stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles was used to demonstrate the efficiency of the stabilization process it was hypothesized that the attachment is only surfaced so the advection dispersion equation based on the classical colloid filtration theory cft was used to simulate experiments finally the numerical model visual modflow was employed to test whether the theory is able to simulate the transport of nanoparticles in porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the chemicals used in these experiments were of laboratory grade iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 were obtained from pasteur institute of iran with average particle size of 44 5 nm and 99 5 purity golzar et al 2014a poly acrylic acid paa mean m w 1 8 kg mol was obtained from sigma aldrich company golzar et al 2014b the porous media selected for this study was glass beads obtained from iran glass beads company the mean diameter of these glass beads was 1 5 mm with a variation of 0 01 mm these experiments were conducted in a two dimensional flow container as shown in fig 1 the dimensions of the flow container are 35 mm thickness 500 mm width 700 mm height in order to establish a uniform flow distribution two perforated pipes 35 mm in diameter covered by geo textile were used at the two ends bottom input and up output the average porosity of the packed container with glass beads was measured 0 37 the hydraulic conductivity was measured 38 88 m day the hydraulic conductivity was measured through primary test when a constant head was applied in both ends the value of longitudinal dispersion was estimated to be 0 0025 m from tracer experiments a non reactive food color blue with color code of e133 was made by mirzayi food industry seyrang nilgun was used as an optical tracer in all the experiments before all tests the filled container was prewashed with 20 l of 0 5 normal hcl and then washed through with distilled water until ph was confirmed in effluent equal with 7 2 2 tracer test after establishing a steady state flow condition in the container 30 ml of colored freshwater with 50 mg l concentration blue dye was injected into the porous media to characterize the movement of freshwater in the physical system by using the tracer test results values of longitudinal dispersion coefficient and its proportion to transverse and vertical dispersion coefficients were calculated the location of the injection point was approximately 20 cm above the bottom of the container and 25 cm from the right end of the container it took approximately 15 s to inject 30 ml of tracer at the rate of 0 002 ml s the transport of the tracer was recorded for about 45 min by a high resolution digital video camera 2 3 preparation of the slurry of iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with paa slurry of iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with paa was synthesized using previously reported methods golzar et al 2014ba b in this study 0 3 g of nanoparticles of fe3o4 and 0 6 g of poly acrylic acid were dissolved in 1000 ml of deionized water finally the concentration of slurry of iron oxide nanoparticle stabilized with paa was 300 mg l after finishing the experiment with tracer solution the container was washed for two times with the method mentioned before similar to the tracer test 30 ml of slurry of iron oxide nanoparticle stabilized with paa was injected separately into the system using the described procedure the video was recorded for a total time of 45 min to capture the movement of the nanoparticle plumes 2 4 image processing system in order to obtain empirical breakthrough curves in different points of the container the digital image processing concept was used two videos were recorded in a dark room at the time of injection and transport of the tracer and nanoparticle slurry the container was placed under a black shield so that in one side there was a light source with uniform distribution and in the other side there was the camera a sony hdr cx290e camera in order to create a uniform light source 6 fluorescent lamps of 600 mm length were installed on a board with a distance of 100 mm from each other the settings of dark room were arranged in a way that the camera received only the light passing through the test section the video was recorded concurrent with injection and movement of tracer solution or nanoparticle slurry fig 2a the recorded videos were converted to jpeg format frame by frame for further processes the interval of 30 s was selected and the km player 3 8 0 118 kmp plus software was employed to capture the frames by extracting the frames the procedure of concentration identification in different points of 2 d container in distinct times began through on digital image processing method in this method the margin spaces of each picture spaces out of the container frame were removed in order to reduce the computer process time and memory in the next step the extracted frames were analyzed and the tendency of color in each pixel was determined a matrix approach was used to assign each pixel to array of the matrix so the numerical values of matrix arrays showed the color concentration of pixel in each picture since the correlation between the color intensity and the concentration was per calculated an equation was derived to convert the value of color to the equation concentration of nanoparticles in the solution so the concentration of the nanoparticles tracer in all points at any time is determined a simple assumption of steady flow between sequent intervals the velocity of the flow and the nanoparticles tracer fluid in the test section could be calculated also as a result of this procedure the empirical breakthrough curve for any point in the container could be obtained in the transport experiments by using this method in three points of 10 20 and 30 cm above place of point of injection and on the symmetry axis of container empirical breakthrough curves were calculated fig 2b shows the position of these points which could be referred as observation wells in order to reach the concentration correction equation cce for experiment of tracer solution injection five tracer solutions of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l were injected into the 2 d porous media test section which the process was recorded after obtain 5 videos of injection tracer solutions with different concentrations one picture frame of the each video in certain time intervals 1 s was extracted by the km player plus software the maximum values of matrix elements an indication of the concentration in the injection point and the minimum values of matrix elements an indication of zero concentration were determined to obtain the equation of concentration correction for each experiment by placing these data in a 2 d coordinate system horizontal axis concentration of pixel read by the program vertical axis concentration of colored solution injected and by fitting a no linear equation the best concentration correction equation was obtained the same method was performed to obtain cce for slurry of iron oxide nanoparticle stabilized with poly acrylic acid so the slurries of nanoparticle with concentration of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l were injected into the 2 d porous media and the other above mentioned stages were repeated as well 2 5 modeling tracer and nanoparticle slurry transport processes computer modeling of the data sets obtained from the experiments described above requires the capability to solve both the groundwater flow and transport equations since the concentrations of tracer and slurry of nanoparticles were so low it was assumed that changes in the concentration field have no effect on density of the flow field thus as a result the flow and transport problems are solved independently in this study the visual modflow software was used for simulation of transport of tracer and slurry of nanoparticle the visual modflow use modflow2000 code to solve groundwater flow equations and the mt3dms code to solve the transport equations in simulation of tracer it is assumed that transport of tracer happened without adsorption and chemical reaction but in simulating transport of slurry of nanoparticles it is assumed that there was a non equilibrium adsorption the classical filtration theory cft in this theory detachment of the particle sticking to the surface of collector ingredients is neglected and without chemical reaction to perform the simulation in visual modflow it is necessary to enter some experimental information to the model for solving the equations of groundwater flow and transport numerically we chose a constant grid size 1 cm in our numerical model the model discretization and other general transport parameters are summarized in table 1 constant head boundaries 3 5 cm were specified for the cells in the last row of grid constant flux boundary condition was set up on the cells of the first row in the grid of the model wells with constant injection rate the number of wells is 50 and the rate for all the wells is equal to 0 02 of total rate of passing flow a boundary condition with constant flux was ascribed to a cell with peculiarities of x 0 195 m y 0 245 m to determine the entrance point of tracer solution also slurry of nanoparticle other boundaries upper and lower boundaries were considered as no flow boundaries three stress periods were employed to simulate 1 the initial steady state before injection 2 injection of tracer or nanoparticles in the porous media and 3 transport of tracer and nanoparticles through the porous media to obtain the steady state flow conditions the first stress period was run with above boundary conditions for 25 s the second stress period was run for 15 s during this period 30 ml of tracer or slurry of nanoparticles was injected into the porous media through a well assuming a constant flow rate of 2 ml s the well that injects tracer or slurry of nanoparticles to porous media was turned off in the third stress period to simulate the transport of tracer or nanoparticles regarding the short duration of injection and its failure to disrupt the condition in 2 d container all three stress periods of flow simulation 0 25 s 25 40s 40 2835 s were considered as permanent with time intervals of 10s and increasing coefficient of 1 2 the values for rate and operation time of the wells are presented in table 1 pcg solver was selected for the model modflow 2000 the model layer was considered as a confined layer zero type since the transport was highly advection dominated in these experiments the advection part of the transport equation was solved this technique helps to minimize numerical dispersion effects in the settings of mt3dms code the total variation diminishing tvd technique that it is a fine difference method was performed to solve the advection part of the transport equation zheng and wang 1999 simulation time was considered to be equal to the duration of each experiment 2835 s intervals of output obtaining were assumed to be 30 s the initial concentration in all areas of the model was equal to zero as mentioned earlier cft was used to simulate the transfer of nanoparticle therefore entering the two coefficients of attachment and detachment as inputs are necessary a great value was entered as an input for coefficient of detachment in order to neglect the second term of adsorption in this way the conditions of classic filtration theory are met but in case of attachment coefficient its real value was calculated calibration of the model is mandatory to calculate the real values of qualitative parameters such as dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient since the visual modflow is not able to calibrate the qualitative parameters manual calibration was performed to calculate these parameters in order to calculate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the results of trace experiment and in order to calculate the attachment coefficient the results of slurry experiment of nanoparticles were used respectively in manual calibration an initial value was set for the qualitative parameter then manual calibration through sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain the real values of parameters in this method the value of initial guess for longitudinal dispersion coefficient was multiplied by 0 5 0 75 1 1 5 and 2 regarding the new obtained values for longitudinal dispersion coefficient simulation of tracing solution transport was repeated and values for sum of squared errors were calculated longitudinal dispersion coefficient with the least value of sum of squared error was selected as the best value in order to calculate attachment coefficient the initial guess was multiplied by 0 8 0 9 1 1 1 and 1 2 regarding the new obtained values simulation of transport of slurry of nanoparticle was repeated and the values for sum of squared errors were calculated attachment coefficient with the least value of sum of squared error was selected as the best value finally simulation of tracer solution transport and slurry of nanoparticle transport were performed after calculation of the best values for attachment coefficient and longitudinal dispersion coefficient by using two numerical models modflow 2000 and mt3dms in the visual modflow software 3 results and discussion fig 3 show digital pictures of 2 d container during injection of tracer solution and injection of slurry of nanoparticle respectively the pictures of the first column time 0 min in fig 3 present the location of the plumes just before injection into porous media the other pictures in the figure were taken at 7 14 21 and 28 min for tracer experiment and 8 16 24 and 30 min for experiment of slurry of nanoparticle the pictures show the tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticles are dispersed and moved vertically and reached the exit boundary under influence of water flow as mentioned before image processing method was used to determine the concentration of tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticle during different time intervals in distinct points of container therefore the cce was calculated both experiments tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticles in fig 4 the data and diagrams collected form injection of tracer solution with different concentrations and slurry of nanoparticles with different concentrations are shown the experimental observations were simulated using the visiual modflow as previously stated longitudinal dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient were calculated through manual calibration based on sensitivity analysis a summary of calculations for the mentioned coefficients performed through manual calibration is presented in table 2 as seen the value 0 0025 m for longitudinal dispersion coefficient and value 4 79 10 5 l s for attachment coefficient had least squared error therefore these two values were chosen as the best values for longitudinal dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient the final simulations of tracer solution transport and nanoparticle slurry transport were performed based on these values the results the patterns of transport and breakthrough curves obtained from the numerical model are compared with the experimental results in figs 5 and 8 fig 5 compares transport pattern obtained from visual modflow with the tracer data and the results show that the model was able to capture the transport patterns very well fig 6 compares the breakthrough curves obtained from visual modflow with the breakthrough obtained from tracer experiment also the results show that model able to simulate the breakthrough curves very well fig 7 compares transport pattern obtained from visual modflow with the nanoparticle slurry transport data the figure shows that the numerical model was able to accurately predict the transport pattern of the plume these results indicate that our assumption of modeling nanoparticle slurry transport as an adsorption method based classical filtration theory was indeed correct fig 8 compares the breakthrough curves obtained from visual modflow with the breakthrough obtained from nanoparticle slurry experiment this figure shows that numerical model able to simulate the breakthrough curves very well finally these figures show the numerical model of mt3dms is able to simulate transports of tracer solution and slurry of nanoparticle moreover manual calibration has a desirable potential to calculate real values of longitudinal dispersion coefficient and attachment coefficient 4 conclusion in brief from the findings of this study one can conclude that using image processing technique in identification of tracer concentration or slurry concentration inside the 2 d container filled with glass beads returnes reliable results also by using this useful method one can obtain concentration maps and empirical breakthrough curves in different points of the container therefore it can be used in other studies on transport of groundwater for example interference of fresh and salt water transport of soluble and suspended substances in groundwater under specific circumstances existence of barrier in the substrate of porous media moreover outcomes show using the results of tracer solution transport experiment is a considerable help for calculation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient due to the lack of absorption by substrate particles in porous media the other outcome that we can mention is those qualitative and quantitative groundwater simulator software such as visual modflow which are not able to estimate qualitative parameters using manual calibration based on sensitivity analysis method can be a great help for calculation of real values for attachment coefficient and dispersion coefficient our modeling results show that the numerical model of mt3dms available in visual modflow is able to simulate transport of nanoparticle slurry iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with poly acrylic acid under conditions of classical filtration theory of colloids a specific case of first order kinetic non equilibrium adsorption mechanism this method of simulation in visual modflow made a desirable adjustment between the calculation and empirical results for 1 d 2 d and 3 d porous media however it is necessary to consider that the physical and chemical heterogeneities innately present in field soils can effect on filtration and clogging of the nanoparticles hence before any field scale nanoparticles injection experiments cautiously designed feasibility studies should be completed using site soils acknowledgement this work was conducted in the nanofluids in porous media laboratory of shahrood university of technology shahrood iran the authors are thankful to
