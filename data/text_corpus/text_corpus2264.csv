11320,in temperate climatic regions agricultural production depends on precipitation amount and its distribution during the growing season a 3 year field study was conducted to investigate the effects of different irrigation regimes on yield parameters and water productivity of sprinkler irrigated soybean glycine max l merr grown under wet semi dry and dry conditions in a temperate environment four irrigation levels were applied full irrigation i100 65 and 40 of full irrigation i65 and i40 and non irrigated control i0 on average the i0 treatment resulted in the highest harvest index hi and i100 produced the lowest hi a significant quadratic correlation between seed yield and crop water use was observed in dry and semi dry year the irrigation regime significantly influenced seed yield and water use i65 treatment produced the highest seed yield 3 69 t ha 1 and showed the highest water productivity wp 0 90 kg m 3 and irrigation wp 1 08 kg m 3 the present study indicated that irrigation is necessary for soybean cultivation in semi dry and dry years i e when seasonal precipitation is lower than about 300 mm in wet years with a favourable amount and distribution of precipitation during the growing season yields are similar to those achieved with irrigation and high et values of soybean are attributable to increased evaporation keywords evapotranspiration agricultural water management glycine max l merr water productivity yield composition 1 introduction temperate climate is characterized by large variability of weather parameters at most places agriculture depends on precipitation its amount and distribution vary from year to year and during growing seasons which causes instability of production and reduces farmers revenue therefore supplemental irrigation is needed to increase and stabilise agricultural production especially during the precipitation scarce seasons vojvodina is located in a temperate climatic zone of the pannonian plain in the northern part of the republic of serbia agricultural production is prevalently rain fed although it is one of priority economic sectors nevertheless in this region as in many similar regions around the world the availability of freshwater resources for agricultural use has been decreasing due to climate change and increasing demand of other sectors drought affects soybean growth and productivity in many parts of the world hatfield and prueger 2011 steduto et al 2012 sentelhas et al 2015 water stress is principally harmful during flowering seed setting and seed filling the research findings indicated that limited supplemental irrigation during the course of growing season or in a specific growth stage can significantly increase water productivity wp and soybean yields giménez et al 2017 jha et al 2018 response to irrigation depends on climate rainfall pattern during growing season soil properties cultivar agronomic practices and experimental procedures limited irrigation can result in substantial differentiation of crop productivity in various environments djaman et al 2013 akcay and dagdelen 2016 reported that deficit irrigation may support the water saving irrigation programs under conditions of water scarcity they stated that effective on farm implementation of deficit irrigation might improve crop productivity when the data about crop yield response to water inputs are available knowledge of crop response to water stress over the growing season is useful also in crop growth modelling enabling both improved prediction of crop performance in different situations and adoption of water saving management practices in the vojvodina region soybean is one of the main field crops grown prevalently under rain fed conditions in the recent years irrigation is becoming a common practice due to variable precipitation pattern and frequent drought caused by climate change however information is lacking on the impact of different irrigation levels on soybean yield and water productivity under different precipitation patterns consequently the objective of this study is to compare the effects of three irrigation treatments and non irrigated treatment on the growth yield and water productivity of soybean grown under different precipitation conditions in a temperate climatic region these data can be useful for soybean industry and the regional soybean growers to maximize the seed yield and productivity of water use through the selection of appropriate irrigation scheduling strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experiment set up field experiments were carried out during three growing seasons 2006 2007 2008 at maize research institute zemun polje vojvodina serbia 44 52 n 20 20 e 81 m above sea level the soil is classified as silty loam calcaric chernozem up to 0 60 m plant available water holding capacity to this depth difference between 0 03 and 1 5 mpa is 118 mm the main chemical and physical characteristics of the soil in the study area are shown in table 1 the experimental area is characterized by a mild temperate climate with hot and dry summers the long term 30 years average annual precipitation is 638 mm with a notable inter and intra seasonal variability in amount and distribution pattern the long term average air temperature is 11 9 c the air temperature precipitation humidity and wind speed data were taken from surčin meteorological station table 2 rain fed farming and occasional irrigations are the main production system in the study area the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four treatments and four replications the following irrigation regimes were applied i100 i65 i40 and i0 closely corresponding to no water deficiency treatment full irrigation 65 of full irrigation 35 deficit 40 of full irrigation 60 deficit and non irrigated rain fed in i100 treatment the irrigation events replenished fully water depleted by evapotranspiration up to the field capacity fc in i40 and i65 treatments the irrigation amounts referred to approximately 40 and 65 of i100 amount the irrigation rates and timings were determined following the soil water content in the effective root zone depth going up to 0 60 m in all irrigated treatments irrigation was practiced when soil water content reached approximately 50 of total available water the difference in soil water storage between field capacity and wilting point full irrigation treatment includes the reservoir fulfillment up to water content at field capacity whereas in the treatments i65 and i40 65 and 40 of full irrigation amounts were applied the irrigation rates and time were determined depending on the soil water content in the effective root zone depth to 0 60 m irrigation events were stopped two to three weeks before harvesting irrigations were applied with the hand move sprinkler irrigation system sprinklers heads with two nozzles mounted at 2 0 m were organized in 12 m 12 m square grid operating pressure was about 3 50 mpa with a discharge of 0 41 l s 1 irrigation started on 11 july and 10 july in the first two seasons 2006 and 2007 respectively and on 4 june in the third season the last seasonal irrigations were applied in the third decade of july and in the third and second decade of august in the first second and third growing season respectively each experimental plot was designed 7 14 m long and 8 0 m wide 57 12 m2 to minimize irrigation edge effects the inter plot space was 2 0 m soybean cv nena maturity group ii obtained from the maize research institute zemun polje company was sown on 28 april 2006 24 april 2007 and 6 may 2008 in 0 50 m wide rows at a seeding rate of 4 45 seed m 2 the crop was fertilized at the recommended rate based on soil tests with 450 kg ha 1 of npk 15 15 15 before sowing and a further nitrogen dose of 69 kg ha 1 was added as urea when the plants were 25 30 cm in height weeds pests and diseases were adequately controlled only the irrigation management differed between the treatments 2 2 crop and yield sampling seed yield was measured by harvesting an area of 5 0 m2 per plot hand harvest took place on 19 18 and 15 october respectively for 2006 2007 and 2008 seed yield was normalized for 13 seed water concentration harvest index was determined as seed yield divided by the total aboveground biomass after drying the samples at 65 c 2 3 soil water and crop evapotranspiration soil water content was measured periodically throughout the growing seasons using gravimetrical method at different depth starting at 0 10 m at sowing and going down to 0 60 m at flowering and hence after the measurements were based on the conventional oven dry mass gravimetrical water content was converted to volumetric water content after multiplying it by the bulk density soil bulk density was measured at the beginning of each crop season at 0 10 m interval depths up to 0 60 m actual crop evapotranspiration or total water consumption eta mm of each plot was calculated according to sincik et al 2008 1 eta p i cr dp rf δs where p is the rainfall in the growth period mm i is the amount of net irrigation water applied to individual plots mm cr is capillary rise of water from below the root zone mm rf is the surface runoff mm dp is the water lost through deep percolation mm and δs is the cumulative change in the soil water storage between planting and harvest within the effective crop root zone mm irrigation scheduling was based on the soil water balance method and gravimetric soil water content measurements in eq 1 cr was assumed to be zero because the water table was at 80 m depth deep percolation was ignored because soil water content measurements showed that no water percolated below 100 cm depth the run off and run on was also assumed to be zero because the field was flat and the irrigation volume per application was less than or equal to fc 2 4 yield and water productivity assessment water productivity wp kg m 3 and irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 were determined to evaluate the productivity of different water regimes these indices were calculated as sincik et al 2008 2 wp y eta 3 iwp yi yo i where y is the seed yield kg ha 1 eta is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm calculated from eq 1 yi is the irrigated treatment seed yield kg ha 1 yo is the rain fed seed yield kg ha 1 and i is the seasonal amount of irrigation water applied mm 2 5 statistical analysis data were subjected to an over year analysis of variance anova as a randomised complete block design with four replications analysis was conducted using ibm spss 20 statistical package and the means were compared using the fisher s least significant difference lsd test at 5 significance level the relationship between seed yield and crop evapotranspiration еtа was evaluated using regression analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during the growing period the first growing season was cooler and wetter than the other two seasons table 2 the average temperature during the first growing season was slightly lower than the long term mean temperature of 18 6 c the average temperatures during the second and third seasons were higher than the long term mean temperature the three investigated growing seasons were characterized as wet season 2006 dry season 2007 and very dry season 2008 with 108 73 and 58 of the long term mean precipitation respectively the first growing season was wet with rainfall 100 mm in june and august much higher than the long term average rainfall was unevenly distributed and irrigation was applied in each year except in the first season in the i40 treatment table 3 3 2 applied irrigation water and seasonal water consumption the total amount of irrigation water varied depending on the seasons and irrigation treatments the differences between three seasons were due to change in the amount and pattern of precipitation table 3 in the first growing season rainfall was particularly abundant in june full irrigation was only 60 mm i e it was more than two times less than in 2007 135 mm and almost four times less than in 2008 235 mm a similar difference in the total amount of irrigation water applied in different years was observed also for other treatments the differences were due to the amount and pattern of precipitation fig 1 in general the lower humidity and higher air temperature resulted in greater demand of water for soybean crop the seasonal crop evapotranspiration eta increased with the increase in the irrigation volume table 3 the highest soybean seasonal eta 461 mm on average was observed in the i100 treatment other treatments subjected to severe water deficits had lower eta the lowest eta was recorded in the rain fed treatment 326 mm on average high precipitation in the first growing season limited irrigation inputs and did not allow a wide variation of eta which ranged from 440 mm in rain fed to 505 mm in full irrigation treatment similarities in eta between irrigation treatments were found for the second and the third growing season the eta was the lowest in the dry 2008 growing season ranging from 227 mm in rain fed to 450 mm in full irrigation treatment according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 estimated eta for maximum production in soybean is between 450 mm and 700 mm depending on the length of growing period cultivar soil conditions and climate sincik et al 2008 observed soya bean eta of 821 471 634 and 373 mm for full irrigated deficit irrigated and dry land plants respectively in the conditions of bursa turkey suyker and verma 2009 reported eta of 431 mm and 452 mm for rain fed and irrigated soybean respectively in eastern nebarska 3 3 soil water content fig 1 shows the soil water content dynamics of each treatment in the top 0 60 m of the crop root zone during three growing seasons of soybean the differences between the treatments augmented with the reduction of seasonal precipitation and with the increase of irrigation requirements in the case of irrigated treatments the soil water content was almost always above the threshold level fixed to 50 depletion of total available water the greatest variation of soil water content was observed for i0 treatment in wet year soil water content of rain fed treatment was similar to the irrigated treatments except a slight deviation in july which corresponded to flowering and pod formation periods in other two years water stress started earlier it was prolonged for more than 60 days and soil water content has reached almost the level of wilting point 3 4 aboveground biomass yield as expected the i0 treatment had the lowest aboveground biomass yield due to water stress which was especially severe in dry third season table 4 no significant differences in aboveground biomass yield were found between i40 and i0 treatments in wet first season the lower irrigation amount for the i40 treatment contributed to lower aboveground biomass compared to i65 and i100 the results indicated that lower irrigation level in i65 and i40 treatments significantly inhibited soybean growth if compared to that in i100 in irrigated and rain fed treatments the aboveground biomass varied from 8 09 to 11 64 t ha 1 and from 5 91 to 8 00 t ha 1 respectively overall the aboveground biomass yields were 2 73 greater in irrigated compared to non irrigated plots depending on the growing season and treatment a similar effect of irrigation on aboveground biomass yield was observed by other researchers karam et al 2005 sincik et al 2008 jha et al 2018 3 5 seed yield results obtained in this study showed that irrigation treatments significantly affected seed yield in each of three growing seasons table 4 the seed yields were the highest during the first wet season in respect to two drier growing seasons all irrigated treatments significantly increased yield compared with the rain fed treatment therefore limited precipitation and the reduced soil water content were the main factors limiting seed yields of soybean in the vojvodina region on average treatment i65 had the greatest seed yield 3 69 t ha 1 followed by i100 and i40 irrigated treatments with 3 32 and 2 97 t ha 1 respectively the possible factors involved in low yield under high irrigation treatment are excessive crop growth during the vegetative stage and poor soil aeration huang et al 2002 the i0 treatment had the lowest seed yield soybean yields were the most responsive to irrigation in the third dry growing season the triennial impact of irrigated treatments on yield led to an increase in seed yield by 28 42 and 15 for i100 i65 and i40 respectively average 29 compared with the i0 non irrigated treatment although i65 irrigation treatments received about 50 41 and 32 less irrigation water in respect to the i100 plots the seed yield was increased by an average of 13 3 2 9 and 19 3 in 2006 2007 and 2008 season respectively as compared to i100 table 4 there were no statistically significant differences in seed yield between the i40 and i0 in the first wet year because of adequate precipitation during the growing season in addition there were no statistically significant differences between the i100 and i65 treatments in the second growing season consequently the difference in seed yield between the growing seasons could result from the rainfall amount and distribution and elevated air temperatures and increased evapotranspiration demand the results of present study are in agreement with those reported by eck et al 1987 and karam et al 2005 they have found significant decrease in seed yield due to water stress sincik et al 2008 reported a significant effect of limited irrigation on seed yield of soybean koivisto et al 2003 stated that significant differences in soybean performance between two experimental years were due to differences in the environmental conditions of the united kingdom the findings of present study do not correspond to those of payero et al 2005 who reported that irrigation treatments had only statistically significant effect on the yield in the two driest seasons 2002 and 2003 under semi arid conditions of west central nebraska 3 6 harvest index harvest index hi had irregular variation from i100 to i40 plots table 4 irrigation regimes had significantly different effects on hi in all three growing seasons but there was no significant difference between the irrigated treatments in the second season and between the i65 and i40 treatments in the first wet growing season on average the i0 treatment resulted in the highest harvest index and i100 produced the lowest hi in the present study harvest index increased slightly on average while the seasonal irrigation volume decreased hi of irrigated treatments was 3 7 lower compared to i0 sincik et al 2008 observed irregular variation of hi and reported that hi tended to be higher in non irrigated treatments pedersen and lauer 2004 found that irrigation lowered hi by 2 on average in contrast to the present study garcia y garcia et al 2010 found that different irrigation regimes did not affect harvest index of soybean in a humid region of the south eastern usa in addition demirtas et al 2010 stated that hi of drip irrigated soybean was not affected by drought stress in a sub humid environment of turkey 3 7 water productivity and irrigation water productivity the wp values for sprinkler irrigated soybean varied considerably with irrigation treatment in all three experimental seasons especially during the driest third growing season table 5 the wp of irrigated treatments did not show consistent difference with decreasing applied irrigation water the wp of i65 was the highest in all seasons and it was on average greater by 13 than wp of non irrigated treatments however the i100 treatment had a wp value 10 lower than the non irrigated one the wp tended to be higher in moderately humid second season no significant difference was found between non irrigated treatment and i100 and i40 treatments in the first wet growing season the i65 treatment resulted in the highest wp in all three growing seasons which means that on average in the i65 treatment more seed mass was produced per mm of water compared with the i40 and i100 treatments the wp of i100 and i40 were on average 24 and 14 less than in the i65 treatment respectively these results are in agreement with those of burriro et al 2002 and sincik et al 2008 on the contrary sincik et al 2008 and demirtas et al 2010 reported remarkably lower wp values from 0 46 to 0 58 kg m 3 and from 0 41 to 0 64 kg m 3 respectively of deficit irrigated soybean in a sub humid region of turkey katerji et al 2008 quoted wp values of 0 39 0 77 kg m 3 for three studies in mediterranean environment only the results obtained by katerji and mastrorilli 2009 with wp values of 0 73 clay soil and 0 81 kg m 3 loam soil are comparable to those of the present study nevertheless eck et al 1987 observed that applying water deficit did not increase seasonal water productivity of soybean in environmental conditions of the southern high plains of the usa they also noted that moderately stressed or unstressed treatments had higher wp than those with severe water stress irrigation treatments influenced iwp much more than wp in the present study iwp showed irregular variation from i40 to i100 but tended to be higher in i65 treatment table 5 there was significant variation in iwp between experimental seasons the difference of average iwp between the treatments in the same growing season was smaller than that between the seasons in the same treatment large variation of iwp was found as a result of significant differences in applied irrigation water across growing seasons therefore the relatively wet first season resulted in significantly higher iwp values compared to the other two growing seasons the lower iwp in the last two seasons may be attributed the lower precipitation than in the wet season the lowest iwp was obtained from treatment i100 in all three growing seasons the iwp values observed in the i65 treatments were significantly higher than those observed in i100 and i40 treatments in all three growing seasons hence it can be concluded that i65 irrigation could be adequate strategy for soybean production in the vojvodina region the iwp values from this study were higher than those reported in many other studies evett et al 2000 sincik et al 2008 demirtas et al 2010 however the iwp values observed in this study are in agreement with those of garcia y garcia et al 2010 who reported iwp for sprinkler irrigated soybean ranging from 0 55 to 1 15 kg m 3 in a humid region of usa indeed it has often been considered that irrigation in humid zones is more efficient than irrigation in the arid regions because the lower water vapour deficit of the humid regions results in higher transpiration efficiency than in the arid climates tanner and sinclair 1983 3 8 relationships between seed yield and seasonal water consumption the results of regression analysis between the seed yield and seasonal crop evapotranspiration eta showed quadratic relationship r2 0 6486 for all irrigation regimes and for all three growing seasons fig 2 therefore there is an optimal water application amount to maximize the effectiveness of irrigation on increasing grain yield above the rain fed yields similarly to these results an exponential relationship between soybean seed yield and seasonal eta was observed by demirtas et al 2010 in the sub humid environmental conditions in turkey in contrast to the present study linear relationships between crop evapotranspiration and soybean yield were reported by payero et al 2005 and kirnak et al 2010 for semi arid environment of west central nebraska and the semi arid harran plain in turkey respectively in nebraska schneekloth et al 1991 found a linear relationship between seed yield and eta most investigations pointed out a strong linear correlation between seasonal eta and soybean yield however the slope of the regression line varied considerably between studies moreover other forms of relationship e g exponential quadratic between crop yield and eta are reported this may be attributed to the impact of different factors such as differences in seasonal precipitation amount its frequency and temporal distribution crop varieties soil properties adopted irrigation method and scheduling and other weather parameters and agronomic management practices 3 9 effect of seasonal precipitation on soybean growth the results of the present study indicated that seasonal precipitation and its distribution throughout the growing season play a significant role in irrigation needs wp and yield of soybean in the wet 2006 season precipitation was nearly enough for achieving yields comparable to those with irrigation treatments the longest dry period in 2006 was 19 days in august but it was between two substantial rainfall events 25 and 20 mm as such an increase in crop et by irrigation did not contribute to increase soybean seed yield relative to the yield of the rain fed control instead the increase of crop et was due to increased soil evaporation in 2006 and 2007 the first water deficits were noted in the pre flowering period in all treatments however contrary to the wet year 2006 the amount of precipitation in the semi dry year 2007 began to decrease in the pre flowering period in july and august of 2006 the amount of precipitation was 136 mm whereas in 2007 it was only 71 mm therefore in 2007 water deficit was compensated by irrigation in the dry year 2008 the amount of precipitation during the vegetative growth may june of soybean was 76 mm much lower than in the semi dry year 2007 and especially in the wet year 2006 in which the amount of precipitation was 105 mm and 177 mm respectively for that reason the irrigation in the driest year 2008 began 35 days earlier than in other two years 120 mm of water was added in the i100 treatment and 50 mm in the i65 treatment in 2008 the amount of precipitation for the remainder of the season was similar to that in 2007 in 2006 the irrigation depth of the treatments varied from approximately 39 to 60 mm these irrigation depths accounted for 8 12 of the seasonal water requirement eta in 2007 and 2008 irrigation accounted for 17 32 and 28 52 of the total seasonal eta of soybean respectively in 2006 the final waterings in treatments i65 and i100 were applied around the middle of the third decade of july in the semi dry year 2007 the final waterings were applied at the beginning of the third decade of july and in the dry year 2008 in the first decade of august in treatments i100 and i65 and in the middle of the second decade of august in treatment i40 the differences between irrigation treatments also included a difference in seasonal eta values between the wet year 2006 and other two years the seasonal eta under deficit irrigation conditions varied among the treatments and growing seasons depending on the total amount of water available to the crop and prevailing weather conditions table 3 the seasonal values of eta of the treatments varied over a broad range from 440 to 505 mm in 2006 308 427 mm in 2007 and 227 450 mm in 2008 the presented data indicated that the difference between i100 and the non irrigated treatment was the smallest in the wet year it was only 65 mm in 2007 and 2008 this difference was 119 and 223 mm respectively in addition despite the fact that the growing season in 2006 was colder and wetter than in 2007 and 2008 the seasonal values of eta of the different treatments were higher in 2006 the high eta values in 2006 are attributable to increased evaporation due to frequent wetting of the soil by precipitation the results of the present study indicate that in such wet years no crop irrigation of soybean is needed in a temperate environment fig 3 shows the correlation between the above ground biomass and eta for all treatments in the dry years 2007 and 2008 the correlation r2 0 7641 established for the dry years is much stronger than when all the three study years are viewed together r2 0 4553 fig 4 shows a good quadratic correlation r2 0 8573 between soybean seed yield and above ground biomass in the dry growing seasons 2007 and 2008 however the quadratic correlation is much weaker when the data on all the three growing seasons are combined r2 0 6459 the soybean seed yield exhibited a quadratic correlation fig 5 with the total seasonal amount of irrigation water in the dry years 2007 and 2008 which implied that there is an optimal water application amount to maximize the effectiveness of irrigation water on increasing grain yield above rain fed yields the quadratic model in the present study also indicated that the soybean seed yield peaked at about 120 mm of overall seasonal irrigation and that it began to decrease with larger seasonal amounts of water hence in the dry years 2007 and 2008 eta reached about 380 mm which ensured the highest yield with irrigation of up to 120 mm this means that for soybean grown in temperate conditions two waterings of 60 mm each might be sufficient and three of 40 mm are even better for high yields this can be explained with good water holding capacity and moderate water permeability of medium textured and well structured deep soils of vojvodina region these amounts of irrigation water are also indicated by the observed data of wp and iwp which were the highest in the i65 treatment furthermore that treatment exhibited the smallest wp and iwp deviations by year which leads to production stability if irrigation added more than 120 mm of water evaporation increased but not the soybean seed yield 4 conclusion the results of the three year study indicated that irrigation regimes significantly affected soybean seed yield and wp in different grades and depending on seasonal precipitation a quadratic relationship between seed yield and seasonal crop eta was observed for the three year data as a rule of thumb a sum of precipitation and irrigation should reach about 380 mm during the growing season to guarantee high yield and wp of soybean furthermore the results showed that the amount of precipitation in two dry growing seasons 2007 and 2008 was insufficient and that irrigation was needed to increase and stabilise yield however in the wet year 2006 an increase in the crop eta due to irrigation did not contribute to a significant increase of soybean yield in respect to the non irrigated treatments this is because the share of evaporation in the total et increased the results of the study suggested that in such wet years no soybean irrigation is needed in a temperate environment with regard to dry years when irrigated eta reaches about 380 mm the yields are the highest when up to 120 mm of irrigation water is added irrigation of more than 120 mm increases soil evaporation but does not increase the yield deficit irrigation treatments increased aboveground biomass seed yield and other investigated variables compared to non irrigated treatment soybean crops under rain fed conditions give highly variable yield making irrigation strongly required in temperate climates the highest yield was obtained from the i65 treatment in all three growing seasons which indicates that deficit irrigation is good strategy in soybean production in terms of yield maximization and water productivity to optimize irrigation management an economic analysis is required it depends on the objectives of irrigation whether the objectives are related to maximization of profits water productivity or yield or to optimize among three objectives which might be a case study nevertheless satisfactory seed yield was obtained with irrigation level i40 although the i40 plot received about 255 less irrigation water compared to the i100 treatment seed yield was reduced by an average of 20 compared to i100 therefore the i40 irrigation strategy proved to be efficient in saving water under conditions of restricted water resources results indicated that crop water productivity was the highest with irrigation regime i65 as shown by the wp and iwp values indicating that this irrigation regime contributes to the most stable soybean production the economic analysis between i65 and i40 deficit irrigation treatments is necessary to be done in order to decide which one of those two treatments is more efficient in addition to this irrigation timing in soybean production is very important to be performed in sensitive phenological stages which directly promote regulated deficit irrigation as a tool to enhance overall irrigation management acknowledgement this work was supported in part by the ministry of education science and

11320,in temperate climatic regions agricultural production depends on precipitation amount and its distribution during the growing season a 3 year field study was conducted to investigate the effects of different irrigation regimes on yield parameters and water productivity of sprinkler irrigated soybean glycine max l merr grown under wet semi dry and dry conditions in a temperate environment four irrigation levels were applied full irrigation i100 65 and 40 of full irrigation i65 and i40 and non irrigated control i0 on average the i0 treatment resulted in the highest harvest index hi and i100 produced the lowest hi a significant quadratic correlation between seed yield and crop water use was observed in dry and semi dry year the irrigation regime significantly influenced seed yield and water use i65 treatment produced the highest seed yield 3 69 t ha 1 and showed the highest water productivity wp 0 90 kg m 3 and irrigation wp 1 08 kg m 3 the present study indicated that irrigation is necessary for soybean cultivation in semi dry and dry years i e when seasonal precipitation is lower than about 300 mm in wet years with a favourable amount and distribution of precipitation during the growing season yields are similar to those achieved with irrigation and high et values of soybean are attributable to increased evaporation keywords evapotranspiration agricultural water management glycine max l merr water productivity yield composition 1 introduction temperate climate is characterized by large variability of weather parameters at most places agriculture depends on precipitation its amount and distribution vary from year to year and during growing seasons which causes instability of production and reduces farmers revenue therefore supplemental irrigation is needed to increase and stabilise agricultural production especially during the precipitation scarce seasons vojvodina is located in a temperate climatic zone of the pannonian plain in the northern part of the republic of serbia agricultural production is prevalently rain fed although it is one of priority economic sectors nevertheless in this region as in many similar regions around the world the availability of freshwater resources for agricultural use has been decreasing due to climate change and increasing demand of other sectors drought affects soybean growth and productivity in many parts of the world hatfield and prueger 2011 steduto et al 2012 sentelhas et al 2015 water stress is principally harmful during flowering seed setting and seed filling the research findings indicated that limited supplemental irrigation during the course of growing season or in a specific growth stage can significantly increase water productivity wp and soybean yields giménez et al 2017 jha et al 2018 response to irrigation depends on climate rainfall pattern during growing season soil properties cultivar agronomic practices and experimental procedures limited irrigation can result in substantial differentiation of crop productivity in various environments djaman et al 2013 akcay and dagdelen 2016 reported that deficit irrigation may support the water saving irrigation programs under conditions of water scarcity they stated that effective on farm implementation of deficit irrigation might improve crop productivity when the data about crop yield response to water inputs are available knowledge of crop response to water stress over the growing season is useful also in crop growth modelling enabling both improved prediction of crop performance in different situations and adoption of water saving management practices in the vojvodina region soybean is one of the main field crops grown prevalently under rain fed conditions in the recent years irrigation is becoming a common practice due to variable precipitation pattern and frequent drought caused by climate change however information is lacking on the impact of different irrigation levels on soybean yield and water productivity under different precipitation patterns consequently the objective of this study is to compare the effects of three irrigation treatments and non irrigated treatment on the growth yield and water productivity of soybean grown under different precipitation conditions in a temperate climatic region these data can be useful for soybean industry and the regional soybean growers to maximize the seed yield and productivity of water use through the selection of appropriate irrigation scheduling strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experiment set up field

taken from surčin meteorological station table 2 rain fed farming and occasional irrigations are the main production system in the study area the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four treatments and four replications the following irrigation regimes were applied i100 i65 i40 and i0 closely corresponding to no water deficiency treatment full irrigation 65 of full

capacity fc in i40 and i65 treatments the irrigation amounts referred to approximately 40 and 65 of i100 amount the irrigation rates and timings were determined following the soil water content in the effective root zone depth going up to 0 60 m in all irrigated treatments irrigation was practiced when soil water content reached approximately 50 of total available water the difference in soil water storage between field capacity and wilting point full irrigation treatment includes the reservoir fulfillment up to water content at field capacity whereas in the treatments i65 and i40 65 and 40 of full irrigation amounts were applied the irrigation rates and time were determined depending on the soil water content in the effective root zone depth to 0 60 m irrigation events were stopped two to three weeks before harvesting irrigations were applied with the hand move sprinkler irrigation system sprinklers heads with two nozzles mounted at 2 0 m were organized in 12 m 12 m square grid operating pressure was about 3 50 mpa with a discharge of 0 41 l s 1 irrigation started on 11 july and 10 july in the first two seasons 2006 and 2007 respectively and on 4 june in the third season the last seasonal irrigations were applied in the third decade of july and in the third and second decade of august in the first second and third growing season respectively each experimental plot was designed 7 14 m long and 8 0 m wide 57 12 m2 to minimize irrigation edge effects the inter plot space was 2 0 m soybean cv nena maturity group ii obtained from the maize research institute zemun polje company was sown on 28 april 2006 24 april 2007 and 6 may 2008 in 0 50 m wide rows at a seeding rate of 4 45 seed m 2 the crop was fertilized at the recommended rate based on soil tests with 450 kg ha 1 of npk 15 15 15 before sowing and a further nitrogen dose of 69 kg ha 1 was added as urea when the plants were 25 30 cm in height weeds pests and diseases were adequately controlled only the irrigation management differed between the treatments 2 2 crop and yield sampling seed yield was measured by harvesting an area of 5 0 m2 per plot hand harvest took place on 19 18 and 15 october respectively for 2006 2007 and 2008 seed yield was normalized for 13 seed water concentration harvest index was determined as seed yield divided by the total aboveground biomass after drying the samples at 65 c 2 3 soil water and crop evapotranspiration soil water content was measured periodically throughout the growing seasons using gravimetrical method at different depth starting at 0 10 m at sowing and going down to 0 60 m at flowering and hence after the measurements were based on the conventional oven dry mass gravimetrical water content was converted to volumetric water content after multiplying it by the bulk density soil bulk density was measured at the beginning of each crop season at 0 10 m interval depths up to 0 60 m actual crop evapotranspiration or total water consumption eta mm of each plot was calculated according to sincik et al 2008 1 eta p i cr dp rf δs where p is the rainfall in the growth period mm i is the amount of net irrigation water applied to individual plots mm cr is capillary rise of water from below the root zone mm rf is the surface runoff mm dp is the water lost through deep percolation mm and δs is the cumulative change in the soil water storage between planting and harvest within the effective crop root zone mm irrigation scheduling was based on the soil water balance method and gravimetric soil water content measurements in eq 1 cr was assumed to be zero because the water table was at 80 m depth deep percolation was ignored because soil water content measurements showed that no water percolated below 100 cm depth the run off and run on was also assumed to be zero because the field was flat and the irrigation volume per application was less than or equal to fc 2 4 yield and water productivity assessment water productivity wp kg m 3 and irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 were determined to evaluate the productivity of different water regimes these indices were calculated as sincik et al 2008 2 wp y

replications analysis was conducted using ibm spss 20 statistical package and the means were compared using the fisher s least significant difference lsd test at 5 significance level the relationship between seed yield and crop evapotranspiration еtа was evaluated using regression analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during the growing period the first growing season was cooler and wetter than the other two seasons table 2 the average temperature during the first growing season was slightly lower than the long term mean temperature of 18 6 c the average temperatures during the second and third seasons were higher than the long term mean temperature the three investigated growing seasons were characterized as wet season 2006 dry season 2007 and very dry season 2008 with 108 73 and 58 of the long term mean precipitation respectively the first growing season was wet with rainfall 100 mm in june and august much higher than the long term average rainfall was unevenly distributed and irrigation was applied in each year except in the first season in the i40 treatment table 3 3 2 applied irrigation water and seasonal water consumption the total amount of irrigation water varied depending on the seasons and irrigation treatments the differences between three seasons were due to change in the amount and pattern of precipitation table 3 in the first growing season rainfall was particularly abundant in june full irrigation was only 60 mm i e it was more than two times less than in 2007 135 mm and almost four times less than in 2008 235 mm a similar difference in the total amount of irrigation water applied in different years was observed also for other treatments the differences were due to the amount and pattern of precipitation fig 1 in general the lower humidity and higher air temperature resulted in greater demand of water for soybean crop the seasonal crop evapotranspiration eta increased with the increase in the irrigation volume table 3 the highest soybean seasonal eta 461 mm on average was observed in the i100 treatment other treatments subjected to severe water deficits had lower eta the lowest eta was recorded in the rain fed treatment 326 mm on average high precipitation in the first growing season limited irrigation inputs and did not allow a wide variation of eta which ranged from 440 mm in rain fed to 505 mm in full irrigation treatment similarities in eta between irrigation treatments were found for the second and the third growing season the eta was the lowest in the dry 2008 growing season ranging from 227 mm in rain fed to 450 mm in full irrigation treatment according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 estimated eta for maximum production in soybean is between 450 mm and 700 mm depending on the length of growing period cultivar soil conditions and climate sincik et al 2008 observed soya bean eta of 821 471 634 and 373 mm for full irrigated deficit irrigated and dry land plants respectively in the conditions of bursa turkey suyker and verma 2009 reported eta of 431 mm and 452 mm for rain fed and irrigated soybean respectively in eastern nebarska 3 3 soil water content fig 1 shows the soil water content dynamics of each treatment in the top 0 60 m of the crop root zone during three growing seasons of soybean the differences between the treatments augmented with the reduction of seasonal precipitation and with the increase of irrigation requirements in the case of irrigated treatments the soil water content was almost always above the threshold level fixed to 50 depletion of total available water the greatest variation of soil water content was observed for i0 treatment in wet year soil water content of rain fed treatment was similar to the irrigated treatments except a slight deviation in july which corresponded to flowering and pod formation periods in other two years water stress started earlier it was prolonged for more than 60 days and soil water content has reached almost the level of wilting point 3 4 aboveground biomass yield as expected the i0 treatment had the lowest aboveground biomass yield due to water stress which was especially severe in dry third season table 4 no significant differences in aboveground biomass yield were found between i40 and i0 treatments in wet first season the lower irrigation amount for the i40 treatment contributed to lower aboveground biomass compared to i65 and i100 the results indicated that lower irrigation level in i65 and i40 treatments significantly inhibited soybean growth if compared to that in i100 in irrigated and rain fed treatments the aboveground biomass varied from 8 09 to 11 64 t ha 1 and from 5 91 to 8 00 t ha 1 respectively overall the aboveground biomass yields were 2 73 greater in irrigated compared to non irrigated plots depending on the growing season and treatment a similar effect of irrigation on aboveground biomass yield was observed by other researchers karam et al 2005 sincik et al 2008 jha et al 2018 3 5 seed yield results obtained in this study showed that irrigation treatments significantly affected seed yield in each of three growing seasons table 4 the seed yields were the highest during the first wet season in respect to two drier growing seasons all irrigated treatments significantly increased yield compared with the rain fed treatment therefore limited precipitation and the reduced soil water content were the main factors limiting seed yields of soybean in the vojvodina region on average treatment i65 had the greatest seed yield 3 69 t ha 1 followed by i100 and i40 irrigated treatments with 3 32 and 2 97 t ha 1 respectively the possible factors involved in low yield under high irrigation treatment are excessive crop growth during the vegetative stage and poor soil aeration huang et al 2002 the i0 treatment had the lowest seed yield soybean yields were the most responsive to irrigation in the third dry growing season the triennial impact of irrigated treatments on yield led to an increase in seed yield by 28 42 and 15 for i100 i65 and i40 respectively average 29 compared with the i0 non irrigated treatment although i65 irrigation treatments received about 50 41 and 32 less irrigation water in respect to the i100 plots the seed yield was increased by an average of 13 3 2 9 and 19 3 in 2006 2007 and 2008 season respectively as compared to i100 table 4 there were no statistically significant differences in seed yield between the i40 and i0 in the first wet year because of adequate precipitation during the growing season in addition there were no statistically significant differences between the i100 and i65 treatments in the second growing season consequently the difference in seed yield between the growing seasons could result from the rainfall amount and distribution and elevated air temperatures and increased evapotranspiration demand the results of present study are in agreement with those reported by eck et al 1987 and karam et al 2005 they have found significant decrease in seed yield due to water stress sincik et al 2008 reported a significant effect of limited irrigation on seed yield of soybean koivisto et al 2003 stated that significant differences in soybean performance between two experimental years were due to differences in the environmental conditions of the united kingdom the findings of present study do not correspond to those of payero et al 2005 who reported that irrigation treatments had only statistically significant effect on the yield in the two driest seasons 2002 and 2003 under semi arid conditions of west central nebraska 3 6 harvest index harvest index hi had irregular variation from i100 to i40 plots table 4 irrigation regimes had significantly different effects on hi in all three growing seasons but there was no significant difference between the irrigated treatments in the second season and between the i65 and i40 treatments in the first wet growing season on average the i0 treatment resulted in the highest harvest index and i100 produced the lowest hi in the present study harvest index increased slightly on average while the seasonal irrigation volume decreased hi of irrigated treatments was 3 7 lower compared to i0 sincik et al 2008 observed irregular variation of hi and reported that hi tended to be higher in non irrigated treatments pedersen and lauer 2004 found that irrigation lowered hi by 2 on average in contrast to the present study garcia y garcia et al 2010 found that different irrigation regimes did not affect harvest index of soybean in a humid region of the south eastern usa in addition demirtas et al 2010 stated that hi of drip irrigated soybean was not affected by drought stress in a sub humid environment of turkey 3 7 water productivity and irrigation water productivity the wp values for sprinkler irrigated soybean varied considerably with irrigation treatment in all three experimental seasons especially during the driest third growing season table 5 the wp of irrigated treatments did not show consistent difference with decreasing applied irrigation water the wp of i65 was the highest in all seasons and it was on average greater by 13 than wp of non irrigated treatments however the i100 treatment had a wp value 10 lower than the non irrigated one the wp tended to be higher in moderately humid second season no significant difference was found between non irrigated treatment and i100 and i40 treatments in the first wet growing season the i65 treatment resulted in the highest wp in all three growing seasons which means that on average in the i65 treatment more seed mass was produced per mm of water compared with the i40 and i100 treatments the wp of i100 and i40 were on average 24 and 14 less than in the i65 treatment respectively these results are in agreement with those of burriro et al 2002 and sincik et al 2008 on the contrary sincik et al 2008 and demirtas et al 2010 reported remarkably lower wp values from 0 46 to 0 58 kg m 3 and from 0 41 to 0 64 kg m 3 respectively of deficit irrigated soybean in a sub humid region of turkey katerji et al 2008 quoted wp values of 0 39 0 77 kg m 3 for three studies in mediterranean environment only the results obtained by katerji and mastrorilli 2009 with wp values of 0 73 clay soil and 0 81 kg m 3 loam soil are comparable to those of the present study nevertheless eck et al 1987 observed that applying water deficit did not increase seasonal water productivity of soybean in environmental conditions of the southern high plains of the usa they also noted that moderately stressed or unstressed treatments had higher wp than those with severe water stress irrigation treatments influenced iwp much more than wp in the present study iwp showed irregular variation from i40 to i100 but tended to be higher in i65 treatment table 5 there was significant variation in iwp between experimental seasons the difference of average iwp between the treatments in the same growing season was smaller than that between the seasons in the same treatment large variation of iwp was found as a result of significant differences in applied irrigation water across growing seasons therefore the relatively wet first season resulted in significantly higher iwp values compared to the other two growing seasons the lower iwp in the last two seasons may be attributed the lower precipitation than in the wet season the lowest iwp was obtained from treatment i100 in all three growing seasons the iwp values observed in the i65 treatments were significantly higher than those observed in i100 and i40 treatments in all three growing seasons hence it can be concluded that i65 irrigation could be adequate strategy for soybean production in the vojvodina region the iwp values from this study were higher than those reported in many other studies evett et al 2000 sincik et al 2008 demirtas et al 2010 however the iwp values observed in this study are in agreement with those of garcia y garcia et al 2010 who reported iwp for sprinkler irrigated soybean ranging from 0 55 to 1 15 kg m 3 in a humid region of usa indeed it has often been considered that irrigation in humid zones is more efficient than irrigation in the arid regions because the lower water vapour deficit of the humid regions results in higher transpiration efficiency than in the arid climates tanner and sinclair 1983 3 8 relationships between seed yield and seasonal water consumption the results of regression analysis between the seed yield and seasonal crop evapotranspiration eta showed quadratic relationship r2 0 6486 for all irrigation regimes and for all three growing seasons fig 2 therefore there is an optimal water application amount to maximize the effectiveness of irrigation on increasing grain yield above the rain fed yields similarly to these results an exponential relationship between soybean seed yield and seasonal eta was observed by demirtas et al 2010 in the sub humid environmental conditions in turkey in contrast to the present study linear relationships between crop evapotranspiration and soybean yield were reported by payero et al 2005 and kirnak et al 2010 for semi arid environment of west central nebraska and the semi arid harran plain in turkey respectively in nebraska schneekloth et al 1991 found a linear relationship between seed yield and eta most investigations pointed out a strong linear correlation between seasonal eta and soybean yield however the slope of the regression line varied considerably between studies moreover other forms of relationship e g exponential quadratic between crop yield and eta are reported this may be attributed to the impact of different factors such as differences in seasonal precipitation amount its frequency and temporal distribution crop varieties soil properties adopted irrigation method and scheduling and other weather parameters and agronomic management practices 3 9 effect of seasonal precipitation on soybean growth the results of the present study indicated that seasonal precipitation and its distribution throughout the growing season play a significant role in irrigation needs wp and yield of soybean in the wet 2006 season precipitation was nearly enough for achieving yields comparable to those with irrigation treatments the longest dry period in 2006 was 19 days in august but it was between two substantial rainfall events 25 and 20 mm as such an increase in crop et by irrigation did not contribute to increase soybean seed yield relative to the yield of the rain fed control instead the increase of crop et was due to increased soil evaporation in 2006 and 2007 the first water deficits were noted in the pre flowering period in all treatments however contrary to the wet year 2006 the amount of precipitation in the semi dry year 2007 began to decrease in the pre flowering period in july and august of 2006 the amount of precipitation was 136 mm whereas in 2007 it was only 71 mm therefore in 2007 water deficit was compensated by irrigation in the dry year 2008 the amount of precipitation during the vegetative growth may june of soybean was 76 mm much lower than in the semi dry year 2007 and especially in the wet year 2006 in which the amount of precipitation was 105 mm and 177 mm respectively for that reason the irrigation in the driest year 2008 began 35 days earlier than in other two years 120 mm of water was added in the i100 treatment and 50 mm in the i65 treatment in 2008 the amount of precipitation for the remainder of the season was similar to that in 2007 in 2006 the irrigation depth of the treatments varied from approximately 39 to 60 mm these irrigation depths accounted for 8 12 of the seasonal water requirement eta in 2007 and 2008 irrigation accounted for 17 32 and 28 52 of the total seasonal eta of soybean respectively in 2006 the final waterings in treatments i65 and i100 were applied around the middle of the third decade of july in the semi dry year 2007 the final waterings were applied at the beginning of the third decade of july and in the dry year 2008 in the first decade of august in treatments i100 and i65 and in the middle of the second decade of august in treatment i40 the differences between irrigation treatments also included a difference in seasonal eta values between the wet year 2006 and other two years the seasonal eta under deficit irrigation conditions varied among the treatments and growing seasons depending on the total amount of water available to the crop and prevailing weather conditions table 3 the seasonal values of eta of the treatments varied over a broad range from 440 to 505 mm in 2006 308 427 mm in 2007 and 227 450 mm in 2008 the presented data indicated that the difference between i100 and the non irrigated treatment was the smallest in the wet year it was only 65 mm in 2007 and 2008 this difference was 119 and 223 mm respectively in addition despite the fact that the growing season in 2006 was colder and wetter than in 2007 and 2008 the seasonal values of eta of the different treatments were higher in 2006 the high eta values in 2006 are attributable to increased evaporation due to frequent wetting of the soil by precipitation the results of the present study indicate that in such wet years no crop irrigation of soybean is needed in a temperate environment fig 3 shows the correlation between the above ground biomass and eta for all treatments in the dry years 2007 and 2008 the correlation r2 0 7641 established for the dry years is much stronger than when all the three study years are viewed together r2 0 4553 fig 4 shows a good quadratic correlation r2 0 8573 between soybean seed yield and above ground biomass in the dry growing seasons 2007 and 2008 however the quadratic correlation is much weaker when the data on all the three growing seasons are combined r2 0 6459 the soybean seed yield exhibited a quadratic correlation fig 5 with the total seasonal amount of irrigation water in the dry years 2007 and 2008 which implied that there is an optimal water application amount to maximize the effectiveness of irrigation water on increasing grain yield above rain fed yields the quadratic model in the present study also indicated that the soybean seed yield peaked at about 120 mm of overall seasonal irrigation and that it began to decrease with larger seasonal amounts of water hence in the dry years 2007 and 2008 eta reached about 380 mm which ensured the highest yield with irrigation of up to 120 mm this means that for soybean grown in temperate conditions two waterings of 60 mm each might be sufficient and three of 40 mm are even better for high yields this can be explained with good water holding capacity and moderate water permeability of medium textured and well structured deep soils of vojvodina region these amounts of irrigation water are also indicated by the observed data of wp and iwp which were the highest in the i65 treatment furthermore that treatment exhibited the smallest wp and iwp deviations by year which leads to production stability if irrigation added more than 120 mm of water evaporation increased but not the soybean seed yield 4 conclusion the results of the three year study indicated that irrigation regimes significantly affected soybean seed yield and wp in different grades and depending on seasonal precipitation a quadratic relationship between seed yield and seasonal crop eta was observed for the three year data as a rule of thumb a sum of precipitation and irrigation should reach about 380 mm during the growing season to guarantee high yield and wp of soybean furthermore the results showed that the amount of precipitation in two dry growing seasons 2007 and 2008 was insufficient and that irrigation was needed to increase and stabilise yield however in the wet year 2006 an increase in the crop eta due to irrigation did not contribute to a significant increase of soybean yield in respect to the non irrigated treatments this is because the share of evaporation in the total et increased the results of the study suggested that in such wet years no soybean irrigation is needed in a temperate environment with regard to dry years when irrigated eta reaches about 380 mm the yields are the highest when up to 120 mm of irrigation water is added irrigation of more than 120 mm increases soil evaporation but does not increase the yield deficit irrigation treatments increased aboveground biomass seed yield and other investigated variables compared to non irrigated treatment soybean crops under rain fed conditions give highly variable yield making irrigation strongly required in temperate climates the highest yield was obtained from the i65 treatment in all three growing seasons which indicates that deficit irrigation is good strategy in soybean production in terms of yield maximization and water productivity to optimize irrigation management an economic analysis is required it depends on the objectives of irrigation whether the objectives are related to maximization of profits water productivity or yield or to optimize among three objectives which might be a case study nevertheless satisfactory seed yield was obtained with irrigation level i40 although the i40 plot received about 255 less irrigation water compared to the i100 treatment seed yield was reduced by an average of 20 compared to i100 therefore the i40 irrigation strategy proved to be efficient in saving water under conditions of restricted water resources results indicated that crop water productivity was the highest with irrigation regime i65 as shown by the wp and iwp values indicating that this irrigation regime contributes to the most stable soybean production the economic analysis between i65 and i40 deficit irrigation treatments is necessary to be done in order to decide which one of those two treatments is more efficient in addition to this irrigation timing in soybean production is very important to be performed in sensitive phenological stages which directly promote regulated deficit irrigation as a tool to enhance overall irrigation management acknowledgement this work was supported in part by the ministry of education science and

11321,in italy the restrictive approach for reclaimed water rw use in agriculture has led to some difficulties in spreading this practice in particular matching microbiological standards evaluated in terms of escherichia coli is quite prohibitive and highly intensive disinfection systems are the sole option to adequately treat municipal wastewater a different view of the same concern is offered by the world health organization who that proposed a pragmatic approach based on microbial risk assessment to evaluate case by case the pathogen reduction in case of rw use in agriculture and how to achieve this in the study two different tertiary treatment options for rw use in agriculture were examined the first option named extensive tertiary treatment system etts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system biological pond storage reservoir sand and disk filters the second option named hybrid tertiary treatment system htts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system sand and disk filters ultraviolet uv system moreover the microbial contamination on crop irrigated by rw from both examined systems was evaluated an economic analysis was carried out for a life cycle of 20 years of the treatment systems economic benefits and total cost of rw for agricultural irrigation using both the tertiary treatment options were evaluated results evidenced that total costs of rw were similar for both options anyway other benefits can support the choice of etts to treat rw for vegetable crop irrigation especially for rural areas in developing countries keywords water reuse approaches natural based treatment removal efficiency treatment costs environmental sustainability 1 introduction the mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change collet et al 2015 and water shortages are expected to continue la jeunesse et al 2016 due to the increasing degradation of water resources overuse pollution salinization etc and increasing water demand in agriculture as well as in the urban industry and energy sectors as an effect of climate change the frequency and intensity of droughts and their environmental and economic damages have drastically increased over the past thirty years the droughts of the summer of 2017 may illustrate the dimensions of economic loss the italian farming sector alone was predicting losses of eur 2 billion ec 2018 agriculture is in fact the largest water user the 2017 un world water and development report unwwdr 2017 based on fao aquastat data states fao 2016 that the water consumption for crop irrigation reaches 70 on average of the world water requirements ait mouheb et al 2018 when natural water reserves are not sufficient one of the most available constantly produced and relatively unaffected by climatic conditions water resource is the reclaimed water rw eea 2009 cirelli et al 2012 ait mouheb et al 2018 rw is already being used directly or indirectly in many semi arid areas of the world e g africa central america southern europe southern asia pedrero et al 2010 in particular rw is becoming an increasingly important source of irrigation being agriculture the highest water demanding user and often the most penalized among others in southern europe more than 50 of the total water consumption comes from agriculture eea 2009 in italy in particular in case of a lack of water the water supply service often favours domestic and industrial sectors over the agricultural one resulting in a negative impact on the local economy cirelli et al 2012 as rw can be an important source of water in agriculture barbagallo et al 2012 its application should be regulated in order to prevent the use of water of insufficient quality that later can cause diseases to humans pedrero et al 2010 dickin et al 2016 on the international level the two benchmark guidelines for rw use are the california guideline state of california 1978 and the world health organization who guideline who 1989 the first one is stricter following a zero risk approach that adopts the best available technology us epa 2012 seder and abdel jabbar 2011 the zero risk approach is based upon the fact that pathogenic micro organism could survive for days weeks and at times months in the soil and on crops so detection in any of these environments is sufficient to indicate that a public health problem exists therefore for example recycled water used for the surface irrigation of food crops where the recycled water comes into contact the edible portion of the crop shall be disinfected tertiary recycled water instead recycled water used for the surface irrigation of food crops where the recycled water does not contact the edible portion shall be at least a disinfected secondary recycled water state of california 2001 for many years the california state regulations were the only legal valid reference for recycling and reuse salgot et al 2017 who 1989 supported by a group of specialists recognized that the extremely strict california standard for rw use adopted by many countries was not justified by the available epidemiological evidence nor was it likely that many countries especially developing countries could meet this strict standard the who guideline was more flexible and it was established in order to be applicable in developing countries with lower economic possibilities bixio et al 2008 the who guidelines followed a calculated risk approach based on existing epidemiological evidence and they considered irrigation as an additional treatment stage in particular the who recommended a microbial guideline of not more than 1000 fecal coliforms fcs per 100 ml for unrestricted irrigation of all crops with special emphasis on the removal of helminth eggs no more than one egg per liter during effluent treatment shuval et al 1986 who 1989 then world health organization who 2006 established a limit of escherichia coli e coli at 104 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml for rw use on vegetables for consumption as fresh food afterwards who as well as australian guidelines recommended the implementation of a risk management plan including a risk assessment for water reuse systems for this purpose the who launched a sanitation safety planning ssp manual as guidance on implementation of the who guidelines for water reuse who 2015 moreover in order to reach an effluent quality suitable for irrigation the california guideline proposed conventional biological treatments in combination with tertiary treatment filtration and chlorine disinfection while the who suggested a series of stabilization ponds barbagallo et al 2003 as consequence there is fierce argument about the economics of rw use winpenny et al 2010 and particularly on the practical consequences of decisions concerning effluent treatment levels the differences between the two approaches and among the different guidelines and regulations may raise doubts about their capability to protect end users in particular the countries that do not yet have guidelines or experience may decide not to deal with rw use brissaud 2008 qadir and sato 2016 most comprehensive standards developed specifically for rw use practices and issued by european states were until today either derived from the california guidelines e g greece cyprus and italy or from the australian guidelines and revised who criteria e g france who 2014 or from a combination of the above e g spain and portugal fawell et al 2016 stated that the non existence of the common standard is the biggest obstruction for the expansion of the rw use sector in europe a common strategy on rw use was issued on may 2018 in fact based on the proposal of minimum quality requirements for water reuse in agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge alcade sanz and gawlik 2017 the european parliament and of the council has just proposed the european directive on the regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse ec 2018 this instrument is based on a risk management framework which is recommended to tackle health and environmental risks and assure a safe use of rw for agriculture the proposed directive could lead to water reuse in agricultural irrigation in the magnitude of 6 6 billion m3 per year as compared to 1 7 billion m3 per year in the absence of any eu legal framework ec 2018 italian regulations for effluent irrigation in agriculture italian ministry decree 185 2003 follows the zero risk approach it fixes limits for 54 parameters 37 of which are not considered for drinking water analysis cirelli et al 2008 2012 castorina et al 2016 the high number of monitored parameters negatively affects to rw use angelakis and gikas 2014 bio by deloitte 2015 and italy is given as the extreme example of a country with a stringent monitoring protocol and severe limits but with only a small proportion of its rw used this is in contrast to israel the country leader in rw use with less than a dozen parameters defined lavrnic et al 2017 moreover the limits fixed by the italian regulations are very stringent for some of parameters such as bod5 20 mg l 1 total suspended solids 10 mg l 1 and escherichia coli 10 cfu 100 ml 1 or 50 cfu 100 ml 1 for 80 of samples respectively in the case of conventional treatment systems or treatment wetland and lagooning the italian approach is much more restrictive with respect to health hazards than the who regulations e g who 1989 shuval 1991 peasey 2000 devaux et al 2001 who 2006 cirelli et al 2008 aiello et al 2013 salgot et al 2017 the fulfillment of high limitations implies high intensive treatments for the use of rw and consequently high costs not always sustainable for users the financial competitiveness of reuse projects compared to traditional water supply schemes is fundamental to support rw use frijns et al 2016 especially in developing countries conventionally the comparison of rw use system alternatives is only based on economic data provided in the feasibility study of the projects so that the alternative with minimum capital operation and maintenance o m costs is chosen zeng et al 2007 following the sustainable sanitation alliance andersson et al 2016 susana 2018 it is key to implement sanitation systems which are sustainable in order to be sustainable a sanitation system has to be not only economically viable socially acceptable and technically and institutionally appropriate it should also protect the environment and the natural resources the latter involves the required energy water and other natural resources for construction as well as o m of the system constructed wetland cws are among the wastewater treatment systems more environmentally sustainable involving the use of engineered technologies that are designed and realized to utilize natural processes these systems are designed to mimic natural wetland systems utilizing wetland plants soil and associated microorganisms to remove contaminants from rw effluents us epa 2012 cws can be adopted as a tertiary treatment technology due to their low o m costs and efficiency in treating rw from small and medium communities cws are used for treating various wastewater types and for polishing advanced treated water effluents for return to freshwater resources us epa 2012 toscano et al 2009 cws have been suggested as alternative for treating nitrate contaminated aquifers denitrification of nitrified sewage effluents and irrigation return flow baker 1998 mara 2013 moreover cws treated municipal effluent directed to irrigation may contain readily absorbable useful nutrients and easily biodegradable organics these substances are generally compatible with the limits imposed by the italian regulations m d 152 2006 for treated water discharged in water bodies cirelli et al 2012 castorina et al 2016 in order to give a contribution to the argument on the zero risk and calculated risk currently followed worldwide in this paper a removal efficiency in terms of both physical chemical and microbial analysis of two different tertiary treatment options for rw use in agriculture was carried out to evaluate a feasible reuse alternative a quantitative economic analysis was performed for both treatment options at full scale of application 2 methodology 2 1 experimental treatment options for rw use in agriculture based on constructed wetland technology based on cws technology two different tertiary treatment options were implemented at the experimental site these options were both finalized to rw use in agriculture the first option named extensive tertiary treatment system etts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system biological pond i e lagooning storage reservoir i e tank sand and disk filters the second option fig 1 named hybrid tertiary treatment system htts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system sand and disk filters and ultraviolet uv systems both tertiary treatment systems use rw coming from the same cw reed bed named h ssf3 in fig 1 the h ssf3 about 2000 m2 in operation since 2012 is planted with phragmites australis and designed to treat 2 l s the filtering bed is 0 6 m deep and filled with 8 10 mm of volcanic gravel this bed is part of the largest natural wwtp of the south italy it includes four h ssf reed beds followed by three batch rw storage reservoirs used as tertiary treatment of secondary effluent coming from a municipal wwtp to reuse in agriculture the cw system recovers annual overall wastewater about 315 000 m3 year about 860 m3 day in order to improve the microbiological water quality in the etts a part of the cw effluent about 3 m3 day 1 was collected in a lagoon biological pond of about 60 m3 then in a storage reservoir of about 100 m3 and finally it was pumped and then filtered by two sand filters and a disk filter 120 mesh disk filter with automatic backwash in the htts after the cw and sand filters treatment rw was pumped through disk filters 120 mesh disk filter with automatic backwash and finally a uv disinfection unit wedeco ag lbx 10 the uv unit was equipped with a three low pressure mercury lamps wavelength λ 254 nm that provide for a maximum flow rate of 6 m3 h 1 a minimum dose of 700 j cm 2 to the water minimum value for a efficiency water disinfection treatment with 70 transmittance the two treatment lines etts and htts were monitored by an intense sampling campaign during the period april september 2014 a simple one way analysis of variance anova was performed by using minitab 16 statistical software in order to comparethe removal efficiency as well as the main physical chemical and microbiological parameters at the outlet of both treatment systems fig 1 2 2 experimental irrigation field the irrigation plots were 30 m long fig 2 all plots supplied by etts htts and fresh water fw had polyethylene pipelines with external diameter of 16 mm and in line labyrinth drippers with a theoretical flow rate of 0 9 l h 1 at a pressure of 70 kpa emitters were spaced at 0 2 m and the distance between rows was of 1 1 m the experimental plots were equipped with drip irrigation systems consisting of surface di and sub surface sdi pipelines buried at a depth of 0 05 m these systems supplied rw or fw to experimental plots the emission uniformity eu of di and sdi systems was monitored during the trial as outlines by keller and karmeli 1975 eu was obtained by measuring the flow rate from 20 selected drippers per each water supplying pipeline of fig 2 tomato solanum licopersycum l cv missouri and eggplant solanum melongena l were both transplanted in may 2014 at density of 2 2 plants m 2 standard cultivation practices were adopted during the cropping season the same quantity of n 55 kg ha p2o5 110 kg ha and k2o 80 kg ha were applied uniformly to the experimental field by a single fertilization of etts htts effluents and fw castorina et al 2016 2 3 monitoring protocol and who exposure scenario the two treatment options were compared in terms of physical chemical removal and overall microbial disinfection performance at the light of both the italian regulation md 185 2003 and who 2006 guidelines fig 1 provide the schematic of the rw sampling points along the treatment lines physical chemical and microbial characteristics of rw were analysed approximately every 30 days during the experiment standard methods apha 2005 were adopted to determine total suspended solids tss at 105 c biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn electrical conductivity ec ph sulfur trioxide so3 iron fe chlorine cl sar e coli and salmonella apha 2005 in the study in order to carry out comparisons the exposure scenario of unrestricted irrigation proposed by who in 2006 and based on the consumption of rw irrigated lettuce was considered the selected scenario corresponds to the controlled use of rw to grow crops that are normally eaten raw who 2006 in particular who 2006 guidelines consider a median design risk for rotavirus infection of 10 3 pppy per patient per year consisting in general of 2 3 log unit reductions due to rotavirus die off between last irrigation and consumption in particular according to who guidelines 2006 rw by the water treatment system could be used for vegetable crop irrigation by implementing some post treatment health protection control measures for example up to 5 log unit of microbial reduction could be achieved by washing the produce with clean water disinfection and peeling the application of these post treatment health protection control measures assures the required log units reduction of e coli for the tolerable rotavirus infection risk microbial contamination analysis of fruits was carried out following the methodology described in castorina et al 2016 for both tomato and eggplant analysing 5 samples of 500 g for each crop 2 4 economic analysis an economic analysis was carried out to further compare etts and htts options to be realistic of the effective continuous operation of both the treatment alternatives the analysis was performed at full scale by including the annual wastewater treated equal to 315 000 m3 year and a small reservoir 2500 m3 in order to enhance the buffer capability of the htts system because the year of construction for both treatment systems was 2014 only the o m costs were actualized the construction cost for each treatment option is given by the following equations eq 1 and 2 1 cc1 cr cp oc 2 cc2 cuv cr cp oc where cc1 and cc2 are construction total costs for the option 1 etts and 2 htts respectively cr is the construction cost of the reservoirs cuv is the cost for an ultra violet uv equipment cp is the cost for personnel oc represents the other costs expropriation and easements the o m costs include maintenance of reservoirs and man labour unskilled workers for the management of the etts maintenance of the small reservoir and uv equipment operation costs electricity consumption of uv equipment and man labour skilled workers for the management of htts monitoring costs for both treatment options consisting in sampling and analysis of the treated wastewater 12 sampling per year as required by italian law a 20 years life cycle was considered for both options for the htts in particular considering that the uv equipment has a life cycle of 15 years following italian rules for depreciation of assets ministerial decree of 28 march 1996 from the 16th year onwards a third of the total cost of a new uv equipment was taken into account o m costs during the 20 years life cycle were actualized present value pv as in the follows eq 3 3 o m p v i 1 20 c f i r i where o m pv represents the actualized present value pv of the total o m costs for the whole life cycle of the system i is the generic year cfi is the cash flow for the generic year r is the coefficient of actualization with an interest rate of 4 equal to 104 in order to have a comprehensive cost which also includes the rw use construction and monitoring costs of the irrigation systems have been evaluated these costs are the same for both etts and htts options moreover economic benefits related to rw same for both options were also included in the analysis in order to use the annual amount of rw 315 000 m3 two crops broccoli and tomato covering with their growing season the whole year were selected in particular the two selected crops have a 6 months growing period each tomato from april to september and broccoli from october to march therefore to define to maximum irrigated area by rw the annual rw volume was divided in two parts about 158 000 m3 each the irrigated area ha was then calculated dividing the six months volume by the water requirement for broccoli and tomato regione siciliana 2013 aiello et al 2013 construction and o m costs of the irrigation system were calculated on the basis of the irrigated areas the construction cost of the irrigation system was about 472 200 00 year 2014 this cost was evaluated by multiplying the irrigated area about 74 00 ha by the construction cost about 6400 00 ha table 1 the o m costs were 1 723 470 00 this cost was obtained maintaining the yearly o m cost constant and equal to 1720 00 ha year table 1 for the whole life cycle of the system 20 year moreover cash flows were then actualized to the year 2014 see eq 3 the actualized cost per unit of water m3 i e obtained dividing the construction plus o m actualized costs by the total available rw for 20 years period was equal to 0 35 m3 for both treatment options the economic benefit related to rw use practice was computed for the two selected crops by considering the following parameters employment increase in agriculture ei δday ha year job days increase per year and hectare due to crop conversion as a result of using the rw for irrigation rain fed versus irrigated agriculture hectare crop table sicilian region decree 5 march 2001 induced economic benefit ieb ha year economic benefit increase from selling of new crops

dataset inea rica arearica crea gov it all indicators were based on regional aggregated statistical data 3 results 3 1 bod5 tss and e coli concentrations along etts and htts lines average values of the main physical chemical characteristics of rw observed were summarized in table 2 and 3 for all the sampling points along etts and htts lines the number of samples collected for each point along both treatment systems was 13 bod5 and cod mean concentrations were reduced by about 70 by the etts and 80 by the htts respectively mean values of bod5 cod and tss always decreased along htts and etts lines the only exception to this behaviour is the storage reservation outlet at the etts where a worsening of the mean concentration values of the three parameters was observed probably due to the harmful algal bloom effect this effect can be due to the establishment of favourable conditions such as sunlight slow moving water as well as nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus that acting all together cause the algal growth that modify the quality of rw us epa 2017 bod5 concentration values resulted always below 20 mg l 1 during the observation period after both sand and disk filters along the etts with the exception of one sample collected at the beginning of june which reached the limit concentration bod5 values resulted always below 20 mg l 1 during the observation period after the uv treatment along the htts fig 3 both systems allowed a tss reduction of about 90 even if tss means were very close to the fixed limit of 10 mg l 1 tss concentration values resulted below 10 mg l 1 for about 90 of samples collected after sand and disk filters respectively along the etts similarly tss concentration values resulted below 10 mg l 1 for 11 13 and for 12 13 samples collected after the disk filter and uv treatment respectively along the htts fig 4 the etts reduced e coli mean concentration values up to 4 1e 01 cfu 100 ml 4 9e 01 and up to 3 4e 01 cfu 100 ml 4 2e 01 after the sand filter and the disk filter respectively in particular for 67 of the samples collected after both sand and disk filters e coli concentration values were below the mandatory limit of 50 cfu 100 ml fixed by the italian legislation in the case of treatment wetland or lagoon effluents e coli mean concentrations were reduced from 5 0e 05 to 1 6e 00 cfu 100 ml 5 0e 00 by the htts after the uv treatment as expected none of the rw samples analysed in the htts before the uv treatment had e coli concentrations below the mandatory limit of 50 cfu 100 ml e coli concentration values varied considerably during the trials at the different sampling points reaching values higher than 1e 06 cfu 100 ml at the inlet of the hssf 3 a percentage of 67 and 80 of samples collected after sand and disk filters along the etts respectively were below the limit of 50 cfu 100 ml for 80 of samples one sample collected after the sand filter and no samples collected after the disk filter exceeded the limit of 2e 02 cfu 100 ml fixed by the italian legislation for reuse m d 185 03 in the case of treatment wetland or lagoon effluents for 20 of samples no sample was below the limit of 50 cfu 100 ml before the uv treatment along the htts but all samples were below this limit after the uv treatment for two samples an increasing of e coli concentration up to values higher than 1 5e 02 cfu 100 ml was observed at the inlet of the irrigation system fig 5 salmonella was never detected in the rw samples collected at the different points along both the treatments lines 3 2 microbial contamination of fruits the mean presence of e coli observed for fruits drip irrigated or sub drip irrigated with rw from both etts and htts was similar table 4 the maximum e coli contamination did not reach significant values for eggplants and tomato irrigated by rw from both esst and hsst in particular the maximum value of e coli was observed in tomato fruits irrigated with rw from etts 1 7e 02 cfu 100 g salmonella was never detected on fruits data not shown 3 3 economic analysis of etts and htts for rw use table 5 reports construction and o m costs for both etts and htts options actualized to the year 2014 as expected the construction cost for the etts was higher while the htts had a higher o m costs the cost per m3 of water was similar between the different treatment options table 6 reports the available rw volumes for each crop the irrigation volumes for the reference crops i e broccoli and tomato and the corresponding maximum irrigation areas table 7 reports the economic benefits of rw use these economic benefits are equal for both options etts and htts 3 4 comparison of etts and htts for rw use table 8 shows the removal efficiency as well as the unit cost of rw for both treatment options the anova analysis revealed that htts allowed to obtain a higher removal efficiency for bod5 p 0 05 and e coli p 0 01 with respect to etts the removal efficiency for cod and tss was instead not significantly different between the two systems moreover the anova analysis applied between the values measured at the outlet of etts and htts revealed that ph nh4 n and ca and e coli were different at p 0 001 bod5 and sar were different at p 0 01 cod and cl were different at p 0 05 for the rest of the parameters the difference were not statistically significant between the two systems no micro climatic effect due to the lowering of the air temperature during winter negatively influenced the removal efficiency of the organic matter and the bacteriological component of the rw treated by both etts and htts the removal efficiency values found in the winter period were in line with the averages shown in table 8 4 discussion the htts treatment option allowed to respect the very restrictive physical chemical limits fixed by italian regulation standards for rw use in agriculture for bod5 cod and tss as well as a complete removal of the bacteriological e coli components of rw figs 3 5 on the other hand notwithstanding the microbial removal efficiency of etts was lower than that obtained by the htts e coli limit concentrations fixed by the italian regulation were matched moreover even if mean values of e coli found on fruits irrigated with rw from the etts were higher than for those irrigated with rw from the htts the maximum contamination never reached significant values similar results were obtained by castorina et al 2016 which reported values of e coli concentration up to 8e 01 cfu 100 g for drip and sub drip irrigated eggplant by fw rw treated by the etts showed e coli contamination always below the value of 1e 04 cfu 100 ml fixed by the world health organization in 2006 for the unrestricted irrigation scenario in order to reach a median design risk for rotavirus infection of 10 3 pppy per patient per year this approach considers feasible a 2 3 log unit reduction of e coli in rw due to rotavirus die off between last irrigation and consumption some of the post treatment health protection control measures suggested by who guidelines 2006 to reduce microbial contaminations incur no additional cost so they can help to reduce the rw use costs qadir et al 2010 the success of the implementation of some health protection measures for the reuse in agriculture was already reported for case studies in ghana senegal vietnam and india us epa 2012 even if the main european standards include additional preventive measures following this multiple barrier approach italian standards are not aligned to those preventive measures following the recently published proposal of the european directive for a regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse ec 2018 rw by the etts corresponded to b quality class being e coli concentration 100 cfu 100 ml for 90 of samples all methods are allowed to irrigate food crops consumed raw where the edible portion is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with rw quality class b ec 2018 the results of this study showed that natural treatment system recommended by the who for using rw in agriculture together with sand and disk filters can represent a reliable alternative to the high intensive disinfection treatment based on uv for example waste biological ponds are recommended by the who because of their effectiveness in removing nematodes eggs and helminths eggs a pathogen endemic within developing countries biological ponds have an advantage that they are very efficient and inexpensive both in terms of capital investment and o m costs salama et al 2014 a recent overview on different studies on natural and conventional disinfection technologies among others chlorine based disinfectants and uv radiation showed that even if the latter represent the most used treatments natural disinfection processes could represent valuable solutions due in particular to the absence of chemical reagents collivignarelli et al 2018 moreover the results of this study confirmed the removal efficiency of sand filters of about one log unit as reported in table 1 already showed in other studies de sanctis et al 2017 sand filter is an easy to handle and cost effective treatment technique which avoids toxicity concerns da costa et al 2014 the study also highlighted high values of emission uniformity keller and karmely 1975 evaluated for both di mean of about 95 and sdi mean of about 93 systems in cases of rw and fw supplying the irrigation system is therefore unsuitable for occlusion conditions that could affect the uniform water distribution to the plants the economic evaluation carried out using reference italian costs indicated that the treatment cost per m3 of rw was slightly higher for the etts than for the htts anyway the etts would be economically more advantageous than the htts by evaluating the construction cost in developing countries where the hourly labour cost per employee is significantly lower than in italy ilo 2018 moreover in both developed and undeveloped countries numerous advantages support the adoption of the etts option first of all the construction and the management simplicity does not need expert skills and makes the system suitable for developing countries second storage reservoirs included in the system adequately sized can also have seasonal regulation purpose making higher buffer capability of the etts and enhancing the resilience of the system to any eventual fluctuation of rw hydraulic and organic load the third aspect regards the search for alternative sanitation systems that are also sustainable from an energetic point of view as promoted by the sustainable sanitation alliance susan 2018 in our case the htts option including the uv system needs 199 728 kw h equal to 17 2 tonnes of oil equivalent toe to work continuously for 20 years while the etts option needs only energy for the pumping system this aspect is also linked with co2 emissions that is another factor that supports the etts option in fact the main co2 emission sources are electricity generation corresponding to the kwh requirement of the uv system for the htts option and direct co2 emissions from wastewater for the etts option because it includes the biological pond and the storage reservoir the total amount of co2 emissions produced by the htts option to work continuously for 20 years correspond to 70 384 kg co2 considering a co2 intensity of electricity coefficient of 0 352 kg co2 kwh 1evaluated for italy at the electric meter enea 2013 co2 emissions from wastewater instead are of biogenic origin therefore they should not be included in total national emissions doorn et al 2006 in other words following the methodology applied in lca studies ghg emissions are assessed based on the energy demand only molinos senante et al 2013 finally even if the htts may allow a higher rw microbiological quality it implies higher o m requirements i e intensive treatment energy costs o m expertise determining a higher environmental impact salama et al 2014 these aspects could condition the use of treatment systems in developing countries where actually most of rw is not treated qadir and sato 2016 therefore in the short term risk management and interim solutions are necessary to prevent adverse impacts from rw irrigation in developing countries a combination of source control and farm level and post treatment measures can be used to protect farm workers and consumers an approach that tends to the who guidelines 2006 for rw use could be more feasible on a general level to encourage the use of rw qadir et al 2010 alcade sanz and gawlik 2014 5 conclusion within the paradigm of the nature based solution systems i e constructed wetlands integrated with lagoons the study dealt with the evaluation of urban wastewater treatment process for reuse purposes using two different sanitation strategies htts versus etts the main difference between the two experimented treatment options is the use of uv disinfection in the htts results evidenced similar costs for cubic meter for rw as well as the comparable removal efficiency between the two treatment options in terms of cod and tss the removal efficiency of bod5 was instead lower for etts that for htts the intensive disinfection made the htts more efficient in terms of e coli removal anyway the rw by etts had microbial characteristics matching both the italian regulation standards and the who guidelines 2006 for the unrestricted irrigation scenario as well as the b quality class as defined in the proposed european directive on water reuse ec 2018 moreover e coli contamination on tomato and eggplant never reached significant values by using rw by both etts and htts total costs of rw were similar for both options anyway other benefits can support the choice of etts to treat rw for vegetable crop irrigation especially for rural areas in developing countries in particular the main advantages are construction and management simplicities use of unskilled workers low labour cost high buffer capability as well as environmental sustainability and co2 emission biogenic origin of the nature based solutions acknowledgements this work has been

11321,in italy the restrictive approach for reclaimed water rw use in agriculture has led to some difficulties in spreading this practice in particular matching microbiological standards evaluated in terms of escherichia coli is quite prohibitive and highly intensive disinfection systems are the sole option to adequately treat municipal wastewater a different view of the same concern is offered by the world health organization who that proposed a pragmatic approach based on microbial risk assessment to evaluate case by case the pathogen reduction in case of rw use in agriculture and how to achieve this in the study two different tertiary treatment options for rw use in agriculture were examined the first option named extensive tertiary treatment system etts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system biological pond storage reservoir sand and disk filters the second option named hybrid tertiary treatment system htts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system sand and disk filters ultraviolet uv system moreover the microbial contamination on crop irrigated by rw from both examined systems was evaluated an economic analysis was carried out for a life cycle of 20 years of the treatment systems economic benefits and total cost of rw for agricultural irrigation using both the tertiary treatment options were evaluated results evidenced that total costs of rw were similar for both options anyway other benefits can support the choice of etts to treat rw for vegetable crop irrigation especially for rural areas in developing countries keywords water reuse approaches natural based treatment removal efficiency treatment costs environmental sustainability 1 introduction the mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change collet et al 2015 and water shortages are expected to continue la jeunesse et al 2016 due to the increasing degradation of water resources overuse pollution salinization etc and increasing water demand in agriculture as well as in the urban industry and energy sectors as an effect of climate change the frequency and intensity of droughts and their environmental and economic damages have drastically increased over the past thirty years the droughts of the summer of 2017 may illustrate the dimensions of economic loss the italian farming sector alone was predicting losses of eur 2 billion ec 2018 agriculture is in fact the largest water user the 2017 un world water and development report unwwdr 2017 based on fao aquastat data states fao 2016 that the water consumption for crop irrigation reaches 70 on average of the world water requirements ait mouheb et al 2018 when natural water reserves are not sufficient one of the most available constantly produced and relatively unaffected by climatic conditions water resource is the reclaimed water rw eea 2009 cirelli et al 2012 ait mouheb et al 2018 rw is already being used directly or indirectly in many semi arid areas of the world e g africa central america southern europe southern asia pedrero et al 2010 in particular rw is becoming an increasingly important source of irrigation being agriculture the highest water demanding user and often the most penalized among others in southern europe more than 50 of the total water consumption comes from agriculture eea 2009 in italy in particular in case of a lack of water the water supply service often favours domestic and industrial sectors over the agricultural one resulting in a negative impact on the local economy cirelli et al 2012 as rw can be an important source of water in agriculture barbagallo et al 2012 its application should be regulated in order to prevent the use of water of insufficient quality that later can cause diseases to humans pedrero et al 2010 dickin et al 2016 on the international level the two benchmark guidelines for rw use are the california guideline state of california 1978 and the world health organization who guideline who 1989 the first one is stricter following a zero risk approach that adopts the best available technology us epa 2012 seder and abdel jabbar 2011 the zero risk approach is based upon the fact that pathogenic micro organism could survive for days weeks and at times months in the soil and on crops so detection in any of these environments is sufficient to indicate that a public health problem exists therefore for example recycled water used for the surface irrigation of food crops where the recycled water comes into contact the edible portion of the crop shall be disinfected tertiary recycled water instead recycled water used for the surface irrigation of food crops where the recycled water does not contact the edible portion shall be at least a disinfected secondary recycled water state of california 2001 for many years the california state regulations were the only legal valid reference for recycling and reuse salgot et al 2017 who 1989 supported by a group of specialists recognized that the extremely strict california standard for rw use adopted by many countries was not justified by the available epidemiological evidence nor was it likely that many countries especially developing countries could meet this strict standard the who guideline was more flexible and it was established in order to be applicable in developing countries with lower economic possibilities bixio et al 2008 the who guidelines followed a calculated risk approach based on existing epidemiological evidence and they considered irrigation as an additional treatment stage in particular the who recommended a microbial guideline of not more than 1000 fecal coliforms fcs per 100 ml for unrestricted irrigation of all crops with special emphasis on the removal of helminth eggs no more than one egg per liter during effluent treatment shuval et al 1986 who 1989 then world health organization who 2006 established a limit of escherichia coli e coli at 104 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml for rw use on vegetables for consumption as fresh food afterwards who as well as australian guidelines recommended the implementation of a risk management plan including a risk assessment for water reuse systems for this purpose the who launched a sanitation safety planning ssp manual as guidance on implementation of the who guidelines for water reuse who 2015 moreover in order to reach an effluent quality suitable for irrigation the california guideline proposed conventional biological treatments in combination with tertiary treatment filtration and chlorine disinfection while the who suggested a series of stabilization ponds barbagallo et al 2003 as consequence there is fierce argument about the economics of rw use winpenny et al 2010 and particularly on the practical consequences of decisions concerning effluent treatment levels the differences between the two approaches and among the different guidelines and regulations may raise doubts about their capability to protect end users in particular the countries that do not yet have guidelines or experience may decide not to deal with rw use brissaud 2008 qadir and sato 2016 most comprehensive standards developed specifically for rw use practices and issued by european states were until today either derived from the california guidelines e g greece cyprus and italy or from the australian guidelines and revised who criteria e g france who 2014 or from a combination of the above e g spain and portugal fawell et al 2016 stated that the non existence of the common standard is the biggest obstruction for the expansion of the rw use sector in europe a common strategy on rw use was issued on may 2018 in fact based on the proposal of minimum quality requirements for water reuse in agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge alcade sanz and gawlik 2017 the european parliament and of the council has just proposed the european directive on the regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse ec 2018 this instrument is based on a risk management framework which is recommended to tackle health and environmental risks and assure a safe use of rw for agriculture the proposed directive could lead to water reuse in agricultural irrigation in the magnitude of 6 6 billion m3 per year as compared to 1 7 billion m3 per year in the absence of any eu legal framework ec 2018 italian regulations for effluent irrigation in agriculture italian ministry decree 185 2003 follows the zero risk approach it fixes limits for 54 parameters 37 of which are not considered for drinking water analysis cirelli et al 2008 2012 castorina et al 2016 the high number of monitored parameters negatively affects to rw use angelakis and gikas 2014 bio by deloitte 2015 and italy is given as the extreme example of a country with a stringent monitoring protocol and severe limits but with only a small proportion of its rw used this is in contrast to israel the country leader in rw use with less than a dozen parameters defined lavrnic et al 2017 moreover the limits fixed by the italian regulations are very stringent for some of parameters such as bod5 20 mg l 1 total suspended solids 10 mg l 1 and escherichia coli 10 cfu 100 ml 1 or 50 cfu 100 ml 1 for 80 of samples respectively in the case of conventional treatment systems or treatment wetland and lagooning the italian approach is much

fulfillment of high limitations implies high intensive treatments for the use of rw and consequently high costs not always sustainable for users the financial competitiveness of reuse projects compared to traditional water supply schemes is fundamental to support rw use frijns et al 2016 especially in developing countries conventionally the comparison of rw use system alternatives is only based on economic data provided in the feasibility study of the projects so that the alternative with minimum capital operation and maintenance o m costs is chosen zeng et al 2007 following the sustainable sanitation alliance andersson et al 2016 susana 2018 it is key to implement sanitation systems which are sustainable in order to be sustainable a sanitation system has to be not only economically viable socially acceptable and technically and institutionally appropriate it should also protect the environment and the natural resources the latter involves the required energy water and other natural resources for construction as well as o m of the system constructed wetland cws are among the wastewater treatment systems more environmentally sustainable involving the use of engineered technologies that are designed and realized to utilize natural processes these systems are designed to mimic natural wetland systems utilizing wetland plants soil and associated microorganisms to remove contaminants from rw effluents us epa 2012 cws can be adopted as a tertiary treatment technology due to their low o m costs and efficiency in treating rw from small and medium communities cws are used for treating various wastewater types and for polishing advanced treated water effluents for return to freshwater resources us epa 2012 toscano et al 2009 cws have been suggested as alternative for treating nitrate contaminated aquifers denitrification of nitrified sewage effluents and irrigation return flow baker 1998 mara 2013 moreover cws treated municipal effluent directed to irrigation may contain readily absorbable useful nutrients and easily biodegradable organics these substances are generally compatible with the limits imposed by the italian regulations m d 152 2006 for treated water discharged in water bodies cirelli et al 2012 castorina et al 2016 in order to give a contribution to the argument on the zero risk and calculated risk currently followed worldwide in this paper a removal efficiency in terms of both physical chemical and microbial analysis of two different tertiary treatment options for rw use in agriculture was carried out to evaluate a feasible reuse alternative a quantitative economic analysis was performed for both treatment options at full scale of application 2 methodology 2 1 experimental treatment options for rw use in agriculture based on constructed wetland technology based on cws technology two different tertiary treatment options were implemented at the experimental site these options were both finalized to rw use in agriculture the first option named extensive tertiary treatment system etts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system biological pond i e lagooning storage reservoir i e tank sand and disk filters the second option fig 1 named hybrid tertiary treatment system htts included in series horizontal sub surface constructed wetland system sand and disk filters and ultraviolet uv systems both tertiary treatment systems use rw coming from the same cw reed bed named h ssf3 in fig 1 the h ssf3 about 2000 m2 in operation since 2012 is planted with phragmites australis and designed to treat 2 l s the filtering bed is 0 6 m deep and filled with 8 10 mm of volcanic gravel this bed is part of the largest natural wwtp of the south italy it includes four h ssf reed beds followed by three batch rw storage reservoirs used as tertiary treatment of secondary effluent coming from a municipal wwtp to reuse in agriculture the cw system recovers annual overall wastewater about 315 000 m3 year about 860 m3 day in order to improve the microbiological water quality in the etts a part of the cw effluent about 3 m3 day 1 was collected in a lagoon biological pond of about 60 m3 then in a storage reservoir of about 100 m3 and finally it was pumped and then filtered by two sand filters and a disk filter 120 mesh disk filter with automatic backwash in the htts after the cw and sand filters treatment rw was pumped through disk filters 120 mesh disk filter with automatic backwash and finally a uv disinfection unit wedeco ag lbx 10 the uv unit was equipped with a three low pressure mercury lamps wavelength λ 254 nm that provide for a maximum flow rate of 6 m3 h 1 a minimum dose of 700 j cm 2 to the water minimum value for a efficiency water disinfection treatment with 70 transmittance the two treatment lines etts and htts were monitored by an intense sampling campaign during the period april september 2014 a simple one way analysis of variance anova was performed by using minitab 16 statistical software in order to comparethe removal efficiency as well as the main physical chemical and microbiological parameters at the outlet of both treatment systems fig 1 2 2 experimental irrigation field the irrigation plots were 30 m long fig 2 all plots supplied by etts htts and fresh water fw had polyethylene pipelines with external diameter of 16 mm and in line labyrinth drippers with a theoretical flow rate of 0 9 l h 1 at a pressure of 70 kpa emitters were spaced at 0 2 m and the distance between rows was of 1 1 m the experimental plots were equipped with drip irrigation systems consisting of surface di and sub surface sdi pipelines buried at a depth of 0 05 m these systems supplied rw or fw to experimental plots the emission uniformity eu of di and sdi systems was monitored during the trial as outlines by keller and karmeli 1975 eu was obtained by measuring the flow rate from 20 selected drippers per each water supplying pipeline of fig 2 tomato solanum licopersycum l cv missouri and eggplant solanum melongena l were both transplanted in may 2014 at density of 2 2 plants m 2 standard cultivation practices were adopted during the cropping season the same quantity of n 55 kg ha p2o5 110 kg ha and k2o 80 kg ha were applied uniformly to the experimental field by a single fertilization of etts htts effluents and fw castorina et al 2016 2 3 monitoring protocol and who exposure scenario the two treatment options were compared in terms of physical chemical removal and overall microbial disinfection performance at the light of both the italian regulation md 185 2003 and who 2006 guidelines fig 1 provide the schematic of the rw sampling points along the treatment lines physical chemical and microbial characteristics of rw were analysed approximately every 30 days during the experiment standard methods apha 2005 were adopted to determine total suspended solids tss at 105 c

2005 in the study in order to carry out comparisons the exposure scenario of unrestricted irrigation proposed by who in 2006 and based on the consumption of rw irrigated lettuce was considered the selected scenario corresponds to the controlled use of rw to grow crops that are normally eaten raw who 2006 in particular who 2006 guidelines consider a median design risk for rotavirus infection of 10 3 pppy per patient per year consisting in general of 2 3 log unit reductions due to rotavirus die off between last irrigation and consumption in particular according to who guidelines 2006 rw by the water treatment system could be used for vegetable crop irrigation by implementing some post treatment health protection control measures for example up to 5 log unit of microbial reduction could be achieved by washing the produce with clean water disinfection and peeling the application of these post treatment health protection control measures assures the required log units reduction of e coli for the tolerable rotavirus infection risk microbial contamination analysis of fruits was carried out following the methodology described in castorina et al 2016 for both tomato and eggplant analysing 5 samples of 500 g for each crop 2 4 economic analysis an economic analysis was carried out to further compare etts and htts options to be realistic of the effective continuous operation of both the treatment alternatives the analysis was performed at full scale by including the annual wastewater treated equal to 315 000 m3 year and a small reservoir 2500 m3 in order to enhance the buffer capability of the htts system because the year of construction for both treatment systems was 2014 only the o m costs were actualized the construction cost for each treatment option is given by the following equations eq 1 and 2 1 cc1 cr cp oc 2 cc2 cuv cr cp oc where cc1 and cc2 are construction total costs for the option 1 etts and 2 htts respectively cr is the construction cost of the reservoirs cuv is the cost for an ultra violet uv equipment cp is the cost for personnel oc represents the other costs expropriation and easements the o m costs include maintenance of reservoirs and man labour unskilled workers for the management of the etts maintenance of the small reservoir and uv equipment operation costs electricity consumption of uv equipment and man labour skilled workers for the management of htts monitoring costs for both treatment options consisting in sampling and analysis of the treated wastewater 12 sampling per year as required by italian law a 20 years life cycle was considered for both options for the htts in particular considering that the uv equipment has a life cycle of 15 years following italian rules for depreciation of assets ministerial decree of 28 march 1996 from the 16th year onwards a third of the total cost of a new uv equipment was taken into account o m costs during the 20 years life cycle were actualized present value pv as in the follows eq 3 3 o m p v i 1 20 c f i r i where o m pv represents the actualized present value pv of the total o m costs for the whole life cycle of the system i is the generic year cfi is the cash flow for the generic year r is the coefficient of actualization with an interest rate of 4 equal to 104 in order to have a comprehensive cost which also includes the rw use construction and monitoring costs of the irrigation systems have been evaluated these costs are the same for both etts and htts options moreover economic benefits related to rw same for both options were also included in the analysis in order to use the annual amount of rw 315 000 m3 two crops broccoli and tomato covering with their growing season the whole year were selected in particular the two selected crops have a 6 months growing period each tomato from april to september and broccoli from october to march therefore to define to maximum irrigated area by rw the annual rw volume was divided in two parts about 158 000 m3 each the irrigated area ha was then calculated dividing the six months volume by the water requirement for broccoli and tomato regione siciliana 2013 aiello et al 2013 construction and o m costs of the irrigation system were calculated on the basis of the irrigated areas the construction cost of the irrigation system was about 472 200 00 year 2014 this cost was evaluated by multiplying the irrigated area about 74 00 ha by the construction cost about 6400 00 ha table 1 the o m costs were 1 723 470 00 this cost was obtained maintaining the yearly o m cost constant and equal to 1720 00 ha year table 1 for the whole life cycle of the system 20 year moreover cash flows were then actualized to the year 2014 see eq 3 the actualized cost per unit of water m3 i e obtained dividing the construction plus o m actualized costs by the total available rw for 20 years period was equal to 0 35 m3 for both treatment options the economic benefit related to rw use practice was computed for the two selected crops by considering the following parameters employment increase in agriculture ei δday ha year job days increase per year and hectare due to crop conversion as a result of using the rw for irrigation rain fed versus irrigated agriculture hectare crop table sicilian region decree 5 march 2001 induced economic benefit ieb ha year economic benefit increase from selling of new crops

dataset inea rica arearica crea gov it all indicators were based on regional aggregated statistical data 3 results 3 1 bod5 tss and e coli concentrations along etts and htts lines average values of the main physical chemical characteristics of rw observed were summarized in table 2 and 3 for all the sampling points along etts and htts lines the number of samples collected for each point along both treatment systems was 13 bod5 and cod mean concentrations were reduced by about 70 by the etts and 80 by the htts respectively mean values of bod5 cod and tss always decreased along htts and etts lines the only exception to this behaviour is the storage reservation outlet at the etts where a worsening of the mean concentration values of the three parameters was observed probably due to the harmful algal bloom effect this effect can be due to the establishment of favourable conditions such as sunlight slow moving water as well as nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus that acting all together cause the algal growth that modify the quality of rw us epa 2017 bod5 concentration values resulted always below 20 mg l 1 during the observation period after both sand and disk filters along the etts with the exception of one sample collected at the beginning of june which reached the limit concentration bod5 values resulted always below 20 mg l 1 during the observation period after the uv treatment along the htts fig 3 both systems allowed a tss reduction of about 90 even if tss means were very close to the fixed limit of 10 mg l 1 tss concentration values resulted below 10 mg l 1 for about 90 of samples collected after sand and disk filters respectively along the etts similarly tss concentration values resulted below 10 mg l 1 for 11 13 and for 12 13 samples collected after the disk filter and uv treatment respectively along the htts fig 4 the etts reduced e coli mean concentration values up to 4 1e 01 cfu 100 ml 4 9e 01 and up to 3 4e 01 cfu 100 ml 4 2e 01 after the sand filter and the disk filter respectively in particular for 67 of the samples collected after both sand and disk filters e coli concentration values were below the mandatory limit of 50 cfu 100 ml fixed by the italian legislation in the case of treatment wetland or lagoon effluents e coli mean concentrations were reduced from 5 0e 05 to 1 6e 00 cfu 100 ml 5 0e 00 by the htts after the uv treatment as expected none of the rw samples analysed in the htts before the uv treatment had e coli concentrations below the mandatory limit of 50 cfu 100 ml e coli concentration values varied considerably during the trials at the different sampling points reaching values higher than 1e 06 cfu 100 ml at the inlet of the hssf 3 a percentage of 67 and 80 of samples collected after sand and disk filters along the etts respectively were below the limit of 50 cfu 100 ml for 80 of samples one sample collected after the sand filter and no samples collected after the disk filter exceeded the limit of 2e 02 cfu 100 ml fixed by the italian legislation for reuse m d 185 03 in the case of treatment wetland or lagoon effluents for 20 of samples no sample was below the limit of 50 cfu 100 ml before the uv treatment along the htts but all samples were below this limit after the uv treatment for two samples an increasing of e coli concentration up to values higher than 1 5e 02 cfu 100 ml was observed at the inlet of the irrigation system fig 5 salmonella was never detected in the rw samples collected at the different points along both the treatments lines 3 2 microbial contamination of fruits the mean presence of e coli observed for fruits drip irrigated or sub drip irrigated with rw from both etts and htts was similar table 4 the maximum e coli contamination did not reach significant values for eggplants and tomato irrigated by rw from both esst and hsst in particular the maximum value of e coli was observed in tomato fruits irrigated with rw from etts 1 7e 02 cfu 100 g salmonella was never detected on fruits data not shown 3 3 economic analysis of etts and htts for rw use table 5 reports construction and o m costs for both etts and htts options actualized to the year 2014 as expected the construction cost for the etts was higher while the htts had a higher o m costs the cost per m3 of water was similar between the different treatment options table 6 reports the available rw volumes for each crop the irrigation volumes for the reference crops i e broccoli and tomato and the corresponding maximum irrigation areas table 7 reports the economic benefits of rw use these economic benefits are equal for both options etts and htts 3 4 comparison of etts and htts for rw use table 8 shows the removal efficiency as well as the unit cost of rw for both treatment options the anova analysis revealed that htts allowed to obtain a higher removal efficiency for bod5 p 0 05 and e coli p 0 01 with respect to etts the removal efficiency for cod and tss was instead not significantly different between the two systems moreover the anova analysis applied between the values measured at the outlet of etts and htts revealed that ph nh4 n and ca and e coli were different at p 0 001 bod5 and sar were different at p 0 01 cod and cl were different at p 0 05 for the rest of the parameters the difference were not statistically significant between the two systems no micro climatic effect due to the lowering of the air temperature during winter negatively influenced the removal efficiency of the organic matter and the bacteriological component of the rw treated by both etts and htts the removal efficiency values found in the winter period were in line with the averages shown in table 8 4 discussion the htts treatment option allowed to respect the very restrictive physical chemical limits fixed by italian regulation standards for rw use in agriculture for bod5 cod and tss as well as a complete removal of the bacteriological e coli components of rw figs 3 5 on the other hand notwithstanding the microbial removal efficiency of etts was lower than that obtained by the htts e coli limit concentrations fixed by the italian regulation were matched moreover even if mean values of e coli found on fruits irrigated with rw from the etts were higher than for those irrigated with rw from the htts the maximum contamination never reached significant values similar results were obtained by castorina et al 2016 which reported values of e coli concentration up to 8e 01 cfu 100 g for drip and sub drip irrigated eggplant by fw rw treated by the etts showed e coli contamination always below the value of 1e 04 cfu 100 ml fixed by the world health organization in 2006 for the unrestricted irrigation scenario in order to reach a median design risk for rotavirus infection of 10 3 pppy per patient per year this approach considers feasible a 2 3 log unit reduction of e coli in rw due to rotavirus die off between last irrigation and consumption some of the post treatment health protection control measures suggested by who guidelines 2006 to reduce microbial contaminations incur no additional cost so they can help to reduce the rw use costs qadir et al 2010 the success of the implementation of some health protection measures for the reuse in agriculture was already reported for case studies in ghana senegal vietnam and india us epa 2012 even if the main european standards include additional preventive measures following this multiple barrier approach italian standards are not aligned to those preventive measures following the recently published proposal of the european directive for a regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse ec 2018 rw by the etts corresponded to b quality class being e coli concentration 100 cfu 100 ml for 90 of samples all methods are allowed to irrigate food crops consumed raw where the edible portion is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with rw quality class b ec 2018 the results of this study showed that natural treatment system recommended by the who for using rw in agriculture together with sand and disk filters can represent a reliable alternative to the high intensive disinfection treatment based on uv for example waste biological ponds are recommended by the who because of their effectiveness in removing nematodes eggs and helminths eggs a pathogen endemic within developing countries biological ponds have an advantage that they are very efficient and inexpensive both in terms of capital investment and o m costs salama et al 2014 a recent overview on different studies on natural and conventional disinfection technologies among others chlorine based disinfectants and uv radiation showed that even if the latter represent the most used treatments natural disinfection processes could represent valuable solutions due in particular to the absence of chemical reagents collivignarelli et al 2018 moreover the results of this study confirmed the removal efficiency of sand filters of about one log unit as reported in table 1 already showed in other studies de sanctis et al 2017 sand filter is an easy to handle and cost effective treatment technique which avoids toxicity concerns da costa et al 2014 the study also highlighted high values of emission uniformity keller and karmely 1975 evaluated for both di mean of about 95 and sdi mean of about 93 systems in cases of rw and fw supplying the irrigation system is therefore unsuitable for occlusion conditions that could affect the uniform water distribution to the plants the economic evaluation carried out using reference italian costs indicated that the treatment cost per m3 of rw was slightly higher for the etts than for the htts anyway the etts would be economically more advantageous than the htts by evaluating the construction cost in developing countries where the hourly labour cost per employee is significantly lower than in italy ilo 2018 moreover in both developed and undeveloped countries numerous advantages support the adoption of the etts option first of all the construction and the management simplicity does not need expert skills and makes the system suitable for developing countries second storage reservoirs included in the system adequately sized can also have seasonal regulation purpose making higher buffer capability of the etts and enhancing the resilience of the system to any eventual fluctuation of rw hydraulic and organic load the third aspect regards the search for alternative sanitation systems that are also sustainable from an energetic point of view as promoted by the sustainable sanitation alliance susan 2018 in our case the htts option including the uv system needs 199 728 kw h equal to 17 2 tonnes of oil equivalent toe to work continuously for 20 years while the etts option needs only energy for the pumping system this aspect is also linked with co2 emissions that is another factor that supports the etts option in fact the main co2 emission sources are electricity generation corresponding to the kwh requirement of the uv system for the htts option and direct co2 emissions from wastewater for the etts option because it includes the biological pond and the storage reservoir the total amount of co2 emissions produced by the htts option to work continuously for 20 years correspond to 70 384 kg co2 considering a co2 intensity of electricity coefficient of 0 352 kg co2 kwh 1evaluated for italy at the electric meter enea 2013 co2 emissions from wastewater instead are of biogenic origin therefore they should not be included in total national emissions doorn et al 2006 in other words following the methodology applied in lca studies ghg emissions are assessed based on the energy demand only molinos senante et al 2013 finally even if the htts may allow a higher rw microbiological quality it implies higher o m requirements i e intensive treatment energy costs o m expertise determining a higher environmental impact salama et al 2014 these aspects could condition the use of treatment systems in developing countries where actually most of rw is not treated qadir and sato 2016 therefore in the short term risk management and interim solutions are necessary to prevent adverse impacts from rw irrigation in developing countries a combination of source control and farm level and post treatment measures can be used to protect farm workers and consumers an approach that tends to the who guidelines 2006 for rw use could be more feasible on a general level to encourage the use of rw qadir et al 2010 alcade sanz and gawlik 2014 5 conclusion within the paradigm of the nature based solution systems i e constructed wetlands integrated with lagoons the study dealt with the evaluation of urban wastewater treatment process for reuse purposes using two different sanitation strategies htts versus etts the main difference between the two experimented treatment options is the use of uv disinfection in the htts results evidenced similar costs for cubic meter for rw as well as the comparable removal efficiency between the two treatment options in terms of cod and tss the removal efficiency of bod5 was instead lower for etts that for htts the intensive disinfection made the htts more efficient in terms of e coli removal anyway the rw by etts had microbial characteristics matching both the italian regulation standards and the who guidelines 2006 for the unrestricted irrigation scenario as well as the b quality class as defined in the proposed european directive on water reuse ec 2018 moreover e coli contamination on tomato and eggplant never reached significant values by using rw by both etts and htts total costs of rw were similar for both options anyway other benefits can support the choice of etts to treat rw for vegetable crop irrigation especially for rural areas in developing countries in particular the main advantages are construction and management simplicities use of unskilled workers low labour cost high buffer capability as well as environmental sustainability and co2 emission biogenic origin of the nature based solutions acknowledgements this work has been

11322,monitoring dynamics in wetting patterns under drip irrigation is important to optimize the frequency and duration of irrigation the emitter discharge rate and the spacing however difficulties in measurement of soil water content swc at high spatial and temporal resolution and in three dimensions 3d restricts direct monitoring around drip emitters indirect methods such as actively heated fiber optics ahfo has shown the potential to measure swc at sub meter intervals therefore the objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of the ahfo method to monitor 3d spatial and temporal variations in wetting patterns under a single drip emitter heat pulses of three minutes duration were applied at a rate of 20 wm 1 through a helically wrapped fiber optic cable in a soil column before during and after irrigation a distributed temperature sensing dts instrument was used to estimate the cumulative temperature increase tcum at locations along the cable an indirect relationship between tcum and swc was developed and validated using the swc measurements determined by the gravimetric method data from the network of 3d points from fiber optic cable were used to generate 3d surfaces of swc in comparison with the gravimetric method ahfo showed predictive accuracies root mean squared error rmse of 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 m3 m 3 n 17 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 0 3 m3 m 3 n 19 and 0 05 m3 m 3 for swc 0 3 m3 m 3 n 6 the time evolution of the 3d swc helped to identify wetting bulb formation movement of the wetting front and changes in the dimensions wetted radius and depth of wetting bulbs this study showed not only the potential of ahfo to help design drip emitters but also the ability to provide high resolution swc information to improve water movement models in the future

is dependent on the spacing between emitters and lines zur 1996 changes of wetting patterns during and after irrigation can be obtained by direct measurement using installed soil water sensors in the

diamantopoulos 2009 ismail et al 2006 kandelous and simunek 2010 lazarovitch et al 2007 drip irrigation however its application in in situ soils is somewhat limited by difficulty of parameterizing spatial temporal variation in soil properties and limited ability to simulate preferential flow processes šimůnek et al 2003 further studies have also used direct measurements among these hanson et al 2003 and badr and abuarab 2013 used neutron scattering to monitor soil water distribution patterns under surface and subsurface irrigation systems however the neutron probe measures soil water at coarse spatial resolutions under a drip emitter due to the large sphere of measurement and often fail to accurately represent the wetting patterns at single drip emitter scale disturbed gravimetric soil samples al mefleh and abu zreig 2013 kumar et al 2015 and point based swc measurement sensors such as tdr da silva et al 2009 dos santos et al 2016 capacitance probes fernández gálvez and simmonds 2006 and tension meters wang et al 2006 have also been used to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetting patterns under irrigation however most of these studies have allowed to characterize wetting patterns dynamics in two dimensional 2d due to lack spatially dense swc measurements around the drip emitters while three dimensional 3d wetting patterns could provide more insights into the changes of wr and wd in heterogeneous soils installation feasibility cost and between sensor variability sensitivity to salinity e g capacitance tdr probes restrict the use of point based sensors at high densities around a drip emitter consequently it affects the accurate characterization of wetting patterns under drip irrigation however fuentes 2005 and dalton et al 2015 used soil water measurements from a radial distribution of capacitance probes to develop 3d 2d maps of wetting patterns under drip irrigation and this study evidenced the potential of using such 3d 2d maps to evaluate various irrigation schedules and compare the performance of different irrigation systems despite the point based soil water sensors a few minimally invasive geophysical methods have been used to characterize and map the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetting patterns under drip irrigation the methods include electromagnetic induction sensors em coppola et al 2016 misra and padhi 2014 ground penetrating radar gpr saito and kitahara 2012 satriani et al 2015 and electrical resistivity imaging eri consoli et al 2017 puy et al 2017 despite their potential to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetting patterns both methods are hampered by highly conductive soils algeo et al 2016 and the poor correlation between the soil water and electrical resistivity at single emitter scale hardie et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to explore alternative soil water sensing techniques which could provide spatially dense soil water measurements at single drip emitter to field scales to better characterize the wetting patterns distributed temperature sensing dts systems are optoelectronic devices which are capable of measuring temperature both in space and time along a fiber optic cable dts systems have gained research interest in environmental temperature sensing due to their ability to measure temperature at sub meter intervals along a fiber optic cable to a distance 10 000 m and at high frequency selker et al 2006a 2006b tyler et al 2008 2009 westhoff et al 2007 dts observed temperatures can be used to estimate soil thermal properties using the principles of heat pulse probe methods weiss 2003 and subsequently swc when a line source of energy heat pulse is sent to a probe the resulting temperature change thermal response of the probe principally depends on the water content of the soil in addition to the soil mineralogy and bulk density bristow et al 1994 1993 a dts system resembles a single probe heat pulse sensor where the fiber optic cable serves as the probe and the optoelectronic device within the dts records temperature along the fiber optic cable a heat pulse can be generated by actively heating the fiber optic cable ahfo and the thermal response can be related to the water content in soil the ahfo method has been used to study the subsurface water movement but these earlier studies were restricted to the identification of dry wet and saturated soil perzlmaier et al 2004 2006 weiss 2003 and small changes were not detected at levels 6 volumetric water contents weiss 2003 sayde et al 2010 expanded the method by using the cumulative temperature increase tcum as the thermal response and reported more accurate swc measurements over a wide range further application of this method can also be found in field sayde et al 2014 and laboratory gil rodríguez et al 2013 studies however all these studies have mainly focused on the feasibility of 2d spatial width and depth swc measurements while the method has the potential to extend into 3d spatial width depth and length swc measurements e g helically wrapping the fiber optic cable laboratory or developing 3d grids field to study soil water movements in 3d three dimensional monitoring of the variations of swc is important for understanding rainfall or irrigation water infiltration redistribution of water within the root zone and transport of nutrients this is especially necessary for heterogeneous media such as soil where soil water shows great variations in both the vertical and in the horizontal directions flury et al 1994 dekker and ritsema 1994 the ahfo method can provide a dense array of radially distributed swc measurements under a drip emitter and would be useful to develop detailed 3d maps of soil water distributions through time with minimal soil disturbance therefore the objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of ahfo method to monitor 3d spatial and temporal variations in wetting patterns under a single drip emitter overall the results of this study will indicate if the ahfo method is a feasible tool to monitor 3d spatial and temporal variations in wetting patterns at a single drip emitter scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 distributed temperature sensing system a distributed temperature sensing dts linear pro series ap sensing germany consisting of two channels with a maximum measurement range of 4 km using laser transmission was used in this study the spatial resolution integrated length over which a single value of the temperature is recorded by the dts was 0 5 m and spatial sampling interval the minimum spatial distance between two consecutive measurement points in the measured temperature profile was 0 25 m the fiber optic cable brusteel brugg cable switzerland consisted of a stainless steel loose tube containing four multimode 50 μm cores and 125 μm cladding fibers surrounded by stainless steel strands which was further enclosed in a protective nylon jacket fig 1 a the external cable diameter was 3 8 mm a laser pulse generated by the dts instrument travelling along the fiber optic cable results in backscattered raman stokes and anti stokes photons due to collisions with electrons in the core of the glass fiber the dts estimates the temperature using the ratio of stokes to anti stokes and the elapsed time between the laser pulse and the observed returned light detailed information on the principle of temperature measurement using dts is well documented by kurashima et al 1990 and tyler et al 2009 while its application for environmental temperature monitoring can be found in selker et al 2006a 2006b 2 2 construction of soil column a soil column was built in a plastic barrel height of 0 85 m and diameter of 0 6 m and was stationed in the soil science laboratory of mcgill university in 2015 a plexiglas base with small perforations 0 005 m in diameter was constructed at a height of 0 15 m from the bottom of the column inside the column the fiber optic cable length 44 5 m was coiled in two concentric helixes with radii of 0 10 and 0 20 m fig 1b and spacing of 0 025 m between the turns forming a 3d network of 178 measurement points ten fiberglass rods 0 005 m diameter resting at the plexiglas base supported the helixes the measurement point network provided 3d spatial swc measurements depth width and length over time and was used to develop 3d surfaces of swc to explore the wetting bulb evolution and changes in its dimensions during irrigation after placing the helixes layers 0 02 m height of medium gravel 9 50 mm diameter were placed on the plexiglas base to facilitate free drainage from the column next the column was filled with sand median diameter of 0 26 mm at a fixed bulk density of 1 65 mg m 3 a total of 238 80 kg of sand calculated based on the volume of the barrel excluding the volume of fiber glass rods was added in controlled lifts of 20 kg 0 05 m height measured using a scale with a precision 0 1 kg finally the soil column had a diameter of 0 55 m diameter and 0 6 m height a pressure compensating emitter with a nominal discharge of 1 5 l h 1 connected to a silicon transparent tube was placed in the middle of the soil column fig 1c the drip emitter continuously supplied water at a rate of 25 ml per hour for 4 5 h at a constant pressure head 0 15 bars five calibrated commercial soil water content measurement sensors smec 300 spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa were installed horizontally at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m depths at distances approximately 0 035 and 0 06 m away from the inner and outer helixes respectively to monitor the wetting front changes 2 3 heating fiber optic cable to generate the heat pulses a few centimeters of the protective nylon jacket were removed at two points immediately outside the soil and two small battery clamps were connected to the metal sheath fig 1c a variable transformer tdgc 0 5kva variac canada was used to send heat pulses of three minutes duration at a power intensity of 20 wm 1 along the cable at 20 minute time intervals over the period of the experiment before during and after irrigation 5 5 h a power control unit consisting of a microcontroller atmega328 p arduino uno usa and a relay board was used to control the heat pulses to an accuracy of 0 001 s to calibrate the dts recorded temperature three sections of unburied fiber optic cable were coiled in two cold and one warm baths fig 2 temperatures of the calibration baths were measured by platinum resistance thermometers pt100 ap sensing germany water circulation using aquarium pumps ensured the uniformity of the temperature in each calibration bath a single ended measurement configuration sending laser pulse from one end of the cable was adopted in this study we followed the procedure described by hausner et al 2011 for dts temperature calibration the temperature at each individual sampling point from the locally measured stokes and anti stokes signals was found as 1 t z γ l n p s z p a s z c δ α z where γ represents the shift in energy between a photon at the wavelength of the incident laser and the scattered raman photon c is the time varying calibration parameter and δα is the differential attenuation between the anti stokes p a s z and stokes p s z signals in the fiber 2 4 calibration relationship and validation after the irrigation experiment the soil column was gravity drained for about two months to establish a soil water gradient in the soil column a total of 84 undisturbed volumetric soil samples were collected from the soil column in three steps 33 soil samples from 0 to 0 2 m depth 33 samples 0 2 0 4 m depth and finally 18 samples from 0 4 to 0 5 m depth before each sampling step three successive heat pulses 3 min long power intensity of 20 wm 1 and 20 min interval were sent this procedure allowed obtaining swc measurements over a wide range of value for calibration and validation soil water content was gravimetrically determined by oven drying at 105 c both swc measurements n 42 and tcum averaged over successive three heat pulses in each step at corresponding cable locations were used develop the tcum swc calibration relationship locations n 42 of measurements were collected approximately 0 05 m away from both cable helixes spanning from surface to bottom of the soil column the predictive accuracy of the calibration relationship was evaluated n 42 by estimating the root mean square error rmse only one calibration curve was used in this study assuming a homogenous bulk density and texture in the soil column however it should be noted that different calibration curves might be required for heterogeneous soil types and an experimental set up with a single calibration curve might produce errors in such situations 2 5 data analysis the integral of the cumulative temperature increase tcum during a heat pulse sayde et al 2010 was calculated at each point of the fiber optic cable as indicated by eq 2 2 t c u m 0 t 0 δ t d t and where t c u m is the integral of the cumulative temperature increase c s during the total time of integration t0 s at a given point of the cable δt is the dts recorded temperature change from the pre pulse temperature c tcum is a function of soil thermal properties such as the thermal conductivity higher thermal conductivity high swc will lead to a higher rate at which the heat is conducted away from the cable resulting in a low tcum at a given point on the cable in this study the average temperature calculated over five minutes prior to each heat pulse was used as the pre pulse temperature this average was subtracted from the temperature during the pulse to obtain the temperature increase δt tcum was then calculated as the sum of the values obtained by multiplying δt by the time interval 30 s between measurements accordingly tcum was calculated during every heat pulse at each point of the three dimensional network in the soil column tcum was normalized by power intensity q as ntcum using eq 3 and swc at each point of the fiber was subsequently obtained from the ntcum swc relationship 3 n t c u m n t c u m q swc values extracted from each location of the fiber were defined in a 3d cartesian coordinate system x y z and swc where z was the depth from the surface of the soil column and the drip emitter was considered as the x y origin kriging was used to interpolate between measured swcs to obtain 3d surfaces of the swc at times before during and after irrigation using fieldpro64 version 4 4 9 vladimir galouchko inc germany two perpendicular planes containing the axis of the soil column were used to visualize the swc variations in x y and z directions values of swc measured at each 0 05 m depth at radial distances of 0 1 and 0 2 m from the drip emitter were used to monitor the variations at point scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in temperature and thermal response temperature within the soil column showed a marked difference between before and immediately after a heat pulse fig 3 this was observable separately for 0 10 and 0 20 m helixes a maximum temperature difference of 23 8 c was observed between before and after heat pulse temperatures at the start of the experiment the commercial swc sensors showed an antecedent soil water gradient from the top dry to the bottom wet of the soil column an inverse relationship was observed in the spatial distribution of soil temperatures with higher temperature at the surface and lower at the bottom of the soil column both before and immediately after the heat pulse fig 3 two peaks of temperatures of about 65 c were observed at locations along the fiber optic cable where the electrical connections were made fig 3 temperature before during and after four heat pulses before 1 h 2 h and 3 h after irrigation at a given cable location within the top 0 05 m of the soil column showed the expected variations fig 4 the difference between the temperature before a heat pulse and the maximum temperature increase immediately after a heat pulse gradually decreased over time the maximum temperature immediately after a heat pulse was 44 9 39 5 37 3 36 4 c at times before 1 h 2 h and 3 h after irrigation respectively as the soil surrounding the cable became wet over time thermal response ntcum within 0 15 m depth was higher maximum 157 30 c s w 1m and it gradually became smaller minimum 86 50 c s w 1m at deeper layers which also indicated the presence of an antecedent soil water gradient in the soil column before the irrigation fig 5 a nevertheless ntcum responded well to the changes in wetting front during irrigation for example after 1 h irrigation ntcum at radial distance of 0 10 m from the drip emitter decreased from 157 30 maximum to 86 40 c s w 1m minimum within the top 0 20 m depth while the ntcum showed small decreases fig 5b at radial distances of 0 2 m right and left locations from the drip emitter it evidenced that the wetting front had reached around a 0 10 m radius but it has not exceeded 0 20 m after 1 h irrigation as the irrigation continued ntcum became more uniform throughout the soil column which indicated that the wetting front has spread vertically and horizontally after 4 h fig 5d the results suggested that ntcum responded well to the spatial and temporal variations of swc 3 2 calibration relationship an exponential relationship provided the best fit between swc and ntcum r2 0 96 with a relative error of 2 3 fig 6 a similarly shaped calibration curve between swc and tcum has been reported in previous studies with satisfactory accuracy sayde et al 2010 gil rodríguez et al 2013 sensitivity of the calibration curve was dependent on the actual swc in comparison with gravimetric measurements the accuracy of the predicted swc by the ahfo was the highest at dry to moderately wet soil conditions and was marginally lower at wet soil conditions rmse was 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 m3 m 3 n 17 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 0 3 m3 m 3 n 19 and 0 05 m3 m 3 for swc 0 3 m3 m 3 n 6 as the water content in the soil surrounding the fiber optic cable increases heat conduction away from the cable increases because the water s greater thermal conductivity decreases ntcum however as the soil water content increases further 0 3 m3 m 3 any increases in thermal conductivity are less rapid which results in ntcum being less sensitive to actual changes in swc 3 3 soil water content variations at point scale the swc at each 0 05 m depth interval at radial distances of 0 1 and 0 2 m from the drip emitter were extracted from the 3d network of measurement points to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the wetting pattern the ahfo predicted swc indicated the presence of a water content gradient before the irrigation there was no horizontal antecedent soil water gradient within the top 0 04 m depth however at deeper layers 0 40 0 55 m the soil was wetter near the edges of the soil column 0 20 m radial distance left and right compared to the soil at the center of the column 0 10 m radial distance fig 7 a c and e this might be due to the formation of preferential flow paths in the center of the soil column at deeper layers 0 40 0 55 m leading to higher amount of drainage from center compared to from sides the gradient with a depression at the center of the soil column might have also be contributed from the cohesion forces in the center over adhesion forces at sides however the variations were not completely identified due to limited number of point based soil water sensors soil water content at 0 05 and 0 10 m depths at a radial distance of 0 10 m increased up to 17 and 8 respectively after 40 min of irrigation which indicated that the wetting front had reached 0 10 m radial distance fig 7a contrary right and left 0 20 m helix locations showed no changes in swc fig 7c and e soil water content swc at 0 3 m depth just started increasing at a radial distance of 0 10 m from the drip emitter after 100 min while swc reached to 25 at 0 15 m depth after 100 min fig 7a this clearly showed a rapid vertical movement of water due to gravitational pull both right and left locations at a radial distance of 0 20 m from the emitter only started showing changes in swc within 0 30 m depth after 100 min of irrigation fig 7c and e this indicated that the wetting front had reached 0 20 m radial distance from the emitter after 100 min of irrigation after 2 h of irrigation watering swc further increased at locations of 0 10 m radial distance at 0 25 0 30 m depths and water started moving into deeper layers at 3 and 4 h of irrigation deeper layers 0 30 m became gradually wet in addition swc at radial distance of 0 20 m from the drip emitter increased after 3 and 4 h of irrigation at deeper layers 0 40 0 55 m depths fig 7d and f which also indicated horizontal movement of water over time and horizontal expansion of wetting bulb soil water contents at locations of 0 10 m radial distance showed a significant decrease an hour after terminating the irrigation fig 7b from 15 to 8 and 17 to 8 at 0 50 and 0 10 m depths respectively this suggested that the cable portion of 0 10 m helix within the top 0 10 m depth could detect the depletion of swc below the drip emitter after terminating the water supply further deeper layers 0 40 m depth became wet at the expense of water in upper layers this was more pronounced at depths of 0 40 0 50 m with high values of swc 30 35 3 4 formation of wetting bulbs three dimensional surfaces were used to describe the spatio temporal variations of swc and the formation and time evolution of wetting bulbs the presence of an antecedent gradient in swc was clearly visible in the pre irrigation map fig 8 bi soil at 0 05 m depth had 2 swc over the 0 20 m radial distance from the emitter soil water content gradually increased at the deeper layers of the column specific examination yields the presence of a slight increase in swc within the center of the volume at middle depths after the first 20 min of irrigation there was no wetting bulb formation detected map not shown this may have been due to the fact that the smallest radius of the helix was 0 10 m and the wetting front simply might not yet have reached a 0 10 m radial distance after 40 min of irrigation a wetting bulb with a wr around 0 10 m and a wd around 0 12 m was observed soil water content reached a range of 15 20 at 0 05 m below the drip emitter in subsequent figures the progression of the wetting bulb can be clearly seen as it spreads horizontally and vertically and the maximum swc is located at increasingly greater depths eventually the wetting bulb merges with the higher water content located at the base of the column after 4 h the swc within the column has become more uniform throughout the middle sections and the size of the local maximum has decreased in both magnitude and scale as water has diffused throughout a greater volume one hour after irrigation has ceased the swc immediately below the drip emitter within 0 10 m depth has decreased to levels that were measured at 0 20 m depth prior to irrigation after more time the pre irrigation near surface swc would be reached point swc measurements also showed the vertical changes with time fig 7 the wetting front is indicated as the depth where the swc is maximum and this position changes through time as the irrigation continues deeper layers of the soil column 0 40 0 55 m became wetter later in the experiment as the wetting front moved down vertically wetted radius wr and wd were approximately 0 10 and 0 12 m respectively after 40 min of irrigation however wd was larger 0 20 and 0 30 m compared to wr 0 15 and 0 25 m after an hour and 100 min of irrigation respectively wetting bulbs initially presented a more rounded or circular 40 min of irrigation with similar wd and wr capillary driven infiltration pulls the water into soil pores both vertically and horizontally as the irrigation continued gravity started pulling water into and through the soil pores which elongated the shape of the wetted bulb after an hour of irrigation fig 8 resulting in wd larger than wr formation of elongated wetted bulbs has been shown to occur rapidly in sandy soil hao et al 2007 after 100 min of irrigation the wetting front reached the horizontal boundary of the plastic barrel and this cuircumstance has caused prefrential flow along the boundary surface which can be clearly observed after 3 h of irrigation fig 8 there were no distinct spatial variations in x and y directions horizontal perhaps attributable to the homogeneity of the sand and the experimental set up horizontally preferential flow patterns were not observed during irrigation fig 8 likely indicating minimal compaction differences in the column the spatial mapping of swc clearly shows the utility of ahfo to render a representation of the 3d wetting bulb resulting from a single drip emitter the number of measurement points and configuration can be modified to suit the application one of the limitations of the method is the need for calibrations curves for different soils and or soil layers due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties such as bulk density and soil texture a field study using drip irrigation and ahfo by sayde et al 2014 found good correspondence between estimated swc and expected values when using a calibration obtained from the same soil depth range and that poorer results were obtained from layers where the soil texture differed from that in the calibration layer despite this limitation our study has shown the potential application of the ahfo method towards better understanding of the spatial patterning of the drip irrigation wetting bulb through time 4 conclusions this study was an initial test to examine the feasibility of the ahfo method to predict swc and provide data on the 3d spatial variations in wetting patterns under drip irrigation the ahfo method predicted swc distributions within a 0 03 0 05 m3 m 3 accuracy range under single drip emitter the 3d surfaces of swc clearly identified the wetting bulb formation its movement with time and changes in its dimensions this showed the potential of the method to visually track the changes of water infiltration and movement in 3d space which could be a useful tool to understand the dynamics of soil water and solutes in the root zone 5 potentials and limitations for future work the ahfo method would be a useful tool to compare the wd and wr of various water applications rates in heterogenous soils at small scales e g soil column and results of such studies could be used for example to help optimize the design and implementation of drip irrigation emitters in the future the ability to configure the measurement design in the field along with the ability to provide swc information at sub meter spatial resolutions along the fiber optic cable has great potential for use in the development and validation of models of soil water dynamics for example intensive 3d monitoring network of soil water could be developed using parallel cable transects placed at depths in the field and soil water data could be used to adjust the inputs of hydrological models e g hydrus 2d 3d to minimize the error and to improve the model s representation of real field conditions it would be interesting to compare the ahfo measured and modelled e g hydrus or wetup soil water distributions under drip emitters in the future one of the limitations of the ahfo method is the necessity of soil specific calibrations therefore more research is needed to document the impact of heterogeneous soils installation of fiber optic cable at desired depths with a good soil contact and minimal soil disturbance is also a challenge similar to the point based soil water sensors such as tdr and capacitance sensors impact of transient nature of soil contact after cable installation on soil water measurements need to be studied in future acknowledgements this project was funded by grants from frqnt fonds de recherche du québec nature et technologies 2015 nc 180817

11322,monitoring dynamics in wetting patterns under drip irrigation is important to optimize the frequency and duration of irrigation the emitter discharge rate and the spacing however difficulties in measurement of soil water content swc at high spatial and temporal resolution and in three dimensions 3d restricts direct monitoring around drip emitters indirect methods such as actively heated fiber optics ahfo has shown the potential to measure swc at sub meter intervals therefore the objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of the ahfo method to monitor 3d spatial and temporal variations in wetting patterns under a single drip emitter heat pulses of three minutes duration were applied at a rate of 20 wm 1 through a helically wrapped fiber optic cable in a soil column before during and after irrigation a distributed temperature sensing dts instrument was used to estimate the cumulative temperature increase tcum at locations along the cable an indirect relationship between tcum and swc was developed and validated using the swc measurements determined by the gravimetric method data from the network of 3d points from fiber optic cable were used to generate 3d surfaces of swc in comparison with the gravimetric method ahfo showed predictive accuracies root mean squared error rmse of 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 m3 m 3 n 17 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 0 3 m3 m 3 n 19 and 0 05 m3 m 3 for swc 0 3 m3 m 3 n 6 the time evolution of the 3d swc helped to identify wetting bulb formation movement of the wetting front and changes in the dimensions wetted radius and depth of wetting bulbs this study showed not only the potential of ahfo to help design drip emitters but also the ability to provide high resolution swc information to improve water movement models in the future

is dependent on the spacing between emitters and lines zur 1996 changes of wetting patterns during and after irrigation can be obtained by direct measurement using installed soil water sensors in the soil or through simulation models such as hydrus 2 d šimůnek et al 2016 and wetup cook et al 2003 there are a considerable number of studies that have used modeling to quantify the soil water content

diamantopoulos 2009 ismail et al 2006 kandelous and simunek 2010 lazarovitch et al 2007 drip irrigation however its application in in situ soils is somewhat limited by difficulty of parameterizing spatial temporal variation in soil properties and limited ability to simulate preferential flow processes šimůnek et al 2003 further studies have also used direct measurements among these hanson et al 2003 and badr and abuarab 2013 used neutron scattering to monitor soil water distribution patterns under surface and subsurface irrigation systems however the neutron probe measures soil water at coarse spatial resolutions under a drip emitter due to the large sphere of measurement and often fail to accurately represent the wetting patterns at single drip emitter scale disturbed gravimetric soil samples al mefleh and abu zreig 2013 kumar et al 2015 and point based swc measurement sensors such as tdr da silva et al 2009 dos santos et al 2016 capacitance probes fernández gálvez and simmonds 2006 and tension meters wang et al 2006 have also been used to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetting patterns under irrigation however most of these studies have allowed to characterize wetting patterns dynamics in two dimensional 2d due to lack spatially dense swc measurements around the drip emitters while three dimensional 3d wetting patterns could provide more insights into the changes of wr and wd in heterogeneous soils installation feasibility cost and between sensor variability sensitivity to salinity e g capacitance tdr probes restrict the use of point based sensors at high densities around a drip emitter consequently it affects the accurate characterization of wetting patterns under drip irrigation however fuentes 2005 and dalton et al 2015 used soil water measurements from a radial distribution of capacitance probes to develop 3d 2d maps of wetting patterns under drip irrigation and this study evidenced the potential of using such 3d 2d maps to evaluate various irrigation schedules and compare the performance of different irrigation systems despite the point based soil water sensors a few minimally invasive geophysical methods have been used to characterize and map the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetting patterns under drip irrigation the methods include electromagnetic induction sensors em coppola et al 2016 misra and padhi 2014 ground penetrating radar gpr saito and kitahara 2012 satriani et al 2015 and electrical resistivity imaging eri consoli et al 2017 puy et al 2017 despite their potential to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetting patterns both methods are hampered by highly conductive soils algeo et al 2016 and the poor correlation between the soil water and electrical resistivity at single emitter scale hardie et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to explore alternative soil water sensing techniques which could provide spatially dense soil water measurements at single drip emitter to field scales to better characterize the wetting patterns distributed temperature sensing dts systems are optoelectronic devices which are capable of measuring temperature both in space and time along a fiber optic cable dts systems have gained research interest in environmental temperature sensing due to their ability to measure temperature at sub meter intervals along a fiber optic cable to a distance 10 000 m and at high frequency selker et al 2006a 2006b tyler et al 2008 2009 westhoff et al 2007 dts observed temperatures can be used to estimate soil thermal properties using the principles of heat pulse probe methods weiss 2003 and subsequently swc when a line source of energy heat pulse is sent to a probe the resulting temperature change thermal response of the probe principally depends on the water content of the soil in addition to the soil mineralogy and bulk density bristow et al 1994 1993 a dts system resembles a single probe heat pulse sensor where the fiber optic cable serves as the probe and the optoelectronic device within the dts records temperature along the fiber optic cable a heat pulse can be generated by actively heating the fiber optic cable ahfo and the thermal response can be related to the water content in soil the ahfo method has been used to study the subsurface water movement but these earlier studies were restricted to the identification of dry wet and saturated soil perzlmaier et al 2004 2006 weiss 2003 and small changes were not detected at levels 6 volumetric water contents weiss 2003 sayde et al 2010 expanded the method by using the cumulative temperature increase tcum as the thermal response and reported more accurate swc measurements over a wide range further application of this method can also be found in field sayde et al 2014 and laboratory gil rodríguez et al 2013 studies however all these studies have mainly focused on the feasibility of 2d spatial width and depth swc measurements while the method has the potential to extend into 3d spatial width depth and length swc measurements e g helically wrapping the fiber optic cable laboratory or developing 3d grids field to study soil water movements in 3d three dimensional monitoring of the variations of swc is important for understanding rainfall or irrigation water infiltration redistribution of water within the root zone and transport of nutrients this is especially necessary for heterogeneous media such as soil where soil water shows great variations in both the vertical and in the horizontal directions flury et al 1994 dekker and ritsema 1994 the ahfo method can provide a dense array of radially distributed swc measurements under a drip emitter and would be useful to develop detailed 3d maps of soil water distributions through time with minimal soil disturbance therefore the objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of ahfo method to monitor 3d spatial and temporal variations in wetting patterns under a single drip emitter overall the results of this study will indicate if the ahfo method is a feasible tool to monitor 3d spatial and temporal variations in wetting patterns at a single drip emitter scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 distributed temperature sensing system a distributed temperature sensing dts linear pro series ap sensing germany consisting of two channels with a maximum measurement range of 4 km using laser transmission was used in this study the spatial resolution integrated length over which a single value of the temperature is recorded by the dts was 0 5 m and spatial sampling interval the minimum spatial distance between two consecutive measurement points in the measured temperature profile was 0 25 m the fiber optic cable brusteel brugg cable switzerland consisted of a stainless steel loose tube containing four multimode 50 μm cores and 125 μm cladding fibers surrounded by stainless steel strands which was further enclosed in a protective nylon jacket fig 1 a the external cable diameter was 3 8 mm a laser pulse generated by the dts instrument travelling along the fiber optic cable results in backscattered raman stokes and anti stokes photons due to collisions with electrons in the core of the glass fiber the dts estimates the temperature using the ratio of stokes to anti stokes and the elapsed time between the laser pulse and the observed returned light detailed information on the principle of temperature measurement using dts is well documented by kurashima et al 1990 and tyler et al 2009 while its application for environmental temperature monitoring can be found in selker et al 2006a 2006b 2 2 construction of soil column a soil column was built in a plastic barrel height of 0 85 m and diameter of 0 6 m and was stationed in the soil science laboratory of mcgill university in 2015 a plexiglas base with small perforations 0 005 m in diameter was constructed at a height of 0 15 m from the bottom of the column inside the column the fiber optic cable length 44 5 m was coiled in two concentric helixes with radii of 0 10 and 0 20 m fig 1b and spacing of 0 025 m between the turns forming a 3d network of 178 measurement points ten fiberglass rods 0 005 m diameter resting at the plexiglas base supported the helixes the measurement point network provided 3d spatial swc measurements depth width and length over time and was used to develop 3d surfaces of swc to explore the wetting bulb evolution and changes in its dimensions during irrigation after placing the helixes layers 0 02 m height of medium gravel 9 50 mm diameter were placed on the plexiglas base to facilitate free drainage from the column next the column was filled with sand median diameter of 0 26 mm at a fixed bulk density of 1 65 mg m 3 a total of 238 80 kg of sand calculated based on the volume of the barrel excluding the volume of fiber glass rods was added in controlled lifts of 20 kg 0 05 m height measured using a scale with a precision 0 1 kg finally the soil column had a diameter of 0 55 m diameter and 0 6 m height a pressure compensating emitter with a nominal discharge of 1 5 l h 1 connected to a silicon transparent tube was placed in the middle of the soil column fig 1c the drip emitter continuously supplied water at a rate of 25 ml per hour for 4 5 h at a constant pressure head 0 15 bars five calibrated commercial soil water content measurement sensors smec 300 spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa were installed horizontally at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m depths at distances approximately 0 035 and 0 06 m away from the inner and outer helixes respectively to monitor the wetting front changes 2 3 heating fiber optic cable to generate the heat pulses a few centimeters of the protective nylon jacket were removed at two points immediately outside the soil and two small battery clamps were connected to the metal sheath fig 1c a variable transformer tdgc 0 5kva variac canada was used to send heat pulses of three minutes duration at a power intensity of 20 wm 1 along the cable at 20 minute time intervals over the period of the experiment before during and after irrigation 5 5 h a power control unit consisting of a microcontroller atmega328 p arduino uno usa and a relay board was used to control the heat pulses to an accuracy of 0 001 s to calibrate the dts recorded temperature three sections of unburied fiber optic cable were coiled in two cold and one warm baths fig 2 temperatures of the calibration baths were measured by platinum resistance thermometers pt100 ap sensing germany water circulation using aquarium pumps ensured the uniformity of the temperature in each calibration bath a single ended measurement configuration sending laser pulse from one end of the cable was adopted in this study we followed the procedure described by hausner et al 2011 for dts temperature calibration the temperature at each individual sampling point from the locally measured stokes and anti stokes signals was found as 1 t z γ l n p s z p a s z c δ α z where γ represents the shift in energy between a photon at the wavelength of the incident laser and the scattered raman photon c is the time varying calibration parameter and δα is the differential attenuation between the anti stokes p a s z and stokes p s z signals in the fiber 2 4 calibration relationship and validation after the irrigation experiment the soil column was gravity drained for about two months to establish a soil water gradient in the soil column a total of 84 undisturbed volumetric soil samples were collected from the soil column in three steps 33 soil samples from 0 to 0 2 m depth 33 samples 0 2 0 4 m depth and finally 18 samples from 0 4 to 0 5 m depth before each sampling step three successive heat pulses 3 min long power intensity of 20 wm 1 and 20 min interval were sent this procedure allowed obtaining swc measurements over a wide range of value for calibration and validation soil water content was gravimetrically determined by oven drying at 105 c both swc measurements n 42 and tcum averaged over successive three heat pulses in each step at corresponding cable locations were used develop the tcum swc calibration relationship locations n 42 of measurements were collected approximately 0 05 m away from both cable helixes spanning from surface to bottom of the soil column the predictive accuracy of the calibration relationship was evaluated n 42 by estimating the root mean square error rmse only one calibration curve was used in this study assuming a homogenous bulk density and texture in the soil column however it should be noted that different calibration curves might be required for heterogeneous soil types and an experimental set up with a single calibration curve might produce errors in such situations 2 5 data analysis the integral of the cumulative temperature increase tcum during a heat pulse sayde et al 2010 was calculated at each point of the fiber optic cable as indicated by eq 2 2 t c u m 0 t 0 δ t d t and where t c u m is the integral of the cumulative temperature increase c s during the total time of integration t0 s at a given point of the cable δt is the dts recorded temperature change from the pre pulse temperature c tcum is a function of soil thermal properties such as the thermal conductivity higher thermal conductivity high swc will lead to a higher rate at which the heat is conducted away from the cable resulting in a low tcum at a given point on the cable in this study the average temperature calculated over five minutes prior to each heat pulse was used as the pre pulse temperature this average was subtracted from the temperature during the pulse to obtain the temperature increase δt tcum was then calculated as the sum of the values obtained by multiplying δt by the time interval 30 s between measurements accordingly tcum was calculated during every heat pulse at each point of the three dimensional network in the soil column tcum was normalized by power intensity q as ntcum using eq 3 and swc at each point of the fiber was subsequently obtained from the ntcum swc relationship 3 n t c u m n t c u m q swc values extracted from each location of the fiber were defined in a 3d cartesian coordinate system x y z and swc where z was the depth from the surface of the soil column and the drip emitter was considered as the x y origin kriging was used to interpolate between measured swcs to obtain 3d surfaces of the swc at times before during and after irrigation using fieldpro64 version 4 4 9 vladimir galouchko inc germany two perpendicular planes containing the axis of the soil column were used to visualize the swc variations in x y and z directions values of swc measured at each 0 05 m depth at radial distances of 0 1 and 0 2 m from the drip emitter were used to monitor the variations at point scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in temperature and thermal response temperature within the soil column showed a marked difference between before and immediately after a heat pulse fig 3 this was observable separately for 0 10 and 0 20 m helixes a maximum temperature difference of 23 8 c was observed between before and after heat pulse temperatures at the start of the experiment the commercial swc sensors showed an antecedent soil water gradient from the top dry to the bottom wet of the soil column an inverse relationship was observed in the spatial distribution of soil temperatures with higher temperature at the surface and lower at the bottom of the soil column both before and immediately after the heat pulse fig 3 two peaks of temperatures of about 65 c were observed at locations along the fiber optic cable where the electrical connections were made fig 3 temperature before during and after four heat pulses before 1 h 2 h and 3 h after irrigation at a given cable location within the top 0 05 m of the soil column showed the expected variations fig 4 the difference between the temperature before a heat pulse and the maximum temperature increase immediately after a heat pulse gradually decreased over time the maximum temperature immediately after a heat pulse was 44 9 39 5 37 3 36 4 c at times before 1 h 2 h and 3 h after irrigation respectively as the soil surrounding the cable became wet over time thermal response ntcum within 0 15 m depth was higher maximum 157 30 c s w 1m and it gradually became smaller minimum 86 50 c s w 1m at deeper layers which also indicated the presence of an antecedent soil water gradient in the soil column before the irrigation fig 5 a nevertheless ntcum responded well to the changes in wetting front during irrigation for example after 1 h irrigation ntcum at radial distance of 0 10 m from the drip emitter decreased from 157 30 maximum to 86 40 c s w 1m minimum within the top 0 20 m depth while the ntcum showed small decreases fig 5b at radial distances of 0 2 m right and left locations from the drip emitter it evidenced that the wetting front had reached around a 0 10 m radius but it has not exceeded 0 20 m after 1 h irrigation as the irrigation continued ntcum became more uniform throughout the soil column which indicated that the wetting front has spread vertically and horizontally after 4 h fig 5d the results suggested that ntcum responded well to the spatial and temporal variations of swc 3 2 calibration relationship an exponential relationship provided the best fit between swc and ntcum r2 0 96 with a relative error of 2 3 fig 6 a similarly shaped calibration curve between swc and tcum has been reported in previous studies with satisfactory accuracy sayde et al 2010 gil rodríguez et al 2013 sensitivity of the calibration curve was dependent on the actual swc in comparison with gravimetric measurements the accuracy of the predicted swc by the ahfo was the highest at dry to moderately wet soil conditions and was marginally lower at wet soil conditions rmse was 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 m3 m 3 n 17 0 03 m3 m 3 for swc 0 05 0 3 m3 m 3 n 19 and 0 05 m3 m 3 for swc 0 3 m3 m 3 n 6 as the water content in the soil surrounding the fiber optic cable increases heat conduction away from the cable increases because the water s greater thermal conductivity decreases ntcum however as the soil water content increases further 0 3 m3 m 3 any increases in thermal conductivity are less rapid which results in ntcum being less sensitive to actual changes in swc 3 3 soil water content variations at point scale the swc at each 0 05 m depth interval at radial distances of 0 1 and 0 2 m from the drip emitter were extracted from the 3d network of measurement points to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the wetting pattern the ahfo predicted swc indicated the presence of a water content gradient before the irrigation there was no horizontal antecedent soil water gradient within the top 0 04 m depth however at deeper layers 0 40 0 55 m the soil was wetter near the edges of the soil column 0 20 m radial distance left and right compared to the soil at the center of the column 0 10 m radial distance fig 7 a c and e this might be due to the formation of preferential flow paths in the center of the soil column at deeper layers 0 40 0 55 m leading to higher amount of drainage from center compared to from sides the gradient with a depression at the center of the soil column might have also be contributed from the cohesion forces in the center over adhesion forces at sides however the variations were not completely identified due to limited number of point based soil water sensors soil water content at 0 05 and 0 10 m depths at a radial distance of 0 10 m increased up to 17 and 8 respectively after 40 min of irrigation which indicated that the wetting front had reached 0 10 m radial distance fig 7a contrary right and left 0 20 m helix locations showed no changes in swc fig 7c and e soil water content swc at 0 3 m depth just started increasing at a radial distance of 0 10 m from the drip emitter after 100 min while swc reached to 25 at 0 15 m depth after 100 min fig 7a this clearly showed a rapid vertical movement of water due to gravitational pull both right and left locations at a radial distance of 0 20 m from the emitter only started showing changes in swc within 0 30 m depth after 100 min of irrigation fig 7c and e this indicated that the wetting front had reached 0 20 m radial distance from the emitter after 100 min of irrigation after 2 h of irrigation watering swc further increased at locations of 0 10 m radial distance at 0 25 0 30 m depths and water started moving into deeper layers at 3 and 4 h of irrigation deeper layers 0 30 m became gradually wet in addition swc at radial distance of 0 20 m from the drip emitter increased after 3 and 4 h of irrigation at deeper layers 0 40 0 55 m depths fig 7d and f which also indicated horizontal movement of water over time and horizontal expansion of wetting bulb soil water contents at locations of 0 10 m radial distance showed a significant decrease an hour after terminating the irrigation fig 7b from 15 to 8 and 17 to 8 at 0 50 and 0 10 m depths respectively this suggested that the cable portion of 0 10 m helix within the top 0 10 m depth could detect the depletion of swc below the drip emitter after terminating the water supply further deeper layers 0 40 m depth became wet at the expense of water in upper layers this was more pronounced at depths of 0 40 0 50 m with high values of swc 30 35 3 4 formation of wetting bulbs three dimensional surfaces were used to describe the spatio temporal variations of swc and the formation and time evolution of wetting bulbs the presence of an antecedent gradient in swc was clearly visible in the pre irrigation map fig 8 bi soil at 0 05 m depth had 2 swc over the 0 20 m radial distance from the emitter soil water content gradually increased at the deeper layers of the column specific examination yields the presence of a slight increase in swc within the center of the volume at middle depths after the first 20 min of irrigation there was no wetting bulb formation detected map not shown this may have been due to the fact that the smallest radius of the helix was 0 10 m and the wetting front simply might not yet have reached a 0 10 m radial distance after 40 min of irrigation a wetting bulb with a wr around 0 10 m and a wd around 0 12 m was observed soil water content reached a range of 15 20 at 0 05 m below the drip emitter in subsequent figures the progression of the wetting bulb can be clearly seen as it spreads horizontally and vertically and the maximum swc is located at increasingly greater depths eventually the wetting bulb merges with the higher water content located at the base of the column after 4 h the swc within the column has become more uniform throughout the middle sections and the size of the local maximum has decreased in both magnitude and scale as water has diffused throughout a greater volume one hour after irrigation has ceased the swc immediately below the drip emitter within 0 10 m depth has decreased to levels that were measured at 0 20 m depth prior to irrigation after more time the pre irrigation near surface swc would be reached point swc measurements also showed the vertical changes with time fig 7 the wetting front is indicated as the depth where the swc is maximum and this position changes through time as the irrigation continues deeper layers of the soil column 0 40 0 55 m became wetter later in the experiment as the wetting front moved down vertically wetted radius wr and wd were approximately 0 10 and 0 12 m respectively after 40 min of irrigation however wd was larger 0 20 and 0 30 m compared to wr 0 15 and 0 25 m after an hour and 100 min of irrigation respectively wetting bulbs initially presented a more rounded or circular 40 min of irrigation with similar wd and wr capillary driven infiltration pulls the water into soil pores both vertically and horizontally as the irrigation continued gravity started pulling water into and through the soil pores which elongated the shape of the wetted bulb after an hour of irrigation fig 8 resulting in wd larger than wr formation of elongated wetted bulbs has been shown to occur rapidly in sandy soil hao et al 2007 after 100 min of irrigation the wetting front reached the horizontal boundary of the plastic barrel and this cuircumstance has caused prefrential flow along the boundary surface which can be clearly observed after 3 h of irrigation fig 8 there were no distinct spatial variations in x and y directions horizontal perhaps attributable to the homogeneity of the sand and the experimental set up horizontally preferential flow patterns were not observed during irrigation fig 8 likely indicating minimal compaction differences in the column the spatial mapping of swc clearly shows the utility of ahfo to render a representation of the 3d wetting bulb resulting from a single drip emitter the number of measurement points and configuration can be modified to suit the application one of the limitations of the method is the need for calibrations curves for different soils and or soil layers due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties such as bulk density and soil texture a field study using drip irrigation and ahfo by sayde et al 2014 found good correspondence between estimated swc and expected values when using a calibration obtained from the same soil depth range and that poorer results were obtained from layers where the soil texture differed from that in the calibration layer despite this limitation our study has shown the potential application of the ahfo method towards better understanding of the spatial patterning of the drip irrigation wetting bulb through time 4 conclusions this study was an initial test to examine the feasibility of the ahfo method to predict swc and provide data on the 3d spatial variations in wetting patterns under drip irrigation the ahfo method predicted swc distributions within a 0 03 0 05 m3 m 3 accuracy range under single drip emitter the 3d surfaces of swc clearly identified the wetting bulb formation its movement with time and changes in its dimensions this showed the potential of the method to visually track the changes of water infiltration and movement in 3d space which could be a useful tool to understand the dynamics of soil water and solutes in the root zone 5 potentials and limitations for future work the ahfo method would be a useful tool to compare the wd and wr of various water applications rates in heterogenous soils at small scales e g soil column and results of such studies could be used for example to help optimize the design and implementation of drip irrigation emitters in the future the ability to configure the measurement design in the field along with the ability to provide swc information at sub meter spatial resolutions along the fiber optic cable has great potential for use in the development and validation of models of soil water dynamics for example intensive 3d monitoring network of soil water could be developed using parallel cable transects placed at depths in the field and soil water data could be used to adjust the inputs of hydrological models e g hydrus 2d 3d to minimize the error and to improve the model s representation of real field conditions it would be interesting to compare the ahfo measured and modelled e g hydrus or wetup soil water distributions under drip emitters in the future one of the limitations of the ahfo method is the necessity of soil specific calibrations therefore more research is needed to document the impact of heterogeneous soils installation of fiber optic cable at desired depths with a good soil contact and minimal soil disturbance is also a challenge similar to the point based soil water sensors such as tdr and capacitance sensors impact of transient nature of soil contact after cable installation on soil water measurements need to be studied in future acknowledgements this project was funded by grants from frqnt fonds de recherche du québec nature et technologies 2015 nc 180817

11323,film mulching drip irrigation technology has been widely promoted and used in arid regions however few studies have simulated the water balance process under film mulching drip irrigation in our study the water movement in different soil layers and the distributions of evaporation and transpiration were evaluated using the hydrus 2d model long term continuous observations of evapotranspiration soil evaporation crop transpiration and soil moisture in a maize field under film mulching drip irrigation were conducted using an eddy covariance system micro lysimeters stem flow gauges and soil water sensors from 2014 to 2016 in northwest china experimental data were collected to calibrate and validate the model results showed that the accuracy of hydrus 2d was satisfactory in deep soil layers and that the rmses root mean square errors of the 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm soil layers were 0 022 cm3 cm 3 0 018 cm3 cm 3 0 014 cm3 cm 3 and 0 010 cm3 cm 3 respectively thus the model could be improved to better simulate soil water in surface soil layers the results suggest that hydrus 2d can generally be used to simulate the actual evaporation ea transpiration ta and evapotranspiration eta in a maize field under film mulching drip irrigation with the res relative errors of 1 7 11 06 and 8 27 respectively the simulation error of eta mainly stemmed from the simulation error of ta and the error contribution was 91 02 therefore further studies that consider the effects of film mulching drip irrigation are needed to improve the root water uptake and the et calculation modules and enhance the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model keywords film mulching drip irrigation water balance hydrus 2d model maize evapotranspiration 1 introduction film mulching drip irrigation is a new type of irrigation technology that combines drip irrigation with plastic film coverage hou et al 2010 unlike traditional drip irrigation in film mulching drip irrigation a drip irrigation pipe system is first deployed at the soil surface and a layer of plastic film is used to cover the drip irrigation pipe zone and soil surface hence film mulching drip irrigation technology combines the advantages of film mulching technology such as soil temperature enhancement and entropy conservation cook et al 2006 ghosh et al 2006 and drip irrigation technology such as water and fertilizer savings bowen and frey 2002 romic et al 2003 and yield increasing cheng and zhang 2000 sun and li 2004 this technology has been widely used for various types of food crops cash crops fruit trees and flowers tiwari et al 2003 singh et al 2007 hou et al 2010 yaghi et al 2013 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b in china the film mulching drip irrigation technology has been applied over approximately 4 7 million hm2 in 29 cities and used in the cultivation of more than 40 crop types including major field crops such as wheat maize and cotton which have exhibited yields that increased by more than 30 on average differing from traditional irrigation types such as border irrigation furrow irrigation and drip irrigation film mulching drip irrigation is synergistically affected by both drip irrigation and film mulching which influence the soil water infiltration patterns and boundary conditions determining how to accurately simulate the water balance process of a cropland system under film mulching drip irrigation has become a popular research topic and attracted considerable attention in the field of hydrology water balance theory is the basis for water cycles in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in recent years many studies have been conducted to understand the spac mechanisms and have modelled the spac process chen et al 2008 manzoni et al 2012 jian et al 2014 chamizo et al 2016 due to the long period and high cost of field experiments using models to predict the water balance in croplands is a cost effective method because of the development of computers forkutsa et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2011 currently the commonly used models include swap swat and hydrus of these models hydrus 2d can accurately simulate the water migration process in two dimensional unsaturated soil with flexible boundary conditions and thus provides an important tool for simulating the cropland water balance tang 2011 modelling drip irrigation has become a popular application of hydrus 2d ever since skaggs et al 2004 successfully compared hydrus 2d simulations of drip irrigation with experimental observations šimůnek et al 2016 and then li et al 2004 2005 hanson et al 2006 2008 2009 roberts et al 2008 2009 selim et al 2012 2013 wang et al 2014 did a lot of similar research on drip irrigation however few studies focused on drip irrigation under mulched conditions for example liu et al 2013 used hydrus 2d to simulate the temporal variations in the soil water content of a drip irrigated cotton field under mulching li et al 2015a li et al 2015b used hydrus 2d 3d to evaluate the soil water distribution under a mulched drip irrigation system in an intercropping tomato and corn field evapotranspiration et is one of the most important components of the hydrological cycle and the results of et estimations and analyses are crucial for effectively assessing the hydrology of a reconstructed landscape and for improving the associated design efficiency izadifar and elshorbagy 2013 the penman monteith model mu et al 2005 shuttleworth wallace model li et al 2013 vegsyst model gimenez et al 2013 aquacrop model and simdualkc model ran et al 2017 have been used for evapotranspiration estimation however limited research has focused on hydrus 2d simulation results in this context ma et al 2011 used hydrus 1d with a modified resistance equation to simulate the et of winter wheat and summer corn under flooding irrigation and the simulations were calibrated with eddy covariance data phogat et al 2017 used hydrus 2d to estimate the water balance and et components of subsurface drip irrigated chardonnay wine grapes and the simulated values were then used to estimate the actual crop coefficients and water productivity currently hydrus 2d is mainly used for evaluations of various irrigation schemes studies of root water uptake and groundwater recharge and analyses of the transport of agricultural contaminants šimůnek et al 2016 although this model has been widely used for different crops irrigation systems and mulches maize one of the most important crops has been rarely studied using hydrus 2d under film mulching drip irrigation and the simulations of evaporation and transpiration are particularly rare further studies of film mulching drip irrigation are needed with a focus on scientifically establishing the boundary conditions of the relevant models and evaluating the accuracies of estimated soil water and et values using the hydrus 2d model therefore in our study long term continuous observations of et soil evaporation crop transpiration and soil moisture in a maize field under film mulching drip irrigation were made using an eddy covariance system micro lysimeters stem flow gauges and cs616 soil water sensors from 2014 to 2016 in arid northwest china with these observations the accuracies of the soil water and et simulations based on the hydrus 2d model were evaluated and the error sources of the et simulation were analysed to provide a reference and basis for improving and optimizing the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and description the field experiments in 2014 and 2015 were conducted in a demonstration area of seeding maize under film mulching drip irrigation this area is part of a state owned farm the experiment in 2016 was conducted at shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university both sites are located in wuwei city gansu province northwest china n 37 52 e 102 50 elevation of 1581 m the region is located in a typical continental temperate climate zone with 164 mm of annual precipitation and 2000 mm of mean annual pan evaporation moreover the average annual duration of sunshine is 3000 h the mean annual temperature is 8 and the annual cumulative temperature 0 is 3550 the groundwater table at the station is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2015a b 2 2 experimental design the width and interval of the plastic mulches were 1 2 m and 0 4 m respectively and 4 seed rows and 2 drip lines were covered emitters were located every 0 3 m along the drip line and the discharge rate was 3 2 l h 1 the distance between neighboring drip lines under the same mulch was 0 6 m the seeding maize was planted parallel to the drip lines with a row spacing of 0 25 m and planting spacing of 0 22 m to provide evidence for improving the local field management the irrigation amount and frequency during testing were consistent with the local standards 2 3 measurements in the maize field as one of the most popular flux observation instruments the eddy covariance ec system has the advantages of high measurement precision and fast sampling frequency in 2014 and 2015 a new open path ec system model ec150 was installed in the maize field notably the site had a very wide area of 2000 m 1000 m that provided adequate fetch the system consisted of a co2 h2o open path gas analyser model ec150 three temperature and rh probes model hmp 155 a a kipp zonen radiometer model cnr4 two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 a set of water content reflectometers model cs616 a set of soil thermocouple probes model tcav and an infrared radiometer model s1 111 these instruments have been described by qin et al 2016 in 2016 the ec system was moved to a new experimental site with an area of 400 m 200 m as described in section 2 1 the probes were the same as those used in the ec system from 2014 to 2015 the ec150 and cnr4 sensors were installed 4 0 m above the ground level and the hmp155 a sensors were set at heights of 2 m 4 m and 6 m additionally the hfp01 plates were set at a depth of 5 cm below the mulched soil and bare soil respectively five cs616 sensors were installed at 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 8 m 1 0 m and the measured soil water content was calibrated based on the oven drying method the ec flux data were collected by a cr3000 data logger and then converted into available data 30 minute interval with loggernet software due to the influences of weather and some other factors eddypro software was used to assess and correct the data before further analysis the linear interpolation method was used for data gap filling when less than 4 observations were missed and the mdv mean diurnal variation method was adopted when five or more observes were missing falge et al 2001 stem flow gauges flow32 1 k dynamax co usa were used to collect maize transpiration measurements the probes were installed on eight maize stems at the end of the jointing stage and data were collected with cr1000 data logger the stem heat balance method shb described in detail by kigalu 2007 was used to measure the sap flow and transpiration rate in the plant stems three micro lysimeters were buried under the mulch and three others were set between mulch areas all these micro lysimeters were weighted at 7 00 am and 7 00 pm daily to determine the amount of soil water evaporation the irrigation amount was controlled by water meters and the leaf area was measured every week using a steel tape the precipitation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were recorded by an automatic weather station h21001 onset computer crop cape cod ma usa the data were sampled every 5 s and calculations were made every 15 min by a data logger table 1 the distributions of precipitation and irrigation were showed in fig 1 3 numerical modelling 3 1 model description hydrus 2d software šimůnek et al 2011 can simulate two or three dimensional axially symmetric water flow and root water uptake based on finite element numerical solutions of the flow equations a wide range of boundary conditions irregular boundaries and soil heterogeneities can be implemented in the model ajdary et al 2007 because the emitter spacing along a dripline was relatively small 0 3 m in our field experiments the individual emitters can be ignored and the drip tubing can be considered a line source with infiltration and redistribution as a two dimensional vertical plane process skaggs et al 2004 disregarding the effects of temperature and gas on soil water movement and assuming that the soil is a porous media with a homogeneous and isotropic structure the two dimensional movement of water in soil was described by the richards equation šimůnek et al 2011 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z s x z h where θ is the

empirical parameters that describe the nonsymmetrical root geometrics in the horizontal and vertical directions and both are set to 1 0 vrugt et al 2001 3 2 initial and boundary conditions the initial water contents of the surface and bottom soil layers within the simulation domain were obtained from the measurements obtained prior to seeding and a linear distribution with depth was assumed due to the special arrangement of maize under the film mulching drip irrigation system the different parts of the soil profile had different boundaries as illustrated in fig 2 a no flux boundary was applied at the sides of the flow domain aa ff due to the deep groundwater table at the experimental sites far below the simulation domain a free drainage boundary was considered at the bottom af at the surface a variable flux boundary was set below the emitters c d a no flux boundary was established under the mulch bc cd de and an atmospheric boundary was set at the soil surface ab ef in hydrus 2d instead of entering atmospheric fluxes it is possible to enter separate potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp fluxes based on lai leaf area index and the extinction coefficient to determine

2014 9 7 134d 2015 4 26 2015 9 4 132d 2016 4 20 2016 9 4 138d due to the large change in the soil water content at depths between 0 cm and 100 cm wang et al 2015 four observation nodes 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm were inserted into the domain model simulated values were compared with measured values and the values of the calibrated parameters were selected from the run when simulated values and measured values were sufficiently similar the soil hydraulic parameters in 2014 calibration and 2015 validation are shown in table 2 however because different experimental sites were studied in 2014 2015 and 2016 the parameters differ due to the limited quantity of observational data the parameters were not validated for the 2016 experiment and this is an area of focus for further research the

the simulated and measured soil water content at various depths in 2014 2015 and 2016 in the 20 cm and 40 cm soil layers both the simulated and measured soil water content considerably increased following a precipitation or irrigation event and then gradually decreased due to et it is not necessary to consider the drainage and runoff in this experimental region at deeper depths 60 cm and 80 cm conversely the variance in soil water was less obvious in the 20 cm and 60 cm soil layers the simulated values were higher than the measured values and the mbes were 0 0128 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0081 cm3 cm 3 respectively in the 40 cm and 80 cm soil layers however the simulated values were lower than the measured values with mbes of 0 0092 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0077 cm3 cm 3 respectively these differences can potentially be attributed to the simplification of the hydraulic parameters of the soil at depths of 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm xi et al 2016 the hydrus 2d results might be substantially improved if the effective soil hydraulic parameters are calibrated based on the results of a dynamic flow experiment kandelous and s imůnek 2010 in 2015 the simulated values of irrigation peaks at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm were 1 3 days earlier than the measured peak values potentially because of the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in the field in 2016 the fluctuation in the soil water content was relatively large but the simulated values were still exhibited good agreement with the measured values with ias of 0 72 0 81 although some deviations between simulations and measurements occurred in some cases the overall accuracy of the hydrus 2d model for simulating the soil water content was satisfactory during the three years the rmse values decreased with increasing of soil depth notably in the 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm soil layers the respective rmses exhibited the following descending order 0 021 cm3 cm 3 0 015 cm3 cm 3 0 015 cm3 cm 3 0 010 cm3 cm 3 2014 0 027 cm3 cm 3 0 020 cm3 cm 3 0 012 cm3 cm 3 0 008 cm3 cm 3 2015 and 0 019 cm3 cm 3 0 018 cm3 cm 3 0 016 cm3 cm 3 0 012 cm3 cm 3 2016 table 3 this result agreed well with that of yao et al 2011 who used hydrus 2d to simulate the soil water dynamics in a section of jujube root zone and the rmae root mean absolute error values in the 20 cm 60 cm 80 cm 100 cm layers below a drip tube were 14 2 13 0 1 1 1 0 respectively one possible reason for these variations was that the root water uptake activity was most intensive in shallow soil zone xi et al 2013 in addition in the upper soil layers rainfall infiltration and soil evaporation considerably influence the soil water content and subsequently result in estimation deviations xi et al 2016 the average values of mbe rmsr and ia values were 0 0010 cm3 cm 3 0 0153 cm3 cm 3 0 705 2014 0 0071 cm3 cm 3 0 0168 cm3 cm 3 0 628 2015 0 0002 cm3 cm 3 0 0163 cm3 cm 3 0 78 2016 moreover these values were comparable to the results obtained by skaggs et al 2004 and kandelous et al 2011 therefore it can be concluded that the accuracy of the simulations for all 4 soil layers was satisfactory and that the hydrus 2d model can reflect the dynamic changes in soil water at different depths 4 2 simulation of evapotranspiration et crop transpiration t and soil water evaporation e are the main mechanisms by which water is cycled in cropland areas and the ratio of t and et are very important for understanding the ecological mechanisms of crop water transport reynolds et al 2000 law et al 2002 scanlon et al 2005 however few studies have modelled e t and et and compared the simulated results with observed data to evaluate hydrus 2d for predicting et and provide support for field management in this study we used the constructed hydrus 2d model to calculate the daily actual e t and et fig 4 from 2014 to 2016 the rmse values of ea ta and eta exhibited the following increasing order 0 522 mm d 1 1 663 mm d 1 1 766 mm d 1 2014 0 545 mm d 1 0 692 mm d 1 0 957 mm d 1 2015 0 619 mm d 1 0 812 mm d 1 0 869 mm d 1 2016 the eta error was influenced by accumulated ea and ta errors the average mbes in the three years were 0 0173 mm d 1 ea 0 3017 mm d 1 ta 0 2844 mm d 1 eta the rmse and mbe values of ta were potentially large because the water consumption of maize is complicated and there were many factors that influenced the measurements and simulations of transpiration as described in detail in the following paragraph the ias were 0 69 ea 0 91 ta and 0 85 eta indicating that the simulated ea and ta values agreed well with the measured values table 4 in 2014 the simulated ea values exhibited high consistency with the measured ea values with a re of 4 22 specially the total simulated and measured values were 113 53 mm and 108 93 mm respectively for transpiration during each growth period the simulated ta values were closed to the measured ta excluding those form the seeding stage in which the simulated ta was significantly lower than the measured ta with a ratio of only 0 29 notably the overall ratio was 0 85 for the actual et the simulated and measured values were similar regardless of the period with a ratio of 0 89 or growth stage with a ratio ranging from 0 65 to 1 16 table 5 in 2015 and 2016 the simulated transpiration similarly to that in 2014 was much lower than the measured transpiration during the seeding stage this difference was potentially because that the stem flow gauges were installed on the maize only after the stem was longer than 20 cm thus relatively large errors existed between the simulations and measurements before the middle shooting stage another possible reason was the influence of radiation which is the main factor that influences stem flow therefore considerable attention should focus on properly using stem flow instruments mackay et al 2010 hydrus 2d overestimated the actual evaporation during the seeding period but underestimated it until the maturity stage the precision of micro lysimeters was associated closely with the frequency of irrigation or precipitation and measurements can be easily to be inaccurate if not change the soil timely sun et al 2005 the plants were initially weak with narrow leaf width and short roots these features led to low water consumption and large area of bare soil hence the transpiration rate was low and the evaporation rate was high with the growth of crops the lai gradually increased and the root water uptake and transpiration also increased the different errors of different growth stages to some extent suggest that the lai influenced the model accuracy in this study the surface resistance which was used to calculate etp was obtained based on the average lai value allen et al 1998 but this approach was originally based on the assumption of dense vegetation and is not appropriate when the leaf area is small therefore the model precision was low during the seeding stage second the ep and tp model inputs were obtained via the beer equation with a simplified extinction coefficient based solely on the lai however these values are also associated with the solar altitude qi et al 2011 so this issue may result in some errors in the simulation results and should be considered more comprehensively in the future interestingly the simulated transpiration values were lower than the measured values and the simulated evaporation values were always larger than measured values during the early growth stage in the medium late growth stages the opposite scenario was generally observed the accuracy of hydrus 2d for simulating transpiration and evaporation showed that there was a compensation effect between evaporation and transpiration for relatively high and low simulated and measured values in the three study years the res of ea and ta were 1 7 and 11 06 respectively hydrus 2d underestimated et with a re of 8 27 and this finding was similar to the results of mailhol et al 2011 and phogat et al 2013 overall although the model results for all growth stages were not always good hydrus 2d can be used as a tool to accurately simulate the total e t and et during the entire growth period the error contributions of e and t to total et are shown in fig 5 the simulation error source for et mainly stemmed from the simulation error of t which was 99 26 83 18 and 90 63 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively by contrast the et error associated with e accounted for only 0 74 16 82 and 9 37 of the error in these years the results indicated that the version of hydrus 2d used in this study does not consider time variable root growth as previously noted by roberts et al 2009 ramos et al 2012 karandish and šimůnek 2016 in addition various environmental factors such as temperature soil water availability and soil strength can influence root development especially at the suboptimal experimental sites in this study hartmann et al 2018 additionally the complicated roots distribution of maize under film mulching drip irrigation significantly varied from the root distributions observed for other traditional irrigation methods thus the root growth modelling may be inadequate and requires additional studies yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b 5 conclusions the feasibility of using the hydrus 2d model to evaluate the water balance under film mulching drip irrigation was validated with field experiment data from 2014 to 2016 the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 the hydrus 2d model exhibited high accuracy in simulations of the soil water content under film mulching drip irrigation and was generally able to accurately capture the dynamic water changes in various soil layers however the accuracy of the soil water simulations in the surface soil layers must be improved 2 hydrus 2d can generally be used to simulate the evaporation and transpiration process for maize under film mulching drip irrigation an error contribution analysis showed that the simulation errors of hydrus 2d particularly for et mainly stemmed from the simulation of crop transpiration further studies that consider the effects of film mulching drip irrigation are required to improve the root water uptake and the et calculation modules and enhance the accuracy of hydrus 2d acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the careful and precise reviews by the anonymous reviewers their efforts considerably improved the manuscript and study this work was financially supported by the chinese national natural science fund 51622907 51621061 and 51622903 
11323,film mulching drip irrigation technology has been widely promoted and used in arid regions however few studies have simulated the water balance process under film mulching drip irrigation in our study the water movement in different soil layers and the distributions of evaporation and transpiration were evaluated using the hydrus 2d model long term continuous observations of evapotranspiration soil evaporation crop transpiration and soil moisture in a maize field under film mulching drip irrigation were conducted using an eddy covariance system micro lysimeters stem flow gauges and soil water sensors from 2014 to 2016 in northwest china experimental data were collected to calibrate and validate the model results showed that the accuracy of hydrus 2d was satisfactory in deep soil layers and that the rmses root mean square errors of the 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm soil layers were 0 022 cm3 cm 3 0 018 cm3 cm 3 0 014 cm3 cm 3 and 0 010 cm3 cm 3 respectively thus the model could be improved to better simulate soil water in surface soil layers the results suggest that hydrus 2d can generally be used to simulate the actual evaporation ea transpiration ta and evapotranspiration eta in a maize field under film mulching drip irrigation with the res relative errors of 1 7 11 06 and 8 27 respectively the simulation error of eta mainly stemmed from the simulation error of ta and the error contribution was 91 02 therefore further studies that consider the effects of film mulching drip irrigation are needed to improve the root water uptake and the et calculation modules and enhance the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model keywords film mulching drip irrigation water balance hydrus 2d model maize evapotranspiration 1 introduction film mulching drip irrigation is a new type of irrigation technology that combines drip irrigation with plastic film coverage hou et al 2010 unlike traditional drip irrigation in film mulching drip irrigation a drip irrigation pipe system is first deployed at the soil surface and a layer of plastic film is used to cover the drip irrigation pipe zone and soil surface hence film mulching drip irrigation technology combines the advantages of film mulching technology such as soil temperature enhancement and entropy conservation cook et al 2006 ghosh et al 2006 and drip irrigation technology such as water and fertilizer savings bowen and frey 2002 romic et al 2003 and yield increasing cheng and zhang 2000 sun and li 2004 this technology has been widely used for various types of food crops cash crops fruit trees and flowers tiwari et al 2003 singh et al 2007 hou et al 2010 yaghi et al 2013 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b in china the film mulching drip irrigation technology has been applied over approximately 4 7 million hm2 in 29 cities and used in the cultivation of more than 40 crop types including major field crops such as wheat maize and cotton which have exhibited yields that increased by more than 30 on average differing from traditional irrigation types such as border irrigation furrow irrigation and drip irrigation film mulching drip irrigation is synergistically affected by both drip irrigation and film mulching which influence the soil water infiltration patterns and boundary conditions determining how to accurately simulate the water balance process of a cropland system under film mulching drip irrigation has become a popular research topic and attracted considerable attention in the field of hydrology water balance theory is the basis for water cycles in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in recent years many studies have been conducted to understand the spac mechanisms and have modelled the spac process chen et al 2008 manzoni et al 2012 jian et al 2014 chamizo et al 2016 due to the long period and high cost of field experiments using models to predict the water balance in croplands is a cost effective method because of the development of computers forkutsa et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2011 currently the commonly used models include swap swat and hydrus of these models hydrus 2d can accurately simulate the water migration process in two dimensional unsaturated soil with flexible boundary conditions and thus provides an important tool for simulating the cropland water balance tang 2011 modelling drip irrigation has become a popular application of hydrus 2d ever since skaggs et al 2004 successfully compared hydrus 2d simulations of drip irrigation with experimental observations šimůnek et al 2016 and then li et al 2004 2005 hanson et al 2006 2008 2009 roberts et al 2008 2009 selim et al 2012 2013 wang et al 2014 did a lot of similar research on drip irrigation however few studies focused on drip irrigation under mulched conditions for example liu et al 2013 used hydrus 2d to simulate the temporal variations in the soil water content of a drip irrigated cotton field under mulching li et al 2015a li et al 2015b used hydrus 2d 3d to evaluate the soil water distribution under a mulched drip irrigation system in an intercropping tomato and corn field evapotranspiration et is one of the most important components of the hydrological cycle and the results of et estimations and analyses are crucial for effectively assessing the hydrology of a reconstructed landscape and for improving the associated design efficiency izadifar and elshorbagy 2013 the penman monteith model mu et al 2005 shuttleworth wallace model li et al 2013 vegsyst model gimenez et al 2013 aquacrop model and simdualkc model ran et al 2017 have been used for evapotranspiration estimation however limited research has focused on hydrus 2d simulation results in this context ma et al 2011 used hydrus 1d with a modified resistance equation to simulate the et of winter wheat and summer corn under flooding irrigation and the simulations were calibrated with eddy covariance data phogat et al 2017 used hydrus 2d to estimate the water balance and et components of subsurface drip irrigated chardonnay wine grapes and the simulated values were then used to estimate the actual crop coefficients and water productivity currently hydrus 2d is mainly used for evaluations of various irrigation schemes studies of root water uptake and groundwater recharge and analyses of the transport of agricultural contaminants šimůnek et al 2016 although this model has been widely used for different crops irrigation systems and mulches maize one of the most important crops has been rarely studied using hydrus 2d under film mulching drip irrigation and the simulations of evaporation and transpiration are particularly rare further studies of film mulching drip irrigation are needed with a focus on scientifically establishing the boundary conditions of the relevant models and evaluating the accuracies of estimated soil water and et values using the hydrus 2d model therefore in our study long term continuous observations of et soil evaporation crop transpiration and soil moisture in a maize field under film mulching drip irrigation were made using an eddy covariance system micro lysimeters stem flow gauges and cs616 soil water sensors from 2014 to 2016 in arid northwest china with these observations the accuracies of the soil water and et simulations based on the hydrus 2d model were evaluated and the error sources of the et simulation were analysed to provide a reference and basis for improving and optimizing the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and description the field experiments in 2014 and 2015 were conducted in a demonstration area of seeding maize under film mulching drip irrigation this area is part of a state owned farm the experiment in 2016 was conducted at shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university both sites are located in wuwei city gansu province northwest china n 37 52 e 102 50 elevation of 1581 m the region is located in a typical continental temperate climate zone with 164 mm of annual precipitation and 2000 mm of mean annual pan evaporation moreover the average annual duration of sunshine is 3000 h the mean annual temperature is 8 and the annual cumulative temperature 0 is 3550 the groundwater table at the station is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2015a b 2 2 experimental design the width and interval of the plastic mulches were 1 2 m and 0 4 m respectively and 4 seed rows and 2 drip lines were covered emitters were located every 0 3 m along the drip line and the discharge rate was 3 2 l h 1 the distance between neighboring drip lines under the same mulch was 0 6 m the seeding maize was planted parallel to the drip lines with a row spacing of 0 25 m and planting spacing of 0 22 m to provide evidence for improving the local field management the irrigation amount and frequency during testing were consistent with the local standards 2 3 measurements in the maize field as one of the most popular flux observation instruments the eddy covariance ec system has the advantages of high measurement precision and fast sampling frequency in 2014 and 2015 a new open path ec system model ec150 was installed in the maize field notably the site had a very wide area of 2000 m 1000 m that provided adequate fetch the system consisted of a co2 h2o open path gas analyser model ec150 three temperature and rh probes model hmp 155 a a kipp zonen radiometer model cnr4 two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 a set of water content reflectometers model cs616 a set of soil thermocouple probes model tcav and an infrared radiometer model s1 111 these instruments have been described by qin et al 2016 in 2016 the ec system was moved to a new experimental site with an area of 400 m 200 m as described in section 2 1 the probes were the same as those used in the ec system from 2014 to 2015 the ec150 and cnr4 sensors were installed 4 0 m above the ground level and the hmp155 a sensors were set at heights of 2 m 4 m and 6 m additionally the hfp01 plates were set at a depth of 5 cm below the mulched soil and bare soil respectively five cs616 sensors were installed at 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 8 m 1 0 m and the measured soil water content was calibrated based on the oven drying method the ec flux data were collected by a cr3000 data logger and then converted into available data 30 minute interval with loggernet software due to the influences of weather and some other factors eddypro software was used to assess and correct the data before further analysis the linear interpolation method was used for data gap filling when less than 4 observations were missed and the mdv mean diurnal variation method was adopted when five or more observes were missing falge et al 2001 stem flow gauges flow32 1 k dynamax co usa were used to collect maize transpiration measurements the probes were installed on eight maize stems at the end of the jointing stage and data were collected with cr1000 data logger the stem heat balance method shb described in detail by kigalu 2007 was used to measure the sap flow and transpiration rate in the plant stems three micro lysimeters were buried under the mulch and three others were set between mulch areas all these micro lysimeters were weighted at 7 00 am and 7 00 pm daily to determine the amount of soil water evaporation the irrigation amount was controlled by water meters and the leaf area was measured every week using a steel tape the precipitation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were recorded by an automatic weather station h21001 onset computer crop cape cod ma usa the data were sampled every 5 s and calculations were made every 15 min by a data logger table 1 the distributions of precipitation and irrigation were showed in fig 1 3 numerical modelling 3 1 model description hydrus 2d software šimůnek et al 2011 can simulate two or three dimensional axially symmetric water flow and root water uptake based on finite element numerical solutions of the flow equations a wide range of boundary conditions irregular boundaries and soil heterogeneities can be implemented in the model ajdary et al 2007 because the emitter spacing along a dripline was relatively small 0 3 m in our field experiments the individual emitters can be ignored and the drip tubing can be considered a line source with infiltration and redistribution as a two dimensional vertical plane process skaggs et al 2004 disregarding the effects of temperature and gas on soil water movement and assuming that the soil is a porous media with a homogeneous and isotropic structure the two dimensional movement of water in soil was described by the richards equation šimůnek et al 2011 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z s x z h where θ is the

empirical parameters that describe the nonsymmetrical root geometrics in the horizontal and vertical directions and both are set to 1 0 vrugt et al 2001 3 2 initial and boundary conditions the initial water contents of the surface and bottom soil layers within the simulation domain were obtained from the measurements obtained prior to seeding and a linear distribution with depth was assumed due to the special arrangement of maize under the film mulching drip irrigation system the different parts of the soil profile had different boundaries as illustrated in fig 2 a no flux boundary was applied at the sides of the flow domain aa ff due to the deep groundwater table at the experimental sites far below the simulation domain a free drainage boundary was considered at the bottom af at the surface a variable flux boundary was set below the emitters c d a no flux boundary was established under the mulch bc cd de and an atmospheric boundary was set at the soil surface ab ef in hydrus 2d instead of entering atmospheric fluxes it is possible to enter separate potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp fluxes based on lai leaf area index and the extinction coefficient to determine the actual evaporation and transpiration rate outputs of the atmospheric and variable boundaries in this study the reference et was calculated by the penman monteith equation allen e t a l 1998 4 e t

the simulated and measured soil water content at various depths in 2014 2015 and 2016 in the 20 cm and 40 cm soil layers both the simulated and measured soil water content considerably increased following a precipitation or irrigation event and then gradually decreased due to et it is not necessary to consider the drainage and runoff in this experimental region at deeper depths 60 cm and 80 cm conversely the variance in soil water was less obvious in the 20 cm and 60 cm soil layers the simulated values were higher than the measured values and the mbes were 0 0128 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0081 cm3 cm 3 respectively in the 40 cm and 80 cm soil layers however the simulated values were lower than the measured values with mbes of 0 0092 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0077 cm3 cm 3 respectively these differences can potentially be attributed to the simplification of the hydraulic parameters of the soil at depths of 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm xi et al 2016 the hydrus 2d results might be substantially improved if the effective soil hydraulic parameters are calibrated based on the results of a dynamic flow experiment kandelous and s imůnek 2010 in 2015 the simulated values of irrigation peaks at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm were 1 3 days earlier than the measured peak values potentially because of the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in the field in 2016 the fluctuation in the soil water content was relatively large but the simulated values were still exhibited good agreement with the measured values with ias of 0 72 0 81 although some deviations between simulations and measurements occurred in some cases the overall accuracy of the hydrus 2d model for simulating the soil water content was satisfactory during the three years the rmse values decreased with increasing of soil depth notably in the 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm soil layers the respective rmses exhibited the following descending order 0 021 cm3 cm 3 0 015 cm3 cm 3 0 015 cm3 cm 3 0 010 cm3 cm 3 2014 0 027 cm3 cm 3 0 020 cm3 cm 3 0 012 cm3 cm 3 0 008 cm3 cm 3 2015 and 0 019 cm3 cm 3 0 018 cm3 cm 3 0 016 cm3 cm 3 0 012 cm3 cm 3 2016 table 3 this result agreed well with that of yao et al 2011 who used hydrus 2d to simulate the soil water dynamics in a section of jujube root zone and the rmae root mean absolute error values in the 20 cm 60 cm 80 cm 100 cm layers below a drip tube were 14 2 13 0 1 1 1 0 respectively one possible reason for these variations was that the root water uptake activity was most intensive in shallow soil zone xi et al 2013 in addition in the upper soil layers rainfall infiltration and soil evaporation considerably influence the soil water content and subsequently result in estimation deviations xi et al 2016 the average values of mbe rmsr and ia values were 0 0010 cm3 cm 3 0 0153 cm3 cm 3 0 705 2014 0 0071 cm3 cm 3 0 0168 cm3 cm 3 0 628 2015 0 0002 cm3 cm 3 0 0163 cm3 cm 3 0 78 2016 moreover these values were comparable to the results obtained by skaggs et al 2004 and kandelous et al 2011 therefore it can be concluded that the accuracy of the simulations for all 4 soil layers was satisfactory and that the hydrus 2d model can reflect the dynamic changes in soil water at different depths 4 2 simulation of evapotranspiration et crop transpiration t and soil water evaporation e are the main mechanisms by which water is cycled in cropland areas and the ratio of t and et are very important for understanding the ecological mechanisms of crop water transport reynolds et al 2000 law et al 2002 scanlon et al 2005 however few studies have modelled e t and et and compared the simulated results with observed data to evaluate hydrus 2d for predicting et and provide support for field management in this study we used the constructed hydrus 2d model to calculate the daily actual e t and et fig 4 from 2014 to 2016 the rmse values of ea ta and eta exhibited the following increasing order 0 522 mm d 1 1 663 mm d 1 1 766 mm d 1 2014 0 545 mm d 1 0 692 mm d 1 0 957 mm d 1 2015 0 619 mm d 1 0 812 mm d 1 0 869 mm d 1 2016 the eta error was influenced by accumulated ea and ta errors the average mbes in the three years were 0 0173 mm d 1 ea 0 3017 mm d 1 ta 0 2844 mm d 1 eta the rmse and mbe values of ta were potentially large because the water consumption of maize is complicated and there were many factors that influenced the measurements and simulations of transpiration as described in detail in the following paragraph the ias were 0 69 ea 0 91 ta and 0 85 eta indicating that the simulated ea and ta values agreed well with the measured values table 4 in 2014 the simulated ea values exhibited high consistency with the measured ea values with a re of 4 22 specially the total simulated and measured values were 113 53 mm and 108 93 mm respectively for transpiration during each growth period the simulated ta values were closed to the measured ta excluding those form the seeding stage in which the simulated ta was significantly lower than the measured ta with a ratio of only 0 29 notably the overall ratio was 0 85 for the actual et the simulated and measured values were similar regardless of the period with a ratio of 0 89 or growth stage with a ratio ranging from 0 65 to 1 16 table 5 in 2015 and 2016 the simulated transpiration similarly to that in 2014 was much lower than the measured transpiration during the seeding stage this difference was potentially because that the stem flow gauges were installed on the maize only after the stem was longer than 20 cm thus relatively large errors existed between the simulations and measurements before the middle shooting stage another possible reason was the influence of radiation which is the main factor that influences stem flow therefore considerable attention should focus on properly using stem flow instruments mackay et al 2010 hydrus 2d overestimated the actual evaporation during the seeding period but underestimated it until the maturity stage the precision of micro lysimeters was associated closely with the frequency of irrigation or precipitation and measurements can be easily to be inaccurate if not change the soil timely sun et al 2005 the plants were initially weak with narrow leaf width and short roots these features led to low water consumption and large area of bare soil hence the transpiration rate was low and the evaporation rate was high with the growth of crops the lai gradually increased and the root water uptake and transpiration also increased the different errors of different growth stages to some extent suggest that the lai influenced the model accuracy in this study the surface resistance which was used to calculate etp was obtained based on the average lai value allen et al 1998 but this approach was originally based on the assumption of dense vegetation and is not appropriate when the leaf area is small therefore the model precision was low during the seeding stage second the ep and tp model inputs were obtained via the beer equation with a simplified extinction coefficient based solely on the lai however these values are also associated with the solar altitude qi et al 2011 so this issue may result in some errors in the simulation results and should be considered more comprehensively in the future interestingly the simulated transpiration values were lower than the measured values and the simulated evaporation values were always larger than measured values during the early growth stage in the medium late growth stages the opposite scenario was generally observed the accuracy of hydrus 2d for simulating transpiration and evaporation showed that there was a compensation effect between evaporation and transpiration for relatively high and low simulated and measured values in the three study years the res of ea and ta were 1 7 and 11 06 respectively hydrus 2d underestimated et with a re of 8 27 and this finding was similar to the results of mailhol et al 2011 and phogat et al 2013 overall although the model results for all growth stages were not always good hydrus 2d can be used as a tool to accurately simulate the total e t and et during the entire growth period the error contributions of e and t to total et are shown in fig 5 the simulation error source for et mainly stemmed from the simulation error of t which was 99 26 83 18 and 90 63 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively by contrast the et error associated with e accounted for only 0 74 16 82 and 9 37 of the error in these years the results indicated that the version of hydrus 2d used in this study does not consider time variable root growth as previously noted by roberts et al 2009 ramos et al 2012 karandish and šimůnek 2016 in addition various environmental factors such as temperature soil water availability and soil strength can influence root development especially at the suboptimal experimental sites in this study hartmann et al 2018 additionally the complicated roots distribution of maize under film mulching drip irrigation significantly varied from the root distributions observed for other traditional irrigation methods thus the root growth modelling may be inadequate and requires additional studies yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b 5 conclusions the feasibility of using the hydrus 2d model to evaluate the water balance under film mulching drip irrigation was validated with field experiment data from 2014 to 2016 the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 the hydrus 2d model exhibited high accuracy in simulations of the soil water content under film mulching drip irrigation and was generally able to accurately capture the dynamic water changes in various soil layers however the accuracy of the soil water simulations in the surface soil layers must be improved 2 hydrus 2d can generally be used to simulate the evaporation and transpiration process for maize under film mulching drip irrigation an error contribution analysis showed that the simulation errors of hydrus 2d particularly for et mainly stemmed from the simulation of crop transpiration further studies that consider the effects of film mulching drip irrigation are required to improve the root water uptake and the et calculation modules and enhance the accuracy of hydrus 2d acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the careful and precise reviews by the anonymous reviewers their efforts

good strategy to increase water use efficiency for many crops without causing a severe reduction in yield geerts and raes 2009 ballester et al 2014 however it is well known that water deficit stress increases the production of reactive oxygen species ros in cellular organelles such as chloroplasts peroxisomes and mitochondria these ros cause negative effects in the metabolic processes and growth

length of spike 17 93 in the number of spiklets per spike 60 26 in the root fresh weights and 55 56 in the root dry weights compared to the control n0 0 i100 treatment exogenous n application at both rates and in absence of di significantly increased all growth parameters compared to the control p 0 05 nitrogen application improved the growth of the plants grown under di and the values in some cases were higher than those of the plants grown under di alone n0 0 i60 treatment although maximum values of growth parameters were obtained with the n0 3 i100 or n0 6 i100 treatment the applications of n fertilizer to wheat plants grown under 60 of etc n0 3 i60 or n0 6 i60 treatment enabled the plants to generate growth characteristics in approximate values of the plants grown under full

metaxylem vessels as well as the dimension of vascular bundles in wheat stem as a result of di exogenous n applications have been shown to be involved in a positive modification all aforesaid anatomical characteristics however the n0 6 i100 or n0 6 i60 treatment significantly improved the stem anatomical characteristics compared to n0 0 i100 or n0 0 i60 treatment respectively and maintained the stem anatomical characteristics at the status in which plants could be overcome di 3 4 effects of n application and deficit irrigation di on leaf photosynthetic pigments of wheat plants

relative membrane permeability and rwc the best results were obtained in the case of the n0 6 i100 treatment in presence of di n supply reduced the injurious effects of drought stress on wheat plants and maintained their rmp and rwc values to close levels as in the control 3 7 effects of n application and deficit irrigation di on total soluble phenols the stress generated by di resulted in an insignificant increase in total soluble phenols compared to non water stressed plants table 6 however this attribute was significantly improved by n treatments in most cases in the presence or absence of the di and the n0 6 i60 treatment and recorded the highest value 3 90 3 8 effects of n application and deficit irrigation di on antioxidant enzyme activities water deficit and n treatments dramatically affected sod and cat activities table 6 exposure of wheat plants to di significantly increased sod and cat activities compared to the normal supply of water n0 0 i100 treatment in addition exogenous n application further increased these enzyme activities in presence of the di stress compared to n0 0 i100 treatment even in the absence of di n addition especially at the highest rate n0 6 significantly increased the activity of the two enzymes compared to the full irrigation conditions n0 0 i100 treatment 4 discussion nitrogen is one of the major components of photosynthetic

reduced length of shoot number of fertile tillers per plant flag leaf area length of spike number of spikelets per spike root fresh and dry weights per plant straw fresh and dry weights per plant spike fresh and dry weights per plant 1000 kernel weight and grains yield per pot the observed reduction in the above mentioned growth parameters under water deficiency stress condition in this study may be due to the disturbance in the metabolic process of the plant including chlorophyll destruction and the cell division tables 4 and 5 the decrease in dry weights of the stressed plants could be attributed to the disturbances in metabolic processes which lead to decrease in meristematic activity thereby inhibiting division of cells causing a reduction in dry mass production the major photosynthetic organ with respect to grain yield is flag leaf in wheat which may be influenced by di during vegetative and reproductive periods our results were also confirmed by boyer 1988 and soha et al 2012 who found the decline in fresh weight may be due to the decrease in water content of the stressed plant cells and tissues which lose their turgor and thus shrink li et al 2012 reported that abiotic stresses such as waterlogging shading during the reproductive period decrease grain yield which limits the carbohydrate supply rouphael et al 2012 found that water stress induces growth and yield loss of a crop due to the reduction in nutrient uptake transport and distribution abdoli and saeidi 2012 stated that water stress at any stage of plant growth adversely affects the yield of a plant cui et al 2015 reported that severe water deficit significantly reduced grain yield due to strong reduction in number of spikes as compared to control agami et al 2017 found that wheat plants exposed to the drought stress exhibited a significant reduction in growth and grain yield lia et al 2018 reported that di900 treatment deficit irrigation 900 μ mol mol 1 co2 in which the irrigation amount was reduced by 30 only decreased the total dry matter weight and grain yield of maize by 7 and 5 when compared with ri900 regular irrigation 900 μmol mol 1 co2 xue et al 2018 also found that different drought stress 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of field capacity fc significantly resulted in different reduction in plant growth and seed yield attributes of cassia obtusifolia and more pronounced with the severity of drought our study suggests that exogenous supply of n may help to reduce the adverse effects of drought in various crops subjected to deficit irrigation di we found that n supply has ameliorative effects on growth characteristics and productivity of wheat plants grown in presence of di this indicates that n fertilizer able to tolerate the deficit irrigation stress it is demonstrated that n addition might play a key role in maintaining plant productivity under different soil water conditions in the arid land this finding was noted earlier in some crop plants i e lalelou and fateh 2014 found that the nitrogen supplement compensates the yield loss of wheat and deteriorative effect of water deficit conditions zodape et al 2011 reported that the deficiency of plant nitrogen under water deficit stress at the vegetative stage can be indemnified by the foliar application of urea our results showed that exposure of wheat plants to di stress leads to a considerable reduction in the thickness of the stem diameter this was mainly due to the decrease in thickness of seclerenchymatous tissue by decreasing both cell number and diameter average diameter of parenchyma cells and the average diameter of parenchyma cells and metaxylem vessels as well as the dimension of vascular bundles in comparison to plants subjected to di alone n0 0 i60 treatment this reduction in the above attributes may be due to the inhibition of the pro cambial activity of vascular tissues as well as a decrease in the cell number and size of stem tissues all improved parameters i e growth and yield characteristics leaf photosynthetic pigments plant water relations osmoprotectants and antioxidant enzymes activities in response to the n supply for di stressed wheat plants were correlated with the improved stem anatomy tables 2 6 and fig 1 the improvement of stem anatomy by n addition seems to contribute to a further improvement of translocation of nutrients from the root into active parts of plants to enable plants to tolerate di stress conditions it is well recognized that n enhances the cell number and cell size and increases the efficiency of the photosynthetic rate in leaves lawlor et al 1988 di stress caused a significant reduction in the total chlorophylls and carotenoids concentration table 5 the decline in total chlorophyll during di stress accelerated a reduction in the photochemical activities of chloroplasts which were responsible for the decrease in photosynthesis the effects of di stress on total chlorophylls were in agreement with the previous findings quaratacci and navari izzo 1992 magnani et al 1996 abdelkader et al 2007 shamsi 2010 agami 2013a 2013b found that nacl stress significantly reduced photosynthetic pigment in leaves of maize plants n supply had significant positive effects on total chlorophylls in the presence or absence di stress that was similarly observed earlier for some crops such as sunflower sugar beet and sugar beet maple pankovic et al 2000 shaw et al 2002 van den berg and perkins 2004 the n addition may induce more biosynthesis of leaf photosynthetic pigments and consequently the improvement of the photosynthesis process to produce more assimilates including osmoprotectants table 5 these osmoprotectants like soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins and free proline may contribute in increase cell health and turgidity in the form of increased rwc and decreased rmp table 6 this provides tissue health and vigorous plant growth under di stress there is a firm correlation between the increased levels of cellular osmolytes proline and soluble carbohydrates and the capacity to overcome the stress effects under stressful conditions proline accumulation is thought to play multiple positive roles in stress tolerance and plant protection such as increasing cellular osmolarity to maintain turgor buffering redox potential stabilizing subcellular structures and pre serving macromolecules like proteins or dna van rensburg et al 1993 or scavenging reactive oxygen species matysik et al 2002 it may be hypothesized that proline acts as a protective osmolyte in wheat plants during di stress in addition soluble sugars are a major category of organic compatible solutes that play a vital role in mitigating the stress effects either by osmotic adjustment or by providing some desiccation resistance to plant cells hassanein et al 2009 therefore these increased osmoprotectants by n applications table 5 played some important roles in mitigating the negative effects of di stress on wheat plants the same result was obtained by rahimi et al 2013 who found that the concentration of soluble sugars and proline increased plantago ovata with n addition in this study n supply reduced the injurious effects of drought stress on wheat plants and maintained their rmp and rwc values at close levels as in control plants table 6 negative changes occurred in the health of tissue membranes under di stress were assessed in the present study however n application repaired the damages occurred in tissue membranes and greatly reduced the rmp this positive modification of tissue membranes may be attributed to that n applications that contributed to maintaining the membrane integrity which is agreed with the results of abid et al 2016 who stated that n supply under drought stress enhanced leaf water potential and membrane stability index and antioxidant activity as well as reduced the down regulation of photosynthetic processes and penalties to grain yield of wheat plants the rwc is a suitable measurement of plant water status as a physiological consequence of cellular moisture stress while water potential is an assessment of plant moisture transport in the soil plant atmosphere continuum darvishan et al 2013 our results of the current work demonstrated that the improved osmotic adjustment resulted in the increased intensity of free proline and soluble carbohydrates and soluble proteins participated in maintaining higher rwc and lower rmp in plant tissues in response to di stress with the addition of n hence alleviation of the harmful effects of di stresses is performed for wheat plants the water status of the wheat plants was expressed by rwc and water use efficiency wue parameters there is a high relationship between rwc rmp and wue under the combined effect of di and application n fertilizers the improvement of plant water status with n application is highly correlated with the increase of wue and decrease in relative membrane permeability rmp in wheat plants under di stress tables 3 and 6 this maintains healthy metabolic processes in wheat leaves as an effective mechanism generated in plants under di stress the results are in agreement with those of shan and chen 1993 who reported the increased yield and water use efficiency in wheat with nitrogen application li et al 2001 reported that limited irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application in wheat during the growing season could significantly increase water use efficiency and yields many previous investigations have observed increased wue in various plant species under water stress conditions clover et al 2001 ye et al 2013 shi et al 2014 accumulation of total soluble phenols was observed in the present study table 6 a similar result was achieved by tahi et al 2008 found that the content of soluble phenols increased about 180 under partial rootzone drying while an even greater value 228 was observed in regulated deficit irrigation plants zancani and nagy 2000 found that h2o2 was scavenged by phenols through peroxidases a tight control of ros generation and accumulation in the plant cell is essential because the over produced ros can cause cell death reducing the plant growth and productivity bieker and zentgraf 2013 to counteract ros toxicity plant cells are well equipped with highly efficient antioxidant molecules and enzymes that are located in different cell compartments these include the superoxide dismutases sods which catalyze the dismutation of o2 to h2o2 catalases cats responsible for the removal of h2o2 and the enzymes and metabolites of the ascorbate glutathione cycle which also remove h2o2 foyer et al 1994 results of our study showed that the activity of sod and cat increased under water deficit treatments similar results have been reported in wheat plants agami et al 2017 and in pea plants iturbe ormaetxe et al 1998 increased cat activities under water stress have been observed luna et al 2004 in this study wheat plants subjected to di and treated with n fertilization showed a significant increase in sod and cat activities this indicates improved redox defense status to scavenge ros damage the development of favorable ros detoxifying antioxidant system in the di stressed plants under n supply in this study might have contributed toward the protection of the photosynthetic process and these findings were in consensus with saneoka et al 2004 koupaei et al 2018 found that deficit irrigation increased the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in fruits and leaves of date palm phoenix dactylifera l in our study wheat plants subjected to di and treated with n fertilization showed a significant increase in sod and cat activities this indicates the improved redox defense status to scavenge ros damage the development of favorable ros detoxifying antioxidant system in the di stressed plants under n supply might be contributed toward the protection of the photosynthetic process these findings were in consensus with those of saneoka et al 2004 who suggested that n nutrition contributed to the drought tolerance in bent grass by preventing the cell membrane damage lowering mda accumulation as well as improving the osmoregulation 5 conclusion exposure of wheat plants to di resulted in the decrease of plant growth leaf photosynthetic pigments rwc straw and grain yields and increased the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins total soluble phenols and proline rmp antioxidant enzymes and wue the study showed that exogenous n supply was effective in mitigating the adverse effects of di stress and the positive effects of n application was more pronounced under n0 6 i60 treatment the n treated wheat plants under di stress maintained higher rwc osmoprotectants soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins and free proline and antioxidant systems sod cat and soluble phenols and lower rmp than untreated plants these findings approved that n supply plays a vital role in plant development metabolism and responses to di stress it could be concluded also that n application is useful for improving the overall growth anatomical characteristics and grains yield of wheat crops under di the analysis of the effect n nutrition of water deficit is complex and requires further studies to assess the accurate functions of n supply in

introduction cereal crops are a major staple food worldwide which contribute more than 50 of total human calorie input directly among them wheat triticum aestivum l occupies the prominent position as source of dietary protein and calories forever burgeoning population of the world fao 2009 due to the global climate changes the agricultural sector began in recent years to overcome the problem of water deficiency in recent years world bank 2006 to manage the limited amount of available water for agriculture successfully the agricultural practices and understanding of water productivity should be improved to increase wue jones 2004 to increase wue a combined practice of deficit irrigation di and supplying the crops with n fertilizer according to previous works irrigating plants under the maximum water requirements for crops became a successful method for saving water pereira et al 2002 abd el mageed et al 2017 to increase wue by di strategy plants are subjected to drought by decreasing the volume of the used water or by decreasing the number of irrigation either throughout a specific stage specific stage or during the whole growing season fereres and soriano 2007 abd el mageed et al 2017 effects of di on growth and productivity of many crops have been intensively investigated fereres and soriano 2007 agami 2013a b and agami et al 2017 it has been shown that di is a good strategy to increase water use efficiency for many crops without causing a severe reduction in yield geerts and raes 2009 ballester et al 2014 however it is well known that water deficit stress increases the production of reactive oxygen species ros in cellular organelles such as chloroplasts peroxisomes and mitochondria these ros cause negative effects in the metabolic processes and growth batra et al 2014 huge cellular deterioration and death will occur if water deficit stress is prolonged because ros production will defeat the scavenging action of the antioxidant system cruz de carvalho 2008 drought stress severely influenced plant water status by reducing the water potential and the relative water content rwc in wheat siddique et al 2001 drought stress can increase organic compounds required for the osmotic adjustments such as soluble sugars and proline garg et al 2001 molinari et al 2007 when adopting deficit irrigation strategies water deficit stress could have some negative effects on growth and productivity as reported by cui et al 2015 however supplying the stressed plants with nitrogen fertilizers will help the crops to tolerate water deficit stress nitrogen is a vital structural component of proteins rubisco nucleic acids chlorophylls as well as some hormones and n fertilization is an essential agronomic management practice to enhance the crop productivity ata ul karim et al 2016 functional activity of the photosynthetic apparatus of leaf depends on the availability of n in plants brennan 1992 in addition efficient n nutrition has been reported to have the potential to alleviate the drought stress damages by maintaining the metabolic activities even at low tissue water potential zhang et al 2007 an appropriate n supply could stimulate plant growth improve water use efficiency wue and alleviate the effects of drought stress wu et al 2008 brueck et al 2010 under drought conditions adequate n supply could enhance plant drought tolerance chapin 1991 arora et al 2001 this study hypothesized that exogenous application of n fertilizer may positively affect on the wheat performance wue chlorophyll concentration osmoprotectants anti oxidative enzymes activities and tissue health as well as stem anatomy therefore the experiments were designed to study the response of wheat plants grown under water deficit stress conditions to the exogenous supply of n fertilizer 2 methodology 2 1 plant culturing and growth conditions two pot experiments were conducted during the two successive seasons of 2015 and 2016

relative membrane permeability and rwc the best results were obtained in the case of the n0 6 i100 treatment in presence of di n supply reduced the injurious effects of drought stress on wheat plants and maintained their rmp and rwc values to close levels as in the control 3 7 effects of n application and deficit irrigation di on total soluble phenols the stress generated by di resulted in an insignificant increase in total soluble phenols compared to non water stressed plants table 6 however this attribute was significantly improved by n treatments in most cases in the presence or absence of the di and the n0 6 i60 treatment and recorded the highest value 3 90 3 8 effects of n application and deficit irrigation di on antioxidant enzyme activities water deficit and n treatments dramatically affected sod and cat activities table 6 exposure of wheat plants to di significantly increased sod and cat activities compared to the normal supply of water n0 0 i100 treatment in addition exogenous n application further increased these enzyme activities in presence of the di stress compared to n0 0 i100 treatment even in the absence of di n addition especially at the highest rate n0 6 significantly increased the activity of the two enzymes compared to the full irrigation conditions n0 0 i100 treatment 4 discussion nitrogen is one of the major components of photosynthetic machinery in plants and mobilization of organic nitrogen that controls the uptake and partitioning of carbon from leaf to seed sinks thornton et al 2002 and lillo 2008 drought is an important environmental factor that influences growth and physiological processes in plants loutfy et al 2012 in this study water deficiency stress significantly reduced the growth of wheat plants in terms of reduced length of shoot number of fertile tillers per plant flag leaf area length of spike number of spikelets per spike root fresh and dry weights per plant straw fresh and dry weights per plant spike fresh and dry weights per plant 1000 kernel weight and grains yield per pot the observed reduction in the above mentioned growth parameters under water deficiency stress condition in this study may be due to the disturbance in the metabolic process of the plant including chlorophyll destruction and the cell division tables 4 and 5 the decrease in dry weights of the stressed plants could be attributed to the disturbances in metabolic processes which lead to decrease in meristematic activity thereby inhibiting division of cells causing a reduction in dry mass production the major photosynthetic organ with respect to grain yield is flag leaf in wheat which may be influenced by di during vegetative and reproductive periods our results were also confirmed by boyer 1988 and soha et al 2012 who found the decline in fresh weight may be due to the decrease in water content of the stressed plant cells and tissues which lose their turgor and thus shrink li et al 2012 reported that abiotic stresses such as waterlogging shading during the reproductive period decrease grain yield which limits the carbohydrate supply rouphael et al 2012 found that water stress induces growth and yield loss of a crop due to the reduction in nutrient uptake transport and distribution abdoli and saeidi 2012 stated that water stress at any stage of plant growth adversely affects the yield of a plant cui et al 2015 reported that severe water deficit significantly reduced grain yield due to strong reduction in number of spikes as compared to control agami et al 2017 found that wheat plants exposed to the drought stress exhibited a significant reduction in growth and grain yield lia et al 2018 reported that di900 treatment deficit irrigation 900 μ mol mol 1 co2 in which the irrigation amount was reduced by 30 only decreased the total dry matter weight and grain yield of maize by 7 and 5 when compared with ri900 regular irrigation 900 μmol mol 1 co2 xue et al 2018 also found that different drought stress 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of field capacity fc significantly resulted in different reduction in plant growth and seed yield attributes of cassia obtusifolia and more pronounced with the severity of drought our study suggests that exogenous supply of n may help to reduce the adverse effects of drought in various crops subjected to deficit irrigation di we found that n supply has ameliorative effects on growth characteristics and productivity of wheat plants grown in presence of di this indicates that n fertilizer able to tolerate the deficit irrigation stress it is demonstrated that n addition might play a key role in maintaining plant productivity under different soil water conditions in the arid land this finding was noted earlier in some crop plants i e lalelou and fateh 2014 found that the nitrogen supplement compensates the yield loss of wheat and deteriorative effect of water deficit conditions zodape et al 2011 reported that the deficiency of plant nitrogen under water deficit stress at the vegetative stage can be indemnified by the foliar application of urea our results showed that exposure of wheat plants to di stress leads to a considerable reduction in the thickness of the stem diameter this was mainly due to the decrease in thickness of seclerenchymatous tissue by decreasing both cell number and diameter average diameter of parenchyma cells and the average diameter of parenchyma cells and metaxylem vessels as well as the dimension of vascular bundles in comparison to plants subjected to di alone n0 0 i60 treatment this reduction in the above attributes may be due to the inhibition of the pro cambial activity of vascular tissues as well as a decrease in the cell number and size of stem tissues all improved parameters i e growth and yield characteristics leaf photosynthetic pigments plant water relations osmoprotectants and antioxidant enzymes activities in response to the n supply for di stressed wheat plants were correlated with the improved stem anatomy tables 2 6 and fig 1 the improvement of stem anatomy by n addition seems to contribute to a further improvement of translocation of nutrients from the root into active parts of plants to enable plants to tolerate di stress conditions it is well recognized that n enhances the cell number and cell size and increases the efficiency of the photosynthetic rate in leaves lawlor et al 1988 di stress caused a significant reduction in the total chlorophylls and carotenoids concentration table 5 the decline in total chlorophyll during di stress accelerated a reduction in the photochemical activities of chloroplasts which were responsible for the decrease in photosynthesis the effects of di stress on total chlorophylls were in agreement with the previous findings quaratacci and navari izzo 1992 magnani et al 1996 abdelkader et al 2007 shamsi 2010 agami 2013a 2013b found that nacl stress significantly reduced photosynthetic pigment in leaves of maize plants n supply had significant positive effects on total chlorophylls in the presence or absence di stress that was similarly observed earlier for some crops such as sunflower sugar beet and sugar beet maple pankovic et al 2000 shaw et al 2002 van den berg and perkins 2004 the n addition may induce more biosynthesis of leaf photosynthetic pigments and consequently the improvement of the photosynthesis process to produce more assimilates including osmoprotectants table 5 these osmoprotectants like soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins and free proline may contribute in increase cell health and turgidity in the form of increased rwc and decreased rmp table 6 this provides tissue health and vigorous plant growth under di stress there is a firm correlation between the increased levels of cellular osmolytes proline and soluble carbohydrates and the capacity to overcome the stress effects under stressful conditions proline accumulation is thought to play multiple positive roles in stress tolerance and plant protection such as increasing cellular osmolarity to maintain turgor buffering redox potential stabilizing subcellular structures and pre serving macromolecules like proteins or dna van rensburg et al 1993 or scavenging reactive oxygen species matysik et al 2002 it may be hypothesized that proline acts as a protective osmolyte in wheat plants during di stress in addition soluble sugars are a major category of organic compatible solutes that play a vital role in mitigating the stress effects either by osmotic adjustment or by providing some desiccation resistance to plant cells hassanein et al 2009 therefore these increased osmoprotectants by n applications table 5 played some important roles in mitigating the negative effects of di stress on wheat plants the same result was obtained by rahimi et al 2013 who found that the concentration of soluble sugars and proline increased plantago ovata with n addition in this study n supply reduced the injurious effects of drought stress on wheat plants and maintained their rmp and rwc values at close levels as in control plants table 6 negative changes occurred in the health of tissue membranes under di stress were assessed in the present study however n application repaired the damages occurred in tissue membranes and greatly reduced the rmp this positive modification of tissue membranes may be attributed to that n applications that contributed to maintaining the membrane integrity which is agreed with the results of abid et al 2016 who stated that n supply under drought stress enhanced leaf water potential and membrane stability index and antioxidant activity as well as reduced the down regulation of photosynthetic processes and penalties to grain yield of wheat plants the rwc is a suitable measurement of plant water status as a physiological consequence of cellular moisture stress while water potential is an assessment of plant moisture transport in the soil plant atmosphere continuum darvishan et al 2013 our results of the current work demonstrated that the improved osmotic adjustment resulted in the increased intensity of free proline and soluble carbohydrates and soluble proteins participated in maintaining higher rwc and lower rmp in plant tissues in response to di stress with the addition of n hence alleviation of the harmful effects of di stresses is performed for wheat plants the water status of the wheat plants was expressed by rwc and water use efficiency wue parameters there is a high relationship between rwc rmp and wue under the combined effect of di and application n fertilizers the improvement of plant water status with n application is highly correlated with the increase of wue and decrease in relative membrane permeability rmp in wheat plants under di stress tables 3 and 6 this maintains healthy metabolic processes in wheat leaves as an effective mechanism generated in plants under di stress the results are in agreement with those of shan and chen 1993 who reported the increased yield and water use efficiency in wheat with nitrogen application li et al 2001 reported that limited irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application in wheat during the growing season could significantly increase water use efficiency and yields many previous investigations have observed increased wue in various plant species under water stress conditions clover et al 2001 ye et al 2013 shi et al 2014 accumulation of total soluble phenols was observed in the present study table 6 a similar result was achieved by tahi et al 2008 found that the content of soluble phenols increased about 180 under partial rootzone drying while an even greater value 228 was observed in regulated deficit irrigation plants zancani and nagy 2000 found that h2o2 was scavenged by phenols through peroxidases a tight control of ros generation and accumulation in the plant cell is essential because the over produced ros can cause cell death reducing the plant growth and productivity bieker and zentgraf 2013 to counteract ros toxicity plant cells are well equipped with highly efficient antioxidant molecules and enzymes that are located in different cell compartments these include the superoxide dismutases sods which catalyze the dismutation of o2 to h2o2 catalases cats responsible for the removal of h2o2 and the enzymes and metabolites of the ascorbate glutathione cycle which also remove h2o2 foyer et al 1994 results of our study showed that the activity of sod and cat increased under water deficit treatments similar results have been reported in wheat plants agami et al 2017 and in pea plants iturbe ormaetxe et al 1998 increased cat activities under water stress have been observed luna et al 2004 in this study wheat plants subjected to di and treated with n fertilization showed a significant increase in sod and cat activities this indicates improved redox defense status to scavenge ros damage the development of favorable ros detoxifying antioxidant system in the di stressed plants under n supply in this study might have contributed toward the protection of the photosynthetic process and these findings were in consensus with saneoka et al 2004 koupaei et al 2018 found that deficit irrigation increased the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in fruits and leaves of date palm phoenix dactylifera l in our study wheat plants subjected to di and treated with n fertilization showed a significant increase in sod and cat activities this indicates the improved redox defense status to scavenge ros damage the development of favorable ros detoxifying antioxidant system in the di stressed plants under n supply might be contributed toward the protection of the photosynthetic process these findings were in consensus with those of saneoka et al 2004 who suggested that n nutrition contributed to the drought tolerance in bent grass by preventing the cell membrane damage lowering mda accumulation as well as improving the osmoregulation 5 conclusion exposure of wheat plants to di resulted in the decrease of plant growth leaf photosynthetic pigments rwc straw and grain yields and increased the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins total soluble phenols and proline rmp antioxidant enzymes and wue the study showed that exogenous n supply was effective in mitigating the adverse effects of di stress and the positive effects of n application was more pronounced under n0 6 i60 treatment the n treated wheat plants under di stress maintained higher rwc osmoprotectants soluble carbohydrates soluble proteins and free proline and antioxidant systems sod cat and soluble phenols and lower rmp than untreated plants these findings approved that n supply plays a vital role in plant development metabolism and responses to di stress it could be concluded also that n application is useful for improving the overall growth anatomical characteristics and grains yield of wheat crops under di the analysis of the effect n nutrition of water deficit is complex and requires further studies to assess the accurate functions of n supply in
