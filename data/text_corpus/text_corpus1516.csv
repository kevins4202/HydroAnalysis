7580,during the winter and spring of 2000 2001 large floods occurred in northern france somme river basin and southern england patcham area of brighton in valleys that are developed on chalk outcrops the floods durations were particularly long more than 3 months in the somme basin and caused significant damage in both countries to improve the understanding of groundwater flooding in chalk catchments an experimental site was set up in the hallue basin which is located in the somme river basin france unsaturated fractured chalk formation overlying the chalk aquifer was monitored to understand its reaction to long and heavy rainfall events when it reaches a near saturation state the water content and soil temperature were monitored to a depth of 8 m and the matrix pressure was monitored down to the water table 26 5 m below ground level the monitoring extended over a 2 5 year period 2006 2008 under natural conditions and during two periods when heavy artificial infiltration was induced the objective of the paper is to describe a vertical numerical flow model based on richards equation using these data that was developed to simulate infiltrating rainwater flow from the ground surface to the saturated aquifer the marthe computer code which models the unsaturated saturated continuum was adapted to reproduce the monitored high saturation periods composite constitutive functions hydraulic conductivity saturation and pressure saturation that integrate the increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation and extra available porosity resulting from fractures were introduced into the code using these composite constitutive functions the model was able to accurately simulate the water contents and pressures at all depths over the entire monitored period including the infiltration tests the soil temperature was also accurately simulated at all depths except during the infiltrations tests which contributes to the model validation the model was used to calculate the aquifer recharge over a long period that included droughts and floods the calculated recharge is realistic as it makes it possible to simulate the corresponding monitored groundwater level data which increases confidence in the modelling approach keywords vadose zone modelling dual permeability flow experimental site deep monitoring soil heat transfer 1 introduction during the winter and spring of 2000 2001 large floods occurred in northern france somme river basin and southern england brighton the chalk in the somme river basin is fractured and has a fine grained porous matrix this matrix provides most of the porosity and storage capacity and the fractures greatly enhance the hydraulic conductivity roux 1965 price 1993 modelling of the groundwater levels and river flows in the somme basin amraoui et al 2002 2003 and various observations have led to the conclusion that in 2001 after several wet years a significant increase in stored groundwater and possibly the saturation of the chalk unsaturated zone uz caused the flood due to the complexity of this chalk medium dual porosity and dual permeability there might have been hydraulic continuity between the unsaturated and saturated zones of the basin during a period of abnormally high rainfall leading to a rapid rise in the groundwater level to better understand the flow processes that occur in the uz under various recharge conditions in chalk catchments an experimental site was set up during the flood1 project the experimental site was installed in the hallue basin which is located in the somme river basin france and equipped to monitor the unsaturated fractured chalk formation overlying the chalk aquifer since the 1970s many experimental studies and a large amount of modelling work have been undertaken to understand the physical processes controlling water and solute movement through the uz simunek et al 2003 and le vine et al 2016 reviewed and compared approaches for describing flow and transport in the uz using a single domain non equilibrium scheme or a preferential flow scheme equilibrium or non equilibrium it has been shown that due to fissures a single domain representation is not suitable ireson et al 2009 preferential flow results in irregular wetting of the soil profile as a direct consequence of water moving faster in certain parts of the ground than in others e g fissures versus matrix preferential flow which generally occurs relatively infrequently ireson and butler 2011 can be represented by a variety of dual porosity or dual permeability models that take into account the macropores and the bulk matrix although dual porosity models assume that the water in the matrix is stagnant dual permeability models assume that the water moves in both the matrix and macropores a simple equilibrium dual porosity flow model can be obtained by combining the single porosity richards equation with double hump constitutive functions of hydraulic properties simunek et al 2003 the double hump allows both porosities and a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation to be accounted for however models based on this assumption implicitly assume instantaneous equilibrium instantaneous exchange of water between the two pore systems non equilibrium flow and transport dual porosity models assume that water in the matrix does not move the matrix pores represent immobile pockets that can exchange retain and store water but do not enable convective flow this conceptualization leads to flow and transport models that partition the liquid phase into mobile and immobile regions simunek et al 2003 observed that dual porosity models have been used mostly for solute transport studies and less frequently for flow various types of non equilibrium dual permeability approaches have been used to describe flow and transport in both pore regions macropores and micropores a critical aspect in all dual porosity permeability models is the description of the coupling terms representing mass transfer between the matrix and fracture regions some descriptions are physically based though approximate whereas others are entirely empirical two main approaches are presented mass transfer driven by the difference in fluid saturation simunek et al 2001 larsbo and jarvis 2003 and mass transfer driven by the difference in pressure head gerke and van genuchten 1993a between the two pore regions as noted by simunek et al 2003 it may be difficult to use the dual permeability approach because of the large number of parameters involved and the lack of experimental techniques needed to obtain them mathias et al 2006 in an attempt to reconcile commonly observed and apparently contradictory phenomena in the unsaturated chalk such as rapid water table response slow solute migration and very low solute dispersion developed a transient dual permeability model of flow and transport through unsaturated chalk although their model does increase our understanding of the processes involved it requires a large number of parameters and was tested only on a hypothetical scenario and not calibrated with field measurements after carrying out detailed field investigations to study groundwater recharge and solute migration through the uz of a chalk aquifer in belgium brouyère et al 2004 and brouyère 2006 developed a mathematical and numerical model of the tracer migration in variably saturated fissured chalk their approach was similar to the above mentioned equilibrium dual porosity model described by simunek et al 2003 that relies on composite constitutive functions of hydraulic properties where the double hump makes it possible to take into account a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation due to the onset of fissure flow the composite retention curve presented by brouyère 2006 is mathematically better than those used in previous studies cited by simunek et al 2003 due to a continuous derivable transition between the functions that describe the matrix and the fissure to calculate contaminant transport in dual porosity media water is usually distributed between mobile and immobile phases and the porosity of the immobile phase in the matrix is assumed to be constant brouyère 2006 introduced mathematical developments to accommodate a variable distribution of water between mobile and immobile phases depending on the degree of saturation the resulting numerical model was applied under steady state conditions to the simulation of breakthrough curves of tracers in variably saturated chalk that resulted from the field campaign described in brouyère et al 2004 interesting results were obtained but they could probably be improved by considering the transient nature of recharge and the variations in piezometric level that were not taken into account in their study van den daele et al 2007 presented a detailed analysis of deuterium tracer test results conducted under natural rainfall conditions in the unsaturated chalk of cambridgeshire uk tracer migration was monitored by periodic core sampling and the collection of lysimeter drainage water modelling of the unsaturated flow and solute transport at the experimental site was performed using macro 5 0 a 1d numerical dual permeability model using an automatic calibration method a good fit was obtained with the measured lysimeter drainage and water contents at different depths but the model was unable to simulate the low pressure heads in the chalk strata observed during the summer simulations of the tracer led to a moderate quality fit of the tracer profiles despite its uncertainties that study represented a significant improvement over the modelling of flow and transport through the unsaturated chalk in a transient regime and with calibration using field data ireson et al 2009 used a parsimonious physically based model for water flow their model used hydraulic properties that were scaled as a function of depth and transpiration losses from the root zone were estimated using the feddes model feddes et al 1976 two dimensional vertical cross section modelling using a physically based hillslope model ireson and butler 2013 was also performed to estimate recharge over a transect to determine aquifer recharge mathias et al 2016 employed the vertical percolation rate vpr estimated using a soil moisture accounting procedure smap they showed that constraining the rate by soil moisture content measurements significantly improved the estimation rahman and rosolem 2017 used a simple approach with a bulk conductivity bc model to simulate water flow through the matrix fracture system they showed that the bc model could potentially be useful for surface modelling over large scale chalk dominated areas finally jarvis et al 2016 presented a thorough review of recent preferential flow modelling taking into account macropores implicitly or explicitly and suggested future prospects the objective of the present paper is to describe a vertically discretized flow model solving richards equation using composite constitutive functions hydraulic conductivity saturation and pressure saturation that is able to simulate all the data gathered at the experimental site during the entire monitored period including the infiltration tests the simulated data include water content and soil temperature down to 8 m depth and pressure head down to the water table at 27 m depth the paper also describes how the monitored data were used to establish the model composite constitutive functions by integrating the increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation and the additional available porosity resulting from fractures the composite functions enable modelling very wet conditions during which preferential flow is dominant a validation of the modelling approach using the calculated aquifer recharge to simulate a long series of groundwater levels monitored in a neighbouring piezometer is presented 2 experimental site and available data the experimental site is located at warloy baillon in the hallue basin somme northern france 21 km northeast of amiens fig 1 in the hallue basin the aquifer is represented by the permeable upper turonian and senonian chalk formations which are overlain by several metres of quaternary silts on the plateau and by alluvium in the valley the unsaturated chalk layer is up to 30 50 m thick on the plateau the hallue river drains the chalk aquifer under both low and high water conditions the lithological description of three cored boreholes drilled in the experimental site show that the top 0 7 m of the profile is a brown loamy soil with scattered chalk gravel and pebbles this soil overlies a weathered chalk horizon extending 6 9 m below ground level bgl which in turn overlies fractured white chalk that reaches a depth of 33 8 m the site was equipped to monitor the chalk saturated and unsaturated zones and the recharge parameters machard de gramont 2007 amraoui et al 2008a 2008b the pressure head was measured from the surface to the water table ten tensiometres which were also equipped with temperature sensors were installed at depths between 0 2 and 8 m twelve jacking tensiometres were used to monitor the deeper unsaturated chalk at depths between 10 and 26 5 m the water content was monitored in the soil and chalk between 0 2 and 8 m depth using an envirosmart probe equipped with 16 sensors for the saturated chalk the groundwater level was monitored continuously in borehole p1 located some metres away meteorological data including rainfall relative humidity and air temperature were also monitored at the site the measurements were carried out over a period of two and a half years in 2006 2008 during that period the water content water temperature pressure head rainfall and groundwater levels were recorded hourly amraoui et al 2008b analysed the results of in situ and laboratory tests and of continuous water content and pressure monitoring and discussed the main flow processes observed during that period two periods of significant natural recharge occurred during this period december 2006 to february 2007 and november 2007 to march 2008 however as there was a risk that no flooding would occur during the 2006 2008 period two heavy artificial infiltration tests were carried out in may 2007 and in april 2008 to simulate flood conditions table 1 the second test which was performed at a lower infiltration rate to provide additional information produced data that were less usable than those of the first test 3 data analysis the data recorded at the experimental site were analysed to determine the soil constitutive functions needed for the numerical model namely retention curves and hydraulic conductivity relation as a function of the water content 3 1 time evolution of hydraulic parameters under natural conditions as anticipated the variations in pressure head are much smoother at greater depths than in the first metre the minimal suction is usually less than 10 cm at all depths during the infiltration test fig 2 at depths lower than 0 5 m the variations in water content monitored over the entire period are approximately 15 of water content at depths between 0 5 and 8 m the variations are small approximately 1 2 fig 2 and therefore very accurate water content measurements are required to determine variations during the may 2007 infiltration test period the monitored water content was significantly higher than under natural conditions including the periods of heavy recharge in the winters of 2006 2007 and 2007 2008 the depth weighted average of the water content between 0 and 8 m depth fluctuated by approximately 2 5 during the period except during the two infiltration tests this average water content which had a mean of 43 75 and a minimum of 42 5 increased regularly during the 2006 2008 period this increase was correlated to the rising water table levels in borehole p1 which were the same as those measured using the senlis le sec 00471x0010 h1 piezometer 3 5 km away over time the depth of the water table in borehole p1 resided between 30 and 19 m bgl 3 2 analysis of the may 2007 infiltration test the may 2007 infiltration test was analysed at hourly time steps at each depth the rise delay which is the time to reach half of the water content or pressure rise was determined the increase in water content at various depths showed that the reactions were rapid and that the amplitude of the rise decreased from 6 of water content at a depth of 1 m to 1 5 at 5 m fig 3 a however the water content rise at 8 m was 2 5 the pressure head also increased rapidly only 21 h were needed for infiltrating water to reach a depth of 8 m 0 38 m h and 32 h to reach a depth of 19 m 0 59 m h fig 3b the water table was at a depth of 22 m during the test and there was no reaction beyond that depth these reactions were rapid because the initial water content was quite high between depths of 0 and 8 m at the beginning of the test depth weighted average 43 88 after the reaction delay the pressure head rose to almost zero the vertical hydraulic head gradient dh dz was then equal to one the water content during the infiltration remained constant for 4 days after the initial rise which suggests that the system was in a steady state the infiltrating water percolated at a rate of 289 mm d see table 1 with a hydraulic gradient of 1 which suggests that the hydraulic conductivity was also 289 mm d as it is not known whether the maximum saturation was reached the hydraulic conductivity at saturation must be at least 289 mm d no groundwater level reaction was observed in the aquifer during this infiltration test because of its high transmissivity the aquifer reacts to the average recharge over several tens of kilometres and the recharge over an area of 24 m2 has a negligible effect 3 3 determination of the retention functions retention functions give the suction or pressure head as a function of water content to correctly model natural flow the retention functions were determined using values measured in situ rather than values from laboratory experiments determining a retention function is relatively easy if the monitored period is long enough and includes both wet and dry periods simultaneous data for water content and pressure head or suction at a given depth should yield the desired function suction was plotted against water content at each monitored depth between 0 2 and 8 m see fig 4 at a depth of 6 50 m the data show considerable hysteresis at a given depth the same water content can correspond to quite different suctions the hysteresis tended however to decrease with depth ireson et al 2012 also observed a large hysteresis that is characteristic of a non equilibrium preferential flow during the infiltration test the water content was much greater than under natural conditions several authors price et al 2000 simunek et al 2003 mathias 2005 brouyère 2006 have suggested that this increase in water content might be due to a double porosity effect fracture volumes in the chalk flow only when there is very high saturation low suction 3 3 1 mathematical formulation brutsaert s equation brutsaert 1966 a classic homographic formulation that is usually very well suited to standard porous media was tried 1 h h 0 θ sm θ θ θ r b 1 s wm 1 b where h suction opposite of pressure head l h0 suction at half saturation l θ water content θr residual water content θsm matric water content at saturation b retention function exponent 1 swm matric water saturation θ θr θsm θr to determine the retention function three parameters must be identified at each depth θsm θr and b an optimisation code was designed to automatically determine the parameters that produce the retention function that is closest to the mean curve determined from the scatter plot however this classic homographic function brutsaert function could not take into account the double porosity effect a fit with a van genuchten function 1980 was also tried but resulted in the same difficulty it was therefore necessary to modify the retention formulation to fit the data a single domain with a composite retention function was used to model flow in this fractured medium a dual permeability approach with two domains could also have been used but is much more complex as acknowledged by simunek et al 2003 to obtain a retention function that was applicable for the entire range of water content values a composite function was used that associates two homographic equations one for the porous matrix and another when water contents exceeds a threshold θl i e when water begins to enter fractures this approach is similar to the dual porosity flow model described by simunek et al 2003 that uses a composite double hump type equation for the hydraulic properties fig 4 displays the homographic composite retention function at a depth of 6 5 m during a wetting phase above a threshold water content of 43 2 the decrease in suction is reduced as the water began to enter the fractures the total saturation reaches 44 1 instead of 43 4 for the porous matrix alone when θ θl the second homographic function is 2 h h 0 f θ sf θ θ θ rf b f 1 s wf 1 b f where θl threshold water content θrf fracture residual water content θsf fracture water content at saturation effective porosity h0f fracture suction at half saturation l bf fracture retention function exponent swf fracture water saturation θ θrf θsf θrf 3 3 2 parameter identification parameter θsf which is the maximum possible water content has a physical connotation whereas h0f θrf and bf are only calibration parameters because the slope of the retention function used by the flow model must be continuous the two retention functions must be tangent for water content θl the suction h and its derivative must be the same for both functions at θl the retention parameters were determined in the following way 1 the threshold water content θl was determined from observations 2 parameters θr θsm b and h0 were first calibrated for water contents θl 3 parameter θsf effective porosity was determined from observations 4 successive values were tried for θrf and the corresponding values for h0f and bf were determined so that the two functions are tangent in θl eqs 3 6 given hl h θl the suction was calculated from the known matrix retention relation 3 h l h 0 θ sm θ l θ l θ r b and given slope the derivative of h θ at θl 4 slope h 0 b θ sm θ r θ l θ r 1 b 1

data very well at all depths for the entire range of suction values between 0 cm and 1000 cm 3 4 determination of the hydraulic conductivity functions from the field data determining the hydraulic conductivity function from field data is difficult because hydraulic conductivity cannot be directly measured in the field but is obtained by indirect measurements that are difficult and uncertain to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values corresponding to different water contents a method adapted from the internal drainage method hillel et al 1972 vachaud et al 1978 was used the method assumes a downward flux from the soil surface and a known infiltration flux it relates the estimated local flux through a layer of soil at a given time to the local hydraulic head gradient estimated from the measurement of the pressure head of the lower and higher depths the local flux in the layer is estimated from the infiltration flux at the surface and from the variations in the water content in all the upper depths the method was applied differently during the 2007 infiltration test and under natural conditions during the 2007 infiltration test both the measured surface runoff 1 5 of the infiltrated flux and the calculated evapotranspiration less than 1 of the infiltrated flux were neglected the infiltrated flux q0 was known because it was monitored and the method could be directly applied because the water content variations were usually small at hourly time steps a 6 h time step was used the hydraulic head gradient was always very close to one but occasionally oscillated to avoid erratic values the gradient was assumed to be always equal to one for the calculation of the hydraulic conductivity under natural conditions the surface flux is unknown the rainfall r and the potential evapotranspiration pe are known but the actual evapotranspiration ae which is conditioned by water availability and plants stress is not known an attempt to use the difference r pe as the surface flux did not produce useful results moreover measurements of the pressure head in the upper depths did not allow the precise definition of a zero flux plane separating the upward and downward flows it was then assumed and verified later that evapotranspiration had no significant effect below 1 m depth except during limited periods the cumulated storage below 1 m was then calculated sequences during which the cumulated storage decreased constantly over long periods were selected and the downward flux was determined using the same equation considering the small rate of water content variations time steps of 4 7 days were used because this approach does not apply above a depth of 1 m the hydraulic conductivity for depths between 0 2 and 0 7 m were calculated only during the 2007 infiltration test 3 4 1 mathematical formulation a simple power function which is usually well adapted to standard porous media was selected 7 k k s θ θ r θ sm θ r d k s s wm d where k hydraulic conductivity l t 1 ks hydraulic conductivity at saturation l t 1 d exponent of the hydraulic conductivity function as expected from the analysis of the may 2007 infiltration test this function was unable to fit the entire range of hydraulic conductivity values calculated from the observations a hydraulic conductivity power function obtained for low to medium water contents considerably underestimated the hydraulic conductivities at higher saturation this proves that as expected due to the fractures in the chalk vertical hydraulic conductivity is considerably greater near saturation using the same approach as for the retention function a simple composite hydraulic conductivity function was defined 8 when θ θ l k k m θ θ r θ sf θ r d and 9 when θ θ l k k f θ θ 2 θ sf θ 2 d f where km matrix hydraulic conductivity at saturation l t 1 kf fractures hydraulic conductivity at saturation l t 1 df exponent of the fractures hydraulic conductivity function θ2 calibrated water content to ensure continuity between the two equations the effective porosity θsf is used in both equations 3 4 2 parameter identification the parameters θsf θr and θl are known from the retention function and the remaining hydraulic conductivity function parameters were determined in the following way 1 km and d were first calibrated for water contents less than θl 2 successive values of kf and df were tried to fit high hydraulic conductivities for water contents exceeding θl and the corresponding value of θ2 was calculated to ensure continuity at θl equating eqs 8 and 9 with θ θl the value of θ2 is 10 θ 2 β θ l θ sf β 1 where 11 β k f k l 1 d f and 12 k l k m θ l θ r θ sf θ r d the composite hydraulic conductivity function was fitted to the data from all depths where water contents were recorded the composite functions obtained at 8 depths adequately fit the data both under natural conditions and during the 2007 infiltration test see fig 5 a for a depth of 6 5 m using the retention functions to convert water content into pressure head the hydraulic conductivity versus pressure head relation was obtained the hydraulic conductivity increases suddenly usually when the pressure head rises above 50 cm fig 5b similar to the results reported by wellings 1984 the hydraulic conductivities at saturation are similar to or even greater than the values reported by mahmood ul hassan and gregory 2002 for example at a depth of 6 5 m above a threshold water content of 43 2 the hydraulic conductivity function integrating fractures has a maximal value at saturation of 450 mm d which is 50 times greater than the matrix hydraulic conductivity at saturation although this method for defining composite hydraulic constitutive functions is similar to the double hump type functions used by brouyère 2006 simple homographic and power functions were used instead of van genuchten mualem functions in brouyère s case the parameters of the constitutive functions were obtained by fitting the experimental curves measured on chalk samples for the matrix component and using literature values for the fracture component in our case the fitting of both relations matrix and fracture was performed using values measured in situ for suction and water content avoiding possible scale effects 4 mathematical model following the analysis of the data from the experimental site we selected a modelling approach employing a single domain flow and heat transport model with composite constitutive functions the marthe computer code thiéry 1993 2015a b c which can model the unsaturated saturated continuum using a 3d finite volume approach was used because the ground surface is for the most part horizontal and uniformly covered by grass and the rainfall is uniform at a local scale a 1d vertical modelling was selected the computer code solves richards equation numerically to calculate the pressure head water content and pore velocity it has been used extensively to model complex flow and transport through the uz as described for example in herbst et al 2005 and vanderborght et al 2005 to allow the possibility of preferential flow the retention and hydraulic conductivity composite functions which are described in eqs 2 and 9 are included in the code the coupled heat transfer module of the code integrates transfer by advection thermal conduction and dispersion thermal dispersion is induced by the heterogeneity of the local velocity in the advection 4 1 water flow equation in the uz richards equation is obtained by combining the darcy equation with the conservation of mass equation in 1d along the vertical direction using the hydraulic head h it takes the form 13 θ t z k h z q where h l is hydraulic head θ is water content k l t 1 is hydraulic conductivity t t is time z l is elevation and q t 1 is the source term as will be explained in the next sub section in detail a flux q resulting from rainfall and evapotranspiration is introduced in the upper cell and the hydraulic head of the bottom cell is prescribed to a constant value corresponding to the local average aquifer level the numerical solution of this equation gives the pressure head water content and darcy velocity at all times in the whole domain it also gives the aquifer recharge 4 2 heat transfer equation the heat transfer equation solved in the model taking into account advection thermal conduction and thermal dispersion is 14 2 λ al t z 2 ρ c w q t z q e ρ c a t t where t c or k is temperature q l t 1 is darcy velocity λal w l 1 k 1 is the resultant aquifer thermal conductivity integrating thermal dispersivity ρcw and ρca j l 3 k 1 are water and aquifer volumetric thermal capacities and qe w l 3 is the energy source term the bulk aquifer parameters ρca and λal are explicated in appendix a soil temperatures are prescribed in the upper and lower boundaries the numerical solution of this equation gives the temperature at all times in the whole domain 4 3 tank model converting aquifer recharge into regional groundwater level because a 1d vertical flow model cannot simulate the evolution of the regional groundwater level of the underlying aquifer we selected a second simple recession model to convert the computed bottom flow to aquifer level assuming a uniform transmissivity and specific yield the aquifer may be represented by a tank model characterised by a specific yield fed by recharge and drained by an outflow proportional to its groundwater level above the base level writing the mass conservation of this simple lumped recession model results immediately in the following equation 15 d l t b dt r t s y l t b c where l t l is aquifer level r t l t 1 is recharge b l is base level sy is specific yield and c t is the recession time constant 5 numerical modelling of flow and heat transfer because the numerical model can solve the unsaturated saturated continuum where the medium is unsaturated it uses the equation θ t z k h z q richards equation where the medium has reached saturation it uses the equation 16 s s h t z k h z q where ss l 1 is the specific storage coefficient to ensure continuity in the model thiéry 1993 2015c the two equations are combined 17 θ t θ θ s s s h t z k h z q where θs is the water content at saturation this equation is solved numerically by a finite volume approach 5 1 discretization and boundary conditions the modelled domain extends from the ground surface to a depth of 27 m which corresponds to the deepest recorded groundwater level the domain is discretized into cells of sizes ranging from 25 cm near the surface to 100 cm at the bottom the size of the upper cell is 40 cm to account for transpiration by grass roots the size of this first cell is not critical as quite similar simulations were obtained using either four 10 cm cells or a single 40 cm cell given the spatial variability of the data in the vertical direction and possible local heterogeneity we chose not to interpolate between the depths to which constitutive functions could be established it was then assumed that the constitutive function established by the data analysis at a given depth should apply to the whole zone centred on this depth eleven homogeneous zones containing several cells were determined each of which having uniform retention and hydraulic conductivity functions in zone nos 1 5 which correspond to depths between 0 and 2 3 m the same hydraulic conductivity function was used because it was difficult to determine these functions at shallow depths zone no 11 corresponds to depths greater than 8 m where no constitutive functions could be defined from the data because the water content was not monitored in this zone it was assumed as a first guess that the parameters of this zone were identical to those of zone no 10 which is located at depths between 7 25 and 8 25 m 5 1 1 hydraulic boundary conditions and time steps in the bottom cell of the model which is located at a depth of 27 m corresponding to the water table a pressure head of zero was prescribed this depth roughly corresponds to the lowest groundwater level of the modelled period the highest level being 10 m higher the hydraulic head of the bottom cell could have been prescribed at the monitored level of the water table but the model would then have lost its predictive capacity prescribing into the bottom cell the monitored water table yielded very small changes in the calculated pressure head the maximum changes were 0 2 at a depth of 6 5 m and 1 0 at a depth of 10 m this shows that the flow did not greatly depend on the bottom boundary condition except in its vicinity at the upper boundary of the model in the first cell the monitored meteorological values rainfall and pe flux were introduced using pe the actual evapotranspiration ae the sum of evaporation and transpiration by plants is calculated by the model because the soil surface is always covered with grass a simple method was found to be sufficient during dry periods pe is automatically reduced by the model to respect a maximum possible suction corresponding to the maximum recorded suction in the root zone this approximately simulates the transpiration decrease resulting from the grass stress considering the pressure monitored at the first depth the maximum possible suction value in the model was set to 900 cm it has been verified that by running the model with a maximal possible suction of 5000 cm instead of 900 cm that the same aquifer recharge was obtained to within 3 but with a much less realistic pressure head in the upper cells during dry periods the 2006 2008 period was modelled using daily meteorological data but the internal model time step was automatically reduced when necessary to achieve a perfect convergence and water balance the 21 26 may 2007 infiltration test was modelled using an hourly time step for this simulation the infiltrated flux was added to the rainfall value the simulations were initialized by a steady state calculation using a constant infiltration flux for the initialization of the 2006 2008 period an infiltration flux of 0 2 mm day was used considering the low rainfall during the previous month and the low initial water content at depths of 0 8m the hourly simulation of the 21 26 may 2007 period was initialised with a higher infiltration rate of 0 96 mm day due to the higher initial water content 5 1 2 thermal boundary conditions at the upper boundary of the model inside the upper cell the daily monitored soil temperature at a depth of 0 2 m was prescribed the monitored air temperature which was not very different could have been used but was less relevant during the summer period in the bottom cell the temperature was prescribed at 11 c which was the aquifer quasi constant temperature considering the great depth of the boundary and the short duration of the modelled period this bottom boundary condition is not critical it has been verified that with a drainage boundary condition where the bottom outflow leaves the bottom cell with its internal temperature the results are identical at the end of the calculation the bottom temperature varied by less than 0 06 c the initial temperature profile was interpolated from the monitored profile at depths between 0 and 8 m below 8 m the initial temperature was extrapolated assuming a temperature of 11 c in the water table at the bottom of the model 5 2 hydraulic model calibration very little calibration was performed and only the following data were calibrated the constitutive functions in the deeper depths and the initial steady state in the lowest zone which corresponds to the domain below 8 m for which no constitutive functions can be determined parameters identical to those at depths of 7 8m were first assigned in this zone below 8 m the difference between porosity and residual water content appeared to be too large the porosity was then decreased slightly to obtain amplitudes similar to those of the upper zones other parameters relative to this deepest zone were also slightly modified see table 2 this enabled a faster pressure head reaction below 8 m which better fit the monitored data the steady state for initialisation was first calculated with a too large infiltration flux this equivalent steady state infiltration flux was then reduced to begin the simulation with water contents and pressure heads closer to the measured values the parameters of the retention laws and hydraulic conductivity laws in the 11 zones are given in table 2 from that table the hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the threshold water content i e when the fracture starts to be active is within a range of 2 8 mm d this is the same order of magnitude as values reported by wellings 1984 and ireson et al 2009 the specific storage coefficient was set equal to 0 a run with a value of 10 6 m 1 produced identical results because the chalk never reached full saturation 5 3 results of the hydraulic modelling 5 3 1 daily simulation of the 2006 2008 period a comparison of observed and simulated time series for water content at depths between 1 5 m and 8 m fig 6 showed that the variations were well simulated at all depths the slight and steady increase in measured values was however not reproduced by the model this increase might have been due to water storage in a fine porosity that was very difficult to drain later it should not be an artefact due to sensor drift because a similar variation was measured at three depths 3m 5 m and 8 m by three different sensors the comparison of observed and simulated time series for pressure head at four depths between 0 5 m and 14 m fig 7 shows that these were generally simulated reasonably well however the simulated pressure head at 14 m tended to be attenuated possibly due to the lateral bypass of heterogeneities which cannot be addressed with a 1d model considering the considerable hysteresis that was observed it is not surprising that it is impossible to obtain a perfect fit for water contents and pressure heads at a given depth the computed vertical flux was examined at different depths the cumulated computed vertical uptake by evapotranspiration at a depth of 1 05 m was 13 mm during the 2 5 year simulation period 5 mm year this validates the assumption that evapotranspiration had no significant effect below a depth of 1 m an assumption that was used to determine the hydraulic conductivity function 5 3 2 hourly simulation of the may 2007 infiltration test a comparison of the observed and simulated water contents at depths between 1 m and 8 m showed that the water content variations were well simulated both in amplitude and time see fig 8 a for an 8 m depth the pressure head rise delay was simulated reasonably well at depths down to 8 m at 8 m 19 m depths the fit was approximate which can be explained by the much more erratic nature of the pressure head measurements fig 8b 5 4 thermal model calibration the heat transfer modelling required few new parameters standard parameters for mineral thermal conductivity 2 5 w m k and mineral volumetric specific heat 2 4 106 j m3 k were used and no fitting was performed the thermal longitudinal dispersivity was set to 0 but as the velocity was small except during the infiltration test this parameter was not critical quasi similar results were obtained with a thermal dispersivity equal to 0 2 m i e 1 20 th of a reference depth of 4 m 5 5 results of the thermal modelling the aim of the thermal modelling was not to simulate the soil temperature but rather to check whether the uz flow modelling approach was consistent with the temperature monitoring the temperatures recorded at all depths during the period before the 2007 infiltration test were well simulated fig 9 however except during the 2007 infiltration test the flow was slow and the heat transfer occurred mainly by thermal conduction and depended little on advection during and after the infiltration test the simulated increase in temperature resulting from the infiltration of warmer water was poorly simulated the simulated increase in temperature at depths between 1 m and 8 m was too high and too long during the infiltration test advection was large a significant portion of the warm infiltrating water probably flowed rapidly through fractures without sufficient time for a total heat exchange with the porous matrix the matrix temperature measured by the sensors was colder than it would have been if all of the flow had circulated through its pores the difficulty in simulating heat transfer with the same thermal parameters during the infiltration test confirms that a large part of the water flows through the fracture network the single domain composite constitutive function configuration that correctly simulates flow even under extreme conditions is an approximation that does not permit accurate solute or heat transfers 5 6 model validation with monitored groundwater levels because the water content and suction values were monitored for only 2 5 years other data were used to validate the model over long periods that included floods and drought for this purpose the groundwater levels recorded in senlis le sec 3 5 km away were used the hydraulic model was run with the daily rainfall data of bernaville for a 20 year period 1988 2008 the calculated series of daily aquifer recharge at the bottom of the model was then converted to groundwater levels using the tank model described in section 4 eq 15 for given values of parameters c sy and b the time variation in the aquifer level l t is obtained by solving eq 15 explicitly at a daily time step using a classic hydrological tank model thiéry 2015d parameters c sy and b were obtained by calibrating the hydrological tank model using the series of observations of groundwater levels fig 10 shows that an accurate simulation was obtained correlation coefficient 0 927 for periods of both low and high water years 1994 1995 2001 and 2002 in particular the groundwater levels during the 2001 historical flood were simulated correctly the 2008 period was however underestimated this simulation was obtained with the following parameters b 57 87 m sy 2 4 and c 6 43 months the specific yield which was equal to 2 4 corresponds to the difference between the saturated and de saturated conditions in the vicinity of the water table this value of specific yield is also consistent with the values obtained in the somme regional model amraoui et al 2002 the recession time constant c should be on the order of magnitude of the standard aquifer time constant tc rousseau gueutin et al 2013 18 t c 4 d 2 s y π 2 t where t l2 t 1 is aquifer average transmissivity and d l is average distance to rivers applying eq 18 with t 2 8 10 3 m2 s the local transmissivity in the hallue basin hamm et al 2008 sy 2 4 and tc c 6 43 months yields an average distance to the rivers of d 7 5 km which is a realistic order of magnitude in this basin the fact that the groundwater level time series can be reproduced using only the recharge evolution calculated with the discretized model gives more confidence to the modelling approach and to the hydraulic parameters at depths greater than 8 m that could not be determined directly it is however not a real validation as the hydrological tank model uses 3 calibrated parameters 6 summary and conclusions the data gathered at the warloy baillon site during the 2006 2008 period from the entire depth of the uz enabled the in situ determination of hydraulic parameters without our having to rely on literature data the infiltration test with a high infiltration rate was essential for defining the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions the data gathered confirmed the hypothesis of a sudden increase in hydraulic conductivities for suctions less than approximately 50 cm and the increase in porosity as the fractures begin to be conductive the corresponding hydraulic conductivity threshold is within a range of 2 8 mm d the infiltration test showed that the maximum saturated hydraulic conductivity integrating the fractures exceeds 300 mm d 3 5 10 6 m s the measured data were modelled using the marthe computer code employing a single domain approach with composite retention and hydraulic conductivity functions the model was run with very little calibration and correctly simulated the water content variations down to a depth of 8 m and also which to our knowledge is new the pressure head variations down to 23 m the pressure head values were simulated correctly but less accurately than the water content values due to a large hysteresis which was not accounted for the water content and pressure head values during the infiltration test period were also simulated accurately using a one hour time step which proves that the rapid flow dynamics were well modelled the model was controlled using the calculated recharge at the bottom of the model to simulate the monitored groundwater level over a period of 20 years 1988 2008 which is a new aspect this is not a real validation but it provides more confidence in the employed modelling approach and determined constitutive laws it also confirms the possibility of using with care the model at a local scale the analysis of the 1988 2008 simulation with the model integrating the 2001 historical flood was not described in the paper but nevertheless shows that the high saturation behaviour of the constitutive laws due to the fractures was used very rarely as the flows through the uz were most of the time less than 8 mm d which was the minimal value of the matrix hydraulic conductivity at saturation to verify the modelling possibilities of the selected scheme the temperature variations down to a depth of 8 m were modelled without extra model calibration the temperature was well simulated under natural conditions but not during the infiltration test this confirms that a single domain model that implicitly assumes an instantaneous equilibrium between matrix and fractures can accurately model water content and flow but not solute or heat transfers this is because in the real fractured medium the mass in solution or the heat is transferred very rapidly through the fracture network without having sufficient time either for any exchange with the matrix to occur or to reach equilibrium as the utilized model can also integrate an explicit network of drains or fractures in saturated and or unsaturated states modelling employing a non equilibrium dual domain scheme could be considered in a future project acknowledgements the

7580,during the winter and spring of 2000 2001 large floods occurred in northern france somme river basin and southern england patcham area of brighton in valleys that are developed on chalk outcrops the floods durations were particularly long more than 3 months in the somme basin and caused significant damage in both countries to improve the understanding of groundwater flooding in chalk catchments an experimental site was set up in the hallue basin which is located in the somme river basin france unsaturated fractured chalk formation overlying the chalk aquifer was monitored to understand its reaction to long and heavy rainfall events when it reaches a near saturation state the water content and soil temperature were monitored to a depth of 8 m and the matrix pressure was monitored down to the water table 26 5 m below ground level the monitoring extended over a 2 5 year period 2006 2008 under natural conditions and during two periods when heavy artificial infiltration was induced the objective of the paper is to describe a vertical numerical flow model based on richards equation using these data that was developed to simulate infiltrating rainwater flow from the ground surface to the saturated aquifer the marthe computer code which models the unsaturated saturated continuum was adapted to reproduce the monitored high saturation periods composite constitutive functions hydraulic conductivity saturation and pressure saturation that integrate the increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation and extra available porosity resulting from fractures were introduced into the code using these composite constitutive functions the model was able to accurately simulate the water contents and pressures at all depths over the entire monitored period including the infiltration tests the soil temperature was also accurately simulated at all depths except during the infiltrations tests which contributes to the model validation the model was used to calculate the aquifer recharge over a long period that included droughts and floods the calculated recharge is realistic as it makes it possible to simulate the corresponding monitored groundwater level data which increases confidence in the modelling approach keywords vadose zone modelling dual permeability flow experimental site deep monitoring soil heat transfer 1 introduction during the winter and spring of 2000 2001 large floods occurred in northern france somme river basin and southern england brighton the chalk in the somme river basin is fractured and has a fine grained porous matrix this matrix provides most of the porosity and storage capacity and the fractures greatly enhance the hydraulic conductivity roux 1965 price 1993 modelling of the groundwater levels and river flows in the somme basin amraoui et al 2002 2003 and various observations have led to the conclusion that in 2001 after several wet years a significant increase in stored groundwater and possibly the saturation of the chalk unsaturated zone uz caused the flood due to the complexity of this chalk medium dual porosity and dual permeability there might have been hydraulic continuity between the unsaturated and saturated zones of the basin during a period of abnormally high rainfall leading to a rapid rise in the groundwater level to better understand the flow processes that occur in the uz under various recharge conditions in chalk catchments an experimental site was set up during the flood1 project the experimental site was installed in the hallue basin which is located in the somme river basin france and equipped to monitor the unsaturated fractured chalk formation overlying the chalk aquifer since the 1970s many experimental studies and a large amount of modelling work have been undertaken to understand the physical processes controlling water and solute movement through the uz simunek et al 2003 and le vine et al 2016 reviewed and compared approaches for describing flow and transport in the uz using a single domain non equilibrium scheme or a preferential flow scheme equilibrium or non equilibrium it has been shown that due to fissures a single domain representation is not suitable ireson et al 2009 preferential flow results in irregular wetting of the soil profile as a direct consequence of water moving faster in certain parts of the ground than in others e g fissures versus matrix preferential flow which generally occurs relatively infrequently ireson and butler 2011 can be represented by a variety of dual porosity or dual permeability models that take into account the macropores and the bulk matrix although dual porosity models assume that the water in the matrix is stagnant dual permeability models assume that the water moves in both the matrix and macropores a simple equilibrium dual porosity flow model can be obtained by combining the single porosity richards equation with double hump constitutive functions of hydraulic properties simunek et al 2003 the double hump allows both porosities and a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation to be accounted for however models based on this assumption implicitly assume instantaneous equilibrium instantaneous exchange of water between the two pore systems non equilibrium flow and transport dual porosity models assume that water in the matrix does not move the matrix pores represent immobile pockets that can exchange retain and store water but do not enable convective flow this conceptualization leads to flow and transport models that partition the liquid phase into mobile and immobile regions simunek et al 2003 observed that dual porosity models have been used mostly for solute transport studies and less frequently for flow various types of non equilibrium dual permeability approaches have been used to describe flow and transport in both pore regions macropores and micropores a critical aspect in all dual porosity permeability models is the description of the coupling terms representing mass transfer between the matrix and fracture regions some descriptions are physically based though approximate whereas others are entirely empirical two main approaches are presented mass transfer driven by the difference in fluid saturation simunek et al 2001 larsbo and jarvis 2003 and mass transfer driven by the difference in pressure head gerke and van genuchten 1993a between the two pore regions as noted by simunek et al 2003 it may be difficult to use the dual permeability approach because of the large number of parameters involved and the lack of experimental techniques needed to obtain them mathias et al 2006 in an attempt to reconcile commonly observed and apparently contradictory phenomena in the unsaturated chalk such as rapid water table response slow solute migration and very low solute dispersion developed a transient dual permeability model of flow and transport through unsaturated chalk although their model does increase our understanding of the processes involved it requires a large number of parameters and was tested only on a hypothetical scenario and not calibrated with field measurements after carrying out detailed field investigations to study groundwater recharge and solute migration through the uz of a chalk aquifer in belgium brouyère et al 2004 and brouyère 2006 developed a mathematical and numerical model of the tracer migration in variably saturated fissured chalk their approach was similar to the above mentioned equilibrium dual porosity model described by simunek et al 2003 that relies on composite constitutive functions of hydraulic properties where the double hump makes it possible to take into account a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation due to the onset of fissure flow the composite retention curve presented by brouyère 2006 is mathematically better than those used in previous studies cited by simunek et al 2003 due to a continuous derivable transition between the functions that describe the matrix and the fissure to calculate contaminant transport in dual porosity media water is usually distributed between mobile and immobile phases and the porosity of the immobile phase in the matrix is assumed to be constant brouyère 2006 introduced mathematical developments to accommodate a variable distribution of water between mobile and immobile phases depending on the degree of saturation the resulting numerical model was applied under steady state conditions to the simulation of breakthrough curves of tracers in variably saturated chalk that resulted from the field campaign described in brouyère et al 2004 interesting results were obtained but they could probably be improved by considering the transient nature of recharge and the variations in piezometric level that were not taken into account in their study van den daele et al 2007 presented a detailed analysis of deuterium tracer test results conducted under natural rainfall conditions in the unsaturated chalk of cambridgeshire uk tracer migration was monitored by periodic core sampling and the collection of lysimeter drainage water modelling of the unsaturated flow and solute transport at the experimental site was performed using macro 5 0 a 1d numerical dual permeability model using an automatic calibration method a good fit was obtained with the measured lysimeter drainage and water contents at different depths but the model was unable to simulate the low pressure heads in the chalk strata observed during the summer simulations of the tracer led to a moderate quality fit of the tracer profiles despite its uncertainties that study represented a significant improvement over the modelling of flow and transport through the unsaturated chalk in a transient regime and with calibration using field data ireson et al 2009 used a parsimonious physically based model for water flow their model used hydraulic properties that were scaled as a function of depth and transpiration losses from the root zone were estimated using the feddes model feddes et al 1976 two dimensional vertical cross section modelling using a physically based hillslope model ireson and butler 2013 was also performed to estimate recharge over a transect to determine aquifer recharge mathias et al 2016 employed the vertical percolation rate vpr estimated using a soil moisture accounting procedure smap they showed that constraining the rate by soil moisture content measurements significantly improved the estimation rahman and rosolem 2017 used a simple approach with a bulk conductivity bc model to simulate water flow through the matrix fracture system they showed that the bc model could potentially be useful for surface modelling over large scale chalk dominated areas finally jarvis et al 2016 presented a thorough review of recent preferential flow modelling taking into account macropores implicitly or explicitly and suggested future prospects the objective of the present paper is to describe a vertically discretized flow model solving richards equation using composite constitutive functions hydraulic conductivity saturation and pressure saturation that is able to simulate all the data gathered at the experimental site during the entire monitored period including the infiltration tests the simulated data include water content and soil temperature down to 8 m depth and pressure head down to the water table at 27 m depth the paper also describes how the monitored data were used to establish the model composite constitutive functions by integrating the increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation and the additional available porosity resulting from fractures the composite functions enable modelling very wet conditions during which preferential flow is dominant a validation of the modelling approach using the calculated aquifer recharge to simulate a long series of groundwater levels monitored in a neighbouring piezometer is presented 2 experimental site and available data the experimental site is located at warloy baillon in the hallue basin somme northern france 21 km northeast of amiens fig 1 in the hallue basin the aquifer is represented by the permeable upper turonian and senonian chalk formations which are overlain by several metres of quaternary silts on the plateau and by alluvium in the valley the unsaturated chalk layer is up to 30 50 m thick on the plateau the hallue river drains the chalk aquifer under both low and high water conditions the lithological description of three cored boreholes drilled in the experimental site show that the top 0 7 m of the profile is a brown loamy soil with scattered chalk gravel and pebbles this soil overlies a weathered chalk horizon extending 6 9 m below ground level bgl which in turn overlies fractured white chalk that reaches a depth of 33 8 m the site was equipped to monitor the chalk saturated and unsaturated zones and the recharge parameters machard de gramont 2007 amraoui et al 2008a 2008b the pressure head was measured from the surface to the water table ten tensiometres which were also equipped with temperature sensors were installed at depths between 0 2 and 8 m twelve jacking tensiometres were used to monitor the deeper unsaturated chalk at depths between 10 and 26 5 m the water content was monitored in the soil and chalk between 0 2 and 8 m depth using an envirosmart probe equipped with 16 sensors for the saturated chalk the groundwater level was monitored continuously in borehole p1 located some metres away meteorological data including rainfall relative humidity and air temperature were also monitored at the site the measurements were carried out over a period of two and a half years in 2006 2008 during that period the water content water temperature pressure head rainfall and groundwater levels were recorded hourly amraoui et al 2008b analysed the results of in situ and laboratory tests and of continuous water content and pressure monitoring and discussed the main flow processes observed during that period two periods of significant natural recharge occurred during this period december 2006 to february 2007 and november 2007 to march 2008 however as there was a risk that no flooding would occur during the 2006 2008 period two heavy artificial infiltration tests were carried out in may 2007 and in april 2008 to simulate flood conditions table 1 the second test which was performed at a lower infiltration rate to provide additional information produced data that were less usable than those of the first test 3 data analysis the data recorded at the experimental site were analysed to determine the soil constitutive functions needed for the numerical model namely retention curves and hydraulic conductivity relation as a function of the water content 3 1 time evolution of hydraulic parameters under natural conditions as anticipated the variations in pressure head are much smoother at greater depths than in the first metre the minimal suction is usually less than 10 cm at all depths during the infiltration test fig 2 at depths lower than 0 5 m the variations in water content monitored over the entire period are approximately 15 of water content at depths between 0 5 and 8 m the variations are small approximately 1 2 fig 2 and therefore very accurate water content measurements are required to determine variations during the may 2007 infiltration test period the monitored water content was significantly higher than under natural conditions including the periods of heavy recharge in the winters of 2006 2007 and 2007 2008 the depth weighted average of the water content between 0 and 8 m depth fluctuated by approximately 2 5 during the period except during the two infiltration tests this average water content which had a mean of 43 75 and a minimum of 42 5 increased regularly during the 2006 2008 period this increase was correlated to the rising water table levels in borehole p1 which were the same as those measured using the senlis le sec 00471x0010 h1 piezometer 3 5 km away over time the depth of the water table in borehole p1 resided between 30 and 19 m bgl 3 2 analysis of the may 2007 infiltration test the may 2007 infiltration test was analysed at hourly time steps at each depth the rise delay which is the time to reach half of the water content or pressure rise was determined the increase in water content at various depths showed that the reactions were rapid and that the amplitude of the rise decreased from 6 of water content at a depth of 1 m to 1 5 at 5 m fig 3 a however the water content rise at 8 m was 2 5 the pressure head also increased rapidly only 21 h were needed for infiltrating water to reach a depth of 8 m 0 38 m h and 32 h to reach a depth of 19 m 0 59 m h fig 3b the water table was at a depth of 22 m during the test and there was no reaction beyond that depth these reactions were rapid because the initial water content was quite high between depths of 0 and 8 m at the beginning of the test depth weighted average 43 88 after the reaction delay the pressure head rose to almost zero the vertical hydraulic head gradient dh dz was then equal to one the water content during the infiltration remained constant for 4 days after the initial rise which suggests that the system was in a steady state the infiltrating water percolated at a rate of 289 mm d see table 1 with a hydraulic gradient of 1 which suggests that the hydraulic conductivity was also 289 mm d as it is not known whether the maximum saturation was reached the hydraulic conductivity at saturation must be at least 289 mm d no groundwater level reaction was observed in the aquifer during this infiltration test because of its high transmissivity the aquifer reacts to the average recharge over several tens of kilometres and the recharge over an area of 24 m2 has a negligible effect 3 3 determination of the retention functions retention functions give the suction or pressure head as a function of water content to correctly model natural flow the retention functions were determined using values measured in situ rather than values from laboratory experiments determining a retention function is relatively easy if the monitored period is long enough and includes both wet and dry periods simultaneous data for water content and pressure head or suction at a given depth should yield the desired function suction was plotted against water content at each monitored depth between 0 2 and 8 m see fig 4 at a depth of 6 50 m the data show considerable hysteresis at a given depth the same water content can correspond to quite different suctions the hysteresis tended however to decrease with depth ireson et al 2012 also observed a large hysteresis that is characteristic of a non equilibrium preferential flow during the infiltration test the water content was much greater than under natural conditions several authors price et al 2000 simunek et al 2003 mathias 2005 brouyère 2006 have suggested that this increase in water content might be due to a double porosity effect fracture volumes in the chalk flow only when there is very high saturation low suction 3 3 1 mathematical formulation brutsaert s equation brutsaert 1966 a classic homographic formulation that is usually very well suited to standard porous media was tried 1 h

function exponent 1 swm matric water saturation θ θr θsm θr to determine the retention function three parameters must be identified at each depth θsm θr and b an optimisation code was designed to automatically determine the parameters that produce the retention function that is closest to the mean curve determined from the scatter plot however this classic homographic function brutsaert function could not take into account the double porosity effect a fit with a van genuchten function 1980 was also tried but resulted in the same difficulty it was therefore necessary to modify the retention formulation to fit the data a single domain with a composite retention function was used to model flow in this fractured medium a dual permeability approach with two domains could also have been used but is much more complex as acknowledged by simunek et al 2003 to obtain a retention function that was applicable for the entire range of water content values a composite function was used that associates two homographic equations one for the porous matrix and another when water contents exceeds a threshold θl i e when water begins to enter fractures this approach is similar to the dual porosity flow model described by simunek et al 2003 that uses a composite double hump type equation for the hydraulic properties fig 4 displays the homographic composite retention function at a depth of 6 5 m during a wetting phase above a threshold water content of 43 2 the decrease in suction is reduced as the water began to enter the fractures the total saturation reaches 44 1 instead of 43 4 for the porous matrix alone when θ θl the second homographic function is 2 h h 0 f θ sf θ θ θ rf b f 1 s wf 1 b f where θl threshold water content θrf fracture residual water content θsf fracture water content at saturation effective porosity h0f fracture suction at half saturation l bf fracture retention function exponent swf fracture water saturation θ θrf θsf θrf 3 3 2 parameter identification parameter θsf which is the maximum possible water content has a physical connotation whereas h0f θrf and bf are only calibration parameters because the slope of the retention function used by the flow model must be continuous the two retention functions must be tangent for water content θl the suction h and its derivative must be the same for both functions at θl the retention parameters were determined in the following way 1 the threshold water content θl was determined from observations 2 parameters θr θsm b and h0 were first calibrated for water contents θl 3 parameter θsf effective porosity was determined from observations 4 successive values were tried for θrf and the corresponding values for h0f and bf were determined so that the two functions are tangent in θl

data very well at all depths for the entire range of suction values between 0 cm and 1000 cm 3 4 determination of the hydraulic conductivity functions from the field data determining the hydraulic conductivity function from field data is difficult because hydraulic conductivity cannot be directly measured in the field but is obtained by indirect measurements that are difficult and uncertain to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values corresponding to different water contents a method adapted from the internal drainage method hillel et al 1972 vachaud et al 1978 was used the method assumes a downward flux from the soil surface and a known infiltration flux it relates the estimated local flux through a layer of soil at a given time to the local hydraulic head gradient estimated from the measurement of the pressure head of the lower and higher depths the local flux in the layer is estimated from the infiltration flux at the surface and from the variations in the water content in all the upper depths the method was applied differently during the 2007 infiltration test and under natural conditions during the 2007 infiltration test both the measured surface runoff 1 5 of the infiltrated flux and the calculated evapotranspiration less than 1 of the infiltrated flux were neglected the infiltrated flux q0 was known because it was monitored and the method could be directly applied because the water content variations were usually small at hourly time steps a 6 h time step was used the hydraulic head gradient was always very close to one but occasionally oscillated to avoid erratic values the gradient was assumed to be always equal to one for the calculation of the hydraulic conductivity under natural conditions the surface flux is unknown the rainfall r and the potential evapotranspiration pe are known but the actual evapotranspiration ae which is conditioned by water availability and plants stress is not known an attempt to use the difference r pe as the surface flux did not produce useful results moreover measurements of the pressure head in the upper depths did not allow the precise definition of a zero flux plane separating the upward and downward flows it was then assumed and verified later that evapotranspiration had no significant effect below 1 m depth except during limited periods the cumulated storage below 1 m was then calculated sequences during which the cumulated storage decreased constantly over long periods were selected and the downward flux was determined using the same equation considering the small rate of water content variations time steps of 4 7 days were used because this approach does not apply above a depth of 1 m the hydraulic conductivity for depths between 0 2 and 0 7 m were calculated only during the 2007 infiltration test 3 4 1 mathematical formulation a simple power function which is usually well adapted to standard porous media was selected 7 k k s θ θ r θ sm θ r d k s s wm d where k hydraulic conductivity l t 1 ks hydraulic conductivity at saturation l t 1 d exponent of the hydraulic conductivity function as expected from the analysis of the may 2007 infiltration test this function was unable to fit the entire range of hydraulic conductivity values calculated from the observations a hydraulic conductivity power function obtained for low to medium water contents considerably underestimated the hydraulic conductivities at higher saturation this proves that as expected due to the fractures in the chalk vertical hydraulic conductivity is considerably greater near saturation using the same approach as for the retention function a simple composite hydraulic conductivity function was defined 8 when θ θ l k k m θ θ r θ sf θ r d and 9 when θ θ l k k f θ θ 2 θ sf θ 2 d f where km matrix hydraulic conductivity at saturation l t 1 kf fractures hydraulic conductivity at saturation l t 1 df exponent of the fractures hydraulic conductivity function θ2 calibrated water content to ensure continuity between the two equations the effective porosity θsf is used in both equations 3 4 2 parameter identification the parameters θsf θr and θl are known from the retention function and the remaining hydraulic conductivity function parameters were determined in the following way 1 km and d were first calibrated for water contents less than θl 2 successive values of kf and df were tried to fit high hydraulic conductivities for water contents exceeding θl and the corresponding value of θ2 was calculated to ensure continuity at θl equating eqs 8 and 9 with θ θl the value of θ2 is 10 θ 2 β θ l θ sf β 1 where 11 β k f k l 1 d f and 12 k l k m θ l θ r θ sf θ r d the composite hydraulic conductivity function was fitted to the data from all depths where water contents were recorded the composite functions obtained at 8 depths adequately fit the data both under natural conditions and during the 2007 infiltration test see fig 5 a for a depth of 6 5 m using the retention functions to convert water content into pressure head the hydraulic conductivity versus pressure head relation was obtained the hydraulic conductivity increases suddenly usually when the pressure head rises above 50 cm fig 5b similar to the results reported by wellings 1984 the hydraulic conductivities at saturation are similar to or even greater than the values reported by mahmood ul hassan and gregory 2002 for example at a depth of 6 5 m above a threshold water content of 43 2 the hydraulic conductivity function integrating fractures has a maximal value at saturation of 450 mm d which is 50 times greater than the matrix hydraulic conductivity at saturation although this method for defining composite hydraulic constitutive functions is similar to the double hump type functions used by brouyère 2006 simple homographic and power functions were used instead of van genuchten mualem functions in brouyère s case the parameters of the constitutive functions were obtained by fitting the experimental curves measured on chalk samples for the matrix component and using literature values for the fracture component in our case the fitting of both relations matrix and fracture was performed using values measured in situ for suction and water content avoiding possible scale effects 4 mathematical model following the analysis of the data from the experimental site we selected a modelling approach employing a single domain flow and heat transport model with composite constitutive functions the marthe computer code thiéry 1993 2015a b c which can model the unsaturated saturated continuum using a 3d finite volume approach was used because the ground surface is for the most part horizontal and uniformly covered by grass and the rainfall is uniform at a local scale a 1d vertical modelling was selected the computer code solves richards equation numerically to calculate the pressure head water content and pore velocity it has been used extensively to model complex flow and transport through the uz as described for example in herbst et al 2005 and vanderborght et al 2005 to allow the possibility of preferential flow the retention and hydraulic conductivity composite functions which are described in eqs 2 and 9 are included in the code the coupled heat transfer module of the code integrates transfer by advection thermal conduction and dispersion thermal dispersion is induced by the heterogeneity of the local velocity in the advection 4 1 water flow equation in the uz richards equation is obtained by combining the darcy equation with the conservation of mass equation in 1d along the vertical direction using the hydraulic head h it takes the form 13 θ t z k h z q where h l is hydraulic head θ is water content k l t 1 is hydraulic conductivity t t is time z l is elevation and q t 1 is the source term as will be explained in the next sub section in detail a flux q resulting from rainfall and evapotranspiration is introduced in the upper cell and the hydraulic head of the bottom cell is prescribed to a constant value corresponding to the local average aquifer level the numerical solution of this equation gives the pressure head water content and darcy velocity at all times in the whole domain it also gives the aquifer recharge 4 2 heat transfer equation the heat transfer equation solved in the model taking into account advection thermal conduction and thermal dispersion is 14 2 λ al t z 2 ρ c w q t z q e ρ c a t t where t c or k is temperature q l t 1 is darcy velocity λal w l 1 k 1 is the resultant aquifer thermal conductivity integrating thermal dispersivity ρcw and ρca j l 3 k 1 are water and aquifer volumetric thermal capacities and qe w l 3 is the energy source term the bulk aquifer parameters ρca and λal are explicated in appendix a soil temperatures are prescribed in the upper and lower boundaries the numerical solution of this equation gives the temperature at all times in the whole domain 4 3 tank model converting aquifer recharge into regional groundwater level because a 1d vertical flow model cannot simulate the evolution of the regional groundwater level of the underlying aquifer we selected a second simple recession model to convert the computed bottom flow to aquifer level assuming a uniform transmissivity and specific yield the aquifer may be represented by a tank model characterised by a specific yield fed by recharge and drained by an outflow proportional to its groundwater level above the base level writing the mass conservation of this simple lumped recession model results immediately in the following equation 15 d l t b dt r t s y l t b c where l t l is aquifer level r t l t 1 is recharge b l is base level sy is specific yield and c t is the recession time constant 5 numerical modelling of flow and heat transfer because the numerical model can solve the unsaturated saturated continuum where the medium is unsaturated it uses the equation θ t z k h z q richards equation where the medium has reached saturation it uses the equation 16 s s h t z k h z q where ss l 1 is the specific storage coefficient to ensure continuity in the model thiéry 1993 2015c the two equations are combined 17 θ t θ θ s s s h t z k h z q where θs is the water content at saturation this equation is solved numerically by a finite volume approach 5 1 discretization and boundary conditions the modelled domain extends from the ground surface to a depth of 27 m which corresponds to the deepest recorded groundwater level the domain is discretized into cells of sizes ranging from 25 cm near the surface to 100 cm at the bottom the size of the upper cell is 40 cm to account for transpiration by grass roots the size of this first cell is not critical as quite similar simulations were obtained using either four 10 cm cells or a single 40 cm cell given the spatial variability of the data in the vertical direction and possible local heterogeneity we chose not to interpolate between the depths to which constitutive functions could be established it was then assumed that the constitutive function established by the data analysis at a given depth should apply to the whole zone centred on this depth eleven homogeneous zones containing several cells were determined each of which having uniform retention and hydraulic conductivity functions in zone nos 1 5 which correspond to depths between 0 and 2 3 m the same hydraulic conductivity function was used because it was difficult to determine these functions at shallow depths zone no 11 corresponds to depths greater than 8 m where no constitutive functions could be defined from the data because the water content was not monitored in this zone it was assumed as a first guess that the parameters of this zone were identical to those of zone no 10 which is located at depths between 7 25 and 8 25 m 5 1 1 hydraulic boundary conditions and time steps in the bottom cell of the model which is located at a depth of 27 m corresponding to the water table a pressure head of zero was prescribed this depth roughly corresponds to the lowest groundwater level of the modelled period the highest level being 10 m higher the hydraulic head of the bottom cell could have been prescribed at the monitored level of the water table but the model would then have lost its predictive capacity prescribing into the bottom cell the monitored water table yielded very small changes in the calculated pressure head the maximum changes were 0 2 at a depth of 6 5 m and 1 0 at a depth of 10 m this shows that the flow did not greatly depend on the bottom boundary condition except in its vicinity at the upper boundary of the model in the first cell the monitored meteorological values rainfall and pe flux were introduced using pe the actual evapotranspiration ae the sum of evaporation and transpiration by plants is calculated by the model because the soil surface is always covered with grass a simple method was found to be sufficient during dry periods pe is automatically reduced by the model to respect a maximum possible suction corresponding to the maximum recorded suction in the root zone this approximately simulates the transpiration decrease resulting from the grass stress considering the pressure monitored at the first depth the maximum possible suction value in the model was set to 900 cm it has been verified that by running the model with a maximal possible suction of 5000 cm instead of 900 cm that the same aquifer recharge was obtained to within 3 but with a much less realistic pressure head in the upper cells during dry periods the 2006 2008 period was modelled using daily meteorological data but the internal model time step was automatically reduced when necessary to achieve a perfect convergence and water balance the 21 26 may 2007 infiltration test was modelled using an hourly time step for this simulation the infiltrated flux was added to the rainfall value the simulations were initialized by a steady state calculation using a constant infiltration flux for the initialization of the 2006 2008 period an infiltration flux of 0 2 mm day was used considering the low rainfall during the previous month and the low initial water content at depths of 0 8m the hourly simulation of the 21 26 may 2007 period was initialised with a higher infiltration rate of 0 96 mm day due to the higher initial water content 5 1 2 thermal boundary conditions at the upper boundary of the model inside the upper cell the daily monitored soil temperature at a depth of 0 2 m was prescribed the monitored air temperature which was not very different could have been used but was less relevant during the summer period in the bottom cell the temperature was prescribed at 11 c which was the aquifer quasi constant temperature considering the great depth of the boundary and the short duration of the modelled period this bottom boundary condition is not critical it has been verified that with a drainage boundary condition where the bottom outflow leaves the bottom cell with its internal temperature the results are identical at the end of the calculation the bottom temperature varied by less than 0 06 c the initial temperature profile was interpolated from the monitored profile at depths between 0 and 8 m below 8 m the initial temperature was extrapolated assuming a temperature of 11 c in the water table at the bottom of the model 5 2 hydraulic model calibration very little calibration was performed and only the following data were calibrated the constitutive functions in the deeper depths and the initial steady state in the lowest zone which corresponds to the domain below 8 m for which no constitutive functions can be determined parameters identical to those at depths of 7 8m were first assigned in this zone below 8 m the difference between porosity and residual water content appeared to be too large the porosity was then decreased slightly to obtain amplitudes similar to those of the upper zones other parameters relative to this deepest zone were also slightly modified see table 2 this enabled a faster pressure head reaction below 8 m which better fit the monitored data the steady state for initialisation was first calculated with a too large infiltration flux this equivalent steady state infiltration flux was then reduced to begin the simulation with water contents and pressure heads closer to the measured values the parameters of the retention laws and hydraulic conductivity laws in the 11 zones are given in table 2 from that table the hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the threshold water content i e when the fracture starts to be active is within a range of 2 8 mm d this is the same order of magnitude as values reported by wellings 1984 and ireson et al 2009 the specific storage coefficient was set equal to 0 a run with a value of 10 6 m 1 produced identical results because the chalk never reached full saturation 5 3 results of the hydraulic modelling 5 3 1 daily simulation of the 2006 2008 period a comparison of observed and simulated time series for water content at depths between 1 5 m and 8 m fig 6 showed that the variations were well simulated at all depths the slight and steady increase in measured values was however not reproduced by the model this increase might have been due to water storage in a fine porosity that was very difficult to drain later it should not be an artefact due to sensor drift because a similar variation was measured at three depths 3m 5 m and 8 m by three different sensors the comparison of observed and simulated time series for pressure head at four depths between 0 5 m and 14 m fig 7 shows that these were generally simulated reasonably well however the simulated pressure head at 14 m tended to be attenuated possibly due to the lateral bypass of heterogeneities which cannot be addressed with a 1d model considering the considerable hysteresis that was observed it is not surprising that it is impossible to obtain a perfect fit for water contents and pressure heads at a given depth the computed vertical flux was examined at different depths the cumulated computed vertical uptake by evapotranspiration at a depth of 1 05 m was 13 mm during the 2 5 year simulation period 5 mm year this validates the assumption that evapotranspiration had no significant effect below a depth of 1 m an assumption that was used to determine the hydraulic conductivity function 5 3 2 hourly simulation of the may 2007 infiltration test a comparison of the observed and simulated water contents at depths between 1 m and 8 m showed that the water content variations were well simulated both in amplitude and time see fig 8 a for an 8 m depth the pressure head rise delay was simulated reasonably well at depths down to 8 m at 8 m 19 m depths the fit was approximate which can be explained by the much more erratic nature of the pressure head measurements fig 8b 5 4 thermal model calibration the heat transfer modelling required few new parameters standard parameters for mineral thermal conductivity 2 5 w m k and mineral volumetric specific heat 2 4 106 j m3 k were used and no fitting was performed the thermal longitudinal dispersivity was set to 0 but as the velocity was small except during the infiltration test this parameter was not critical quasi similar results were obtained with a thermal dispersivity equal to 0 2 m i e 1 20 th of a reference depth of 4 m 5 5 results of the thermal modelling the aim of the thermal modelling was not to simulate the soil temperature but rather to check whether the uz flow modelling approach was consistent with the temperature monitoring the temperatures recorded at all depths during the period before the 2007 infiltration test were well simulated fig 9 however except during the 2007 infiltration test the flow was slow and the heat transfer occurred mainly by thermal conduction and depended little on advection during and after the infiltration test the simulated increase in temperature resulting from the infiltration of warmer water was poorly simulated the simulated increase in temperature at depths between 1 m and 8 m was too high and too long during the infiltration test advection was large a significant portion of the warm infiltrating water probably flowed rapidly through fractures without sufficient time for a total heat exchange with the porous matrix the matrix temperature measured by the sensors was colder than it would have been if all of the flow had circulated through its pores the difficulty in simulating heat transfer with the same thermal parameters during the infiltration test confirms that a large part of the water flows through the fracture network the single domain composite constitutive function configuration that correctly simulates flow even under extreme conditions is an approximation that does not permit accurate solute or heat transfers 5 6 model validation with monitored groundwater levels because the water content and suction values were monitored for only 2 5 years other data were used to validate the model over long periods that included floods and drought for this purpose the groundwater levels recorded in senlis le sec 3 5 km away were used the hydraulic model was run with the daily rainfall data of bernaville for a 20 year period 1988 2008 the calculated series of daily aquifer recharge at the bottom of the model was then converted to groundwater levels using the tank model described in section 4 eq 15 for given values of parameters c sy and b the time variation in the aquifer level l t is obtained by solving eq 15 explicitly at a daily time step using a classic hydrological tank model thiéry 2015d parameters c sy and b were obtained by calibrating the hydrological tank model using the series of observations of groundwater levels fig 10 shows that an accurate simulation was obtained correlation coefficient 0 927 for periods of both low and high water years 1994 1995 2001 and 2002 in particular the groundwater levels during the 2001 historical flood were simulated correctly the 2008 period was however underestimated this simulation was obtained with the following parameters b 57 87 m sy 2 4 and c 6 43 months the specific yield which was equal to 2 4 corresponds to the difference between the saturated and de saturated conditions in the vicinity of the water table this value of specific yield is also consistent with the values obtained in the somme regional model amraoui et al 2002 the recession time constant c should be on the order of magnitude of the standard aquifer time constant tc rousseau gueutin et al 2013 18 t c 4 d 2 s y π 2 t where t l2 t 1 is aquifer average transmissivity and d l is average distance to rivers applying eq 18 with t 2 8 10 3 m2 s the local transmissivity in the hallue basin hamm et al 2008 sy 2 4 and tc c 6 43 months yields an average distance to the rivers of d 7 5 km which is a realistic order of magnitude in this basin the fact that the groundwater level time series can be reproduced using only the recharge evolution calculated with the discretized model gives more confidence to the modelling approach and to the hydraulic parameters at depths greater than 8 m that could not be determined directly it is however not a real validation as the hydrological tank model uses 3 calibrated parameters 6 summary and conclusions the data gathered at the warloy baillon site during the 2006 2008 period from the entire depth of the uz enabled the in situ determination of hydraulic parameters without our having to rely on literature data the infiltration test with a high infiltration rate was essential for defining the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions the data gathered confirmed the hypothesis of a sudden increase in hydraulic conductivities for suctions less than approximately 50 cm and the increase in porosity as the fractures begin to be conductive the corresponding hydraulic conductivity threshold is within a range of 2 8 mm d the infiltration test showed that the maximum saturated hydraulic conductivity integrating the fractures exceeds 300 mm d 3 5 10 6 m s the measured data were modelled using the marthe computer code employing a single domain approach with composite retention and hydraulic conductivity functions the model was run with very little calibration and correctly simulated the water content variations down to a depth of 8 m and also which to our knowledge is new the pressure head variations down to 23 m the pressure head values were simulated correctly but less accurately than the water content values due to a large hysteresis which was not accounted for the water content and pressure head values during the infiltration test period were also simulated accurately using a one hour time step which proves that the rapid flow dynamics were well modelled the model was controlled using the calculated recharge at the bottom of the model to simulate the monitored groundwater level over a period of 20 years 1988 2008 which is a new aspect this is not a real validation but it provides more confidence in the employed modelling approach and determined constitutive laws it also confirms the possibility of using with care the model at a local scale the analysis of the 1988 2008 simulation with the model integrating the 2001 historical flood was not described in the paper but nevertheless shows that the high saturation behaviour of the constitutive laws due to the fractures was used very rarely as the flows through the uz were most of the time less than 8 mm d which was the minimal value of the matrix hydraulic conductivity at saturation to verify the modelling possibilities of the selected scheme the temperature variations down to a depth of 8 m were modelled without extra model calibration the temperature was well simulated under natural conditions but not during the infiltration test this confirms that a single domain model that implicitly assumes an instantaneous equilibrium between matrix and fractures can accurately model water content and flow but not solute or heat transfers this is because in the real fractured medium the mass in solution or the heat is transferred very rapidly through the fracture network without having sufficient time either for any exchange with the matrix to occur or to reach equilibrium as the utilized model can also integrate an explicit network of drains or fractures in saturated and or unsaturated states modelling employing a non equilibrium dual domain scheme could be considered in a future project acknowledgements the

7581,within hydrological models flow approximations are commonly used to reduce computation time the validity of these approximations is strongly determined by flow height flow velocity and the spatial resolution of the model in this presentation the validity and performance of the kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow approximations are investigated for use in a catchment based flood model particularly the validity during flood events and for varying spatial resolutions is investigated the openlisem hydrological model is extended to implement both these flow approximations and channel flooding based on dynamic flow the flow approximations are used to recreate measured discharge in three catchments among which is the hydrograph of the 2003 flood event in the fella river basin furthermore spatial resolutions are varied for the flood simulation in order to investigate the influence of spatial resolution on these flow approximations results show that the kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow approximation provide least to highest accuracy respectively in recreating measured discharge kinematic flow which is commonly used in hydrological modelling substantially over estimates hydrological connectivity in the simulations with a spatial resolution of below 30 m since spatial resolutions of models have strongly increased over the past decades usage of routed kinematic flow should be reconsidered the combination of diffusive or dynamic overland flow and dynamic channel flooding provides high accuracy in recreating the 2003 fella river flood event finally in the case of flood events spatial modelling of kinematic flow substantially over estimates hydrological connectivity and flow concentration since pressure forces are removed leading to significant errors keywords spatial numerical modeling physically based modeling flash floods catchment hydrology hydraulics openlisem 1 introduction both due to climate change and population growth global risk for fluvial floods has been found to increase kron et al 1999 ipcc 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 different processes can lead to flooding in an area and based on the perception of the dominant process different types of floods are recognized in disaster risk management flash floods are characterized by both the spatial and temporal scales in which they take place they often take place in or close to upstream runoff generating areas and are characterized by rapid release of water from a catchment this type of flood event often takes place within a few hours of the rainfall event and often lasting less than a day the dynamics of a flash flood are closely related to the dynamics of the rainfall event the dynamics of floods that are generated by an overflowing river channel vary according to the spatial and temporal scales of the catchment when the dynamics of the flood depend less on the rainfall characteristics and more on the characteristics of the contributing river system the incoming wave we tend to term these slower and long lasting floods as fluvial floods other mechanisms of flooding are a rise of groundwater above the surface and poor drainage in flat areas with excessive rainfall while physically similar it makes sense to recognize and define different flood types from a disaster risk reduction perspective as people have developed a sense of the associated problems the timing needed for early warning and a certain impact with these different flood types in this analysis we focus on flash flood events which cause substantial damage in various regions around the world re 2005 schiermeier 2006 thus research into understanding of the hydrological processes that precede flash flood events and analyzing best ways of simulating flow dynamics is of key importance spatial numerical modelling is commonly used to investigate both flash floods and the preceding hydrological processes within numerical models flow approximations are widely used to provide appropriate and efficient simulation of water flow te chow 1964 tsai 2003 water flow on the surface can be simulated by solving a mass and momentum balance using gravity pressure differences and momentum under different environmental conditions pressure differences and or inertial momentum are not included in numerical solutions for flow in practice two types of model systems are used for flood modeling a decoupled systems in which the source areas are separated from the flooded areas and b integrated catchment models the decoupled model systems have essentially two models one that generates an incoming discharge wave and one that simulates the flood process from this incoming discharge the advantage is that both model systems can be separate with different principles scales and resolutions upstream models divide space in regular gridcells or polygons representing landscape elements and even entire subcatchments that generate runoff which is collected in a stream network to create a discharge wave downstream flood models can adopt a gridcell size optimal for flood modelling the disadvantage is the assumption that there are a few clearly defined inflow points which is not always the case examples of this type of models are hec hms scharffenberg fleming 2006 hec ras brunner 1995 tuflow bmt wbm 2010 and mike she prucha et al 2016 the second type of models are integrated catchment models that simulate the complete hydrology and flow generating runoff leading to discharge and then to flooding the advantages are that there are no entry points but instead open boundaries where runoff can lead directly to flooding the disadvantages are that there is generally one spatial resolution for the entire domain and computationally these models can be less efficient while integrated catchment models require more computation depending on the event they can be required for accurate simulations in many situations flash floods cannot be simulated with a decoupled model system often a flash flood is not strictly related to an overflowing channel as they occur in accentuated terrain sloping areas are prone to overland flow that adds directly to the flood water especially in hilly urban areas where impermeable surfaces dominate flash floods are often a combination of an overflowing channel overland flow and even direct rainfall also rapid changes in water height and fluxes may occur over short distances which need robust numerical solutions to cope with examples of integrated catchment models are flo 2d o brien 2007 and trex velleux england julien 2008 both these models however use simplified equations to describe flow behavior recent approaches to integrated flood simulations in a catchment model use hybrid modelling bellos and tsakiris 2016 combined the flo r2d model tsakiris bellos 2014 and unit hydrograph theory nguyen et al 2015 developed the hiresflood uci model which uses the output from a lumped rainfall runoff model for their flood simulation however both methods use clumped runoff and have limited interactions between flood water and other hydrological processes such as rainfall and infiltration while both these approaches thus provide improvement over traditional methods a fully integrated approach to simulate floods in a catchment model could improve understanding of the processes that lead to floods in the majority of models that include hydrology and flow routing three ways of routing are used to simulate surface and channel flow the kinematic flow approximation which simplifies water flow by neglecting pressure and inertial momentum gained popularity in the early years of numerical modelling for its computationally efficient and robust estimations of flow patterns kinematic wave solutions use a predefined converging flow network that connects the spatial elements e g through the steepest slope and the channel system this means that there is always connectivity between the spatial elements the flow does not have to fill up small storages before it can continue the only way to influence the timing of the flow is by the surface friction parameters models such as swat arnold et al 1998 and trex velleux england julien 2008 use clumped and spatially routed kinematic flow respectively the diffusive flow approximation implements pressure in the momentum equations using this method models such as lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 approximate flood behavior for detailed spatial modelling of flood behavior the saint venant equations dynamic wave for shallow flow are commonly used this approximation which requires more computation is used by models such as cche2d ch3d wu 2001 hec ras brunner 1995 tuflow syme 2001 3di dahm et al 2014 and delft 2d deltares hydraulics 1999 both the diffusive wave and dynamic wave use the dem directly and water pressure differences between spatial elements and momentum allow the flow to converge and diverge connectivity is not pre defined local storages can exist and need to fill before the flow continues while the implementation of flow approximations improves efficiency both the spatial and temporal scale of the simulation determine the validity of the approximation the validity then limits the possible application of models to the temporal and spatial scales of flash floods tsai 2003 in practice this is largely ignored the availability of high resolution data has increased strongly in the past decades with for instance lidar derived digital terrain models the general tendency in thinking is that a higher resolution offers greater accuracy but it ignores the validity of flow approximations furthermore during flash flood events high water heights flow velocities and small spatial resolutions influence the validity of kinematic and diffusive flow further therefore a detailed investigation into the influence of flow approximations on flash flood modelling is required the objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of spatial resolution on the validity of the kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow approximations for use in integrated flood modelling this investigation is separated into two parts first the behavior of these flow approximations for spatial runoff modelling is investigated for several spatial resolutions secondly the flow approximations are coupled with channel flooding and the influence of flow approximations on the flood simulation is investigated study catchments from china hessel and van asch 2003 and spain baartman et al 2013 are used with a spatial resolution of 10 and 20 m to investigate runoff behavior for flooding calibration is performed on 20 40 and 80 m spatial resolution from the italian alps borga et al 2007 calibration is performed on discharge data for those catchments the open source limburg soil erosion model openlisem jetten 2002 starkloff and stolte 2014 hu et al 2015 is to perform the simulations kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow are implemented for overland and channel flow dynamics in order to simulate flooding in a catchment environment dynamic wave channel flooding is included in all three combinations for each combination flow types are fully linked with both each other and other hydrological processes explained below 2 theory for the simulation of overland and channel flow three commonly used approximations for water flow have been implemented kinematic flow diffusive flow and saint venant flow for the simulation of channel flooding saint venant flow is used in this section the derivation and required assumptions for these flow approximations are described in order to describe continuity of any substance with advection the mass balance equation is the basis eq 1 1 h t hu x x hu y y r i where h is the flow height m u is the flow velocity m s 1 r is the rainfall m and i is the infiltration m this equation is valid for all the implemented flow approximations and forms the basis for the numerical methods in the rest of this section equations that describe conservation of momentum for the flow approximations are stated 2 1 dynamic flow the momentum balance equations for water flow approximations are typically derived from the navier stokes equations for incompressible flow when this set of equations is depth averaged and internal friction forces are neglected the saint venant equations result

inertial terms are assumed very small when compared to other acceleration terms when the inertial terms are neglected velocity is determined predominantly by hydraulic gradient friction forces and the

used to further the development of openlisem which is open source and freely available the integration of flooding into the model allows the detailed investigation into the processes that lead to the flood event the openlisem model implements multiple types of infiltration models such as smith parlange 1978 and the swatre full vertical soil water balance model bastiaanssen et al 1996 the simulations in this paper use the green ampt infiltration model which assumes a wetting front moving down into the soil due to infiltrating rainfall green ampt 1911 the resulting potential infiltration is subtracted from the available surface water eq 11 11 f pot k s ψ θ s θ i f 1 where fpot is the potential infiltration rate m s 1 f is the cumulative infiltrated water m θs is the porosity m 3 m 3 θi is the initial soil moisture content m 3 m 3 ψ is the matric pressure at the wetting front h ψ z m and ks is the saturated conductivity m s 1 input data consists of soil land surface and terrain properties and can be defined on a sub cell basis by using fraction maps as input fig 1 the infiltration of water and routing of overland flow are fully coupled and thus computed for each numerical timestep further details on the underlying physical principles of openlisem can be found in baartman et al 2012a and jetten 2002 and de roo et al 1996 2 5 numerical implementations the numerical implementations of flow equations can if not appropriate influence behavior and validity a numerical method should be appropriate to the assumptions of the equations and provide a stable accurate and realistic simulation therefore separate numerical methods were implemented for the flow approximations the numerical methods that were implemented during the development stages of openlisem are presented in this section 2 6 saint venant flow cell boundary fluxes the implemented solution for saint venant flow is based on the fullswof2d library delestre et al 2014 this library uses a monotonic upstream cell centered muscl scheme to provide a second order spatial accurate solution this method uses a linear approximates of the flow parameters on the cell boundaries in order to calculate the flux at these boundaries fig 2 the estimation of cell interface fluxes furthermore corrects for elevation differences based on a hydrostatic reconstruction audusse et al 2004 this results in a solution that is both total variation diminishing and preserves a steady state at rest using the harten lax van leer riemann solver shock wave behavior is captured harten et al 1983 finally new water heights are calculated using the hydrostatic reconstruction in order to gain second order accuracy in time heun s predictor corrector method is used which is a 2 step runga kutta solver 2 7 diffusive flow bilinear interpolation if inertial acceleration terms are ignored behavior will become unnatural surrounding local depressions in elevation while tayfur and kavas 1994 use a cell boundary based method to solve diffusive and kinematic flow liu et al 2004 note that irregularities in the digital elevation model dem cause difficulties for such a method thus we implement a distinct advection scheme in order to solve diffusive flow for any cell the location of the water volume is updated by the velocity fig 3 the water volume is then distributed to the cells that surround the new location courant et al 1952 2 8 kinematic flow flow network a numerical solution for kinematic flow must be coherent with the assumptions that lead to the kinematic flow approximations pressure forces are ignored and flow directions are completely determined by terrain slope because of this converging slopes will cause unnatural oscillating behavior to avoid this unnatural behavior kinematic flow is implemented using a pre defined flow direction network fig 4 this network must ignore any local depressions to ensure validity of kinematic flow furthermore the flow direction network allows for a one dimensional implementation of kinematic flow along the network strongly increasing computational speed creation of this network is done using the open source freeware raster gis pcraster karssenberg et al 2010 2 9 connecting one and two dimensional flow channel flow can be simulated in one dimension using the same equations as for overland flow within the model the channel is assumed to be rectangular with limited flow depth to calculate the inflow from the land surface into the channel it is assumed that the direction of overland flow in cells containing channels is perpendicular to the channel direction the channel is furthermore assumed to be located in the middle of the cell this way using the channel width and flow velocity the fraction of runoff water that flows into the channel can be calculated eq 12 12 f qch dtu 0 5 c xy b c where bc is the channel width at the surface m similar methods have been shown to provide accurate estimations of channel inflow bradbrook et al 2004 yin et al 2013 channel overflow immediately adds to flooding if the channel has extra capacity available flooding water is likewise immediately transported into the channel fig 5 2 10 connecting overland flow and flooding besides channel water overland flow enters and thus adds to the flood volume when overland flow and channel flooding are not approximating using the same method their interactions cannot be solved based on normal saint venant flow in reality overland flow water must be added to the flood depth and an exchange of momentum takes place for the kinematic and diffusive wave momentum conservation neglects important terms that are present in the flood water therefore the process of overland flow mixing with flood water is approximated using an empirical relationship eq 13 13 f rf min 1 0 1 e c r h f h r where frf is the fraction of runoff water transferred to the flood water cr is a coefficient hf the flood depth m and hr is the overland flow depth m here the hf and hr are at each moment taken from the local flow properties the coefficient cr is purely based on modelling experience generally taken to be 2 0 since flood artifacts disappear at this value using this approximation overland flow water is gradually transferred to the flood water while it does not unnaturally affect flood momentum 3 materials and methods three study sites are used to investigate the validity of the implemented flow approximations an overview of the topography saturated conductivity and manning s n for these catchments are shown in figs 6 8 the first of these is the danangou catchment a rural area in the loess plateau in china where soil erosion is a major problem due to agriculture on steep slopes and the erodibility of loess soil hessel and van asch 2003 this area was previously used by hessel et al 2003a see also hessel et al 2003b hessel van asch 2003 hessel jetten 2007 to calibrate and validate a previous version of the lisem model this 257 ha region is characterized by steep slopes 20 large eroded gullies land use consists predominantly of woods wild grasslands and parts of cropland in the upper regions for this catchment three precipitation events from 20 07 1999 23 08 1998 and 01 08 1998 will be used the events were recorded by three rainfall gauges in the area and rainfall maps based on the nearest station are therefore used as input the rainfall events are typically characterized by shorts burst of intense precipitation with durations around 30 min intensities up to 100 mm h and high spatial variability during such events hydraulic conductivity is a limiting factor in the amount of infiltration together with measured rainfall intensity discharge after these events is available for every two minutes more details on the events and area are available in hessel et al 2003a the spatial resolution of this dataset is 10 m the channel network in the area consists of small not channelized streams and gullies that converge near the main outlet for validation and calibration discharge data is available at a 2 min interval discharge values have been estimated using water height timeseries at a weir and a stage discharge curve a second catchment in prado south eastern spain will be used this 50 km2 semi arid region experiences between 250 mm and 530 mm of rainfall each year the area has previously been used with lisem by baartman et al 2013 baartman et al 2012a baartman et al 2012b land cover consists mainly of natural shrubs forests and dryland farming such as cereals soil information was obtained by baartman et al 2013 using in situ measurements of all parameters required for openlisem the soil types are primarily calcic cambisols and calcaric fluvisols rainfall data is available for three rainfall events on 29 09 1997 top 09 12 2003 middle and 17 10 2003 bottom baartman et al 2012a the events have a total rainfall of 19 7 26 9 and 49 mm respectively and a duration of around 2 h the channel network in the area consists of small not channelized streams and gullies that converge near the main outlet discharge data has been gathered at the outlet of the described catchment at a 5 min interval discharge values have been estimated using water height timeseries at a weir and a stage discharge curve the spatial resolution of this dataset is 20 m the third catchment is a 164 5 km2 region along the northern italian alps that has been investigated by chen et al 2014 land use in the region consists mainly of multiple types of forest and heathland in the upslope areas and small build up regions in the lower rainfall data is available for an intense precipitation event on the 29th of august 2003 which took place after several weeks of droughts and had a return period between 200 and 500 years norbiato et al 2007 peak rainfall intensity reached 81 mm h during an hour at pontebba located at the outlet of the selected catchment here total precipitation for the event of 389 mm for a detailed description of the precipitation event on the 29th of august 2003 and the methodology in estimating the rainfall intensities see borga et al 2007 multiple upslope branches of tributaries of the fella river experienced flash flooding at small drainage areas borga et al 2007 nikolopoulos et al 2013 besides flooding the area experienced severe geomorphic impacts during the event which might have influenced the flow dynamics marchi et al 2009 the river network in the area consists of many non channelized steep side branches leading to the fella river the main river branch has a wide base 25 m and features culverts near the local highway the outlet discharge data for this event is based on a stage discharge relationship and is available for every half hour the location of this outlet is the fella river at pontebba borga et al 2007 during a post event survey peak discharge estimates were determined for one additional location in the catchment uqua at ugovizza borga et al 2007 the dataset for this catchment was made as part of the increo project increasing resilience through earth observation increo an elevation model and land use map were made available from the project the alpine area features steep slopes and the majority of the area is covered by coniferous forest soil information was collected from the isric database wageningen hengl et al 2017 and literature data from saxton and rawls 2006 the majority of the area has loam like soil characteristics the vegetation index was derived from spot 4 satellite images the available spatial resolutions are 20 40 and 80 m 3 1 simulated scenarios to investigate the performance of the described flow approximations several are used to simulate identical scenarios on the danangou and prado catchments the used flow approximations are kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow for overland flow and respectively kinematic kinematic and dynamic flow for channel flow based on the best calibrated simulation performance of the flow approximation will be analyzed furthermore spatial patterns in flow height are used to see how the flow approximations and processes such as infiltration influence each other to investigate the performance of the flow approximations in flash flood modelling the fella basin is simulated using all combinations of flow approximations this includes kinematic diffusive and dynamic overland flow these types of overland are combined with respectively kinematic kinematic and dynamic flow for the channels finally these flow approximations are combined with dynamic channel flooding leading to a total of 5 combinations of flow approximations to investigate the influence of spatial resolution on the performance of these flash flood simulations spatial flood depth is analyzed for the distinct flow approximations and spatial resolutions 3 2 openlisem input data the input data of openlisem can be separated into three categories firstly a catchment description has to be provided in the form of spatial rasters the provided catchment data was already available in the correct raster format preparation of the dataset was performed using the pcraster open source gis package karssenberg et al 2010 for both the danangou and prado catchment maps of soil and land cover parameters were available in the case of the fella river basin the original dataset has a spatial resolution 20 ms using pcraster this dataset was resampled to 40 and 80 m resolution on the resampled elevation models a simple pit filling algorithm was used to restore flow pathways secondly boundary conditions have to be provided to complete the description of the event time series of catchment averaged rainfall intensity were available as text tables for the prado and fella catchments these were used as input in openlisem from these tables spatially homogeneous rainfall over the catchment area was assumed a list of four rainfall stations combined with station locations were available for the danangou catchment based on these rainfall stations spatial maps of rainfall intensity were made that assigned every cell the rainfall intensity of the closest rainfall station these were then used as input for openlisem to provide spatial rainfall during the simulation outflow boundary conditions were set to allow outflow at any point no inflow besides rainfall was specified for the simulations finally the openlisem simulation parameters are required a table of these parameters for the described datasets is shown in table 1 3 3 calibration for all the described study sites the simulations are calibrated to discharge data discharge data was available with a 10 min resolution for the prado catchment a 30 min resolution for the fella catchment and a 15 min resolution for the danangou catchment while several measurements were removed for several reasons the available data provided enough certainty in the calibration process to calibrate the simulations the saturated conductivity manning s coefficient and initial soil moisture content is varied these parameters have been found to have the highest influence on simulation behavior hessel and jetten 2007 the values for these parameters are kept between 50 and 200 of their original values in order to maintain a physically meaningful simulation the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is used as the measure of performance eq 14 where 1 indicates perfect correlation and increasing negative value a decreasing correlation 14 e 1 q o t q m t 2 q o t q o 2 where e is the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient q o t is the observed discharge at time t m 3 s 1 q m t is the modelled discharge at time t m 3 s 1 and q o is the average observed discharge m 3 s 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 danangou and prado catchments both measured and simulated discharge for the danangou and prado catchment are shown in figs 9 and 10 calibrated simulations for the kinematic diffusive and saint venant flow approximations are provided calibration parameters had to be altered from the original values used by hessel and jetten 2007 due to the usage of different model efficiency functions the values of the nash sutcliffe correlation coefficients and average calibration parameters for each are provided in tables 2 and 3 4 2 connectivity of overland flow the simulation results for the danangou catchment show significant differences in performance for the various flow approximations the time of peak discharge is simulated with substantially higher accuracy by diffusive and saint venant flow both the timing and general shape of the simulated hydrographs lead to substantially higher correlation coefficients for the diffusive and saint venant flow when compared to kinematic flow hessel and van asch 2003 concluded that for this catchment the timing of the discharge peak was especially difficult to predict the authors mentioned that inaccuracy of the digital elevation could have led to steeper slopes this would have increased average overland flow velocity however comparison with dynamic and diffusive wave simulations showed that flow velocities have been increased by the inherent properties of the kinematic flow approximation where diffusive and saint venant flow spread due to pressure forces kinematic flow concentrates to the width of a single cell when the spatial resolution is high this leads to unrealistically high water heights because of this increase in flow height flow velocity increases this effect is furthermore strengthened by the fact that the routing network ignores local depressions in fig 12 maximum flow depth for the july rainfall event are shown while kinematic flow forces a direct path through any rough terrain diffusive and dynamic flow are partly blocked and re routed both of these effects increase the average flow velocity of kinematic flow and cause the approximation to over estimate connectivity in the catchment the results of this over estimation can be seen in the form of the early peak discharge time for the kinematic flow simulations therefore the kinematic flow approximation instead of the digital elevation model was the dominant reason for the inaccuracy the influence of flow approximations on average flow velocities is furthermore visible in the final calibration parameters where manning s n the frictional coefficient is significantly lower for kinematic flow this indicates that during calibration the flow had to be artificially slowed down to gain accuracy the simulation results for the prado catchment show significant differences in performance for the distinct flow approximations all three flow approximations provided satisfactory results in calibration for the three rainfall events dynamic overland flow performed best in recreating the shape of measured hydrographs both diffusive and dynamic flow showed an increase in accuracy when compared to the kinematic flow approximation fig 13 shows the simulated spatial patterns of overland flow for the july rainfall event in the prado catchment a predominant difference in these patterns is the concentration of flow compared to the dynamic flow which performed best in calibration kinematic and diffusive flow respectively over estimate and under estimate flow concentration this is evident from the mathematical and numerical descriptions of their behavior kinematic flow forces flow through the width of a single cell artificially concentrating flow diffusive flow adds pressure terms which act as a diffusive force and neglects other forces causing an overestimation of flow diffusion a second difference between the flow approximations is caused by differences in infiltration on locations where flow concentrates infiltration is limited by the infiltration capacity and the active surface for infiltration flow concentration strongly influences the available surface area for infiltration in the north of the prado catchment runoff is generated that flows south through an area of high infiltration kinematic flow concentrates and limits the active surface area of infiltration thus flowing through areas with high infiltration capacity quicker the diffusive and dynamic flow are predominantly infiltrated due to their more diffusive flow within the final calibration parameters the same effect is visible due to the larger amount of infiltration with diffusive flow the calibration lead to lower values for the saturated conductivity which increases final discharge based on the results of both the danangou and prado catchment kinematic flow is highly accurate and efficient in the correct setting when flow heights relative to spatial resolution is low velocity and flow diffusion are correctly estimated mathematical analysis for the use of flow approximations such as those by vieira 1983 can be used to support the use of flow approximation a crucial difference in behavior is however caused by spatial modelling in the case of spatial flow modelling concentration of flow can quickly change flow properties due to several effects hydrological connectivity can be substantially over estimated by kinematic flow furthermore because the routing scheme for kinematic flow is bound by cell size errors increase with increasing spatial resolution therefore in the case of spatial modelling the ratio of catchment size versus cell size plays an important role in the applicability of the kinematic flow approximation 4 3 validation with flooding simulated and measured discharge for the 2003 fella basin flood event are shown in fig 11 simulations using kinematic diffusive and saint venant approximations both with and without saint venant based channel flooding have been calibrated and are provided the nash sutcliffe correlation coefficient for the discharge simulations of the fella basin flood event are provided in table 4 4 4 flood behavior in the case of the 2003 flood event in the fella river basin the gradual decline in measured discharge after the event confirms the reports of flooding the decrease in flow height and slope outside of the channel causes a gradual return of flood water into the channel flood depth maps for the coupled kinematic diffusive and saint venant simulations with channel flooding are provided in fig 14 for three representative locations flood depth time series for the same simulations are shown in fig 15 the difficulty in recreating the hydrograph differed for the distinct flow approximations without channel flooding kinematic and diffusive flow were not able to provide an accurate recreation of the measured hydrograph the kinematic flow approximation completely neglects the flooding behavior the diffusive flow approximation strongly underestimates flow velocities at the incline of the hydrograph this leads to a late increase in discharge the cause of the underestimated velocities can be found in the over estimation of the spread of the water flow this is due to the presence of pressure term but lack of inertia related acceleration the inertia related acceleration terms would increase flow concentration in sharp incised channels when the kinematic flow approximation is combined with saint venant based channel flooding accuracy increases substantially however channel flooding only slightly increases accuracy in the tail of the hydrograph the combination of diffusive flow with saint venant channel flooding and a full saint venant approximation show accurate recreation of the 2003 fella basin flood hydrograph the main reason for this is shown in fig 7 the flooding during the simulation with kinematic flow is mainly present near the main channel when this flood water re enters the channel it can quickly leave the area for the diffusive and saint venant flow flooding takes place substantially more in the upstream areas because of this water takes a longer time to reach the outlet once it re enters the channel thus while addition of channel based flooding improved calibration accuracy for kinematic flow this method has limited predictive power when compared to diffusive and dynamic overland flow for these flow approximations flooding behavior can take place at any location allowing a greater degree of accuracy in the simulations while dynamic and diffusive flow outperform kinematic flow when using a spatial resolution of 20 m difficulties arise in the case of 40 and 80 m for both 40 and 80 m resolution the coarser resolution creates local depressions in the digital elevation model the routing network that is used for kinematic flow neglects these local depressions while diffusive and saint venant flow first fill these leading to spurious flooded cells correction to the elevation model could be made to increase connectivity for diffusive and dynamic flow however such corrections are a difficult process and can substantially alter slopes on a complex topography another disadvantage of diffusive and dynamic flow on coarse resolutions is that flow spread is generally over estimated when pressure terms are included when spatial resolution is coarse flow spread should not be wider than a single cell however due to pressure terms diffusive and dynamic flow generally use two or more cells however despite the inaccurate flooding of local depressions both flooding extent and flooding depth are substantially more consistent with the results of the 20 m simulation in the case of diffusive or dynamic flow for kinematic flow it is visible that a decrease in spatial resolution causes the flooding to take place increasingly upstream this can be explained by the strong over estimation of connectivity in the fella basin because of terrain with high spatial variability flow velocities are lower when details are included on coarser resolution kinematic flow ignores an increasing amount of details in the topography increasing the over estimation of connectivity and flow velocity this would cause the runoff to arrive at the channel earlier causing flooding in increasingly upstream areas summarizing in the performed simulations due to the strong over estimation of connectivity on both higher and lower spatial resolutions the usage of a kinematic flow approximation could not accurately recreate flow behavior thus both the calibration performance and the consistency of flood extent and volume for varying spatial resolution are substantially higher in the case of diffusive and dynamic flow the influence of spatial resolution on flood connectivity has been described earlier by haile rientjes 2005 in their case re sampling of flood plain elevation influenced the hydraulic connectivity and thus the simulated flood extent they conclude that especially in terrain with high spatial variability important details in elevation are lost in coarser resolutions when simulating flooding within a catchment model that includes rough upstream topography the effect of spatial resolution on flow connectivity should therefore be of even higher importance the manner in which flow approximations are influenced by the topography has been recognized previously kazezyılmaz alhan and medina 2007 in their simulations steeper slopes 0 11 degrees show higher accuracy in using kinematic and diffusive wave approximations in a one dimensional setting in our two dimensional simulations similar effect are visible steep slopes tend to provide larger gravitational acceleration therefore inertial and primarily pressure forces which are ignored by the kinematic flow approximation lose relative magnitude when compared to the gravitational forces the slope values for the described catchments are shown in fig 16 particularly the danandau catchment which features steep slopes and while the catchment edges in the fella basin feature very steep slopes 40 degrees the central river area is very flat leading to inaccurate behavior of kinematic flow finally the prado catchment features mostly gentle slopes 5 degrees as expected performance differences between flow approximations are less noticeable when compared to the other catchments a final consideration in the performance of the flow approximations in flash flood modelling is mass conservation typically numerical flow computations loss or gain water outside of the normal water balance when computational errors are made an overview of the water balance errors in the fella flash flood simulations are shown in table 5 within the implementation of the kinematic and diffusive flow numerical errors are strictly limited to machine precision rounding errors since the flow advection is implemented in a strictly mass conserving manner for dynamic flow this is not the case and mass balance errors increase during the simulations the total amount of water lost in the full dynamic flow simulation is 8 7e 2 due to the insignificant amounts of water lost during the simulation there is no relationship with the quality of the simulation 4 5 sensitivity analysis results from a sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 17 calibrated parameters for the fella flash flood simulations are shown in table 6 the result of the sensitivity analysis show several variables to which the flow methods is highly sensitive both saturated conductivity and manning s coefficient have a strong influence on the output of the model the influence of model resolution on the simulation is relatively low when compared to the saturated conductivity and the manning s coefficient especially average flood depth and flood velocity are substantially affected by the input parameters the distinct flow approximations have substantial differences in sensitivity the kinematic flow approach has the highest sensitivity to resolution changes this is caused by the usage of the local drainage network this causes flow to move through the width of a single cell when cell sizes are changes this significantly influences flow height and thus velocity for the other methods the sensitivity of flood properties is comparable to similar detailed flood models haile rientjes 2005 horritt and bates 2001 generally the kinematic flow approximation shows the lowest sensitivity to the manning s coefficient and the saturated conductivity in these cases however it is important to note that a lower sensitivity does not necessarily mean higher accuracy in the case of kinematic flow infiltration for example is not limited by the hydraulic conductivity but rather by the flow width this decreases sensitivity to a change in hydraulic conductivity the diffusive flow approximation shows an especially high sensitivity for maximum flood depth and maximum flood velocity finally the saint venant flow shows an average sensitivity for all investigated variables 5 conclusions based on the simulation results diffusive and dynamic flow overland flow provide a substantial increase in calibration performance when compared to kinematic flow in both the danangou and prado catchment kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow performed respectively least to most accurate in calibration to measured hydrographs for these catchments with a spatial resolution of 10 and 20 m kinematic flow performed substantially less in both catchments the kinematic flow approximation over estimated connectivity within the catchment both due to flow concentration the use of a routing network and decreased infiltration hydrological connectivity is in some cases highly over estimated when kinematic flow is used therefore the assumptions that lead to kinematic flow have a high influence on hydrological connectivity for simulations of flood events kinematic flow similarly provides the least accuracy the implementation of saint venant based channel flooding strongly increased calibration performance the transition to diffusive and saint venant equations for overland flow further increased accuracy and realism the best results were obtained with a combination of diffusive overland flow and dynamic flow for channel flooding both this combination and full dynamic flow were able to recreate the hydrograph of the 2003 fella basin flood event the primary cause of this was that for diffusive and dynamic flow flood behavior is not limited by the presence of a channel for kinematic flow flooding is initiated along the channels limiting the predictive nature of the model spatial resolution of the dataset has a significant impact on the performance of the flow approximations in the case of coarser resolutions 40 m or higher local depressions were ignored by kinematic flow this improved the relative accuracy of this method in the case of higher spatial resolutions pressure forces within water flow become important as a result of the substantial over estimations of connectivity and flow velocity on both lower and higher spatial resolutions the usage of kinematic flow could not accurately recreate flow behavior in the simulated flood event the performed simulations show that validity of the approximation is highly dependent on the type of event and the spatial resolution with the increasing availability of detailed elevation data and increasing computational power simulations with high spatial resolutions become more common for higher spatial resolutions the usage of kinematic flow can have a significant impact on the model usage of this flow approximation should then be based on a thorough investigation the extent in which a kinematic diffusive or dynamic wave can be used in flow simulations at different spatial resolutions depends on the type of area and particularly the slopes and spatial variability of the topography in the case of flood simulations the implementation of channel based flooding with dynamic flow is required for catchment based simulations of flooding ignoring pressure terms by assuming infinite channels results in unrealistic flow heights and velocities for the same reason kinematic flow was for the fella river simulations not an appropriate method for simulating overland flow the usage of a flow network artificially increases flow concentration and ignores pressure terms which are crucial in describing the behavior of flood water similarly in applications related to spatial hazard susceptibility usage of routing networks and kinematic flow should generally only be considered as a viable alternative when the investigations shows the topography slopes and spatial resolution do not lead to inaccurate behavior of the flow approximation acknowledgements we want to gracefully acknowledge the help of researchers that kindly allowed for the use of their datasets for this research

7581,within hydrological models flow approximations are commonly used to reduce computation time the validity of these approximations is strongly determined by flow height flow velocity and the spatial resolution of the model in this presentation the validity and performance of the kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow approximations are investigated for use in a catchment based flood model particularly the validity during flood events and for varying spatial resolutions is investigated the openlisem hydrological model is extended to implement both these flow approximations and channel flooding based on dynamic flow the flow approximations are used to recreate measured discharge in three catchments among which is the hydrograph of the 2003 flood event in the fella river basin furthermore spatial resolutions are varied for the flood simulation in order to investigate the influence of spatial resolution on these flow approximations results show that the kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow approximation provide least to highest accuracy respectively in recreating measured discharge kinematic flow which is commonly used in hydrological modelling substantially over estimates hydrological connectivity in the simulations with a spatial resolution of below 30 m since spatial resolutions of models have strongly increased over the past decades usage of routed kinematic flow should be reconsidered the combination of diffusive or dynamic overland flow and dynamic channel flooding provides high accuracy in recreating the 2003 fella river flood event finally in the case of flood events spatial modelling of kinematic flow substantially over estimates hydrological connectivity and flow concentration since pressure forces are removed leading to significant errors keywords spatial numerical modeling physically based modeling flash floods catchment hydrology hydraulics openlisem 1 introduction both due to climate change and population growth global risk for fluvial floods has been found to increase kron et al 1999 ipcc 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 different processes can lead to flooding in an area and based on the perception of the dominant process different types of floods are recognized in disaster risk management flash floods are characterized by both the spatial and temporal scales in which they take place they often take place in or close to upstream runoff generating areas and are characterized by rapid release of water from a catchment this type of flood event often takes place within a few hours of the rainfall event and often lasting less than a day the dynamics of a flash flood are closely related to the dynamics of the rainfall event the dynamics of floods that are generated by an overflowing river channel vary according to the spatial and temporal scales of the catchment when the dynamics of the flood depend less on the rainfall characteristics and more on the characteristics of the contributing river system the incoming wave we tend to term these slower and long lasting floods as fluvial floods other mechanisms of flooding are a rise of groundwater above the surface and poor drainage in flat areas with excessive rainfall while physically similar it makes sense to recognize and define different flood types from a disaster risk reduction perspective as people have developed a sense of the associated problems the timing needed for early warning and a certain impact with these different flood types in this analysis we focus on flash flood events which cause substantial damage in various regions around the world re 2005 schiermeier 2006 thus research into understanding of the hydrological processes that precede flash flood events and analyzing best ways of simulating flow dynamics is of key importance spatial numerical modelling is commonly used to investigate both flash floods and the preceding hydrological processes within numerical models flow approximations are widely used to provide appropriate and efficient simulation of water flow te chow 1964 tsai 2003 water flow on the surface can be simulated by solving a mass and momentum balance using gravity pressure differences and momentum under different environmental conditions pressure differences and or inertial momentum are not included in numerical solutions for flow in practice two types of model systems are used for flood modeling a decoupled systems in which the source areas are separated from the flooded areas and b integrated catchment models the decoupled model systems have essentially two models one that generates an incoming discharge wave and one that simulates the flood process from this incoming discharge the advantage is that both model systems can be separate with different principles scales and resolutions upstream models divide space in regular gridcells or polygons representing landscape elements and even entire subcatchments that generate runoff which is collected in a stream network to create a discharge wave downstream flood models can adopt a gridcell size optimal for flood modelling the disadvantage is the assumption that there are a few clearly defined inflow points which is not always the case examples of this type of models are hec hms scharffenberg fleming 2006 hec ras brunner 1995 tuflow bmt wbm 2010 and mike she prucha et al 2016 the second type of models are integrated catchment models that simulate the complete hydrology and flow generating runoff leading to discharge and then to flooding the advantages are that there are no entry points but instead open boundaries where runoff can lead directly to flooding the disadvantages are that there is generally one spatial resolution for the entire domain and computationally these models can be less efficient while integrated catchment models require more computation depending on the event they can be required for accurate simulations in many situations flash floods cannot be simulated with a decoupled model system often a flash flood is not strictly related to an overflowing channel as they occur in accentuated terrain sloping areas are prone to overland flow that adds directly to the flood water especially in hilly urban areas where impermeable surfaces dominate flash floods are often a combination of an overflowing channel overland flow and even direct rainfall also rapid changes in water height and fluxes may occur over short distances which need robust numerical solutions to cope with examples of integrated catchment models are flo 2d o brien 2007 and trex velleux england julien 2008 both these models however use simplified equations to describe flow behavior recent approaches to integrated flood simulations in a catchment model use hybrid modelling bellos and tsakiris 2016 combined the flo r2d model tsakiris bellos 2014 and unit hydrograph theory nguyen et al 2015 developed the hiresflood uci model which uses the output from a lumped rainfall runoff model for their flood simulation however both methods use clumped runoff and have limited interactions between flood water and other hydrological processes such as rainfall and infiltration while both these approaches thus provide improvement over traditional methods a fully integrated approach to simulate floods in a catchment model could improve understanding of the processes that lead to floods in the majority of models that include hydrology and flow routing three ways of routing are used to simulate surface and channel flow the kinematic flow approximation which simplifies water flow by neglecting pressure and inertial momentum gained popularity in the early years of numerical modelling for its computationally efficient and robust estimations of flow patterns kinematic wave solutions use a predefined converging flow network that connects the spatial elements e g through the steepest slope and the channel system this means that there is always connectivity between the spatial elements the flow does not have to fill up small storages before it can continue the only way to influence the timing of the flow is by the surface friction parameters models such as swat arnold et al 1998 and trex velleux england julien 2008 use clumped and spatially routed kinematic flow respectively the diffusive flow approximation implements pressure in the momentum equations using this method models such as lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 approximate flood behavior for detailed spatial modelling of flood behavior the saint venant equations dynamic wave for shallow flow are commonly used this approximation which requires more computation is used by models such as cche2d ch3d wu 2001 hec ras brunner 1995 tuflow syme 2001 3di dahm et al 2014 and delft 2d deltares hydraulics 1999 both the diffusive wave and dynamic wave use the dem directly and water pressure differences between spatial elements and momentum allow the flow to converge and diverge connectivity is not pre defined local storages can exist and need to fill before the flow continues while the implementation of flow approximations improves efficiency both the spatial and temporal scale of the simulation determine the validity of the approximation the validity then limits the possible application of models to the temporal and spatial scales of flash floods tsai 2003 in practice this is largely ignored the availability of high resolution data has increased strongly in the past decades with for instance lidar derived digital terrain models the general tendency in thinking is that a higher resolution offers greater accuracy but it ignores the validity of flow approximations furthermore during flash flood events high water heights flow velocities and small spatial resolutions influence the validity of kinematic and diffusive flow further therefore a detailed investigation into the influence of flow approximations on flash flood modelling is required the objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of spatial resolution on the validity of the kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow approximations for use in integrated flood modelling this investigation is separated into two parts first the behavior of these flow approximations for spatial runoff modelling is investigated for several spatial resolutions secondly the flow approximations are coupled with channel flooding and the influence of flow approximations on the flood simulation is investigated study catchments from china hessel and van asch 2003 and spain baartman et al 2013 are used with a spatial resolution of 10 and 20 m to investigate runoff behavior for flooding calibration is performed on 20 40 and 80 m spatial resolution from the italian alps borga et al 2007 calibration is performed on discharge data for those catchments the open source limburg soil erosion model openlisem jetten 2002 starkloff and stolte 2014 hu et al 2015 is to perform the simulations kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow are implemented for overland and channel flow dynamics in order to simulate flooding in a catchment environment dynamic wave channel flooding is included in all three combinations for each combination flow types are fully linked with both each other and other hydrological processes explained below 2 theory for the simulation of overland and channel flow three commonly used approximations for water flow have been implemented kinematic flow diffusive flow and saint venant flow for the simulation of channel flooding saint venant flow is used in this section the derivation and required assumptions for these flow approximations are described in order to describe continuity of any substance with advection the mass balance equation is the basis eq 1 1 h t hu x x hu y y r i where h is the flow height m u is the flow velocity m s 1 r is the rainfall m and i is the infiltration m this equation is valid for all the implemented flow approximations and forms the basis for the numerical methods in the rest of this section equations that describe conservation of momentum for the flow approximations are stated 2 1 dynamic flow the momentum balance equations for water flow approximations are typically derived from the navier stokes equations for incompressible flow when this set of equations is depth averaged and internal friction forces are neglected the saint venant equations result barré de saint venant 1871 eqs 2 and 3 2 hu x t hu x 2 1 2 gh 2 x hu x u y y gh s x s f x 3 hu y t hu y 2 1 2 gh 2 y hu x u y x gh s y s f y here g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 s is the bed slope term and sf is the bed friction term the friction slope terms which are the friction forces divided by the water height and the gravitational acceleration can be calculated using the darcy weisbach friction law te chow 1964 eqs 4 and 5 4 s f x n 2 u x u h 5 s f y n 2 u y u h where n is manning s n friction coefficient sm 1 3 2 2 diffusive flow in the diffusive flow approximation inertial terms are assumed very small when compared to other acceleration terms when the inertial terms are neglected velocity is determined predominantly by hydraulic gradient friction forces and the gravitational force this assumption leads to a simplified set of equations eqs 6 and 7 6 g dh dx s f x s x 7 g dh dy s f y s y 2 3 kinematic flow in the kinematic flow approximation both inertial acceleration and acceleration due to a hydraulic gradient are assumed very small when compared to the other acceleration terms in this assumption velocity is at any moment determined by the friction and gravitational force eqs 8 and 9 8 0 s f x s x 9 0 s f y s y in this set of equations the velocity depends directly on a balance between gravitational and friction forces and flow always moves in the direction of steepest descent solving the kinematic flow equations with manning s friction law leads to manning s law for overland flow velocity te chow 1964 eq 10 10 u r 2 3 s n where u is the flow velocity m s 1 r is the hydraulic radius m and n is the mannings coefficient of the surface sm 1 3 2 4 hydrology and data layers in openlisem the flow methods described in this paper have been used to further the development of openlisem which is open source and freely available the integration of flooding into the model allows the detailed investigation into the processes that lead to the flood event the openlisem model implements multiple types of infiltration models such as smith parlange 1978 and the swatre full vertical soil water balance model bastiaanssen et al 1996 the simulations in this paper use the green ampt infiltration model which assumes a wetting front moving down into the soil due to infiltrating rainfall green ampt 1911 the resulting potential infiltration is subtracted from the available surface water eq 11 11 f pot k s ψ θ s θ i f 1 where fpot is the potential infiltration rate m s 1 f is the cumulative infiltrated water m θs is the porosity m 3 m 3 θi is the initial soil moisture content m 3 m 3 ψ is the matric pressure at the wetting front h ψ z m and ks is the saturated conductivity m s 1 input data consists of soil land surface and terrain properties and can be defined on a sub cell basis by using fraction maps as input fig 1 the infiltration of water and routing of overland flow are fully coupled and thus computed for each numerical timestep further details on the underlying physical principles of openlisem can be found in baartman et al 2012a and jetten 2002 and de roo et al 1996 2 5 numerical implementations the numerical implementations of flow equations can if not appropriate influence behavior and validity a numerical method should be appropriate to the assumptions of the equations and provide a stable accurate and realistic simulation therefore separate numerical methods were implemented for the flow approximations the numerical methods that were implemented during the development stages of openlisem are presented in this section 2 6 saint venant flow cell boundary fluxes the implemented solution for saint venant flow is based on the fullswof2d library delestre et al 2014 this library uses a monotonic upstream cell centered muscl scheme to provide a second order spatial accurate solution this method uses a linear approximates of the flow parameters on the cell boundaries in order to calculate the flux at these boundaries fig 2 the estimation of cell interface fluxes furthermore corrects for elevation differences based on a hydrostatic reconstruction audusse et al 2004 this results in a solution that is both total variation diminishing and preserves a steady state at rest using the harten lax van leer riemann solver shock wave behavior is captured harten et al 1983 finally new water heights are calculated using the hydrostatic reconstruction in order to gain second order accuracy in time heun s predictor corrector method is used which is a 2 step runga kutta solver 2 7 diffusive flow bilinear interpolation if inertial acceleration terms are ignored behavior will become unnatural surrounding local depressions in elevation while tayfur and kavas 1994 use a cell boundary based method to solve diffusive and kinematic flow liu et al 2004 note that irregularities in the digital elevation model dem cause difficulties for such a method thus we implement a distinct advection scheme in order to solve diffusive flow for any cell the location of the water volume is updated by the velocity fig 3 the water volume is then distributed to the cells that surround the new location courant et al 1952 2 8 kinematic flow flow network a numerical solution for kinematic flow must be coherent with the assumptions that lead to the kinematic flow approximations pressure forces are ignored and flow directions are completely determined by terrain slope because of this converging slopes will cause unnatural oscillating behavior to avoid this unnatural behavior kinematic flow is implemented using a pre defined flow direction network fig 4 this network must ignore any local depressions to ensure validity of kinematic flow furthermore the flow direction network allows for a one dimensional implementation of kinematic flow along the network strongly increasing computational speed creation of this network is done using the open source freeware raster gis pcraster karssenberg et al 2010 2 9 connecting one and two dimensional flow channel flow can be simulated in one dimension using the same equations as for overland flow within the model the channel is assumed to be rectangular with limited flow depth to calculate the inflow from the land surface into the channel it is assumed that the direction of overland flow in cells containing channels is perpendicular to the channel direction the channel is furthermore assumed to be located in the middle of the cell this way using the channel width and flow velocity the fraction of runoff water that flows into the channel can be calculated eq 12 12 f qch dtu 0 5 c xy b c where bc is the channel width at the surface m similar methods have been shown to provide accurate estimations of channel inflow bradbrook et al 2004 yin et al 2013 channel overflow immediately adds to flooding if the channel has extra capacity available flooding water is likewise immediately transported into the channel fig 5 2 10 connecting overland flow and flooding besides channel water overland flow enters and thus adds to the flood volume when overland flow and channel flooding are not approximating using the same method their interactions cannot be solved based on normal saint venant flow in reality overland flow water must be added to the flood depth and an exchange of momentum takes place for the kinematic and diffusive wave momentum conservation neglects important terms that are present in the flood water therefore the process of overland flow mixing with flood water is approximated using an empirical relationship eq 13 13 f rf min 1 0 1 e c r h f h r where frf is the fraction of runoff water transferred to the flood water cr is a coefficient hf the flood depth m and hr is the overland flow depth m here the hf and hr are at each moment taken from the local flow properties the coefficient cr is purely based on modelling experience generally taken to be 2 0 since flood artifacts disappear at this value using this approximation overland flow water is gradually transferred to the flood water while it does not unnaturally affect flood momentum 3 materials and methods three study sites are used to investigate the validity of the implemented flow approximations an overview of the topography saturated conductivity and manning s n for these catchments are shown in figs 6 8 the first of these is the danangou catchment a rural area in the loess plateau in china where soil erosion is a major problem due to agriculture on steep slopes and the erodibility of loess soil hessel and van asch 2003 this area was previously used by hessel et al 2003a see also hessel et al 2003b hessel van asch 2003 hessel jetten 2007 to calibrate and validate a previous version of the lisem model this 257 ha region is characterized by steep slopes 20 large eroded gullies land use consists predominantly of woods wild grasslands and parts of cropland in the upper regions for this catchment three precipitation events from 20 07 1999 23 08 1998 and 01 08 1998 will be used the events were recorded by three rainfall gauges in the area and rainfall maps based on the nearest station are therefore used as input the rainfall events are typically characterized by shorts burst of intense precipitation with durations around 30 min intensities up to 100 mm h and high spatial variability during such events hydraulic conductivity is a limiting factor in the amount of infiltration together with measured rainfall intensity discharge after these events is available for every two minutes more details on the events and area are available in hessel et al 2003a the spatial resolution of this dataset is 10 m the channel network in the area consists of small not channelized streams and gullies that converge near the main outlet for validation and calibration discharge data is available at a 2 min interval discharge values have been estimated using water height timeseries at a weir and a stage discharge curve a second catchment in prado south eastern spain will be used this 50 km2 semi arid region experiences between 250 mm and 530 mm of rainfall each year the area has previously been used with lisem by baartman et al 2013 baartman et al 2012a baartman et al 2012b land cover consists mainly of natural shrubs forests and dryland farming such as cereals soil information was obtained by baartman et al 2013 using in situ measurements of all parameters required for openlisem the soil types are primarily calcic cambisols and calcaric fluvisols rainfall data is available for three rainfall events on 29 09 1997 top 09 12 2003 middle and 17 10 2003 bottom baartman et al 2012a the events have a total rainfall of 19 7 26 9 and 49 mm respectively and a duration of around 2 h the channel network in the area consists of small not channelized streams and gullies that converge near the main outlet discharge data has been gathered at the outlet of the described catchment at a 5 min interval discharge values have been estimated using water height timeseries at a weir and a stage discharge curve the spatial resolution of this dataset is 20 m the third catchment is a 164 5 km2 region along the northern italian alps that has been investigated by chen et al 2014 land use in the region consists mainly of multiple types of forest and heathland in the upslope areas and small build up regions in the lower rainfall data is available for an intense precipitation event on the 29th of august 2003 which took place after several weeks of droughts and had a return period between 200 and 500 years norbiato et al 2007 peak rainfall intensity reached 81 mm h during an hour at pontebba located at the outlet of the selected catchment here total precipitation for the event of 389 mm for a detailed description of the precipitation event on the 29th of august 2003 and the methodology in estimating the rainfall intensities see borga et al 2007 multiple upslope branches of tributaries of the fella river experienced flash flooding at small drainage areas borga et al 2007 nikolopoulos et al 2013 besides flooding the area experienced severe geomorphic impacts during the event which might have influenced the flow dynamics marchi et al 2009 the river network in the area consists of many non channelized steep side branches leading to the fella river the main river branch has a wide base 25 m and features culverts near the local highway the outlet discharge data for this event is based on a stage discharge relationship and is available for every half hour the location of this outlet is the fella river at pontebba borga et al 2007 during a post event survey peak discharge estimates were determined for one additional location in the catchment uqua at ugovizza borga et al 2007 the dataset for this catchment was made as part of the increo project increasing resilience through earth observation increo an elevation model and land use map were made available from the project the alpine area features steep slopes and the majority of the area is covered by coniferous forest soil information was collected from the isric database wageningen hengl et al 2017 and literature data from saxton and rawls 2006 the majority of the area has loam like soil characteristics the vegetation index was derived from spot 4 satellite images the available spatial resolutions are 20 40 and 80 m 3 1 simulated scenarios to investigate the performance of the described flow approximations several are used to simulate identical scenarios on the danangou and prado catchments the used flow approximations are kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow for overland flow and respectively kinematic kinematic and dynamic flow for channel flow based on the best calibrated simulation performance of the flow approximation will be analyzed furthermore spatial patterns in flow height are used to see how the flow approximations and processes such as infiltration influence each other to investigate the performance of the flow approximations in flash flood modelling the fella basin is simulated using all combinations of flow approximations this includes kinematic diffusive and dynamic overland flow these types of overland are combined with respectively kinematic kinematic and dynamic flow for the channels finally these flow approximations are combined with dynamic channel flooding leading to a total of 5 combinations of flow approximations to investigate the influence of spatial resolution on the performance of these flash flood simulations spatial flood depth is analyzed for the distinct flow approximations and spatial resolutions 3 2 openlisem input data the input data of openlisem can be separated into three categories firstly a catchment description has to be provided in the form of spatial rasters the provided catchment data was already available in the correct raster format preparation of the dataset was performed using the pcraster open source gis package karssenberg et al 2010 for both the danangou and prado catchment maps of soil and land cover parameters were available in the case of the fella river basin the original dataset has a spatial resolution 20 ms using pcraster this dataset was resampled to 40 and 80 m resolution on the resampled elevation models a simple pit filling algorithm was used to restore flow pathways secondly boundary conditions have to be provided to complete the description of the event time series of catchment averaged rainfall intensity were available as text tables for the prado and fella catchments these were used as input in openlisem from these tables spatially homogeneous rainfall over the catchment area was assumed a list of four rainfall stations combined with station locations were available for the danangou catchment based on these rainfall stations spatial maps of rainfall intensity were made that assigned every cell the rainfall intensity of the closest rainfall station these were then used as input for openlisem to provide spatial rainfall during the simulation outflow boundary conditions were set to allow outflow at any point no inflow besides rainfall was specified for the simulations finally the openlisem simulation parameters are required a table of these parameters for the described datasets is shown in table 1 3 3 calibration for all the described study sites the simulations are calibrated to discharge data discharge data was available with a 10 min resolution for the prado catchment a 30 min resolution for the fella catchment and a 15 min resolution for the danangou catchment while several measurements were removed for several reasons the available data provided enough certainty in the calibration process to calibrate the simulations the saturated conductivity manning s coefficient and initial soil moisture content is varied these parameters have been found to have the highest influence on simulation behavior hessel and jetten 2007 the values for these parameters are kept between 50 and 200 of their original values in order to maintain a physically meaningful simulation the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is used as the measure of performance eq 14 where 1 indicates perfect correlation and increasing negative value a decreasing correlation 14 e 1 q o t q m t 2 q o t q o 2 where e is the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient q o t is the observed discharge at time t m 3 s 1 q m t is the modelled discharge at time t m 3 s 1 and q o is the average observed discharge m 3 s 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 danangou and prado catchments both measured and simulated discharge for the danangou and prado catchment are shown in figs 9 and 10 calibrated simulations for the kinematic diffusive and saint venant flow approximations are provided calibration parameters had to be altered from the original values used by hessel and jetten 2007 due to the usage of different model efficiency functions the values of the nash sutcliffe correlation coefficients and average calibration parameters for each are provided in tables 2 and 3 4 2 connectivity of overland flow the simulation results for the danangou catchment show significant differences in performance for the various flow approximations the time of peak discharge is simulated with substantially higher accuracy by diffusive and saint venant flow both the timing and general shape of the simulated hydrographs lead to substantially higher correlation coefficients for the diffusive and saint venant flow when compared to kinematic flow hessel and van asch 2003 concluded that for this catchment the timing of the discharge peak was especially difficult to predict the authors mentioned that inaccuracy of the digital elevation could have led to steeper slopes this would have increased average overland flow velocity however comparison with dynamic and diffusive wave simulations showed that flow velocities have been increased by the inherent properties of the kinematic flow approximation where diffusive and saint venant flow spread due to pressure forces kinematic flow concentrates to the width of a single cell when the spatial resolution is high this leads to unrealistically high water heights because of this increase in flow height flow velocity increases this effect is furthermore strengthened by the fact that the routing network ignores local depressions in fig 12 maximum flow depth for the july rainfall event are shown while kinematic flow forces a direct path through any rough terrain diffusive and dynamic flow are partly blocked and re routed both of these effects increase the average flow velocity of kinematic flow and cause the approximation to over estimate connectivity in the catchment the results of this over estimation can be seen in the form of the early peak discharge time for the kinematic flow simulations therefore the kinematic flow approximation instead of the digital elevation model was the dominant reason for the inaccuracy the influence of flow approximations on average flow velocities is furthermore visible in the final calibration parameters where manning s n the frictional coefficient is significantly lower for kinematic flow this indicates that during calibration the flow had to be artificially slowed down to gain accuracy the simulation results for the prado catchment show significant differences in performance for the distinct flow approximations all three flow approximations provided satisfactory results in calibration for the three rainfall events dynamic overland flow performed best in recreating the shape of measured hydrographs both diffusive and dynamic flow showed an increase in accuracy when compared to the kinematic flow approximation fig 13 shows the simulated spatial patterns of overland flow for the july rainfall event in the prado catchment a predominant difference in these patterns is the concentration of flow compared to the dynamic flow which performed best in calibration kinematic and diffusive flow respectively over estimate and under estimate flow concentration this is evident from the mathematical and numerical descriptions of their behavior kinematic flow forces flow through the width of a single cell artificially concentrating flow diffusive flow adds pressure terms which act as a diffusive force and neglects other forces causing an overestimation of flow diffusion a second difference between the flow approximations is caused by differences in infiltration on locations where flow concentrates infiltration is limited by the infiltration capacity and the active surface for infiltration flow concentration strongly influences the available surface area for infiltration in the north of the prado catchment runoff is generated that flows south through an area of high infiltration kinematic flow concentrates and limits the active surface area of infiltration thus flowing through areas with high infiltration capacity quicker the diffusive and dynamic flow are predominantly infiltrated due to their more diffusive flow within the final calibration parameters the same effect is visible due to the larger amount of infiltration with diffusive flow the calibration lead to lower values for the saturated conductivity which increases final discharge based on the results of both the danangou and prado catchment kinematic flow is highly accurate and efficient in the correct setting when flow heights relative to spatial resolution is low velocity and flow diffusion are correctly estimated mathematical analysis for the use of flow approximations such as those by vieira 1983 can be used to support the use of flow approximation a crucial difference in behavior is however caused by spatial modelling in the case of spatial flow modelling concentration of flow can quickly change flow properties due to several effects hydrological connectivity can be substantially over estimated by kinematic flow furthermore because the routing scheme for kinematic flow is bound by cell size errors increase with increasing spatial resolution therefore in the case of spatial modelling the ratio of catchment size versus cell size plays an important role in the applicability of the kinematic flow approximation 4 3 validation with flooding simulated and measured discharge for the 2003 fella basin flood event are shown in fig 11 simulations using kinematic diffusive and saint venant approximations both with and without saint venant based channel flooding have been calibrated and are provided the nash sutcliffe correlation coefficient for the discharge simulations of the fella basin flood event are provided in table 4 4 4 flood behavior in the case of the 2003 flood event in the fella river basin the gradual decline in measured discharge after the event confirms the reports of flooding the decrease in flow height and slope outside of the channel causes a gradual return of flood water into the channel flood depth maps for the coupled kinematic diffusive and saint venant simulations with channel flooding are provided in fig 14 for three representative locations flood depth time series for the same simulations are shown in fig 15 the difficulty in recreating the hydrograph differed for the distinct flow approximations without channel flooding kinematic and diffusive flow were not able to provide an accurate recreation of the measured hydrograph the kinematic flow approximation completely neglects the flooding behavior the diffusive flow approximation strongly underestimates flow velocities at the incline of the hydrograph this leads to a late increase in discharge the cause of the underestimated velocities can be found in the over estimation of the spread of the water flow this is due to the presence of pressure term but lack of inertia related acceleration the inertia related acceleration terms would increase flow concentration in sharp incised channels when the kinematic flow approximation is combined with saint venant based channel flooding accuracy increases substantially however channel flooding only slightly increases accuracy in the tail of the hydrograph the combination of diffusive flow with saint venant channel flooding and a full saint venant approximation show accurate recreation of the 2003 fella basin flood hydrograph the main reason for this is shown in fig 7 the flooding during the simulation with kinematic flow is mainly present near the main channel when this flood water re enters the channel it can quickly leave the area for the diffusive and saint venant flow flooding takes place substantially more in the upstream areas because of this water takes a longer time to reach the outlet once it re enters the channel thus while addition of channel based flooding improved calibration accuracy for kinematic flow this method has limited predictive power when compared to diffusive and dynamic overland flow for these flow approximations flooding behavior can take place at any location allowing a greater degree of accuracy in the simulations while dynamic and diffusive flow outperform kinematic flow when using a spatial resolution of 20 m difficulties arise in the case of 40 and 80 m for both 40 and 80 m resolution the coarser resolution creates local depressions in the digital elevation model the routing network that is used for kinematic flow neglects these local depressions while diffusive and saint venant flow first fill these leading to spurious flooded cells correction to the elevation model could be made to increase connectivity for diffusive and dynamic flow however such corrections are a difficult process and can substantially alter slopes on a complex topography another disadvantage of diffusive and dynamic flow on coarse resolutions is that flow spread is generally over estimated when pressure terms are included when spatial resolution is coarse flow spread should not be wider than a single cell however due to pressure terms diffusive and dynamic flow generally use two or more cells however despite the inaccurate flooding of local depressions both flooding extent and flooding depth are substantially more consistent with the results of the 20 m simulation in the case of diffusive or dynamic flow for kinematic flow it is visible that a decrease in spatial resolution causes the flooding to take place increasingly upstream this can be explained by the strong over estimation of connectivity in the fella basin because of terrain with high spatial variability flow velocities are lower when details are included on coarser resolution kinematic flow ignores an increasing amount of details in the topography increasing the over estimation of connectivity and flow velocity this would cause the runoff to arrive at the channel earlier causing flooding in increasingly upstream areas summarizing in the performed simulations due to the strong over estimation of connectivity on both higher and lower spatial resolutions the usage of a kinematic flow approximation could not accurately recreate flow behavior thus both the calibration performance and the consistency of flood extent and volume for varying spatial resolution are substantially higher in the case of diffusive and dynamic flow the influence of spatial resolution on flood connectivity has been described earlier by haile rientjes 2005 in their case re sampling of flood plain elevation influenced the hydraulic connectivity and thus the simulated flood extent they conclude that especially in terrain with high spatial variability important details in elevation are lost in coarser resolutions when simulating flooding within a catchment model that includes rough upstream topography the effect of spatial resolution on flow connectivity should therefore be of even higher importance the manner in which flow approximations are influenced by the topography has been recognized previously kazezyılmaz alhan and medina 2007 in their simulations steeper slopes 0 11 degrees show higher accuracy in using kinematic and diffusive wave approximations in a one dimensional setting in our two dimensional simulations similar effect are visible steep slopes tend to provide larger gravitational acceleration therefore inertial and primarily pressure forces which are ignored by the kinematic flow approximation lose relative magnitude when compared to the gravitational forces the slope values for the described catchments are shown in fig 16 particularly the danandau catchment which features steep slopes and while the catchment edges in the fella basin feature very steep slopes 40 degrees the central river area is very flat leading to inaccurate behavior of kinematic flow finally the prado catchment features mostly gentle slopes 5 degrees as expected performance differences between flow approximations are less noticeable when compared to the other catchments a final consideration in the performance of the flow approximations in flash flood modelling is mass conservation typically numerical flow computations loss or gain water outside of the normal water balance when computational errors are made an overview of the water balance errors in the fella flash flood simulations are shown in table 5 within the implementation of the kinematic and diffusive flow numerical errors are strictly limited to machine precision rounding errors since the flow advection is implemented in a strictly mass conserving manner for dynamic flow this is not the case and mass balance errors increase during the simulations the total amount of water lost in the full dynamic flow simulation is 8 7e 2 due to the insignificant amounts of water lost during the simulation there is no relationship with the quality of the simulation 4 5 sensitivity analysis results from a sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 17 calibrated parameters for the fella flash flood simulations are shown in table 6 the result of the sensitivity analysis show several variables to which the flow methods is highly sensitive both saturated conductivity and manning s coefficient have a strong influence on the output of the model the influence of model resolution on the simulation is relatively low when compared to the saturated conductivity and the manning s coefficient especially average flood depth and flood velocity are substantially affected by the input parameters the distinct flow approximations have substantial differences in sensitivity the kinematic flow approach has the highest sensitivity to resolution changes this is caused by the usage of the local drainage network this causes flow to move through the width of a single cell when cell sizes are changes this significantly influences flow height and thus velocity for the other methods the sensitivity of flood properties is comparable to similar detailed flood models haile rientjes 2005 horritt and bates 2001 generally the kinematic flow approximation shows the lowest sensitivity to the manning s coefficient and the saturated conductivity in these cases however it is important to note that a lower sensitivity does not necessarily mean higher accuracy in the case of kinematic flow infiltration for example is not limited by the hydraulic conductivity but rather by the flow width this decreases sensitivity to a change in hydraulic conductivity the diffusive flow approximation shows an especially high sensitivity for maximum flood depth and maximum flood velocity finally the saint venant flow shows an average sensitivity for all investigated variables 5 conclusions based on the simulation results diffusive and dynamic flow overland flow provide a substantial increase in calibration performance when compared to kinematic flow in both the danangou and prado catchment kinematic diffusive and dynamic flow performed respectively least to most accurate in calibration to measured hydrographs for these catchments with a spatial resolution of 10 and 20 m kinematic flow performed substantially less in both catchments the kinematic flow approximation over estimated connectivity within the catchment both due to flow concentration the use of a routing network and decreased infiltration hydrological connectivity is in some cases highly over estimated when kinematic flow is used therefore the assumptions that lead to kinematic flow have a high influence on hydrological connectivity for simulations of flood events kinematic flow similarly provides the least accuracy the implementation of saint venant based channel flooding strongly increased calibration performance the transition to diffusive and saint venant equations for overland flow further increased accuracy and realism the best results were obtained with a combination of diffusive overland flow and dynamic flow for channel flooding both this combination and full dynamic flow were able to recreate the hydrograph of the 2003 fella basin flood event the primary cause of this was that for diffusive and dynamic flow flood behavior is not limited by the presence of a channel for kinematic flow flooding is initiated along the channels limiting the predictive nature of the model spatial resolution of the dataset has a significant impact on the performance of the flow approximations in the case of coarser resolutions 40 m or higher local depressions were ignored by kinematic flow this improved the relative accuracy of this method in the case of higher spatial resolutions pressure forces within water flow become important as a result of the substantial over estimations of connectivity and flow velocity on both lower and higher spatial resolutions the usage of kinematic flow could not accurately recreate flow behavior in the simulated flood event the performed simulations show that validity of the approximation is highly dependent on the type of event and the spatial resolution with the increasing availability of detailed elevation data and increasing computational power simulations with high spatial resolutions become more common for higher spatial resolutions the usage of kinematic flow can have a significant impact on the model usage of this flow approximation should then be based on a thorough investigation the extent in which a kinematic diffusive or dynamic wave can be used in flow simulations at different spatial resolutions depends on the type of area and particularly the slopes and spatial variability of the topography in the case of flood simulations the implementation of channel based flooding with dynamic flow is required for catchment based simulations of flooding ignoring pressure terms by assuming infinite channels results in unrealistic flow heights and velocities for the same reason kinematic flow was for the fella river simulations not an appropriate method for simulating overland flow the usage of a flow network artificially increases flow concentration and ignores pressure terms which are crucial in describing the behavior of flood water similarly in applications related to spatial hazard susceptibility usage of routing networks and kinematic flow should generally only be considered as a viable alternative when the investigations shows the topography slopes and spatial resolution do not lead to inaccurate behavior of the flow approximation acknowledgements we want to gracefully acknowledge the help of researchers that kindly allowed for the use of their datasets for this research

es or at least to cover the potential costs associated with water use management changes that would provide the same es smith et al 2015 kemkes et al 2010 the mechanisms of social equity economic factors and water marketing systems are important for constraining reasonable allocations of responsibilities and obligations in watershed pes processes a cooperative game cg is an external incentive strategy that promotes public awareness of es to maximize economic social and es gains for water use the use of multi objective models is a useful method for solving complicated systems examples of which include those discussed by divakar et al 2011 who presented a model for the optimum allocation of limited available water to agriculture industry and ecology sectors and by bielsa and duarte 2001 who presented an economic model for the allocation of water to the agricultural irrigation and hydroelectric sectors to study the multi objective optimization of water resources allocation giuliani and castelletti 2013 used a multi agent simulation to model and analyse different levels of cooperation and information exchange and singh 2014 provided a multi objective algorithm and multi objective evaluation methods to balance water supply and demand with respect to economic and social factors cgs play a very important role in the process of decision making liu and zhao 2016 game theory can identify and interpret the behaviours of parties to pes problems and describe how interactions among different parties who prioritize their own objectives rather than system objectives result in a system s evolution madani 2010 cg provides the instruments that are necessary to analyse situations that require cost sharing rules adopted game solutions should guarantee acceptable cost allocations that consider water system the characteristics and requirements provided by pes authorities and other decision makers sechi et al 2013a b among game solutions point solutions have been widely used to allocate water service costs in water resource systems point solutions such as the shapley value shapley 1953 or the so called nucleolus schmeidler 1969 define only one division and are more similar to the classic idea of a unique problem solution the shapley value is a solution concept in cg theory shapley value is characterized by a collection of desirable properties in some cases but not always the asymptotic shapley value is more favourable for large traders than for nucleoli in contrast to monopoly cases einy et al 1999 at present a wide variety of payment schemes and fairness criteria have been implemented to provide pes much of the literature has focused on maximizing system benefits or minimizing water use li et al 2014 water allocation processes make it possible to gather information on how positive incentives provided by water related es influence relationships between society and es bellver domingo et al 2016 for the upper reaches of rivers some uncertainties will be faced when assessing the values of improving water related es and may lead to higher estimates of willingness to accept reward pascual et al 2010 optimization mostly provides a mathematical relationship between economy and es social equity and cg theory should be used to control and regulate the water consumption behaviours of the public when determining payment standards for water related es in watersheds considering their robustness and efficacy for water resource allocation in multi objective optimizations in agriculture industry and municipal water sectors the major consumers of water resources it is of utmost importance to devise water related constraints and execute a comprehensive water related framework of pes a new method has been developed that considers the balance between water use and es with respect to economic and social factors providing equity and balancing water use in different sectors in terms of the socio economic profitability between different watershed sectors on the optimum allocation of water resources in watersheds however their willingness to accept payment still reflects the level of payments needed to enter into voluntary agreements this paper is structured as follows 1 the introduction in which the background and theoretical significance of the research subject in this paper are presented 2 theoretical analysis and data handling with subsections on the 1 sustainable water resources allocation framework which is based on social equity and cg theory and 2 data source analysis and handling 3 model building with subsections on 1 water resources compensation related to social equity and 2 water resources compensation related to cgs 4 a case study and 5 conclusions we propose an integrated system to describe the interactions among the allocation of watershed water resources water consumption and water use in different departments in which pes schemes have been well established fig 1 2 theoretical analysis and data handling 2 1 sustainable water resources allocation framework 2 1 1 allocation framework based on social equity social equity is an important concept for water resources allocation because water is a type of public good thus water resources should be allocated based on social equity social equity focuses on appropriate water distribution in society in terms of the allocation of limited water resources equity has received less attention mainly because equity judgement standards are always individualized tsur and dinar 1995 social equity is subjective and therefore cannot be analysed scientifically wang et al 2015 we put forward an equitable water distribution strategy using cg theory that assists in measuring pes for water resources allocation the upper and lower reaches of a watershed should share the profits resulting from water conservation exploration and utilization typically the lower reaches should pay the upper reaches of the watershed for increasing or maintaining water flow and the upper reaches of the watershed should guarantee that the water demands of the lower reaches are met by enforcing active ecological protections and managing water consumption water conservation and ecological protection in the upper reaches of a watershed are related to the obtained ecological quota and frequency of pes ariely et al 2009 reasonable payments can motivate an es watershed provider to alter its antiquated production and lifestyle and accelerate development qin and kang 2007 therefore when implementing pes for water resources the objectives of social development and ecological protection should be fully considered based on the restoration of the watershed es thereby gradually eliminating the backward regional development of the upper reaches caused by increasing the water supply to the lower reaches brockington and schmidt soltau 2004 pes for water allocation is closely related to regional balanced and sustainable development the calculation methods for pes standards in china are summarized according to watershed pes mechanism at present there are no unified pes calculation standards for use in china a series of ecological watershed protection and management projects have been implemented for the 21st century but without corresponding laws regulations policies and market mechanism many problems and obstacles remain to be overcome in china china has produced very advanced science on the links between ecosystem conditions and human well being and innovative policies that provide eco compensation to poor farmers in remote places fu et al 2012 qin and kang 2007 wang et al 2008 the realization of win win cooperation between the upper and lower reaches of a watershed is one objective of water related pes paterson et al 2015 expect that we will increasingly find hybrid approaches that combine bottom up approaches to integrate scales and available datasets during the implementation of pes effective responsibility and equitable profit allocation practices are important and may increase public willingness to participate in ecological protection to date most scholars have examined profit maximization in societies using the cost profit weighted analysis method based on coupled equity and allocation a comprehensive model employing the three principles of efficiency equity and sustainability has been used to consider economic social and environmental problems in sustainability development manshadi et al 2015 some of the existing literature has highlighted equality and stability during water allocation van et al 2015 presented a method that minimized the differences between upstream and downstream irrigation water users benefits to balance efficiency and equity in water allocation senantea et al 2014 developed a mathematical model integrating water use efficiency and distribution equity to cope with irrigation water allocation at the river basin level however most research has tended to underline economic efficiency and equity conflicts with equity under consideration of pes standards often only being an unquantified concept in this paper water resources in a watershed were re allocated based on game theory to realize optimal water resources allocation and profit maximization for water use among water consumer associations water re allocation was performed to optimize inter basin water quantity and maximize profits to the water consumption sectors in the watershed a decision making process for fair water resources re allocation within the watershed is proposed based on interval optimization and game theory as shown in fig 2 the decision making process consists of three steps first a linearization process for interval water flow optimization is defined to control initial water rights and pollutant discharge permissions second a water consumer association is established to optimize the parameters for model construction and maximize the profits of water consumption sectors third a solution based on the cg is proposed for equitable allocations of the water resources and profits of ecological protection in the watershed changing opportunity and transaction costs between the public and regional governments will lead to unfair allocations of water resources thereby affecting the determination of pes water resources standards it is necessary to study the willingness of the public to pay for water quantity and quality in watersheds and to obtain the degree of support of the aquatic ecological protection participants beneficiaries for a watershed pes standard through a free negotiation process given that pes inequality can lead to increased unsustainability sustainability is made a fundamental objective in the allocation framework to avoid water demand conflicts between economic and environmental development in each subarea the trade offs between water use equity and efficiency are discussed below 2 1 2 allocation framework based on cg game theory plays an influential role in managing water resources systems especially for water allocations among trans boundary users cooperation is an important measure for restoring damaged aquatic ecosystems and game theory is an important strategy for ensuring equitable allocations of aquatic ecosystem value in a watershed game theory has been widely used to solve water resources management and allocation conflicts the dynamic stackelberg game model nash function gini coefficient and other efficient equitable water resources allocation models were constructed to resolve stochastic conflicts in water resources management but they did not optimize the water allocation process tisdell harrison 1992 kerachian karamouz 2006 cullis van koppen 2007 gunasekara et al 2014 as a type of cg definite information games allow for equitable and reasonable water resource profit allocations when all participants have the same interest in meeting the demands of different associations they form an ambiguous information association an ambiguous information game is a re allocation process in which the total net profits of all participants are re allocated within the association water resource allocation systems are associated with various activities and objectives all of which have complicated demand and supply conflicts in this paper a framework for fair water resources allocation is proposed based on the cg theory of competitive water consumption using an improved version of game theory fig 3 first an optimized water allocation model was constructed for water resources allocation among competitive water consumers according to the demands of different water consumption sectors in the watershed second considering the difference in interests among different water consumers an optimized model was constructed with optimal resource allocation and using the differences in material and environmental conditions as constraints to determine the allocation of water resources among different interest groups the influences of insufficient incoming water resources on the profits of water resources can be resolved using a water quality simulation third the profits generated by water consumption by water consumers may be re allocated based on cg theory and competitors of water consumption are encouraged to actively participate in the protection of aquatic ecosystems fair water resource allocation is studied based on the economy equity and environmental indicators the method proposed in this paper is based on the user sequence of game theory to improve cross regional fair water resources allocation in this paper the calculation method can meet the water demands of all users because it considers the priority order water rights and agreements of water management the one dimensional transport equation and the effects of convection diffusion dilution physical interaction and sources were included in the study the adopted methodology is based on the mathematical programming of game models widely applied in economic social and es analyses undertaken for water resources allocation divakar et al 2011 giuliani and castelletti 2013 habibi davijani et al 2016 2 2 data source analysis and handling 2 2 1 data source of the yongding river watershed the yongding river 112 117 45 e 39 41 20 n is one of seven major water systems in the haihe river basin the upper reach of the yongding river consists of the shanggan river and the yanghe river which originate from the southwestern part of shanxi and the southern part of inner mongolia respectively both rivers flow through the guanting reservoir after flowing through the guanting reservoir the shanggan and yanghe rivers converge at qujia village and form the yongding river the yongding river basin is located in the semi arid and semi humid monsoon climate region and the climate in the yongding river basin is classified as a cold temperate continental climate based on administrative divisions the upper reach of the guanting reservoir on the yongding river mainly includes the inner mongolia autonomous region shanxi province hebei province and beijing for this paper the upper reaches of the guanting reservoir datong and suzhou cities in shanxi province and zhangjiakou city in hebei province were selected as the study area fig 4 geographic data were obtained from the national earth system science data sharing platform s open website www geodata cn the study area lies along the upstream reaches of the yongding river and is a public field owned by the people s republic of china thus no specific permission was required to use the site in the study area developed local agricultural production has resulted in high chemical fertilizer and agricultural non point source pollution since the sustainable water resources utilization of beijing programme was implemented in the early 21st century in the study area the construction and reconstruction of municipal sewage treatment plants have increased and direct discharges of urban household wastes and industrial sewage into the river channel have decreased in recent years demand in various sectors has tended to sharply increase with significant increases arising from the agricultural and industrial sectors the water demands of shanxi and hebei provinces in the upper reaches of the yongding river in 2013 are presented in table 1 the data in the table are the surface water demands of the water consumption sectors in the specified regions the data were extracted from the amounts of surface water and underground water supplied according to the demands of the water consumption sectors in 2013 in the specified regions municipal water consumption includes domestic and hygienic water environmental water consumption and water consumption from other public services and construction projects were also included the available water in the yongding river watershed consists of both surface and underground water the estimates presented in table 1 were based on the annual average inflows into the existing basin hydrologic boundaries considering different rainfall probabilities and environmental water demand 2 2 2 water resources and agricultural cultivation data handling the water resources and water demand were calculated based on data from 2013 from the haihe watershed statistical yearbook and the haihe watershed water resources assessment report the yongding river basin is experiencing a water shortage and the amount of riverine aquatic biological resources is small thus the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species based on the water allocation results calculated by fu et al 2012 the standards for pes in the boundary section of the watershed were improved detailed socio economic data were obtained from the local subareas the estimates of water allocation under multi objective decisions were based on the annual average inflows into the existing basin hydrologic boundaries considering different rainfall probabilities and environmental water demand outflow calculations which are relatively simple we set the guanting reservoir s annual inflow to the annual runoff volume at the bahaoqiao hydrological station the differences in runoff among the nanyang river sangan river and huliu river and the annual outflows in shanxi province 108 m3 per year were calculated as described below the annual runoff measured at the chaigoupu hydrological station is the annual outflow of the nanyang river the annual outflow of the sangan river was calculated using 1 w sang w ce 0 23 w chai w irrigation 0 063 the annual outflow huliu river was calculated using 2 w hu 0 713 f hu reservoir where wce is the annual discharge of the cetian reservoir hydrological station wchai is the annual flow monitored at the chaigoupu hydrological station flow wirrigation is the amount of water used for irrigation in shanxi province and fhu reservoir is the inflow of huliuhe reservoir hydrological station according to the annual outflow the amounts of water discharged into the yongding river in shanxi province and hebei province were 45 mm3 and 83 mm3 in 2013 respectively some studies have examined economic benefit estimates for the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors in this study the factors considered to affect agricultural yield mainly included the level of agricultural modernization the quality and quantity of people and the productivity of the land the correlation coefficients between those three factors and agricultural yield were 0 33 0 30 and 0 47 respectively land productivity is an important factor for the development of modern agriculture sun et al 2009 in this study we determined the correlation coefficients between the impact factors of agriculture and industry and economic profits to comprehensively reflect the integrated effects of water resources on yield zhao et al 2009 for agriculture the correlation coefficients were 0 92 for grain yield 0 88 for small livestock 0 93 for the water consumption of vegetables and 0 75 for irrigation water for industry the correlation coefficients were 0 84 for the water consumed for thermal power 0 70 for groundwater consumption 0 73 for the water consumed per 10 000 yuan of output and 0 81 for water consumed by state owned and large scale industrial enterprises as public institutions the amounts of water consumed and economic profits of municipal and environment sectors are difficult to quantify therefore these values were not quantified for this paper the economic profits of the water consumption sectors in this watershed are mainly reflected by agriculture the prices and costs of the different crops were collected and integrated in the study considering the crop zoning reported in the yearbook of agriculture in china 2013 and based on statistical data of key crops in shanxi and hebei provinces wheat corn soybeans peanuts cotton fruits and vegetables were selected to describe the distribution area and related parameters according to the zoning plan and statistical data obtained from the study area in 2013 the scopes of the variations in relevant parameters were presented as intervals to avoid the influences of parameter uncertainty on the value of agricultural production during water consumption based on a summary of the same area and after data sorting the resulting parameter intervals are presented in table 2 the variable costs correspond to the summation of specific crop expenses with costs for temporary labour and mechanization the prices used were collected from records from the wholesale local market and were integrated to generate the endogenous prices of different crops in light of the yongding river basin water allocation provision table 1 and in combination with the annual outflows under different rainfall possibilities we provide the basic parameters of agricultural cultivation based on the non residential water tax table 2 3 water related to pes model building equality and balancing are the important factors affecting pes payments to avoid water demand conflicts between economic and environmental development we built a pes model related to an allocation framework based on social equity fig 2 and a cg fig 3 3 1 pes related to social equity 3 1 1 water allocation the goal of water allocation in relation to social equity is to maximize the economic profitability resulting from the optimum allocation of water to the demands of the agriculture industry and municipal water for drinking and recreation sectors habibi davijani et al 2016 the objective function is expressed by the following equation 3 f max f agri f indus f soc where fagri findus and fsoc are the economic profit functions in the agriculture industry and municipal water sectors respectively 1 agricultural water demand the aim of agricultural water allocation is to maximize economic profit using the combined optimization of deficient irrigation and changes in cultivation patterns the objective function is expressed as 4 f agri m 1 m q m a m p m where m is the number of agriculture products qm is the yield function of the products am is the area under cultivation hectares and pm is the income from the mth product 2 industrial water demand consider a competitive company that produces product z using water supply w and other supplies t consisting of capital workforce and land the objective function is expressed as 5 z f w t the demand functions are obtained as a function of production level z price of water supply pw and the price of other supplies pt these functions are defined as 6 t d t z p t p w w d w z p t p w in view of relations 5 and 6 and the economic efficiency the objective function f indus can be expressed as 7 f indus f t d w d p indus in eq 7 f td wd is the demand function derived for the water and non water supplies and pindus is the economic efficiency of production rials per ton of product habibi davijani et al 2016 fu et al 2012 8 f t d w d 3 5 10 6 exp 4 10 7 d the economic efficiency for production or industry is 78 yuan per ton of product therefore the function f indus can be obtained using relation 9 the derived water demand parameter is relatively attractive for some industrial activities which means that any increase in the price of water may result in a change in technology habibi davijani et al 2016 9 f indus 3 5 10 6 exp 4 10 7 d 78 3 municipal water demand in the study the water needed for municipal administration was fully provided and it was assumed that the economic benefits from that sector f soc are spent on obtaining and supplying the water and on the repair and maintenance of the existing systems in the yongding river watershed 10 f soc b soc c soc b soc is the profit obtained from the municipal water supply and c soc is the current expenditures in the municipal water sector 3 1 2 pollutant emission permission managing water quality and providing reclamation and waste reduction strategies acknowledging the environmental importance of watersheds have become the focus of pes in past decades the general objective when issuing permits for emitting pollutants into rivers is to implement a coordinated set of strategies that reduce or allocate the waste loads entering them assuming the water demands of the water consumption sectors of the watershed are proportional to the permitted pollutant emissions the permitted pollutant emissions can be calculated as 11 t t j d t j d t e t where tt j is the permitted pollutant emissions allocated to water consumer j during time period t 104 t dt j is the water demand of water consumer j during time period t 104 m3 and dt and et are the total water demands 104 m3 and the pollutant holding capacities of the water bodies in the watershed 104 t respectively pollutant holding capacity provides complete protection at the watershed scale the relationships between pollution sources and water quality conditions in the waterbody are complex therefore the water quality standard is a fixed value but the flow in the waterbody and the carrying capacity fluctuate the application of pollutant holding capacity is more complex and requires additional analysis tools to calculate point and nps emissions and to determine the allowable maximum loads for the receiving waterbody and the associations between the pollution source emissions and water quality in the receiving waterbody chen et al 2016 a flowchart for determining pollutant holding capacity is shown in fig 5 pollutant holding capacity has been used widely to assess chemical oxygen demand cod phosphorous p and nitrogen n concentrations in rivers and reservoirs the methodology has been proposed for researching pollutant emission permissions in river systems using the decision support system dss for the graph model for conflict resolution ii gmcrii multi criteria decision making mcdm analysis and the multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm saberi niksokhan 2017 3 1 3 profits of water consumption

is the permitted pollutant emissions of water consumer j in the i th water consumption sector 104 t to highlight key factors and for simplicity only the roles of water quantity and the beneficial coefficient of water consumption on the allocation of profits among different water consumer associations were considered in this context water resources were allocated to each water consumer in the watershed the total profits that result from reasonable water resources allocation based on the mean profit of production sectors are estimated as 14 t benefit j s b j j s c 1 c j a cj b cj y ajc y

obtain the maximum achievable economic benefits with limited water watershed managers need to continuously improve water use economic benefit efficiency therefore the lower level objective function is the maximization of the economic benefit efficiency within each subarea 3 2 pes related to cgs taking sustainability as a constraint we built a multi objective water allocation programming model that addressed efficiency and equity integrating equity efficiency and ecology for yongding river water allocation was considered to establish an optimization model furthermore the cg method was used to trade off efficiency and equity many multidisciplinary journals have presented game theory in greater detail each presented game theory in a way that provided enough information to better understand how it can be used for these types of problems jiang and hellegers 2016 kyriazi et al 2017 shi et al 2016 to solve a cg due to its complexity and the abundant decision variations in decision models optimization algorithms such as the nucleolus and weak nucleolus theories and genetic algorithms have been applied 3 2 1 cg theory young 1994 reported that cg theory provides the necessary instruments for analysing situations in which there is a sharing mechanism that is considered efficient equal and just by all users in the literature many cost allocation problems have been analysed using cg principles but the approaches varied significantly in the different research fields cg principles have also been applied in studies related to water resources hilton and culver 2000 the participants

calculated by 17 φ i v i t n s 1 n s n v j t s j e j v j t i s j e j when calculating the shapley value the amount of water consumption is integrated with the economic profit from water consumption the water consumers in the watershed were divided into four sectors according to the features of the damaged aquatic ecosystems in the watershed water shortage serious water pollution and poor water quality 1 upstream agriculture 2 upstream industry 3 upstream ecological fields and 4 downstream agriculture during the re allocation of water resources and net profits based on the shapley value the profits of different water consumers were re allocated according to the characteristic function of the water consumer association as shown in fig 4 in the figure i 1 2 3 and 4 indicate the amounts of

sustainability is used as a constraint in water resources allocation economic benefit is the main focus of the existing multi objective programming literature roozbahani et al 2015 wang et al 2008 this study which is based on empirical data demonstrates that the adoption of an actual model leads to greater efficiency in the distribution of profits among water users the process of water resources and net profit allocations based on ambiguous information associations is affected by the number of water consumers and the characteristic function the water allocation function is expressed as 18 x s i 1 3 pr i s a i s and 19 v s b s x s x s c s b s c s x s c s where a i is the amount of water resources re allocated to water consumer i during the second stage 104 m3 c s is the upper

the net profit coefficient per unit water of association s and s 1 2 and 3 represent the associations of the upstream agricultural water consumers downstream agricultural water consumers and upstream industrial water consumers respectively since 2008 there has been an increasing interest in wfa water footprint assessment for understanding corporate water sustainability water risk and water stewardship hoekstra 2013 the goal of the game is to allocate among the players the cost of the most efficient coalition as defined in previous paragraphs that will allow water demand satisfaction sechi et al 2013a b the adopted game solution should guarantee an acceptable cost allocation considering the particular characteristics of the water system fig 6 cg theory is applied to resolve the conflict between different water users the evaluation of the cg core of solutions represents the set of admissible cost allocations and supplies the boundary values for each player the efficiencies of different cgs for apportioning costs of water supply development projects were compared by young et al 1982 inside the core each allocation satisfies the marginality and rationality principles and the stakeholders should recognize equity and fairness to realize the cost distribution in joint pes and water allocation projects coppola and szidarovszky 2004 designed a two person conflicting game to analyse the optimal tradeoff between water supply and contamination risk lewandowski 1979 used a game theoretic approach to model the behaviour of water users in a quality control problem and van der veeren and tol 2003 applied game theory to solve water allocation and pollution problems of transboundary rivers including an inter country river 4 results and discussion 4 1 water quantity optimization the nucleolus and weak nucleolus theories of cgs were used to re allocate the total profits and agricultural water rights of different participants in the association the upper and lower limits of the profits of the water consumption sectors in the upper reaches of the watersheds were obtained based on an analysis of the long term consecutive data tables 3 and 4 in table 3 l indicates the lower limit and u indicates the upper limit water user associations 1 2 3 and 4 correspond to the area upstream of the cetian reservoir on the yongding river in datong city shanxi province the section from the cetian reservoir on the yongding river to sanjiadian in datong city shanxi province the section from the cetian reservoir of the yongding river to sanjiadian in zhangjiakou city and the area upstream of the cetian reservoir on the yongding river in shuozhou city shanxi province the long term water consumption data obtained from the water consumption sectors from 1978 to 2013 are presented in table 4 in this paper the arable land areas for different computing units in the study area were calculated based on the land utilization map in the study area using the gis statistical analysis function water resources were re allocated based on the planting areas of different crops to maximize water consumer profits optimal agricultural water demand table 5 was calculated using nucleolus theory according to social equity mechanisms as based on the nucleolus theory cg and under the current development mode the water demand in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed is characterized by the following parameters the upper limit of the amount of water in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed was 112 mm3 the lower limit was 102 mm3 and the mean value was 107 mm3 the total water demand of shanxi and hebei provinces in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed was 41 mm3 which was 66 mm3 lower than the equilibrium status to facilitate the uniform allocation of water utilization profit during the linearization process it was assumed that the percentage of agricultural water utilization profit was the same as that in the study area and that water flow under the equilibrium status was 113 mm3 the water quantity and quality in the upper reaches of the yongding river can meet the agricultural demand for water by using water saving and water recycling technologies 66 mm3 of water has been saved the water flow in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed reached 128 mm3 in 2013 according to the rule that the beneficiary provides the payment beijing which is located in the downstream area of the yongding river watershed should pay the upstream for incoming water resources this es payment standard is based on the economic profits of agricultural water use which is the product of agricultural water consumption in the downstream area and the difference between the economic profits from agricultural water pes in the upstream and downstream areas the upstream and downstream payment water prices were 0 68 m3 and 0 34 m3 respectively therefore beijing should provide the exchange rate between the us dollar and the yuan was assumed to be 6 19 yuan per us dollar usd 6 31 m 39 03 m in payments to the upstream area including usd 3 52 m 21 73 m for hebei province and usd 2 79 m 17 3 m for shanxi province according to the characteristics of the cg consumers act to improve water utilization efficiency in the early stage of consumer participation in the association and water consumers with high water utilization profits are allowed to obtain residual water resources beyond their initial water rights based on the integrated coordinated development of the watershed the water consumers with high water utilization profits should pay those with low water utilization profits in addition based on the relationships between the initial water right allocations for the downstream and upstream areas of the watershed the water resources allocated to water user sectors 1 2 3 and 4 were 431 mm3 133 mm3 6 mm3 and 8 mm3 considering only surface water respectively in 2013 water allocation between the upper and lower reaches is related to regional development patterns depends on the different water quality levels and shows a certain degree of imbalance to facilitate the re allocation process of water resources and economic profits according to eqs 18 and 19 b i b i and c i c i were used table 6 to calculate the allocation of water resources and economic profits in the ambiguous information game based on calculations of economic profit per unit of water and amounts of disposable water resources determined from a water type analysis of the water consumers a summary of the regional water consumption and the economic profits of different sectors when water consumption sectors participate in ambiguous information associations greater profits even greater the profit allocation predicted by the shapley value of definite information can be obtained from the same amount of water resources therefore in this case reasonable water resources allocation is important for determining the payment relationships between the upper and lower reaches in accordance with the calculation method presented in this paper the amount of water resources allocated to water consumers will be lower than the initial amount of water allocation water consumers can obtain higher profits based on the perspectives of equity and comprehensive profits than under disordered competition status in the cg of the three water consumer associations of the upstream water utilization sectors the corresponding relationships between the final amount of water and the shapley value were 0 5 3 9 and 32 m3 the amounts of water resources in sectors 1 2 and 3 were 59 mm3 20 mm3 and 6 mm3 respectively and the total water demand was 85 mm3 considering social equity the downstream areas should pay the upstream areas according to the water flow at the boundary section because the water resources that flow from the upstream to downstream areas of the yongding river watershed were obtained by considering es and water saving efficacy in the upstream area thus the amount of pes was usd 6 31 m 39 03 m water allocation payment intensity varies regionally because of the strong relationships among the intensities of conflicts regional economic activities and relative abundances of water resources rivera et al 2016 the pes associated with different risk levels of constraint violation were obtained which can help reveal the relationship between the economic objective and water related es protection 4 2 water quality optimization in the yongding river watershed many chemical substances are emitted into the river from anthropogenic sources to protect water quality in the yongding river watershed the pes calculation includes water quality requirements for improving the watershed s environment cg theory has been utilized for fair treatment cost reallocation in a water quality management programme manshadi et al 2015 defining treatment levels using optimal pollutant emission permissions would indicate that water quality standards have been maintained along the river or at specified control points in the final allocation of water resources we used pollutant discharge treatment trade off curves fig 7 to calculate the cost of pes based on the pollutant treatment level the fuzzy risk of a pollutant exceeding a pollution emission permission can be obtained then according to the cost fuzzy risk trade off curve the pes cost to control water pollution is established the trade off curves between the objectives were developed using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii which is powerful and developed multi objective genetic algorithm technique niksokhan et al 2009 nsga ii can be used to consider the minimal pollution loads needed to realize the smallest wastewater treatment cost the objective functions are related to pes cost and a fuzzy risk of violating water quality standards to reduce pollutant treatment costs pollution dischargers can participate in cooperative pollutant discharge permit trading the pay off between pollutant dischargers and environmental protectors is obtained using a two person nonzero sum game for this paper a cg theoretic nucleolus game was utilized to equitably allocate the total cost reduction to dischargers and calculate pes in the non dominated yongding river watershed the fuzzy risk of violating the water quality standards was 0 4 and the pollutant treatment level was 40 we acquired a total restoration cost of 160 m yuan by applying fig 7 stakeholders in the yongding river watershed have indicated that they are willing to pay approximately 5570 yuan t for environmental improvements as mentioned earlier the amount of water discharged in the yongding river was 4 50 107 m3 in shanxi province 83 mm3 in hebei province and 41 3 mm3 in beijing city in 2013 therefore beijing should pay usd 6 31 m 39 03 m as a pes to the upstream area to improve the water environment the value of the final pes allocation is reasonable miyun reservoir is the main drinking water source for beijing providing 73 3 of the total domestic water supply the input by local residents for water source protection was 33 96 m per year xu et al 2015 water eco services in mentougou have suffered damages valued at usd 5 54 m bai et al 2011 therefore the pes allocation could provide decision making references for promoting the coordinated development of the beijing shanxi hebei region 5 conclusions based on social equity the optimal water demand of the upper reaches of the yongding river was calculated using interval values the water quality in the upper reaches of the yongding river is very poor and the water is mainly used for agricultural irrigation according to the nucleolus theory cg 128 mm3 of water flowed to shanxi section and hebei from the upstream reaches of the yongding river in 2013 thus beijing should pay usd 6 31 m 39 03 m as a pes to the upstream area for the costs and losses due to the downstream water supply the management of water resources allocation pes is a complicated issue due to the increased use and demand prevailing today the approach proposed here serves as a methodological basis for considering the fundamental aspects of water related es sustainability when applied to water management the pes for sustainable water use grows quickly in both civil society and watersheds but the poor state of transformation relationships between water allocation and es regarding their direct and indirect water use implies that there is still a long way to go before we can expect that water related pes can effectively contribute to making water allocations more sustainable acknowledgements the study was financially supported by the national key research

7582,watershed water resource allocation focuses on concrete aspects of the sustainable management of ecosystem services es that are related to water and examines the possibility of implementing payment for ecosystem services pes for water es pes can be executed to satisfy both economic and environmental objectives and demands considering the importance of calculating pes schemes at the social equity and cooperative game cg levels to quantitatively solve multi objective problems a water resources allocation model and multi objective optimization are provided the model consists of three modules that address the following processes ① social equity mechanisms used to study water consumer associations ② an optimal decision making process based on variable intervals and cg theory and ③ the use of shapley values of cgs for profit maximization the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for realizing sustainable development was examined first an optimization model with water allocation objective was developed based on sustainable water resources allocation framework that maximizes the net benefit of water use then to meet water quality requirements pes cost was estimated using trade off curves among different pollution emission concentration permissions finally to achieve equity and supply sufficient incentives for water resources protection cg theory approaches were utilized to reallocate pes benefits the potential of the developed model was examined by its application to a case study in the yongding river watershed of china approximately 128 mm3 of water flowed from the upper reach shanxi and hebei provinces sections of the yongding river to the lower reach beijing in 2013 according to the calculated results beijing should pay usd 6 31 m 39 03 m for water related es to shanxi and hebei provinces the results reveal that the proposed methodology is an available tool that can be used for sustainable development with resolving pes amounts among different regions under social and environmental constraints by considering the characteristics of social equity and cgs keywords payment for ecosystem services water resources allocation social equity cooperative game 1 introduction payment for ecosystem services pes is a market based instrument used to internalize the benefits provided by natural capital by creating a market for ecosystem services es or at least to cover the potential costs associated with water use management changes that would provide the same es smith et al 2015 kemkes et al 2010 the mechanisms of social equity economic factors and water marketing systems are important for constraining reasonable allocations of responsibilities and obligations in watershed pes processes a cooperative game cg is an external incentive strategy that promotes public awareness of es to maximize economic social and es gains for water use the use of multi objective models is a useful method for solving complicated systems examples of which include those discussed by divakar et al 2011 who presented a model for the optimum allocation of limited available water to agriculture industry and ecology sectors and by bielsa and duarte 2001 who presented an economic model for the allocation of water to the agricultural irrigation and hydroelectric sectors to study the multi objective optimization of water resources allocation giuliani and castelletti 2013 used a multi agent simulation to model and analyse different levels of cooperation and information exchange and singh 2014 provided a multi objective algorithm and multi objective evaluation methods to balance water supply and demand with respect to economic and social factors cgs play a very important role in the process of decision making liu and zhao 2016 game theory can identify and interpret the behaviours of parties to pes problems and describe how interactions among different parties who prioritize their own objectives rather than system objectives result in a system s evolution madani 2010 cg provides the instruments that are necessary to analyse situations that require cost sharing rules adopted game solutions should guarantee acceptable cost allocations that consider water system the characteristics and requirements provided by pes authorities and other decision makers sechi et al 2013a b among game solutions point solutions have been widely used to allocate water service costs in water resource systems point solutions such as the shapley value shapley 1953 or the so called nucleolus schmeidler 1969 define only one division and are more similar to the classic idea of a unique problem solution the shapley value is a solution concept in cg theory shapley value is characterized by a collection of desirable properties in some cases but not always the asymptotic shapley value is more favourable for large traders than for nucleoli in contrast to monopoly cases einy et al 1999 at present a wide variety of payment schemes and fairness criteria have been implemented to provide pes much of the literature has focused on maximizing system benefits or minimizing water use li et al 2014 water allocation processes make it possible to gather information on how positive incentives provided by water related es influence relationships between society and es bellver domingo et al 2016 for the upper reaches of rivers some uncertainties will be faced when assessing the values of improving water related es and may lead to higher estimates of willingness to accept reward pascual et al 2010 optimization mostly provides a mathematical relationship between economy and es social equity and cg theory should be used to control and regulate the water consumption behaviours of the public when determining payment standards for water related es in watersheds considering their robustness and efficacy for water resource allocation in multi objective optimizations in agriculture industry and municipal water sectors the major consumers of water resources it is of utmost importance to devise water related constraints and execute a comprehensive water related framework of pes a new method has been developed that considers the balance between water use and es with respect to economic and social factors providing equity and balancing water use in different sectors in terms of the socio economic profitability between different watershed sectors on the optimum allocation of water resources in watersheds however their willingness to accept payment still reflects the level of payments needed to enter into voluntary agreements this paper is structured as follows 1 the introduction in which the background and theoretical significance of the research subject in this paper are presented 2 theoretical analysis and data handling with subsections on the 1 sustainable water resources allocation framework which is based on social equity and cg theory and 2 data source analysis and handling 3 model building with subsections on 1 water resources compensation related to social equity and 2 water resources compensation related to cgs 4 a case study and 5 conclusions we propose an integrated system to describe the interactions among the allocation of watershed water resources water consumption and water use in different departments in which pes schemes have been well established fig 1 2 theoretical analysis and data handling 2 1 sustainable water resources allocation framework 2 1 1 allocation framework based on social equity social equity is an important concept for water resources allocation because water is a type of public good thus water resources should be allocated based on social equity social equity focuses on appropriate water distribution in society in terms of the allocation of limited water resources equity has received less attention mainly because equity judgement standards are always individualized tsur and dinar 1995 social equity is subjective and therefore cannot be analysed scientifically wang et al 2015 we put forward an equitable water distribution strategy using cg theory that assists in measuring pes for water resources allocation the upper and lower reaches of a watershed should share the profits resulting from water conservation exploration and utilization typically the lower reaches should pay the upper reaches of the watershed for increasing or maintaining water flow and the upper reaches of the watershed should guarantee that the water demands of the lower reaches are met by enforcing active ecological protections and managing water consumption water conservation and ecological protection in the upper reaches of a watershed are related to the obtained ecological quota and frequency of pes ariely et al 2009 reasonable payments can motivate an es watershed provider to alter its antiquated production and lifestyle and accelerate development qin and kang 2007 therefore when implementing pes for water resources the objectives of social development and ecological protection should be fully considered based on the restoration of the watershed es thereby gradually eliminating the backward regional development of the upper reaches caused by increasing the water supply to the lower reaches brockington and schmidt soltau 2004 pes for water allocation is closely related to regional balanced and sustainable development the calculation methods for pes standards in china are summarized according to watershed pes mechanism at present there are no unified pes calculation standards for use in china a series of ecological watershed protection and management projects have been implemented for the 21st century but without corresponding laws regulations policies and market mechanism many problems and obstacles remain to be overcome in china china has produced very advanced science on the links between ecosystem conditions and human well being and innovative policies that provide eco compensation to poor farmers in remote places fu et al 2012 qin and kang 2007 wang et al 2008 the realization of win win cooperation between the upper and lower reaches of a watershed is one objective of water related pes paterson et al 2015 expect that we will increasingly find hybrid approaches that combine bottom up approaches to integrate scales and available datasets during the implementation of pes effective responsibility and equitable profit allocation practices are important and may increase public willingness to participate in ecological protection to date most scholars have examined profit maximization in societies using the cost profit weighted analysis method based on coupled equity and allocation a comprehensive model employing the three principles of efficiency equity and sustainability has been used to consider economic social and environmental problems in sustainability development manshadi et al 2015 some of the existing literature has highlighted equality and stability during water allocation van et al 2015 presented a method that minimized the differences between upstream and downstream irrigation water users benefits to balance efficiency and equity in water allocation senantea et al 2014 developed a mathematical model integrating water use efficiency and distribution equity to cope with irrigation water allocation at the river basin level however most research has tended to underline economic efficiency and equity conflicts with equity under consideration of pes standards often only being an unquantified concept in this paper water resources in a watershed were re allocated based on game theory to realize optimal water resources allocation and profit maximization for water use among water consumer associations water re allocation was performed to optimize inter basin water quantity and maximize profits to the water consumption sectors in the watershed a decision making process for fair water resources re allocation within the watershed is proposed based on interval optimization and game theory as shown in fig 2 the decision making process consists of three steps first a linearization process for interval water flow optimization is defined to control initial water rights and pollutant discharge permissions second a water consumer association is established to optimize the parameters for model construction and maximize the profits of water consumption sectors third a solution based on the cg is proposed for equitable allocations of the water resources and profits of ecological protection in the watershed changing opportunity and transaction costs between the public and regional governments will lead to unfair allocations of water resources thereby affecting the determination of pes water resources standards it is necessary to study the willingness of the public to pay for water quantity and quality in watersheds and to obtain the degree of support of the aquatic ecological protection participants beneficiaries for a watershed pes standard through a free negotiation process given that pes inequality can lead to increased unsustainability sustainability is made a fundamental objective in the allocation framework to avoid water demand conflicts between economic and environmental development in each subarea the trade offs between water use equity and efficiency are discussed below 2 1 2 allocation framework based on cg game theory plays an influential role in managing water resources systems especially for water allocations among trans boundary users cooperation is an important measure for restoring damaged aquatic ecosystems and game theory is an important strategy for ensuring equitable allocations of aquatic ecosystem value in a watershed game theory has been widely used to solve water resources management and allocation conflicts the dynamic stackelberg game model nash function gini coefficient and other efficient equitable water resources allocation models were constructed to resolve stochastic conflicts in water resources management but they did not optimize the water allocation process tisdell harrison 1992 kerachian karamouz 2006 cullis van koppen 2007 gunasekara et al 2014 as a type of cg definite information games allow for equitable and reasonable water resource profit allocations when all participants have the same interest in meeting the demands of different associations they form an ambiguous information association an ambiguous information game is a re allocation process in which the total net profits of all participants are re allocated within the association water resource allocation systems are associated with various activities and objectives all of which have complicated demand and supply conflicts in this paper a framework for fair water resources allocation is proposed based on the cg theory of competitive water consumption using an improved version of game theory fig 3 first an optimized water allocation model was constructed for water resources allocation among competitive water consumers according to the demands of different water consumption sectors in the watershed second considering the difference in interests among different water consumers an optimized model was constructed with optimal resource allocation and using the differences in material and environmental conditions as constraints to determine the allocation of water resources among different interest groups the influences of insufficient incoming water resources on the profits of water resources can be resolved using a water quality simulation third the profits generated by water consumption by water consumers may be re allocated based on cg theory and competitors of water consumption are encouraged to actively participate in the protection of aquatic ecosystems fair water resource allocation is studied based on the economy equity and environmental indicators the method proposed in this paper is based on the user sequence of game theory to improve cross regional fair water resources allocation in this paper the calculation method can meet the water demands of all users because it considers the priority order water rights and agreements of water management the one dimensional transport equation and the effects of convection diffusion dilution physical interaction and sources were included in the study the adopted methodology is based on the mathematical programming of game models widely applied in economic social and es analyses undertaken for water resources allocation divakar et al 2011 giuliani and castelletti 2013 habibi davijani et al 2016 2 2 data source analysis and handling 2 2 1 data source of the yongding river watershed the yongding river 112 117 45 e 39 41 20 n is one of seven major water systems in the haihe river basin the upper reach of the yongding river consists of the shanggan river and the yanghe river which originate from the southwestern part of shanxi and the southern part of inner mongolia respectively both rivers flow through the guanting reservoir after flowing through the guanting reservoir the shanggan and yanghe rivers converge at qujia village and form the yongding river the yongding river basin is located in the semi arid and semi humid monsoon climate region and the climate in the yongding river basin is classified as a cold temperate continental climate based on administrative divisions the upper reach of the guanting reservoir on the yongding river mainly includes the inner mongolia autonomous region shanxi province hebei province and beijing for this paper the upper reaches of the guanting reservoir datong and suzhou cities in shanxi province and zhangjiakou city in hebei province were selected as the study area fig 4 geographic data were obtained from the national earth system science data sharing platform s open website www geodata cn the study area lies along the upstream reaches of the yongding river and is a public field owned by the people s republic of china thus no specific permission was required to use the site in the study area developed local agricultural production has resulted in high chemical fertilizer and agricultural non point source pollution since the sustainable water resources utilization of beijing programme was implemented in the early 21st century in the study area the construction and reconstruction of municipal sewage treatment plants have increased and direct discharges of urban household wastes and industrial sewage into the river channel have decreased in recent years demand in various sectors has tended to sharply increase with significant increases arising from the agricultural and industrial sectors the water demands of shanxi and hebei provinces in the upper reaches of the yongding river in 2013 are presented in table 1 the data in the table are the surface water demands of the water consumption sectors in the specified regions the data were extracted from the amounts of surface water and underground water supplied according to the demands of the water consumption sectors in 2013 in the specified regions municipal water consumption includes domestic and hygienic water environmental water consumption and water consumption from other public services and construction projects were also included the available water in the yongding river watershed consists of both surface and underground water the estimates presented in table 1 were based on the annual average inflows into the existing basin hydrologic boundaries considering different rainfall probabilities and environmental water demand 2 2 2 water resources and agricultural cultivation data handling the water resources and water demand were calculated based on data from 2013 from the haihe watershed statistical yearbook and the haihe watershed water resources assessment report the yongding river basin is experiencing a water shortage and the amount of riverine aquatic biological resources is small thus the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species based on the water allocation results calculated by fu et al 2012 the standards for pes in the boundary section of the watershed were improved detailed socio economic data were obtained from the local subareas the estimates of water allocation under multi objective decisions were based on the annual average inflows into the existing basin hydrologic boundaries considering different rainfall probabilities and environmental water demand outflow calculations which are relatively simple we set the guanting reservoir s annual inflow to the annual runoff volume at the bahaoqiao hydrological station the differences in runoff among the nanyang river sangan river and huliu river and the annual outflows in shanxi province 108 m3 per year were calculated as described below the annual runoff measured at the chaigoupu hydrological station is the annual outflow of the nanyang river the annual outflow of the sangan river was calculated using 1 w sang w ce 0 23 w chai w irrigation 0 063 the annual outflow huliu river was calculated using 2 w hu 0 713 f hu reservoir where wce is the annual discharge of the cetian reservoir hydrological station wchai is the annual flow monitored at the chaigoupu hydrological station flow wirrigation is the amount of water used for irrigation in shanxi province and fhu reservoir is the inflow of huliuhe reservoir hydrological station according to the annual outflow the amounts of water discharged into the yongding river in shanxi province and hebei province were 45 mm3 and 83 mm3 in 2013 respectively some studies have examined economic benefit estimates for the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors in this study the factors considered to affect agricultural yield mainly included the level of agricultural modernization the quality and quantity of people and the productivity of the land the correlation coefficients between those three factors and agricultural yield were 0 33 0 30 and 0 47 respectively land productivity is an important factor for the development of modern agriculture sun et al 2009 in this study we determined the correlation coefficients between the impact factors of agriculture and industry and economic profits to comprehensively reflect the integrated effects of water resources on yield zhao et al 2009 for agriculture the correlation coefficients were 0 92 for grain yield 0 88 for small livestock 0 93 for the water consumption of vegetables and 0 75 for irrigation water for industry the correlation coefficients were 0 84 for the water consumed for thermal power 0 70 for groundwater consumption 0 73 for the water consumed per 10 000 yuan of output and 0 81 for water consumed by state owned and large scale industrial enterprises as public institutions the amounts of water consumed and economic profits of municipal and environment sectors are difficult to quantify therefore these values were not quantified for this paper the economic profits of the water consumption sectors in this watershed are mainly reflected by agriculture the prices and costs of the different crops were collected and integrated in the study considering the crop zoning reported in the yearbook of agriculture in china 2013 and based on statistical data of key crops in shanxi and hebei provinces wheat corn soybeans peanuts cotton fruits and vegetables were selected to describe the distribution area and related parameters according to the zoning plan and statistical data obtained from the study area in 2013 the scopes of the variations in relevant parameters were presented as intervals to avoid the influences of parameter uncertainty on the value of agricultural production during water consumption based on a summary of the same area and after data sorting the resulting parameter intervals are presented in table 2 the variable costs correspond to the summation of specific crop expenses with costs for temporary labour and mechanization the prices used were collected from records from the wholesale local market and were integrated to generate the endogenous prices of different crops in light of the yongding river basin water allocation provision table 1 and in combination with the annual outflows under different rainfall possibilities we provide the basic parameters of agricultural cultivation based on the non residential water tax table 2 3 water related to pes model building equality and balancing are the important factors affecting pes payments to avoid water demand conflicts between economic and environmental development we built a pes model related to an allocation framework based on social equity fig 2 and a cg fig 3 3 1 pes related to social equity 3 1 1 water allocation the goal of water allocation in relation to social equity is to maximize the economic profitability resulting from the optimum allocation of water to the demands of the agriculture industry and municipal water for drinking and recreation sectors habibi davijani et al 2016 the objective function is expressed by the following equation 3 f max f agri f indus f soc where fagri findus and fsoc are the economic profit functions in the agriculture industry and municipal water sectors respectively 1 agricultural water demand the aim of agricultural water allocation is to maximize economic profit using the combined optimization of deficient irrigation and changes in cultivation patterns the objective function is expressed as 4 f agri m 1 m q m a m p m where m is the number of agriculture products qm is the yield function of the products am is the area under cultivation hectares and pm is the income from the mth product 2 industrial water demand consider a competitive company that produces product z using water supply w and other supplies t consisting of capital workforce and land the objective function is expressed as 5 z f w t the demand functions are obtained as a function of production level z price of water supply pw and the price of other supplies pt these functions are defined as 6 t d t z p t p w w d w z p t p w in view of relations 5 and 6 and the economic efficiency the objective function f indus can be expressed as 7 f indus f t d w d p indus in eq 7 f td wd is the demand function derived for the water and non water supplies and pindus is the economic efficiency of production rials per ton of product habibi davijani et al 2016 fu et al 2012 8 f t d w d 3 5 10 6 exp 4 10 7 d the economic efficiency for production or industry is 78 yuan per ton of product therefore the function f indus can be obtained using relation 9 the derived water demand parameter is relatively attractive for some industrial activities which means that any increase in the price of water may result in a change in technology habibi davijani et al 2016 9 f indus 3 5 10 6 exp 4 10 7 d 78 3 municipal water demand in the study the water needed for municipal administration was fully provided and it was assumed that the economic benefits from that sector f soc are spent on obtaining and supplying the water and on the repair and maintenance of the existing systems in the yongding river watershed 10 f soc b soc c soc b soc is the profit obtained from the municipal water supply and c soc is the current expenditures in the municipal water sector 3 1 2 pollutant emission permission managing water quality and providing reclamation and waste reduction strategies acknowledging the environmental importance of watersheds have become the focus of pes in past decades the general objective when issuing permits for emitting pollutants into rivers is to implement a coordinated set of strategies that reduce or allocate the waste loads entering them assuming the water demands of the water consumption sectors of the watershed are proportional to the permitted pollutant emissions the permitted pollutant emissions can be calculated as 11 t t j d t j d t e t where tt j is the permitted pollutant emissions allocated to water consumer j during time period t 104 t dt j is the water demand of water consumer j during time period t 104 m3 and dt and et are the total water demands 104 m3 and the pollutant holding capacities of the water bodies in the watershed 104 t respectively pollutant holding capacity provides complete protection at the watershed scale the relationships between pollution sources and water quality conditions in the waterbody are complex therefore the water quality standard is a fixed value but the flow in the waterbody and the carrying capacity fluctuate the application of pollutant holding capacity is more complex and requires additional analysis tools to calculate point and nps emissions and to determine the allowable maximum loads for the receiving waterbody and the associations between the pollution source emissions and water quality in the receiving waterbody chen et al 2016 a flowchart for determining pollutant holding capacity is shown in fig 5 pollutant holding capacity has been used widely to assess chemical oxygen demand cod phosphorous p and nitrogen n concentrations in rivers and reservoirs the methodology has been proposed for researching pollutant emission permissions in river systems using the decision support system dss for the graph model for conflict resolution ii gmcrii multi criteria decision making mcdm analysis and the multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm saberi niksokhan 2017 3 1 3 profits of water consumption

is the permitted pollutant emissions of water consumer j in the i th water consumption sector 104 t to highlight key factors and for simplicity only the roles of water quantity and the beneficial coefficient of water consumption on the allocation of profits among different water consumer associations were considered in this context water resources were allocated to each water consumer in the watershed the total profits that result from reasonable water resources allocation based on the mean profit of production sectors are estimated as 14 t benefit j s b j j s c 1 c j a cj b cj y ajc y

obtain the maximum achievable economic benefits with limited water watershed managers need to continuously improve water use economic benefit efficiency therefore the lower level objective function is the maximization of the economic benefit efficiency within each subarea 3 2 pes related to cgs taking sustainability as a constraint we built a multi objective water allocation programming model that addressed efficiency and equity integrating equity efficiency and ecology for yongding river water allocation was considered to establish an optimization model furthermore the cg method was used to trade off efficiency and equity many multidisciplinary journals have presented game theory in greater detail each presented game theory in a way that provided enough information to better understand how it can be used for these types of problems jiang and hellegers 2016 kyriazi et al 2017 shi et al 2016 to solve a cg due to its complexity and the abundant decision variations in decision models optimization algorithms such as the nucleolus and weak nucleolus theories and genetic algorithms have been applied 3 2 1 cg theory young 1994 reported that cg theory provides the necessary instruments for analysing situations in which there is a sharing mechanism that is considered efficient equal and just by all users in the literature many cost allocation problems have been analysed using cg principles but the approaches varied significantly in the different research fields cg principles have also been applied in studies related to water resources hilton and culver 2000 the participants

calculated by 17 φ i v i t n s 1 n s n v j t s j e j v j t i s j e j when calculating the shapley value the amount of water consumption is integrated with the economic profit from water consumption the water consumers in the watershed were divided into four sectors according to the features of the damaged aquatic ecosystems in the watershed water shortage serious water pollution and poor water quality 1 upstream agriculture 2 upstream industry 3 upstream ecological fields and 4 downstream agriculture during the re allocation of water resources and net profits based on the shapley value the profits of different water consumers were re allocated according to the characteristic function of the water consumer association as shown in fig 4 in the figure i 1 2 3 and 4 indicate the amounts of

sustainability is used as a constraint in water resources allocation economic benefit is the main focus of the existing multi objective programming literature roozbahani et al 2015 wang et al 2008 this study which is based on empirical data demonstrates that the adoption of an actual model leads to greater efficiency in the distribution of profits among water users the process of water resources and net profit allocations based on ambiguous information associations is affected by the number of water consumers and the characteristic function the water allocation function is expressed as 18 x s i 1 3 pr i s a i s and 19 v s b s x s x s c s b s c s x s c s where a i is the amount of water resources re allocated to water consumer i during the second stage 104 m3 c s is the upper limit of ambiguous information association s 104 m3 x s is the water consumption of association s 104 m3 pr i s is the probability of the participation of water consumer i in the association b s is the net profit coefficient per unit water of association s and s 1 2 and 3 represent the associations of the upstream agricultural water consumers downstream agricultural water consumers and upstream industrial water consumers respectively since 2008 there has been an increasing interest in wfa water footprint assessment for understanding corporate water sustainability water risk and water stewardship hoekstra 2013 the goal of the game is to allocate among the players the cost of the most efficient coalition as defined in previous paragraphs that will allow water demand satisfaction sechi et al 2013a b the adopted game solution should guarantee an acceptable cost allocation considering the particular characteristics of the water system fig 6 cg theory is applied to resolve the conflict between different water users the evaluation of the cg core of solutions represents the set of admissible cost allocations and supplies the boundary values for each player the efficiencies of different cgs for apportioning costs of water supply development projects were compared by young et al 1982 inside the core each allocation satisfies the marginality and rationality principles and the stakeholders should recognize equity and fairness to realize the cost distribution in joint pes and water allocation projects coppola and szidarovszky 2004 designed a two person conflicting game to analyse the optimal tradeoff between water supply and contamination risk lewandowski 1979 used a game theoretic approach to model the behaviour of water users in a quality control problem and van der veeren and tol 2003 applied game theory to solve water allocation and pollution problems of transboundary rivers including an inter country river 4 results and discussion 4 1 water quantity optimization the nucleolus and weak nucleolus theories of cgs were used to re allocate the total profits and agricultural water rights of different participants in the association the upper and lower limits of the profits of the water consumption sectors in the upper reaches of the watersheds were obtained based on an analysis of the long term consecutive data tables 3 and 4 in table 3 l indicates the lower limit and u indicates the upper limit water user associations 1 2 3 and 4 correspond to the area upstream of the cetian reservoir on the yongding river in datong city shanxi province the section from the cetian reservoir on the yongding river to sanjiadian in datong city shanxi province the section from the cetian reservoir of the yongding river to sanjiadian in zhangjiakou city and the area upstream of the cetian reservoir on the yongding river in shuozhou city shanxi province the long term water consumption data obtained from the water consumption sectors from 1978 to 2013 are presented in table 4 in this paper the arable land areas for different computing units in the study area were calculated based on the land utilization map in the study area using the gis statistical analysis function water resources were re allocated based on the planting areas of different crops to maximize water consumer profits optimal agricultural water demand table 5 was calculated using nucleolus theory according to social equity mechanisms as based on the nucleolus theory cg and under the current development mode the water demand in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed is characterized by the following parameters the upper limit of the amount of water in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed was 112 mm3 the lower limit was 102 mm3 and the mean value was 107 mm3 the total water demand of shanxi and hebei provinces in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed was 41 mm3 which was 66 mm3 lower than the equilibrium status to facilitate the uniform allocation of water utilization profit during the linearization process it was assumed that the percentage of agricultural water utilization profit was the same as that in the study area and that water flow under the equilibrium status was 113 mm3 the water quantity and quality in the upper reaches of the yongding river can meet the agricultural demand for water by using water saving and water recycling technologies 66 mm3 of water has been saved the water flow in the upper reaches of the yongding river watershed reached 128 mm3 in 2013 according to the rule that the beneficiary provides the payment beijing which is located in the downstream area of the yongding river watershed should pay the upstream for incoming water resources this es payment standard is based on the economic profits of agricultural water use which is the product of agricultural water consumption in the downstream area and the difference between the economic profits from agricultural water pes in the upstream and downstream areas the upstream and downstream payment water prices were 0 68 m3 and 0 34 m3 respectively therefore beijing should provide the exchange rate between the us dollar and the yuan was assumed to be 6 19 yuan per us dollar usd 6 31 m 39 03 m in payments to the upstream area including usd 3 52 m 21 73 m for hebei province and usd 2 79 m 17 3 m for shanxi province according to the characteristics of the cg consumers act to improve water utilization efficiency in the early stage of consumer participation in the association and water consumers with high water utilization profits are allowed to obtain residual water resources beyond their initial water rights based on the integrated coordinated development of the watershed the water consumers with high water utilization profits should pay those with low water utilization profits in addition based on the relationships between the initial water right allocations for the downstream and upstream areas of the watershed the water resources allocated to water user sectors 1 2 3 and 4 were 431 mm3 133 mm3 6 mm3 and 8 mm3 considering only surface water respectively in 2013 water allocation between the upper and lower reaches is related to regional development patterns depends on the different water quality levels and shows a certain degree of imbalance to facilitate the re allocation process of water resources and economic profits according to eqs 18 and 19 b i b i and c i c i were used table 6 to calculate the allocation of water resources and economic profits in the ambiguous information game based on calculations of economic profit per unit of water and amounts of disposable water resources determined from a water type analysis of the water consumers a summary of the regional water consumption and the economic profits of different sectors when water consumption sectors participate in ambiguous information associations greater profits even greater the profit allocation predicted by the shapley value of definite information can be obtained from the same amount of water resources therefore in this case reasonable water resources allocation is important for determining the payment relationships between the upper and lower reaches in accordance with the calculation method presented in this paper the amount of water resources allocated to water consumers will be lower than the initial amount of water allocation water consumers can obtain higher profits based on the perspectives of equity and comprehensive profits than under disordered competition status in the cg of the three water consumer associations of the upstream water utilization sectors the corresponding relationships between the final amount of water and the shapley value were 0 5 3 9 and 32 m3 the amounts of water resources in sectors 1 2 and 3 were 59 mm3 20 mm3 and 6 mm3 respectively and the total water demand was 85 mm3 considering social equity the downstream areas should pay the upstream areas according to the water flow at the boundary section because the water resources that flow from the upstream to downstream areas of the yongding river watershed were obtained by considering es and water saving efficacy in the upstream area thus the amount of pes was usd 6 31 m 39 03 m water allocation payment intensity varies regionally because of the strong relationships among the intensities of conflicts regional economic activities and relative abundances of water resources rivera et al 2016 the pes associated with different risk levels of constraint violation were obtained which can help reveal the relationship between the economic objective and water related es protection 4 2 water quality optimization in the yongding river watershed many chemical substances are emitted into the river from anthropogenic sources to protect water quality in the yongding river watershed the pes calculation includes water quality requirements for improving the watershed s environment cg theory has been utilized for fair treatment cost reallocation in a water quality management programme manshadi et al 2015 defining treatment levels using optimal pollutant emission permissions would indicate that water quality standards have been maintained along the river or at specified control points in the final allocation of water resources we used pollutant discharge treatment trade off curves fig 7 to calculate the cost of pes based on the pollutant treatment level the fuzzy risk of a pollutant exceeding a pollution emission permission can be obtained then according to the cost fuzzy risk trade off curve the pes cost to control water pollution is established the trade off curves between the objectives were developed using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii which is powerful and developed multi objective genetic algorithm technique niksokhan et al 2009 nsga ii can be used to consider the minimal pollution loads needed to realize the smallest wastewater treatment cost the objective functions are related to pes cost and a fuzzy risk of violating water quality standards to reduce pollutant treatment costs pollution dischargers can participate in cooperative pollutant discharge permit trading the pay off between pollutant dischargers and environmental protectors is obtained using a two person nonzero sum game for this paper a cg theoretic nucleolus game was utilized to equitably allocate the total cost reduction to dischargers and calculate pes in the non dominated yongding river watershed the fuzzy risk of violating the water quality standards was 0 4 and the pollutant treatment level was 40 we acquired a total restoration cost of 160 m yuan by applying fig 7 stakeholders in the yongding river watershed have indicated that they are willing to pay approximately 5570 yuan t for environmental improvements as mentioned earlier the amount of water discharged in the yongding river was 4 50 107 m3 in shanxi province 83 mm3 in hebei province and 41 3 mm3 in beijing city in 2013 therefore beijing should pay usd 6 31 m 39 03 m as a pes to the upstream area to improve the water environment the value of the final pes allocation is reasonable miyun reservoir is the main drinking water source for beijing providing 73 3 of the total domestic water supply the input by local residents for water source protection was 33 96 m per year xu et al 2015 water eco services in mentougou have suffered damages valued at usd 5 54 m bai et al 2011 therefore the pes allocation could provide decision making references for promoting the coordinated development of the beijing shanxi hebei region 5 conclusions based on social equity the optimal water demand of the upper reaches of the yongding river was calculated using interval values the water quality in the upper reaches of the yongding river is very poor and the water is mainly used for agricultural irrigation according to the nucleolus theory cg 128 mm3 of water flowed to shanxi section and hebei from the upstream reaches of the yongding river in 2013 thus beijing should pay usd 6 31 m 39 03 m as a pes to the upstream area for the costs and losses due to the downstream water supply the management of water resources allocation pes is a complicated issue due to the increased use and demand prevailing today the approach proposed here serves as a methodological basis for considering the fundamental aspects of water related es sustainability when applied to water management the pes for sustainable water use grows quickly in both civil society and watersheds but the poor state of transformation relationships between water allocation and es regarding their direct and indirect water use implies that there is still a long way to go before we can expect that water related pes can effectively contribute to making water allocations more sustainable acknowledgements the study was financially supported by the national key research

study of its application in québec canada the results of the québec study demonstrate the applicability of the pmb framework for initiating and designing participatory model building processes and analyzing barriers towards institutionalization keywords water management participatory modeling stakeholder participation systems thinking policy analysis process design 1 introduction water legislation such as the u s clean water act the québec water policy and the european water framework directive emphasize the need for integrated and participatory approaches for the sustainable management of water resources participatory modeling has been found to be a useful methodology to support stakeholder involvement and integrated analysis of water resources issues e g pahl wostl et al 2007 serrat capdevila et al 2011 inam et al 2015 stakeholders can be an individual or group who can indirectly or directly affect or be affected by an issue or a topic of interest glicken 2000 such as a water quality issue by building a model stakeholders can express their points of view learn about other perspectives and examine factual knowledge and subjective perceptions pahl wostl 2007 the construction of simulation models allows for the testing of assumptions and thereby supports learning about the system dörner 1996 sterman 2000 there are profound barriers to the implementation of participatory modeling in water resources management first the initiation of participatory modeling processes is often hampered due to the limited modeling and facilitation skills of practitioners e g water agencies hare 2011 and the widespread perception that stakeholder involvement is a time consuming and costly process while the benefits remain obscure morrison 2003 winz et al 2009 hare 2011 second context specific design of participatory modeling processes is a challenging task and requires methodological development to adapt the process to physical environmental socio economic and institutional circumstances hatzilacou et al 2007 winz et al 2009 metcalf et al 2010 besides a context specific customization an explicit process design also allows for a rigorous monitoring and evaluation of participatory modeling processes by specifying process steps and intended outcomes see jones et al 2009 carr et al 2012 third participatory modeling processes are often constrained to short and mid term interventions during research projects led by modeling experts voinov and bousquet 2010 even though significant improvement of water issues usually requires long term engagement pahl wostl et al 2007 thus approaches are needed that support an analysis of requirements for long term participatory modeling processes which involve envisioning of supportive institutional structures and mechanisms for capacity building this paper proposes a participatory model building pmb framework that addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing an innovative stepwise approach for the initiation design and institutionalization of participatory modeling processes the methodological framework consists of five successive stages 1 problem framing and stakeholder analysis 2 process design 3 individual modeling 4 group model building and 5 institutionalized participatory modeling the pmb framework combines context sensitive process design stages one and two a focus on process initiation through a low threshold modeling approach stage three a high compatibility with quantitative modeling approaches in stage four and an analysis of requirements for institutionalized participatory modeling stage five the structure of the paper is as follows first the methodological foundations of the pmb framework are introduced including the management and transition framework mtf as well as conceptual participatory modeling second the five steps of the pmb framework and their links to other participatory modeling frameworks are presented third a case study in québec canada on water quality management is provided in which the application of the pmb framework is tested and assessed our experiences from the case study in québec and further participatory modeling processes in ontario canada cyprus guatemala and pakistan are discussed before we conclude with suggestions for future research 2 methodological background the mtf and conceptual participatory modeling are the methodological foundations of the pmb framework the mtf is used for problem and stakeholder analysis stage one context sensitive process design stage two and analysis of requirements for institutionalized participatory modeling stage five conceptual modeling is used to initiate participatory modeling processes stage three and ensure a high compatibility with quantitative modeling approaches stage four 2 1 management and transition framework the mtf was developed by pahl wostl et al pahl wostl et al 2010 knieper et al 2010 pahl wostl 2015 knüppe and knieper 2016 as a diagnostic tool for water resources governance and management problems the mtf is based upon the three conceptual pillars of adaptive management e g holling 1978 social learning and transformation processes pahl wostl et al 2007 as well as the institutional analysis and development framework ostrom 2005 key concepts and their relationships are specified through a class diagram that defines the general structure of a water system fig 1 a each class e g technical infrastructure or actor is characterized by certain attributes that allow for a detailed description of case specific conditions for instance actors can be characterized by sectors and the spatial scale at which they typically operate relational databases are used to support formalization and standardization of data collection and representation knieper et al 2010 the overarching problem boundaries are given by the water system which comprises all environmental and human components fig 1a the ecological system class comprises abiotic and biotic components of the water system which provide different services for human activities the societal system embeds multiple action arenas which are issue specific political arenas focused on a societal function such as flood protection or water supply and characterized by strategic management goals actors and action situations an action situation is a key concept of the mtf that allows for the analysis of the water management process and is defined as a structured social interaction context that leads to specific outcomes see fig 1b results of an action situation can be for example institutions or knowledge which can affect social interactions in other action situations or direct physical interventions in the system such as implementation of infrastructure or distribution of water to different uses thus the mtf is able to specify a the overall structure of the water system which forms the context in which management processes take place fig 1a as well as b water management processes as a sequence of action situations including influencing factors and outputs fig 1b as depicted in fig 1a the mtf has a number of other classes e g institution knowledge role which are explained in detail in pahl wostl et al 2010 and pahl wostl 2015 the application of the mtf as a diagnostic ex post analysis tool has been extended in the pmb framework towards a planning ex ante analysis tool see sections 3 2 and 3 5 for a detailed explanation the mtf allows for the systematic examination and graphical representation of the process steps as well as interactions between context and process which includes the definition of action situations participating actors and aspired outcomes halbe et al 2013 in addition to its application for problem diagnosis and process design the mtf is also applied for the analysis of requirements for institutionalizing participatory modeling here institutionalization is understood as cognitive normative and regulative structures and activities that provide stability and meaning to social behavior scott 1995 p 33 the institutionalization of the participatory model building process comprises the development of the capacity of stakeholders e g water agencies to continue the participatory modeling process in the long term i e cognitive activities such as the development of modeling skills awareness raising for the relevance of stakeholder involvement in civic professional and political networks i e normative activities such as curriculum or guideline development and the establishment of formal rules to organize the process and specify its mandate i e regulative activities structures such as mechanisms for conflict resolution and implementation 2 2 conceptual participatory modeling participatory modeling involves the engagement of stakeholders in the modeling process which can be accomplished in various forms ranging from direct participation in model construction to consultation on model validity and testing of a completed simulation model hare 2011 beall and ford 2010 define three continuums that illustrate the diversity in participatory environmental modeling 1 the hands on continuum that ranges from models built by experts with some input of participants to joint problem mapping with participants 2 the problem definition to solution producing continuum that points to the complexity that is addressed in the modeling process ranging from well defined problems and options for solutions to poorly defined messy problems and 3 the quantitative to qualitative data continuum that expresses the various types of data that is relevant for a specific problem and thus needs to be included in the model ranging from hard quantitative data e g water quality indicators to soft qualitative data requirements e g environmental awareness various participatory modeling frameworks exist that propose specific process steps and combinations of qualitative and quantitative modeling methods voinov and bousquet 2010 provide an overview of different stakeholder based modeling frameworks and criticize the proliferation of participatory modeling frameworks which in many cases only differ slightly major differences among existing participatory modeling frameworks relate to the modeling methods included such as agent based modeling e g gurung et al 2006 or system dynamics modeling e g langsdale et al 2006 for example companion modeling is a well known participatory modeling framework that integrates the application of role playing games and agent based models e g barreteau et al 2003 gurung et al 2006 campo et al 2010 system dynamics is applied in various modeling frameworks including group model building vennix 1996 mediated modeling van den belt 2004 and shared vision planning palmer et al 2013 conceptual modeling is an important step in any model building process gupta et al 2012 and is particularly suitable for the initiation of participatory modeling processes inam et al 2015 in contrast to quantitative models conceptual models describe system elements and their interactions in a verbal or pictorial form often without rigorously specifying the relationships between system elements gupta et al 2012 in this respect systems thinking using causal loop diagrams clds allows for user friendly and participatory conceptual modeling mirchi et al 2012 in clds elements of the system are connected by arrows and together form causal chains for an example see fig 4 a positive link indicates the parallel behavior of variables in the case of an increase in the causing variable the variable that is affected also increases while a decrease in the causing variable implies a decrease in the affected variable a negative link indicates an inverse relation between variables feedback loops are a further central concept in systems thinking two different feedback loops exist that can be detected in clds the self correcting balancing loop uneven number of negative links within the loop and the self amplifying reinforcing loop even number of negative links sterman 2000 causal loop diagrams built by individuals or groups represent individual or collective cognitive maps regarding a problem e g water pollution or flooding such a cognitive map can provide the basis for any type of advanced modeling van kouwen et al 2008 p 1143 such as system dynamics simulation models e g langsdale et al 2006 agent based models e g scholz 2016 bayesian networks e g giordano et al 2013 or fuzzy cognitive maps e g gray et al 2014 see section 3 4 for more details the choice for a specific modeling method or framework should be based on the purpose of the modeling process which can be decision support social learning or model improvement hare 2011 various context factors can furthermore influence method selection and process design such as the availability of data the level of conflict or the size of the stakeholder group beall and ford 2010 beall king and thornton 2016 the coupling of stakeholder built models with expert models such as sahysmod inam et al 2017a b or in combination with other tools such as spreadsheet software lorie and cardwell 2006 or individual audience response technologies beall king and thornton 2016 constitute further options to tailor the participatory process to case specific demands opportunities and constraints there is also an increasing relevance of social media and web applications in participatory modeling that allow for new contexts and scales of stakeholder participation voinov et al 2016 the pmb framework developed in the current study focuses on conceptual modeling using clds to provide a low threshold approach to systematically engage stakeholders see section 3 3 for a detailed description of the modeling approach in addition the pmb framework allows for compatibility with other participatory modeling frameworks that use quantitative modeling and further engagement tools see section 3 4 3 participatory model building pmb framework the pmb framework has been iteratively developed and applied in several study sites over six years by our research team several of our publications previously focused on specific parts of the framework such as individual interviews halbe 2009 halbe et al 2014 inam et al 2015 process design and analysis of institutional structures halbe et al 2013 halbe 2016 as well as quantitative modeling using system dynamics halbe 2009 inam 2016 inam et al 2017a b the framework was applied in several case studies including cyprus water scarcity management halbe 2009 halbe et al 2015a pakistan soil salinity management inam et al 2015 2017a b guatemala food security malard et al 2015 ontario canada sustainable agriculture halbe et al 2014 and québec canada water quality management halbe and adamowski 2011 while individual modeling was found to be sufficient in the cyprus case study stakeholders in the québec and guatemala cases explicitly requested a group modeling process as a result of their positive experiences with individual modeling this inspired the development and testing of the group model building stage stage four in the pmb framework the cyprus and québec case studies furthermore underlined the importance of process design to consider potential linkages between the participatory process and formal water management both cases also showed several barriers towards a long term continuation of the process such as the availability of modeling skills and financial resources which required structural changes in the water governance framework this experience resulted in the usage of the mtf as an integrated planning and analysis tool in the process design stage stage two and inclusion of the institutionalized participatory modeling stage stage five in the framework the different stages of the pmb framework are presented in fig 2 stakeholders such as water managers can test qualitative participatory model building in the exploratory phase stages one to three even in the context of limited funding time and expertise and decide after these practical experiences whether a continuation of the process is useful for the specific problem situation more resource intensive quantitative participatory modeling approaches can be applied in stage four which allows the pmb framework to be highly compatible with other modeling frameworks such as mediated modeling shared vision planning or group model building institutionalized participation requires that water authorities e g water boards watershed organizations are able to organize and implement participatory processes independently from external process facilitation experts in the long term in stage five the pmb framework therefore offers a methodology for detecting barriers to participatory management and envisioning pathways towards capacity building in water agencies and institutional change for the realization of collaborative water management the five stages of the proposed pmb framework are described in detail below 3 1 stage one problem and stakeholder analysis in stage one of the pmb framework the mtf is used as a diagnostic tool that supports a systematic collection and analysis of information for the development of a preliminary problem definition and selection of key stakeholders all available data and information regarding the water system structure is added to the mtf database by the process organizers such as attributes of the water system e g basin area average annual discharge population density and technical infrastructure e g scale ownership state of maintenance the evolution of the water issue is defined through a sequence of action situations in the mtf see section 2 1 actors involved in the history of the water issue should be included in the database as well as information on their roles e g decision maker expert and sectoral affiliation e g agriculture water supply in this first stage the main sources of information are the scientific literature dealing with the problem and other documents that reflect the opinions and interests involved e g newspaper articles reports from interest groups in addition informal interviews with experts and other stakeholders can provide first impressions regarding hidden conflicts and perspectives based upon data and information from the problem analysis stakeholders relevant to finding a solution to the water issue are selected the mtf allows for the specification of several stakeholder attributes such as their associated spatial unit e g local regional national interest in the resource issue and perceived urgency different methods of stakeholder analysis exist e g reed et al 2009 stanghellini 2010 that can be applied based upon the data in the mtf halbe 2009 and inam et al 2015 proposed a systematic stakeholder analysis approach that is applied in stage one of the pmb framework first stakeholders are sorted according to their roles such as decision makers users implementers executives and experts suppliers european commission 2003 to examine any gaps in the composition second stakeholders are prioritized using three attributes power to influence the process legitimacy to influence and the perceived urgency for action in order to detect those stakeholder groups that are of critical importance for an effective stakeholder process mitchell et al 1997 3 2 stage two process design transparent process design a relatively young field of research von korff et al 2010 forrest and wiek 2014 is another important step in participatory modeling as it can prevent possible negative effects of stakeholder involvement such as stakeholder disillusionment barreteau et al 2010 lopsided decisions and increased conflict and wasted resources von korff et al 2010 by clearly defining process steps and expected outcomes in advance process design can be guided by conceptual and methodological frameworks that define key processes and mechanisms in participatory processes e g rowe and frewer 2005 barreteau et al 2010 criteria for effective participatory modeling processes e g rouwette et al 2002 rowe and frewer 2000 and principles based upon experience from practice e g von korff et al 2010 argent et al 2016 consideration of the context in the design of participatory processes is a critical factor carr et al 2012 as institutional socio economic or environmental context factors can influence the outcome forrest and wiek 2014 point to the need for analytical evaluative frameworks to identify context sensitive success factors for societal transitions towards sustainability the mtf is such a framework which has been widely applied to analyze the embedment of water management processes in case specific contexts e g sendzimir et al 2010 schlüter et al 2010 knüppe and pahl wostl 2012 process representation through action situations see fig 1b section 2 1 is used for historical analysis of the water management processes in stage one and the same scheme is used to plan for the organization of a future participatory process in stage two thus each step in the participatory process is defined by an action situation e g contacting potential stakeholders organization of individual interviews and related influencing factors and expected results halbe et al 2013 the analysis of the historical process completed in stage one can be used to define possible influential factors from past management efforts e g a piece of legislation as well as potential ways in which the participatory process can induce change in the water system e g have a positive impact on water quality the process planning approach using sequences of action situations allows for inclusion of stakeholders e g water agencies in the design process through a graphical representation of the process evolution over time see halbe et al 2013 halbe 2016 the identification of consecutive process steps allows for the definition of specific and practical process indicators which can point to resource management outcomes e g improved water quality or reduction of conflict between water users intermediary outcomes e g trust or knowledge or process quality indicators e g legitimacy of participants carr et al 2012 the continuous comparison of expected process results to actual experienced results stimulates a questioning of the applicability and suitability of the methods applied as well as underlying theories if expectations are not met process organizers have to rethink their understanding of the system and based upon this revise the organization of the participatory process e g through the application of new methods and tools thus the application of the mtf constitutes an important step towards effective participatory process design and evaluation see halbe and ruutu 2015 3 3 stage three individual modeling the building of individual clds by each key stakeholder constitutes the third stage of the proposed pmb framework compared to the group modeling of stage four individual interviews usually require minimal resources i e only the travel costs of the facilitators and provide an opportunity for stakeholders to express their points of view more freely due to a personal atmosphere i e only the interviewee and facilitators meet and the absence of potential influence from other stakeholders i e facilitators take a neutral position three steps are proposed for the individual modeling stage of the pmb framework halbe 2009 inam et al 2015 in the first step facilitators visit each stakeholder that was identified in stage one each stakeholder builds their cld independently by choosing variables and drawing causal linkages the facilitator provides only methodological support without influencing the content of the model variables are written on sticky notes that are put on a large sheet of paper and causal linkages are drawn in by the stakeholders see example model in fig 4 the individual modeling process begins with a discussion of the preliminary problem definition and the identification of the causes of the defined problem as well as the polarity of causal links the consequences of the problem are then studied and the interviewee is encouraged to find feedback loops vennix 1996 finally solution strategies are added to the model as well as barriers towards their implementation in summary this approach encourages the structured construction of a holistic system that represents the participant s mental model of the status quo as well as preferred strategies and implementation barriers due to its structured nature the system thinking approach allows for the comparison of clds as all participants follow the same methodology e g schaffernicht and groesser 2011 the analysis of the causal structures furthermore supports a deep understanding of the causes consequences and possible intervention points sterman 2000 in the second step individual clds are merged into an overall cld by the facilitator to provide a holistic picture of the water issues based on the different mental models of the stakeholders conflicts and diverging points of views are elicited by comparing and merging clds built by individual stakeholders see inam et al 2015 for more details on comparing and merging clds the clds from different stakeholders may consist of redundant complementary or oppositional elements oppositional system representations should be highlighted e g by an exclamation mark since these aspects may create potential conflicts between stakeholder groups halbe et al 2015a if complementary system elements are available the merging of these aspects will result in a more detailed model structure inam et al 2015 to avoid the preparation of an unwieldy merged model with a large number of variable names and crossing causal links it can be useful to develop thematic models thematic models are clearly arranged sub models that represent the collective viewpoint on a certain topic such as environmental or socio economic aspects see appendix a for examples of thematic models merging individual clds can be a challenging task as interviewees may use different words for the same concept may refer to different concepts with the same words or use concepts that overlap but do not match exactly halbe et al 2015a p 6 thus some interpretation is needed to develop a comprehensive overall cld model and subdivide it into thematic models in the end the merged model should be regarded as a preliminary group model that includes diverging stakeholder perspectives such a model can allow water authorities to see the potential benefits of group model building processes that will be organized in stage four of the pmb framework in the third step the presentation of the merged cld model to the participants aims at supporting a learning process as stakeholders examine different perspectives and ideas a workbook can be designed that includes the merged model and a questionnaire to ask for stakeholder opinions regarding the merged model halbe 2009 see appendix b for a workbook designed for the québec case study based upon the experiences and findings in stages one to three water managers and other stakeholders can decide whether investment in more intensive stakeholder involvement stage four is sufficiently promising to address the case specific water issues 3 4 stage four group model building the group model building stage of the pmb framework involves the organization of group workshops in which stakeholders meet face to face such personal interactions are critical for effective social learning processes pahl wostl 2007 and require professional conflict mediation skills van den belt 2004 compared to the individual modeling of stage three group processes usually require substantial resources for renting an appropriate meeting place supplementary material catering and travel of stakeholders in an acute problem situation stakeholders might have a high motivation to participate and might bring in some of their own resources stakeholders with a low interest in a change of the status quo might however refuse to make an effort the limited motivation of some stakeholders is particularly problematic for the organization of multiple workshops which can result in low attendance and discontinuity e g videira et al 2009 burgin et al 2013 conceptual modeling helps to develop a common understanding of how a system works and thus supports communication and learning between modelers decision makers and other stakeholders e g liu et al 2008 serrat capdevila et al 2011 the conceptual group modeling process builds upon the results of stage three stakeholders have gained experience in the application of conceptual modeling i e clds and the preliminary comprehensive model i e the merged model provides an indication of the scope of the issue potential conflicts alternative problem perspectives and solution strategies the actual conceptual group modeling process can begin rapidly as stakeholders are already acquainted with the method through the construction of individual clds the merged model and the results of the questionnaires can function as an entry point for discussion the group has to decide whether to use or revise the merged model that was built in the previous stages or whether to start from scratch i e a new model is jointly developed by the group from the beginning vennix 1996 quantitative participatory modeling can further build upon the conceptual modeling efforts proposed in the pmb framework and provide insights into complex system dynamics and potential solution strategies quantitative modeling involves the specifications of equations and model parametrization based upon available data and information various quantitative modeling methods exist that allow for stakeholder involvement each having different application contexts and requirements such as expertise of stakeholders and the facilitators time requirements and the nature of the problem e g lack of knowledge or conflicting interests the most frequently used participatory modeling methods are system dynamics and agent based modeling fuzzy cognitive mapping and bayesian networks voinov and bousquet 2010 quantitative system dynamics modeling requires the conversion of the group built cld into a stock and flow diagram to which parameters and equations are subsequently added vennix 1996 sterman 2000 van den belt 2004 for an agent based modeling approach the individual and group built clds can be interpreted as individual and collective mental models and thus can support the design of agents etienne et al 2011 scholz 2016 fuzzy cognitive mapping allows for assessing the plausibility of cognitive maps and generating scenarios e g van vliet et al 2010 jetter and kok 2014 causal loop diagrams can also be used in the design of qualitative and quantitative bayesian networks van kouwen et al 2008 giordano et al 2013 the modeling process usually proceeds in an iterative manner for example findings from quantitative analyses can necessitate a revision of the group built cld in all model stages the outcomes and proceedings of the model building need to be documented in a transparent way in order to inform non participating stakeholders for example through reports or action plans 3 5 stage five institutionalized participatory modeling while project oriented and short term group model building research has yielded remarkable outcomes see rouwette et al 2002 there has been little implementation of long term participatory processes voinov and bousquet 2010 even though overcoming barriers towards stakeholder involvement and implementing adaptive management requires long term engagement e g hatzilacou et al 2007 camacho et al 2010 allen and gunderson 2011 to adapt the strategies values and institutions to current challenges and achieve social learning pahl wostl et al 2007 social learning requires informal discourse in which water management problems are discussed and the stakeholder group strives to develop the capacity to solve problems collectively pahl wostl et al 2007 this does not imply consensus but at least the ability to deal constructively with controversial perspectives these informal learning processes need to be linked to formal policy making in order to effectively facilitate new routines or practices sendzimir et al 2010 such linkages might be a formal mandate for participatory processes legal obligations that result from participatory processes representation of stakeholders in committees or clearly defined governmental involvement in stakeholder processes with respect to participatory model building water agencies can function as a link between formal water management and informal learning processes water agencies e g water boards or watershed organizations are often located at the interface between policy development and implementation where close collaboration with stakeholder groups is particularly important to function as such a link water agencies require adequate funds skills and mandates to ensure long term financing and organization of collaborative management processes the mtf is applied as an analytical tool in the institutionalized participatory modeling stage of the proposed pmb framework stage five the analysis of institutionalization requirements includes financial instruments dissemination of information and knowledge as well as the roles of stakeholders in the learning process and rules for decision making for example a facilitator may be required for the group discussion and to elicit knowledge and insights from stakeholders in addition a process coach can examine the group internal social processes and provide skills for mediation of conflicts richardson and andersen 1995 importance can also be attributed to emergent leadership which may be essential for facilitating the implementation of solution strategies e g möllenkamp et al 2008 the ex ante analysis is based upon previously gathered information about systemic barriers and drivers of institutionalization from the problem diagnosis in stage 1 as well as individual interviews and group processes in stages 3 and 4 further expert interviews can be conducted as well specific process steps towards institutionalized participatory modeling are defined in the form of action situations that aims at overcoming an institutionalization barrier e g lack of modeling skills or support a driver e g existing cooperation between stakeholders again each action situation is further specified by expected influencing factors aspired outcomes see section 3 3 as well as stakeholders that need to be involved a pathway towards institutionalized participatory modeling is developed by linking action situations through time this pathway can provide orientation to stakeholders in their efforts to achieve transformative change and long term continuation of the process by identifying suitable measures to develop skills and capacities the pathway should be revised in case new barriers drivers or implementation challenges e g stakeholders who refuse to cooperate are identified 4 application of the pmb framework in québec the research team explored the use of the pmb framework in the du chêne watershed in québec in cooperation with the local watershed organization l organisme de bassins versants de la zone du chêne obv du chêne the obv du chêne is located in southern québec canada about 40 km south of québec city and manages one of the 40 priority integrated watershed management zones in the province the obv du chêne was formed in 2007 through a joint effort of the union of agricultural producers and the municipalité régionale de comté mrc lotbinière the du chêne is the major watershed in the zone du chêne and along with a number of smaller adjacent watersheds directly discharges into the saint lawrence river the du chêne watershed covers 800 km2 with intensive agricultural and forestry production which has resulted in pollution problems and soil erosion the participatory process started in 2010 with a meeting of mcgill researchers and the obv staff to consider the participatory modeling process as a potentially useful tool to improve relations between stakeholders in the du chêne watershed and to learn about different perspectives of the causes consequences and solutions regarding the water quality problem in the watershed 4 1 problem framing and stakeholder analysis stage one the problem and stakeholder analysis was accomplished in close cooperation with the obv du chêne at the beginning of the participatory modeling process a thorough literature review and interviews with staff of the du chêne watershed organization were conducted the obv du chêne determined that the major issue in the watershed was declining water quality mainly due to eutrophication and chemical contamination the sources of water pollution were thought to originate from the agriculture forestry and municipal sectors however the exact pathways and quantities were unclear and further research was required to identify solution strategies the research project adopted this initial problem frame from the obv du chêne as it was broad enough to motivate many stakeholders to participate in addition this broad problem definition was expected to include different more specific problem perspectives from other stakeholders available information was included in a mtf database to analyze the complexity of the water quality issue and associated stakeholders in an integrated and systematic manner the problem analysis started in 1960 to consider long term impacts from the agricultural municipal and forestry sectors the level of detail of the problem analysis increased with time due to greater information and data e g systematic monitoring of water quality data in the du chêne watershed was not started until 2005 important historical events for water quality management include the programme d assainissement des eaux du québec paeq initiated in 1978 by the provincial government to foster water treatment in the municipal and industrial sectors as well as improved manure practices in agriculture gravel 2006 the règlement sur les exploitations agricoles rea implemented in 2002 includes important regulations regarding diffuse pollution from agriculture including the development of fertilizer management plans and the limitation of agricultural expansion in degraded watersheds before the new québec water policy in 2002 local and regional county municipalities were responsible for enforcing environmental law and managing rivers and adjacent areas the québec water policy introduced a participatory integrated watershed based management approach beginning in 2002 watershed agencies were formed at local and regional levels to develop and implement a master plan for water to comply with priorities guidelines regulations and legislation at the national provincial and municipal levels plans have to be submitted for evaluation and approval by the minister of state for the environment and water the watershed organizations are composed of representatives of stakeholder groups comprising citizens elected officials of municipalities or regional county municipalities and water user representatives such as the agricultural or industrial sectors provincial government representatives act as facilitators and provide scientific and technical support but do not have voting or decision rights baril et al 2005 watershed based management is synchronized at the provincial levels through a general reference framework established by the ministère du développement durable de l environnement et des parcs mddep 2002 the le regroupement des organismes de bassins versants du québec robvq represents local watershed agencies i e obvs and is another central actor that fosters integration of local water management in québec thus the obvs are embedded in a multi level water governance framework due to the central importance of the obvs the du chêne watershed was chosen as an appropriate boundary for the participatory process the board of directors of the obv du chêne aims to represent all water related stakeholders in the zone du chêne through the analysis of stakeholder roles attributes and dynamics it was determined that crucial participants were the staff of the obv du chêne and representatives from the agriculture municipal forestry tourism environmental and civil society sectors the analysis of stakeholder dynamics highlighted the possibility of future participation by representatives of the industrial sectors in particular the shale gas industry was emerging as a new stakeholder in the watershed at that time due to exploratory drilling activities however the development of the industry was stopped in 2013 through a moratorium by the provincial government that prohibits drilling fracturing and injective testing in the area obv du chêne 2014a 4 2 process design stage two during the preparatory meeting the staff of the obv du chêne emphasized the importance of linking the participatory modeling process to the formal water management framework in québec a tangible outcome was expected from the participatory process to support the obv du chêne in fulfilling their formal obligations e g develop a master plan for water foster knowledge dissemination and raise awareness the outcomes from each step in the participatory modeling process and its linkage to the formal mandate of the obv du chêne were thus discussed in detail by the research team and the staff of the obv fig 3 shows a simplified conceptualization of the modeling process blue elements and the formal water management process white elements in the du chêne watershed the obv du chêne was established in 2007 on the basis of the québec water policy by 2010 knowledge regarding water quality and other attributes of the watershed was gathered and a technical committee was formed consisting of all major stakeholder groups agriculture economic municipal and civic sectors from 2010 to 2014 a participatory analysis of the basin was conducted by the staff of the obv to produce a portrait obv du chêne 2014a and a diagnostic report obv du chêne 2014b of the watershed based on these findings the watershed organization defined specific problems and objectives obv du chêne 2014c this work resulted in a master plan for the watershed specifying concrete actions and responsibilities obv du chêne 2014d the participatory modeling process entered the official water management process at different points in time the involvement of the researchers started in 2010 with a preparatory meeting in which a cld was constructed with the obv staff the members of the obv du chêne learned about the method and decided to initiate an individual modeling process in october 2010 the low time and resource requirements of the individual modeling stage allowed water managers to commit to the process since separate funds for the testing of new facilitation methods were not available the outcomes of this process were intended to be a collection of individual clds developed by each stakeholder and a merged overall cld of all perspectives as described in section 3 3 the individual modeling process was aimed at improving contacts and communication between the watershed organization and stakeholders to support the participatory analysis of the basin based on positive experiences with the individual modeling stage the watershed organization decided to proceed towards the group model building stage to support group discussions in an upcoming stakeholder meeting see section 3 4 thus the development of a group model was planned to improve the understanding of problems in the watershed and allow staff and stakeholders of the obv to gain new methodological knowledge in a next step the development of a quantitative system dynamics model was discussed with the staff of the obv based upon the previously developed individual and group built clds a system dynamics model was considered helpful to test different solution strategies for the water quality problem e g alternative farming methods planting of riparian vegetation under varying conditions e g changing precipitation patterns due to climate change population dynamics which could inform the choice of objectives and the preparation and revision of the watershed master plan as the pathways of nutrients and suspended solids are a central concern in the watershed a model coupling approach was discussed that would dynamically couple a physically based model i e the swat model to the group built system dynamics model in order to assess the effects of policies e g on soil erosion in detail see inam 2016 and inam et al 2017a b for more details on this model coupling approach the application of the mtf was considered to be useful for process design and evaluation the analysis of the linkages of the modeling process demonstrated how the participatory process fed into the formal decision making process see fig 3 and thereby helped to fulfill the formal mandate of the obv this assisted staff members in clearly communicating the purpose of the process to stakeholders and government agencies 4 3 individual modeling stage three individual models were built in eight stakeholder interviews the stakeholders were visited by two facilitators i e one staff member and one researcher at their home or office to minimize efforts required by stakeholders such as time requirements for traveling the choice for interviewees represented the composition of the du chêne watershed organization and included two representatives of civil society an environmental ngo and a citizen s group three representatives from different municipalities and three representatives from the economic sector tourism agriculture and forestry these stakeholders brought a broad range of expertise to the participatory process including training in environmental management biology ecology and economics clds were built by each interviewee individually while methodological support was jointly provided by two staff members of the du chêne watershed organization and one of the authors the staff members received training through a two hour preparatory meeting in which the systems thinking method was presented and an individual cld built the stakeholder interviews took approximately 1 5 h each and the entire individual interview process was accomplished in three days according to the guideline in section 3 3 i e problem causes consequences feedbacks solutions barriers the construction of the individual stakeholder clds began with the definition of the problem variable all participants agreed that water quality was the major problem in the du chêne watershed while emissions from agriculture and municipal sectors were seen as causes by all participants the role of forestry was not seen uniformly by stakeholders i e a number of models did not include impacts from forestry the main suggested impacts from agriculture stemmed from soil erosion and the use of pesticides and fertilizers that entered the river through the agricultural drainage system river dredging and drainage systems were also seen as having major impacts on water quality by some stakeholders as they increase the velocity of river flow and disturb natural filtration processes the impact of the municipal sector was related to deficient wastewater infrastructure in urban areas and septic tanks at isolated residences emissions from the road network were also seen as a relevant source of emissions by some participants forestry contributed to the water quality issue through deforestation which caused higher water temperatures and soil erosion natural emissions e g from wetlands were mentioned as an important factor by some stakeholders participants considered the consequences of the water quality issue on the environment e g aquatic flora and fauna tourism and recreation e g swimming and fishing and potable water supply e g higher treatment costs several reinforcing feedback loops were identified see appendix b for example in the case of a declining standard of living in the du chêne watershed this would be expected to lower the willingness of citizens to protect the aquatic environment as socio economic issues become a priority as a consequence water quality could deteriorate and the standard of living might be reduced even more balancing feedback loops to improve water quality included solutions proposed by stakeholders such as stricter legislation and implementation of regulations e g rea installment of riparian vegetation strips reforestation investment in wastewater infrastructure and education campaigns for example a farmer proposed more hands on measures such as placing stones in the riverbed to reduce erosion while representatives from the municipalities included more policy oriented approaches such as application of the environmental quality act responsibilities for the implementation of these measures were seen on a broad societal scale including provincial ministries municipal administration obvs agriculture clubs foresters and civic society barriers were related to the costs of solution strategies and a lack of environmental consciousness by several stakeholder groups the outcomes of these individual model building sessions consisted of a number of multi faceted clds the participants were generally satisfied with their models and believed that they reflected their point of view in a comprehensive way fig 4 presents a translated cld model upper part of fig 4 developed by a stakeholder during a 1 5 h interview and which was later digitized by the facilitators using the vensim software lower part of fig 4 the model in fig 4 shows the perceived causes and consequences of the water quality problem in the du chêne watershed as well as preferred solution strategies and implementation barriers from the perspective of a single stakeholder apart from the treatment loop all feedback loops include the variable education and sensibilization see appendix a for a detailed description of all loops there are various balancing feedback processes that include solution strategies that are expected to balance the water quality problem e g new cultural practices implementation of environmental regulations or natural conservation two implementation barriers point to limited resources and opposition of stakeholders from the agricultural sector in fig 4 only one reinforcing feedback loop is included which refers to loads of organic environments such as wetlands that contribute to natural emissions of organic materials in summary the cld depicts the stakeholder s mental model of the water quality issue including environmental e g wetlands forest cover economic e g financial resources technical e g sewage treatment septic tanks and social e g education sensitization aspects subsequent to the individual interviews a merged model from all stakeholder built clds and a related workbook were prepared by one of the authors see appendix a in the workbook the merged model was presented successively by using thematic models each highlighting a specific thematic aspect of the overall model erosion and deforestation problems water pollution and economic impacts impacts of water quality on tourism and quality of life these models are not independent from each other and it was underlined that the three models are intertwined and only presented in this way for clarity the staff members of the obv du chêne decided to directly enter the involvement phase stages four and five of the pmb without sending the workbook out to stakeholders nevertheless the workbook demonstrated the ability of the method to provide an integrated picture of the water quality issues in the watershed 4 4 group model building stage four based upon the positive experiences and the methodological knowledge that was acquired a group modeling exercise was integrated into a regular meeting of the obv du chêne the group exercise was attended by ten stakeholders who represented all sectors involved in the water quality issue two researchers supported the staff members to structure the group exercise instead of discussing the general problem of water quality the group decided to concentrate on the more focused problem of soil erosion as they perceived it to be the major reason for water quality problems in the du chêne watershed the discussion of causes and consequences of soil erosion confirmed the diversity in stakeholder perceptions that had been revealed through the individual modeling process the group exercise took approximately 1 5 h and helped to clarify differing definitions of terms and levels of abstraction with respect to causes and consequences each model variable was discussed by the group and only added to the model if all participants agreed upon its meaning and validity this approach resulted in a structured and in depth discussion the model building process was considerably slower than the individual model building given all the discussion however this provided the stakeholders with a unique opportunity to discuss points of contention in a productive way learn about the perspectives of others and discover the interconnected system structure of soil erosion and its link to water quality as considerable time was needed to clarify stakeholder contributions to the discussion the resulting model fig 5 contains a lower number of variables and connections than the individual models cf fig 4 the process of detailed explanation and rephrasing of statements is an important step towards social learning the obv du chêne was satisfied with the group process as the modeling exercise was the first time that stakeholders had discussed water issues in the du chêne watershed in an active manner despite previous repeated attempts of staff members to stimulate an open discussion stakeholder meetings had merely been one way information meetings the structured modeling process helped the stakeholders to discuss the causes and consequences of poor water quality including socio economic technical and environmental aspects the modeling process was evaluated through a questionnaire that was handed out to all participants all respondents agreed that the group model building method supported discussion and development of a deeper understanding of the water quality issue in the du chêne watershed the majority of participants suggested that the group modeling process continue in the future in order to explore the soil erosion problem and other issues related to soil erosion and water quality in more depth in addition some respondents explicitly asked that the pmb process move towards quantification of the model and subsequent scenario analysis criticism was mainly related to the differing involvement of participants i e some participants chose to contribute more to the discussion than others a continuation of the participatory modeling process could address these demands by offering more time for discussion and additional opportunities for participants to express their points of view following the group model building process the development of a quantitative system dynamics model based upon the qualitative models from the individual and group model building process was planned in a follow up meeting of mcgill researchers and obv staff due to the prioritization of the soil erosion problem the model was intended to initially focus on the simulation of erosion pathways and the effectiveness of measures such as the improvement of riparian vegetation strips the simulation model was expected to help the obv in selecting management actions to improve water quality in the du chêne watershed therefore a model coupling approach was designed to dynamically couple the system dynamics model addressing socio economic aspects of the water quality issue to a swat model simulating physical and environmental processes cf inam 2016 inam et al 2017a b however missing streamflow data for the du chêne created a barrier to quantitative modeling the installation of streamflow gauging stations in the watershed is an example of a long term measure which requires substantial investment such broader requirements for systemic change towards participatory and sustainable water management further examples are the development of facilitation skills or the implementation of new legal frameworks and funding structures are prevalent in water resources management practice this motivated the development of stage five of the pmb framework which allows for the systematic analysis of long term solution strategies and opportunities for institutionalized participatory modeling 4 5 institutionalized participatory modeling stage five up to this point the participatory modeling process was jointly facilitated by the research group and staff members from the obv du chêne throughout the process the staff members were included as much as possible in the application of the participatory methods to develop their capacity to independently continue the process legislative conditions for the initiation of the participatory modeling process are supportive given that the obvs have flexibility in their choice of approaches for stakeholder participation however several challenges for the long term continuation and institutionalization of the modeling process were revealed during the participatory process including the availability of modeling skills financial resources decision making power broader experiences in participatory modeling and a coherent water governance framework fig 6 shows a simplified pathway to overcome the detected barriers of long term participatory modeling processes in the du chêne watershed this is explained in more detail below first while qualitative system analysis with the help of clds turned out to be quite intuitive the development of a quantitative system dynamics model requires significant modeling skills obv staff would need further training in modeling to autonomously continue the process in the future long term cooperation between universities as1 in the region and obvs is a promising approach to ensure methodological support and modeling skill development second the long term involvement of scientists in the process as well as the establishment of a streamflow gauging network in the du chêne requires financial resources and decision making power as2 until now the obvs have not had sufficient funding for a strategic partnership with universities but mainly depended upon resources from stakeholders e g municipalities this lack of funding and dependence upon the goodwill of stakeholders influences the obv s ability to implement measures and strategies laid down in their master plans robvq 2013 ccd 2013 medema et al 2015 third there is further potential for improvement of water management in québec as3 for instance an action plan for water has been requested by the sustainable development commissioner from the ministère du développement durable de l environnement et des parcs and the robvq that involves all governmental agencies and supplements water master plans in the watershed robvq 2013 ccd 2013 another request by the sustainable development commissioner and the robvq relates to a management framework that specifies responsibilities between different entities of the water system including obvs ministers and municipalities ccd 2013 such a framework would support vertical integration i e across management levels as well as horizontal integration i e across sectors such as water management and land planning within the water governance system in québec finally the initiation of further participatory modeling processes in québec is needed as4 for experience to be acquired and the potential of participatory model building to be demonstrated to a wider audience i e other obvs the robvq and provincial ministries as participatory modeling is increasingly applied in research and teaching at universities in québec e g at mcgill university see halbe et al 2015b more students scientists and practitioners have the required methodological expertise that is necessary for a broader application of participatory modeling approaches 5 discussion the case study in québec demonstrates the usefulness of the pmb framework for initiating participatory modeling processes in unfavorable contexts i e limited time financial resources and methodological knowledge while the time requirements for the researcher were considerable about 3 4 months for problem and stakeholder analysis and individual modeling the time requirements for other stakeholders such as the du chêne watershed organization about 3 4 weeks of involvement and interviewees about 1 1 5 h each were lower the extensive involvement of a researcher was needed to test evaluate and refine the new pmb framework in the future we anticipate that stages one to three of the pmb framework can be accomplished with less involvement of researchers through the preparation of a website that contains guidance documents and further case study examples the results of the exploratory phase in the case study comprise a systematic analysis of stakeholder perspectives on the water quality issue and the development of a holistic system understanding which were explicitly mentioned in an official report of the watershed organization obv du chêne 2014b the study revealed that further research and action is needed on economic and institutional aspects of the problem e g effective policies to foster reforestation as well as streamflow monitoring in the watershed to allow for more detailed analyses of emission pathways besides these more problem related outcomes the modeling process significantly improved the discussion process and relationships between stakeholders without the exploratory stakeholder participation phase of the pmb framework stages one to three it is likely that participatory modeling would not have been applied in the case study due to minimal funding time and expertise stakeholders were not aware of participatory modeling even though participatory water management was desired the pmb framework is thus a promising approach to support the widespread initiation and application of the participatory modeling method in water management practice watershed agencies can test the appropriateness of participatory modeling step by step during the exploratory phase of the pmb framework and decide from the insights gained whether more intensive involvement is appropriate in the specific case study the pmb framework needs to be used in an iterative way to deal with the complexity of water resources issues for example findings from individual interviews stage three can require a revision of the initial problem and stakeholder analysis stage one and process design stage two the use of the mtf for process design stage three allows for a systematic analysis of the participatory process and its context such a systematic process design supports process monitoring and assessment and based upon this an iterative adaptation of the process design to challenges and opportunities such as a change in stakeholder composition or funding options more systemic case specific challenges of stakeholder participation and requirements of institutionalized participatory modeling are addressed in stage five of the pmb framework of course the use of the mtf alone does not dissolve barriers to institutionalized participatory modeling such as inadequate funds or limited capacities however analyzing requirements for institutionalizing participatory modeling allows for a more strategic stakeholder selection stage one and process design stage two for instance by including stakeholders who can support capacity building or even act as process facilitators in the long term in addition the mtf can be used to systematically compare and to facilitate the exchange of experiences between cases knieper et al 2010 pahl wostl et al 2012 for example regarding barriers and drivers of participatory processes e g sendzimir et al 2010 schlüter et al 2010 and to help envision a more supportive institutional structure for participation e g halbe et al 2013 in this way challenges that were faced during the participatory modeling process can point to the need for broader changes in water governance systems further research is needed to gather more case specific data on barriers and drivers of participatory modeling processes as well as systematically reviewing and synthesizing such context specific factors into general findings 6 conclusions the proposed participatory model building pmb framework addresses the challenges of initiating designing and institutionalizing participatory model building processes in water resources management to date participatory modeling has resulted in promising outcomes under favorable contexts e g available funds such as research projects but widespread implementation is limited given the unfavorable contexts which often exist in practice e g insufficient time financial resources and facilitation skills the pmb framework provides a stepwise approach for water managers to move towards stakeholder involvement and integrated water resources planning and management starting with approaches that require little investment of finances and time as well as low levels of mediation skills stages one to three water managers and agencies can obtain insights on the need and applicability of a participatory approach in the event of positive experiences the process can proceed to the involvement stage stages four and five where stakeholders meet and discuss the causes and consequences of a water resources problem as well as policies and strategies for its solution the pmb framework highlights the importance of capacity building in the water sector to allow for independent implementation of participatory model building processes which is an important requirement for institutionalized participation case specific requirements for continuous and effective collaborative management processes can be analyzed using the management and transition framework mtf an analytical tool that allows for the integrated analysis and planning of water management processes the proposed pmb framework was tested in multiple case studies in canada québec and ontario cyprus pakistan and guatemala the results from the case study in québec were presented in detail in this paper and highlight the heterogeneity of stakeholder perspectives which in turn underlines the need for participatory and

7583,multiple barriers constrain the widespread application of participatory methods in water management including the more technical focus of most water agencies additional cost and time requirements for stakeholder involvement as well as institutional structures that impede collaborative management this paper presents a stepwise methodological framework that addresses the challenges of context sensitive initiation design and institutionalization of participatory modeling processes the methodological framework consists of five successive stages 1 problem framing and stakeholder analysis 2 process design 3 individual modeling 4 group model building and 5 institutionalized participatory modeling the management and transition framework is used for problem diagnosis stage one context sensitive process design stage two and analysis of requirements for the institutionalization of participatory water management stage five conceptual modeling is used to initiate participatory modeling processes stage three and ensure a high compatibility with quantitative modeling approaches stage four this paper describes the proposed participatory model building pmb framework and provides a case study of its application in québec canada the results of the québec study demonstrate the applicability of the pmb framework for initiating and designing participatory model building processes and analyzing barriers towards institutionalization keywords water management participatory modeling stakeholder participation systems thinking policy analysis process design 1 introduction water legislation such as the u s clean water act the québec water policy and the european water framework directive emphasize the need for integrated and participatory approaches for the sustainable management of water resources participatory modeling has been found to be a useful methodology to support stakeholder involvement and integrated analysis of water resources issues e g pahl wostl et al 2007 serrat capdevila et al 2011 inam et al 2015 stakeholders can be an individual or group who can indirectly or directly affect or be affected by an issue or a topic of interest glicken 2000 such as a water quality issue by building a model stakeholders can express their points of view learn about other perspectives and examine factual knowledge and subjective perceptions pahl wostl 2007 the construction of simulation models allows for the testing of assumptions and thereby supports learning about the system dörner 1996 sterman 2000 there are profound barriers to the implementation of participatory modeling in water resources management first the initiation of participatory modeling processes is often hampered due to the limited modeling and facilitation skills of practitioners e g water agencies hare 2011 and the widespread perception that stakeholder involvement is a time consuming and costly process while the benefits remain obscure morrison 2003 winz et al 2009 hare 2011 second context specific design of participatory modeling processes is a challenging task and requires methodological development to adapt the process to physical environmental socio economic and institutional circumstances hatzilacou et al 2007 winz et al 2009 metcalf et al 2010 besides a context specific customization an explicit process design also allows for a rigorous monitoring and evaluation of participatory modeling processes by specifying process steps and intended outcomes see jones et al 2009 carr et al 2012 third participatory modeling processes are often constrained to short and mid term interventions during research projects led by modeling experts voinov and bousquet 2010 even though significant improvement of water issues usually requires long term engagement pahl wostl et al 2007 thus approaches are needed that support an analysis of requirements for long term participatory modeling processes which involve envisioning of supportive institutional structures and mechanisms for capacity building this paper proposes a participatory model building pmb framework that addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing an innovative stepwise approach for the initiation design and institutionalization of participatory modeling processes the methodological framework consists of five successive stages 1 problem framing and stakeholder analysis 2 process design 3 individual modeling 4 group model building and 5 institutionalized participatory modeling the pmb framework combines context sensitive process design stages one and two a focus on process initiation through a low threshold modeling approach stage three a high compatibility with quantitative modeling approaches in stage four and an analysis of requirements for institutionalized participatory modeling stage five the structure of the paper is as follows first the methodological foundations of the pmb framework are introduced including the management and transition framework mtf as well as conceptual participatory modeling second the five steps of the pmb framework and their links to other participatory modeling frameworks are presented third a case study in québec canada on water quality management is provided in which the application of the pmb framework is tested and assessed our experiences from the case study in québec and further participatory modeling processes in ontario canada cyprus guatemala and pakistan are discussed before we conclude with suggestions for future research 2 methodological background the mtf and conceptual participatory modeling are the methodological foundations of the pmb framework the mtf is used for problem and stakeholder analysis stage one context sensitive process design stage two and analysis of requirements for institutionalized participatory modeling stage five conceptual modeling is used to initiate participatory modeling processes stage three and ensure a high compatibility with quantitative modeling approaches stage four 2 1 management and transition framework the mtf was developed by pahl wostl et al pahl wostl et al 2010 knieper et al 2010 pahl wostl 2015 knüppe and knieper 2016 as a diagnostic tool for water resources governance and management problems the mtf is based upon the three conceptual pillars of adaptive management e g holling 1978 social learning and transformation processes pahl wostl et al 2007 as well as the institutional analysis and development framework ostrom 2005 key concepts and their relationships are specified through a class diagram that defines the general structure of a water system fig 1 a each class e g technical infrastructure or actor is characterized by certain attributes that allow for a detailed description of case specific conditions for instance actors can be characterized by sectors and the spatial scale at which they typically operate relational databases are used to support formalization and standardization of data collection and representation knieper et al 2010 the overarching problem boundaries are given by the water system which comprises all environmental and human components fig 1a the ecological system class comprises abiotic and biotic components of the water system which provide different services for human activities the societal system embeds multiple action arenas which are issue specific political arenas focused on a societal function such as flood protection or water supply and characterized by strategic management goals actors and action situations an action situation is a key concept of the mtf that allows for the analysis of the water management process and is defined as a structured social interaction context that leads to specific outcomes see fig 1b results of an action situation can be for example institutions or knowledge which can affect social interactions in other action situations or direct physical interventions in the system such as implementation of infrastructure or distribution of water to different uses thus the mtf is able to specify a the overall structure of the water system which forms the context in which management processes take place fig 1a as well as b water management processes as a sequence of action situations including influencing factors and outputs fig 1b as depicted in fig 1a the mtf has a number of other classes e g institution knowledge role which are explained in detail in pahl wostl et al 2010 and pahl wostl 2015 the application of the mtf as a diagnostic ex post analysis tool has been extended in the pmb framework towards a planning ex ante analysis tool see sections 3 2 and 3 5 for a detailed explanation the mtf allows for the systematic examination and graphical representation of the process steps as well as interactions between context and process which includes the definition of action situations participating actors and aspired outcomes halbe et al 2013 in addition to its application for problem diagnosis and process design the mtf is also applied for the analysis of requirements for institutionalizing participatory modeling here institutionalization is understood as cognitive normative and regulative structures and activities that provide stability and meaning to social behavior scott 1995 p 33 the institutionalization of the participatory model building process comprises the development of the capacity of stakeholders e g water agencies to continue the participatory modeling process in the long term i e cognitive activities such as the development of modeling skills awareness raising for the relevance of stakeholder involvement in civic professional and political networks i e normative activities such as curriculum or guideline development and the establishment of formal rules to organize the process and specify its mandate i e regulative activities structures such as mechanisms for conflict resolution and implementation 2 2 conceptual participatory modeling participatory modeling involves the engagement of stakeholders in the modeling process which can be accomplished in various forms ranging from direct participation in model construction to consultation on model validity and testing of a completed simulation model hare 2011 beall and ford 2010 define three continuums that illustrate the diversity in participatory environmental modeling 1 the hands on continuum that ranges from models built by experts with some input of participants to joint problem mapping with participants 2 the problem definition to solution producing continuum that points to the complexity that is addressed in the modeling process ranging from well defined problems and options for solutions to poorly defined messy problems and 3 the quantitative to qualitative data continuum that expresses the various types of data that is relevant for a specific problem and thus needs to be included in the model ranging from hard quantitative data e g water quality indicators to soft qualitative data requirements e g environmental awareness various participatory modeling frameworks exist that propose specific process steps and combinations of qualitative and quantitative modeling methods voinov and bousquet 2010 provide an overview of different stakeholder based modeling frameworks and criticize the proliferation of participatory modeling frameworks which in many cases only differ slightly major differences among existing participatory modeling frameworks relate to the modeling methods included such as agent based modeling e g gurung et al 2006 or system dynamics modeling e g langsdale et al 2006 for example companion modeling is a well known participatory modeling framework that integrates the application of role playing games and agent based models e g barreteau et al 2003 gurung et al 2006 campo et al 2010 system dynamics is applied in various modeling frameworks including group model building vennix 1996 mediated modeling van den belt 2004 and shared vision planning palmer et al 2013 conceptual modeling is an important step in any model building process gupta et al 2012 and is particularly suitable for the initiation of participatory modeling processes inam et al 2015 in contrast to quantitative models conceptual models describe system elements and their interactions in a verbal or pictorial form often without rigorously specifying the relationships between system elements gupta et al 2012 in this respect systems thinking using causal loop diagrams clds allows for user friendly and participatory conceptual modeling mirchi et al 2012 in clds elements of the system are connected by arrows and together form causal chains for an example see fig 4 a positive link indicates the parallel behavior of variables in the case of an increase in the causing variable the variable that is affected also increases while a decrease in the causing variable implies a decrease in the affected variable a negative link indicates an inverse relation between variables feedback loops are a further central concept in systems thinking two different feedback loops exist that can be detected in clds the self correcting balancing loop uneven number of negative links within the loop and the self amplifying reinforcing loop even number of negative links sterman 2000 causal loop diagrams built by individuals or groups represent individual or collective cognitive maps regarding a problem e g water pollution or flooding such a cognitive map can provide the basis for any type of advanced modeling van kouwen et al 2008 p 1143 such as system dynamics simulation models e g langsdale et al 2006 agent based models e g scholz 2016 bayesian networks e g giordano et al 2013 or fuzzy cognitive maps e g gray et al 2014 see section 3 4 for more details the choice for a specific modeling method or framework should be based on the purpose of the modeling process which can be decision support social learning or model improvement hare 2011 various context factors can furthermore influence method selection and process design such as the availability of data the level of conflict or the size of the stakeholder group beall and ford 2010 beall king and thornton 2016 the coupling of stakeholder built models with expert models such as sahysmod inam et al 2017a b or in combination with other tools such as spreadsheet software lorie and cardwell 2006 or individual audience response technologies beall king and thornton 2016 constitute further options to tailor the participatory process to case specific demands opportunities and constraints there is also an increasing relevance of social media and web applications in participatory modeling that allow for new contexts and scales of stakeholder participation voinov et al 2016 the pmb framework developed in the current study focuses on conceptual modeling using clds to provide a low threshold approach to systematically engage stakeholders see section 3 3 for a detailed description of the modeling approach in addition the pmb framework allows for compatibility with other participatory modeling frameworks that use quantitative modeling and further engagement tools see section 3 4 3 participatory model building pmb framework the pmb framework has been iteratively developed and applied in several study sites over six years by our research team several of our publications previously focused on specific parts of the framework such as individual interviews halbe 2009 halbe et al 2014 inam et al 2015 process design and analysis of institutional structures halbe et al 2013 halbe 2016 as well as quantitative modeling using system dynamics halbe 2009 inam 2016 inam et al 2017a b the framework was applied in several case studies including cyprus water scarcity management halbe 2009 halbe et al 2015a pakistan soil salinity management inam et al 2015 2017a b guatemala food security malard et al 2015 ontario canada sustainable agriculture halbe et al 2014 and québec canada water quality management halbe and adamowski 2011 while individual modeling was found to be sufficient in the cyprus case study stakeholders in the québec and guatemala cases explicitly requested a group modeling process as a result of their positive experiences with individual modeling this inspired the development and testing of the group model building stage stage four in the pmb framework the cyprus and québec case studies furthermore underlined the importance of process design to consider potential linkages between the participatory process and formal water management both cases also showed several barriers towards a long term continuation of the process such as the availability of modeling skills and financial resources which required structural changes in the water governance framework this experience resulted in the usage of the mtf as an integrated planning and analysis tool in the process design stage stage two and inclusion of the institutionalized participatory modeling stage stage five in the framework the different stages of the pmb framework are presented in fig 2 stakeholders such as water managers can test qualitative participatory model building in the exploratory phase stages one to three even in the context of limited funding time and expertise and decide after these practical experiences whether a continuation of the process is useful for the specific problem situation more resource intensive quantitative participatory modeling approaches can be applied in stage four which allows the pmb framework to be highly compatible with other modeling frameworks such as mediated modeling shared vision planning or group model building institutionalized participation requires that water authorities e g water boards watershed organizations are able to organize and implement participatory processes independently from external process facilitation experts in the long term in stage five the pmb framework therefore offers a methodology for detecting barriers to participatory management and envisioning pathways towards capacity building in water agencies and institutional change for the realization of collaborative water management the five stages of the proposed pmb framework are described in detail below 3 1 stage one problem and stakeholder analysis in stage one of the pmb framework the mtf is used as a diagnostic tool that supports a systematic collection and analysis of information for the development of a preliminary problem definition and selection of key stakeholders all available data and information regarding the water system structure is added to the mtf database by the process organizers such as attributes of the water system e g basin area average annual discharge population density and technical infrastructure e g scale ownership state of maintenance the evolution of the water issue is defined through a sequence of action situations in the mtf see section 2 1 actors involved in the history of the water issue should be included in the database as well as information on their roles e g decision maker expert and sectoral affiliation e g agriculture water supply in this first stage the main sources of information are the scientific literature dealing with the problem and other documents that reflect the opinions and interests involved e g newspaper articles reports from interest groups in addition informal interviews with experts and other stakeholders can provide first impressions regarding hidden conflicts and perspectives based upon data and information from the problem analysis stakeholders relevant to finding a solution to the water issue are selected the mtf allows for the specification of several stakeholder attributes such as their associated spatial unit e g local regional national interest in the resource issue and perceived urgency different methods of stakeholder analysis exist e g reed et al 2009 stanghellini 2010 that can be applied based upon the data in the mtf halbe 2009 and inam et al 2015 proposed a systematic stakeholder analysis approach that is applied in stage one of the pmb framework first stakeholders are sorted according to their roles such as decision makers users implementers executives and experts suppliers european commission 2003 to examine any gaps in the composition second stakeholders are prioritized using three attributes power to influence the process legitimacy to influence and the perceived urgency for action in order to detect those stakeholder groups that are of critical importance for an effective stakeholder process mitchell et al 1997 3 2 stage two process design transparent process design a relatively young field of research von korff et al 2010 forrest and wiek 2014 is another important step in participatory modeling as it can prevent possible negative effects of stakeholder involvement such as stakeholder disillusionment barreteau et al 2010 lopsided decisions and increased conflict and wasted resources von korff et al 2010 by clearly defining process steps and expected outcomes in advance process design can be guided by conceptual and methodological frameworks that define key processes and mechanisms in participatory processes e g rowe and frewer 2005 barreteau et al 2010 criteria for effective participatory modeling processes e g rouwette et al 2002 rowe and frewer 2000 and principles based upon experience from practice e g von korff et al 2010 argent et al 2016 consideration of the context in the design of participatory processes is a critical factor carr et al 2012 as institutional socio economic or environmental context factors can influence the outcome forrest and wiek 2014 point to the need for analytical evaluative frameworks to identify context sensitive success factors for societal transitions towards sustainability the mtf is such a framework which has been widely applied to analyze the embedment of water management processes in case specific contexts e g sendzimir et al 2010 schlüter et al 2010 knüppe and pahl wostl 2012 process representation through action situations see fig 1b section 2 1 is used for historical analysis of the water management processes in stage one and the same scheme is used to plan for the organization of a future participatory process in stage two thus each step in the participatory process is defined by an action situation e g contacting potential stakeholders organization of individual interviews and related influencing factors and expected results halbe et al 2013 the analysis of the historical process completed in stage one can be used to define possible influential factors from past management efforts e g a piece of legislation as well as potential ways in which the participatory process can induce change in the water system e g have a positive impact on water quality the process planning approach using sequences of action situations allows for inclusion of stakeholders e g water agencies in the design process through a graphical representation of the process evolution over time see halbe et al 2013 halbe 2016 the identification of consecutive process steps allows for the definition of specific and practical process indicators which can point to resource management outcomes e g improved water quality or reduction of conflict between water users intermediary outcomes e g trust or knowledge or process quality indicators e g legitimacy of participants carr et al 2012 the continuous comparison of expected process results to actual experienced results stimulates a questioning of the applicability and suitability of the methods applied as well as underlying theories if expectations are not met process organizers have to rethink their understanding of the system and based upon this revise the organization of the participatory process e g through the application of new methods and tools thus the application of the mtf constitutes an important step towards effective participatory process design and evaluation see halbe and ruutu 2015 3 3 stage three individual modeling the building of individual clds by each key stakeholder constitutes the third stage of the proposed pmb framework compared to the group modeling of stage four individual interviews usually require minimal resources i e only the travel costs of the facilitators and provide an opportunity for stakeholders to express their points of view more freely due to a personal atmosphere i e only the interviewee and facilitators meet and the absence of potential influence from other stakeholders i e facilitators take a neutral position three steps are proposed for the individual modeling stage of the pmb framework halbe 2009 inam et al 2015 in the first step facilitators visit each stakeholder that was identified in stage one each stakeholder builds their cld independently by choosing variables and drawing causal linkages the facilitator provides only methodological support without influencing the content of the model variables are written on sticky notes that are put on a large sheet of paper and causal linkages are drawn in by the stakeholders see example model in fig 4 the individual modeling process begins with a discussion of the preliminary problem definition and the identification of the causes of the defined problem as well as the polarity of causal links the consequences of the problem are then studied and the interviewee is encouraged to find feedback loops vennix 1996 finally solution strategies are added to the model as well as barriers towards their implementation in summary this approach encourages the structured construction of a holistic system that represents the participant s mental model of the status quo as well as preferred strategies and implementation barriers due to its structured nature the system thinking approach allows for the comparison of clds as all participants follow the same methodology e g schaffernicht and groesser 2011 the analysis of the causal structures furthermore supports a deep understanding of the causes consequences and possible intervention points sterman 2000 in the second step individual clds are merged into an overall cld by the facilitator to provide a holistic picture of the water issues based on the different mental models of the stakeholders conflicts and diverging points of views are elicited by comparing and merging clds built by individual stakeholders see inam et al 2015 for more details on comparing and merging clds the clds from different stakeholders may consist of redundant complementary or oppositional elements oppositional system representations should be highlighted e g by an exclamation mark since these aspects may create potential conflicts between stakeholder groups halbe et al 2015a if complementary system elements are available the merging of these aspects will result in a more detailed model structure inam et al 2015 to avoid the preparation of an unwieldy merged model with a large number of variable names and crossing causal links it can be useful to develop thematic models thematic models are clearly arranged sub models that represent the collective viewpoint on a certain topic such as environmental or socio economic aspects see appendix a for examples of thematic models merging individual clds can be a challenging task as interviewees may use different words for the same concept may refer to different concepts with the same words or use concepts that overlap but do not match exactly halbe et al 2015a p 6 thus some interpretation is needed to develop a comprehensive overall cld model and subdivide it into thematic models in the end the merged model should be regarded as a preliminary group model that includes diverging stakeholder perspectives such a model can allow water authorities to see the potential benefits of group model building processes that will be organized in stage four of the pmb framework in the third step the presentation of the merged cld model to the participants aims at supporting a learning process as stakeholders examine different perspectives and ideas a workbook can be designed that includes the merged model and a questionnaire to ask for stakeholder opinions regarding the merged model halbe 2009 see appendix b for a workbook designed for the québec case study based upon the experiences and findings in stages one to three water managers and other stakeholders can decide whether investment in more intensive stakeholder involvement stage four is sufficiently promising to address the case specific water issues 3 4 stage four group model building the group model building stage of the pmb framework involves the organization of group workshops in which stakeholders meet face to face such personal interactions are critical for effective social learning processes pahl wostl 2007 and require professional conflict mediation skills van den belt 2004 compared to the individual modeling of stage three group processes usually require substantial resources for renting an appropriate meeting place supplementary material catering and travel of stakeholders in an acute problem situation stakeholders might have a high motivation to participate and might bring in some of their own resources stakeholders with a low interest in a change of the status quo might however refuse to make an effort the limited motivation of some stakeholders is particularly problematic for the organization of multiple workshops which can result in low attendance and discontinuity e g videira et al 2009 burgin et al 2013 conceptual modeling helps to develop a common understanding of how a system works and thus supports communication and learning between modelers decision makers and other stakeholders e g liu et al 2008 serrat capdevila et al 2011 the conceptual group modeling process builds upon the results of stage three stakeholders have gained experience in the application of conceptual modeling i e clds and the preliminary comprehensive model i e the merged model provides an indication of the scope of the issue potential conflicts alternative problem perspectives and solution strategies the actual conceptual group modeling process can begin rapidly as stakeholders are already acquainted with the method through the construction of individual clds the merged model and the results of the questionnaires can function as an entry point for discussion the group has to decide whether to use or revise the merged model that was built in the previous stages or whether to start from scratch i e a new model is jointly developed by the group from the beginning vennix 1996 quantitative participatory modeling can further build upon the conceptual modeling efforts proposed in the pmb framework and provide insights into complex system dynamics and potential solution strategies quantitative modeling involves the specifications of equations and model parametrization based upon available data and information various quantitative modeling methods exist that allow for stakeholder involvement each having different application contexts and requirements such as expertise of stakeholders and the facilitators time requirements and the nature of the problem e g lack of knowledge or conflicting interests the most frequently used participatory modeling methods are system dynamics and agent based modeling fuzzy cognitive mapping and bayesian networks voinov and bousquet 2010 quantitative system dynamics modeling requires the conversion of the group built cld into a stock and flow diagram to which parameters and equations are subsequently added vennix 1996 sterman 2000 van den belt 2004 for an agent based modeling approach the individual and group built clds can be interpreted as individual and collective mental models and thus can support the design of agents etienne et al 2011 scholz 2016 fuzzy cognitive mapping allows for assessing the plausibility of cognitive maps and generating scenarios e g van vliet et al 2010 jetter and kok 2014 causal loop diagrams can also be used in the design of qualitative and quantitative bayesian networks van kouwen et al 2008 giordano et al 2013 the modeling process usually proceeds in an iterative manner for example findings from quantitative analyses can necessitate a revision of the group built cld in all model stages the outcomes and proceedings of the model building need to be documented in a transparent way in order to inform non participating stakeholders for example through reports or action plans 3 5 stage five institutionalized participatory modeling while project oriented and short term group model building research has yielded remarkable outcomes see rouwette et al 2002 there has been little implementation of long term participatory processes voinov and bousquet 2010 even though overcoming barriers towards stakeholder involvement and implementing adaptive management requires long term engagement e g hatzilacou et al 2007 camacho et al 2010 allen and gunderson 2011 to adapt the strategies values and institutions to current challenges and achieve social learning pahl wostl et al 2007 social learning requires informal discourse in which water management problems are discussed and the stakeholder group strives to develop the capacity to solve problems collectively pahl wostl et al 2007 this does not imply consensus but at least the ability to deal constructively with controversial perspectives these informal learning processes need to be linked to formal policy making in order to effectively facilitate new routines or practices sendzimir et al 2010 such linkages might be a formal mandate for participatory processes legal obligations that result from participatory processes representation of stakeholders in committees or clearly defined governmental involvement in stakeholder processes with respect to participatory model building water agencies can function as a link between formal water management and informal learning processes water agencies e g water boards or watershed organizations are often located at the interface between policy development and implementation where close collaboration with stakeholder groups is particularly important to function as such a link water agencies require adequate funds skills and mandates to ensure long term financing and organization of collaborative management processes the mtf is applied as an analytical tool in the institutionalized participatory modeling stage of the proposed pmb framework stage five the analysis of institutionalization requirements includes financial instruments dissemination of information and knowledge as well as the roles of stakeholders in the learning process and rules for decision making for example a facilitator may be required for the group discussion and to elicit knowledge and insights from stakeholders in addition a process coach can examine the group internal social processes and provide skills for mediation of conflicts richardson and andersen 1995 importance can also be attributed to emergent leadership which may be essential for facilitating the implementation of solution strategies e g möllenkamp et al 2008 the ex ante analysis is based upon previously gathered information about systemic barriers and drivers of institutionalization from the problem diagnosis in stage 1 as well as individual interviews and group processes in stages 3 and 4 further expert interviews can be conducted as well specific process steps towards institutionalized participatory modeling are defined in the form of action situations that aims at overcoming an institutionalization barrier e g lack of modeling skills or support a driver e g existing cooperation between stakeholders again each action situation is further specified by expected influencing factors aspired outcomes see section 3 3 as well as stakeholders that need to be involved a pathway towards institutionalized participatory modeling is developed by linking action situations through time this pathway can provide orientation to stakeholders in their efforts to achieve transformative change and long term continuation of the process by identifying suitable measures to develop skills and capacities the pathway should be revised in case new barriers drivers or implementation challenges e g stakeholders who refuse to cooperate are identified 4 application of the pmb framework in québec the research team explored the use of the pmb framework in the du chêne watershed in québec in cooperation with the local watershed organization l organisme de bassins versants de la zone du chêne obv du chêne the obv du chêne is located in southern québec canada about 40 km south of québec city and manages one of the 40 priority integrated watershed management zones in the province the obv du chêne was formed in 2007 through a joint effort of the union of agricultural producers and the municipalité régionale de comté mrc lotbinière the du chêne is the major watershed in the zone du chêne and along with a number of smaller adjacent watersheds directly discharges into the saint lawrence river the du chêne watershed covers 800 km2 with intensive agricultural and forestry production which has resulted in pollution problems and soil erosion the participatory process started in 2010 with a meeting of mcgill researchers and the obv staff to consider the participatory modeling process as a potentially useful tool to improve relations between stakeholders in the du chêne watershed and to learn about different perspectives of the causes consequences and solutions regarding the water quality problem in the watershed 4 1 problem framing and stakeholder analysis stage one the problem and stakeholder analysis was accomplished in close cooperation with the obv du chêne at the beginning of the participatory modeling process a thorough literature review and interviews with staff of the du chêne watershed organization were conducted the obv du chêne determined that the major issue in the watershed was declining water quality mainly due to eutrophication and chemical contamination the sources of water pollution were thought to originate from the agriculture forestry and municipal sectors however the exact pathways and quantities were unclear and further research was required to identify solution strategies the research project adopted this initial problem frame from the obv du chêne as it was broad enough to motivate many stakeholders to participate in addition this broad problem definition was expected to include different more specific problem perspectives from other stakeholders available information was included in a mtf database to analyze the complexity of the water quality issue and associated stakeholders in an integrated and systematic manner the problem analysis started in 1960 to consider long term impacts from the agricultural municipal and forestry sectors the level of detail of the problem analysis increased with time due to greater information and data e g systematic monitoring of water quality data in the du chêne watershed was not started until 2005 important historical events for water quality management include the programme d assainissement des eaux du québec paeq initiated in 1978 by the provincial government to foster water treatment in the municipal and industrial sectors as well as improved manure practices in agriculture gravel 2006 the règlement sur les exploitations agricoles rea implemented in 2002 includes important regulations regarding diffuse pollution from agriculture including the development of fertilizer management plans and the limitation of agricultural expansion in degraded watersheds before the new québec water policy in 2002 local and regional county municipalities were responsible for enforcing environmental law and managing rivers and adjacent areas the québec water policy introduced a participatory integrated watershed based management approach beginning in 2002 watershed agencies were formed at local and regional levels to develop and implement a master plan for water to comply with priorities guidelines regulations and legislation at the national provincial and municipal levels plans have to be submitted for evaluation and approval by the minister of state for the environment and water the watershed organizations are composed of representatives of stakeholder groups comprising citizens elected officials of municipalities or regional county municipalities and water user representatives such as the agricultural or industrial sectors provincial government representatives act as facilitators and provide scientific and technical support but do not have voting or decision rights baril et al 2005 watershed based management is synchronized at the provincial levels through a general reference framework established by the ministère du développement durable de l environnement et des parcs mddep 2002 the le regroupement des organismes de bassins versants du québec robvq represents local watershed agencies i e obvs and is another central actor that fosters integration of local water management in québec thus the obvs are embedded in a multi level water governance framework due to the central importance of the obvs the du chêne watershed was chosen as an appropriate boundary for the participatory process the board of directors of the obv du chêne aims to represent all water related stakeholders in the zone du chêne through the analysis of stakeholder roles attributes and dynamics it was determined that crucial participants were the staff of the obv du chêne and representatives from the agriculture municipal forestry tourism environmental and civil society sectors the analysis of stakeholder dynamics highlighted the possibility of future participation by representatives of the industrial sectors in particular the shale gas industry was emerging as a new stakeholder in the watershed at that time due to exploratory drilling activities however the development of the industry was stopped in 2013 through a moratorium by the provincial government that prohibits drilling fracturing and injective testing in the area obv du chêne 2014a 4 2 process design stage two during the preparatory meeting the staff of the obv du chêne emphasized the importance of linking the participatory modeling process to the formal water management framework in québec a tangible outcome was expected from the participatory process to support the obv du chêne in fulfilling their formal obligations e g develop a master plan for water foster knowledge dissemination and raise awareness the outcomes from each step in the participatory modeling process and its linkage to the formal mandate of the obv du chêne were thus discussed in detail by the research team and the staff of the obv fig 3 shows a simplified conceptualization of the modeling process blue elements and the formal water management process white elements in the du chêne watershed the obv du chêne was established in 2007 on the basis of the québec water policy by 2010 knowledge regarding water quality and other attributes of the watershed was gathered and a technical committee was formed consisting of all major stakeholder groups agriculture economic municipal and civic sectors from 2010 to 2014 a participatory analysis of the basin was conducted by the staff of the obv to produce a portrait obv du chêne 2014a and a diagnostic report obv du chêne 2014b of the watershed based on these findings the watershed organization defined specific problems and objectives obv du chêne 2014c this work resulted in a master plan for the watershed specifying concrete actions and responsibilities obv du chêne 2014d the participatory modeling process entered the official water management process at different points in time the involvement of the researchers started in 2010 with a preparatory meeting in which a cld was constructed with the obv staff the members of the obv du chêne learned about the method and decided to initiate an individual modeling process in october 2010 the low time and resource requirements of the individual modeling stage allowed water managers to commit to the process since separate funds for the testing of new facilitation methods were not available the outcomes of this process were intended to be a collection of individual clds developed by each stakeholder and a merged overall cld of all perspectives as described in section 3 3 the individual modeling process was aimed at improving contacts and communication between the watershed organization and stakeholders to support the participatory analysis of the basin based on positive experiences with the individual modeling stage the watershed organization decided to proceed towards the group model building stage to support group discussions in an upcoming stakeholder meeting see section 3 4 thus the development of a group model was planned to improve the understanding of problems in the watershed and allow staff and stakeholders of the obv to gain new methodological knowledge in a next step the development of a quantitative system dynamics model was discussed with the staff of the obv based upon the previously developed individual and group built clds a system dynamics model was considered helpful to test different solution strategies for the water quality problem e g alternative farming methods planting of riparian vegetation under varying conditions e g changing precipitation patterns due to climate change population dynamics which could inform the choice of objectives and the preparation and revision of the watershed master plan as the pathways of nutrients and suspended solids are a central concern in the watershed a model coupling approach was discussed that would dynamically couple a physically based model i e the swat model to the group built system dynamics model in order to assess the effects of policies e g on soil erosion in detail see inam 2016 and inam et al 2017a b for more details on this model coupling approach the application of the mtf was considered to be useful for process design and evaluation the analysis of the linkages of the modeling process demonstrated how the participatory process fed into the formal decision making process see fig 3 and thereby helped to fulfill the formal mandate of the obv this assisted staff members in clearly communicating the purpose of the process to stakeholders and government agencies 4 3 individual modeling stage three individual models were built in eight stakeholder interviews the stakeholders were visited by two facilitators i e one staff member and one researcher at their home or office to minimize efforts required by stakeholders such as time requirements for traveling the choice for interviewees represented the composition of the du chêne watershed organization and included two representatives of civil society an environmental ngo and a citizen s group three representatives from different municipalities and three representatives from the economic sector tourism agriculture and forestry these stakeholders brought a broad range of expertise to the participatory process including training in environmental management biology ecology and economics clds were built by each interviewee individually while methodological support was jointly provided by two staff members of the du chêne watershed organization and one of the authors the staff members received training through a two hour preparatory meeting in which the systems thinking method was presented and an individual cld built the stakeholder interviews took approximately 1 5 h each and the entire individual interview process was accomplished in three days according to the guideline in section 3 3 i e problem causes consequences feedbacks solutions barriers the construction of the individual stakeholder clds began with the definition of the problem variable all participants agreed that water quality was the major problem in the du chêne watershed while emissions from agriculture and municipal sectors were seen as causes by all participants the role of forestry was not seen uniformly by stakeholders i e a number of models did not include impacts from forestry the main suggested impacts from agriculture stemmed from soil erosion and the use of pesticides and fertilizers that entered the river through the agricultural drainage system river dredging and drainage systems were also seen as having major impacts on water quality by some stakeholders as they increase the velocity of river flow and disturb natural filtration processes the impact of the municipal sector was related to deficient wastewater infrastructure in urban areas and septic tanks at isolated residences emissions from the road network were also seen as a relevant source of emissions by some participants forestry contributed to the water quality issue through deforestation which caused higher water temperatures and soil erosion natural emissions e g from wetlands were mentioned as an important factor by some stakeholders participants considered the consequences of the water quality issue on the environment e g aquatic flora and fauna tourism and recreation e g swimming and fishing and potable water supply e g higher treatment costs several reinforcing feedback loops were identified see appendix b for example in the case of a declining standard of living in the du chêne watershed this would be expected to lower the willingness of citizens to protect the aquatic environment as socio economic issues become a priority as a consequence water quality could deteriorate and the standard of living might be reduced even more balancing feedback loops to improve water quality included solutions proposed by stakeholders such as stricter legislation and implementation of regulations e g rea installment of riparian vegetation strips reforestation investment in wastewater infrastructure and education campaigns for example a farmer proposed more hands on measures such as placing stones in the riverbed to reduce erosion while representatives from the municipalities included more policy oriented approaches such as application of the environmental quality act responsibilities for the implementation of these measures were seen on a broad societal scale including provincial ministries municipal administration obvs agriculture clubs foresters and civic society barriers were related to the costs of solution strategies and a lack of environmental consciousness by several stakeholder groups the outcomes of these individual model building sessions consisted of a number of multi faceted clds the participants were generally satisfied with their models and believed that they reflected their point of view in a comprehensive way fig 4 presents a translated cld model upper part of fig 4 developed by a stakeholder during a 1 5 h interview and which was later digitized by the facilitators using the vensim software lower part of fig 4 the model in fig 4 shows the perceived causes and consequences of the water quality problem in the du chêne watershed as well as preferred solution strategies and implementation barriers from the perspective of a single stakeholder apart from the treatment loop all feedback loops include the variable education and sensibilization see appendix a for a detailed description of all loops there are various balancing feedback processes that include solution strategies that are expected to balance the water quality problem e g new cultural practices implementation of environmental regulations or natural conservation two implementation barriers point to limited resources and opposition of stakeholders from the agricultural sector in fig 4 only one reinforcing feedback loop is included which refers to loads of organic environments such as wetlands that contribute to natural emissions of organic materials in summary the cld depicts the stakeholder s mental model of the water quality issue including environmental e g wetlands forest cover economic e g financial resources technical e g sewage treatment septic tanks and social e g education sensitization aspects subsequent to the individual interviews a merged model from all stakeholder built clds and a related workbook were prepared by one of the authors see appendix a in the workbook the merged model was presented successively by using thematic models each highlighting a specific thematic aspect of the overall model erosion and deforestation problems water pollution and economic impacts impacts of water quality on tourism and quality of life these models are not independent from each other and it was underlined that the three models are intertwined and only presented in this way for clarity the staff members of the obv du chêne decided to directly enter the involvement phase stages four and five of the pmb without sending the workbook out to stakeholders nevertheless the workbook demonstrated the ability of the method to provide an integrated picture of the water quality issues in the watershed 4 4 group model building stage four based upon the positive experiences and the methodological knowledge that was acquired a group modeling exercise was integrated into a regular meeting of the obv du chêne the group exercise was attended by ten stakeholders who represented all sectors involved in the water quality issue two researchers supported the staff members to structure the group exercise instead of discussing the general problem of water quality the group decided to concentrate on the more focused problem of soil erosion as they perceived it to be the major reason for water quality problems in the du chêne watershed the discussion of causes and consequences of soil erosion confirmed the diversity in stakeholder perceptions that had been revealed through the individual modeling process the group exercise took approximately 1 5 h and helped to clarify differing definitions of terms and levels of abstraction with respect to causes and consequences each model variable was discussed by the group and only added to the model if all participants agreed upon its meaning and validity this approach resulted in a structured and in depth discussion the model building process was considerably slower than the individual model building given all the discussion however this provided the stakeholders with a unique opportunity to discuss points of contention in a productive way learn about the perspectives of others and discover the interconnected system structure of soil erosion and its link to water quality as considerable time was needed to clarify stakeholder contributions to the discussion the resulting model fig 5 contains a lower number of variables and connections than the individual models cf fig 4 the process of detailed explanation and rephrasing of statements is an important step towards social learning the obv du chêne was satisfied with the group process as the modeling exercise was the first time that stakeholders had discussed water issues in the du chêne watershed in an active manner despite previous repeated attempts of staff members to stimulate an open discussion stakeholder meetings had merely been one way information meetings the structured modeling process helped the stakeholders to discuss the causes and consequences of poor water quality including socio economic technical and environmental aspects the modeling process was evaluated through a questionnaire that was handed out to all participants all respondents agreed that the group model building method supported discussion and development of a deeper understanding of the water quality issue in the du chêne watershed the majority of participants suggested that the group modeling process continue in the future in order to explore the soil erosion problem and other issues related to soil erosion and water quality in more depth in addition some respondents explicitly asked that the pmb process move towards quantification of the model and subsequent scenario analysis criticism was mainly related to the differing involvement of participants i e some participants chose to contribute more to the discussion than others a continuation of the participatory modeling process could address these demands by offering more time for discussion and additional opportunities for participants to express their points of view following the group model building process the development of a quantitative system dynamics model based upon the qualitative models from the individual and group model building process was planned in a follow up meeting of mcgill researchers and obv staff due to the prioritization of the soil erosion problem the model was intended to initially focus on the simulation of erosion pathways and the effectiveness of measures such as the improvement of riparian vegetation strips the simulation model was expected to help the obv in selecting management actions to improve water quality in the du chêne watershed therefore a model coupling approach was designed to dynamically couple the system dynamics model addressing socio economic aspects of the water quality issue to a swat model simulating physical and environmental processes cf inam 2016 inam et al 2017a b however missing streamflow data for the du chêne created a barrier to quantitative modeling the installation of streamflow gauging stations in the watershed is an example of a long term measure which requires substantial investment such broader requirements for systemic change towards participatory and sustainable water management further examples are the development of facilitation skills or the implementation of new legal frameworks and funding structures are prevalent in water resources management practice this motivated the development of stage five of the pmb framework which allows for the systematic analysis of long term solution strategies and opportunities for institutionalized participatory modeling 4 5 institutionalized participatory modeling stage five up to this point the participatory modeling process was jointly facilitated by the research group and staff members from the obv du chêne throughout the process the staff members were included as much as possible in the application of the participatory methods to develop their capacity to independently continue the process legislative conditions for the initiation of the participatory modeling process are supportive given that the obvs have flexibility in their choice of approaches for stakeholder participation however several challenges for the long term continuation and institutionalization of the modeling process were revealed during the participatory process including the availability of modeling skills financial resources decision making power broader experiences in participatory modeling and a coherent water governance framework fig 6 shows a simplified pathway to overcome the detected barriers of long term participatory modeling processes in the du chêne watershed this is explained in more detail below first while qualitative system analysis with the help of clds turned out to be quite intuitive the development of a quantitative system dynamics model requires significant modeling skills obv staff would need further training in modeling to autonomously continue the process in the future long term cooperation between universities as1 in the region and obvs is a promising approach to ensure methodological support and modeling skill development second the long term involvement of scientists in the process as well as the establishment of a streamflow gauging network in the du chêne requires financial resources and decision making power as2 until now the obvs have not had sufficient funding for a strategic partnership with universities but mainly depended upon resources from stakeholders e g municipalities this lack of funding and dependence upon the goodwill of stakeholders influences the obv s ability to implement measures and strategies laid down in their master plans robvq 2013 ccd 2013 medema et al 2015 third there is further potential for improvement of water management in québec as3 for instance an action plan for water has been requested by the sustainable development commissioner from the ministère du développement durable de l environnement et des parcs and the robvq that involves all governmental agencies and supplements water master plans in the watershed robvq 2013 ccd 2013 another request by the sustainable development commissioner and the robvq relates to a management framework that specifies responsibilities between different entities of the water system including obvs ministers and municipalities ccd 2013 such a framework would support vertical integration i e across management levels as well as horizontal integration i e across sectors such as water management and land planning within the water governance system in québec finally the initiation of further participatory modeling processes in québec is needed as4 for experience to be acquired and the potential of participatory model building to be demonstrated to a wider audience i e other obvs the robvq and provincial ministries as participatory modeling is increasingly applied in research and teaching at universities in québec e g at mcgill university see halbe et al 2015b more students scientists and practitioners have the required methodological expertise that is necessary for a broader application of participatory modeling approaches 5 discussion the case study in québec demonstrates the usefulness of the pmb framework for initiating participatory modeling processes in unfavorable contexts i e limited time financial resources and methodological knowledge while the time requirements for the researcher were considerable about 3 4 months for problem and stakeholder analysis and individual modeling the time requirements for other stakeholders such as the du chêne watershed organization about 3 4 weeks of involvement and interviewees about 1 1 5 h each were lower the extensive involvement of a researcher was needed to test evaluate and refine the new pmb framework in the future we anticipate that stages one to three of the pmb framework can be accomplished with less involvement of researchers through the preparation of a website that contains guidance documents and further case study examples the results of the exploratory phase in the case study comprise a systematic analysis of stakeholder perspectives on the water quality issue and the development of a holistic system understanding which were explicitly mentioned in an official report of the watershed organization obv du chêne 2014b the study revealed that further research and action is needed on economic and institutional aspects of the problem e g effective policies to foster reforestation as well as streamflow monitoring in the watershed to allow for more detailed analyses of emission pathways besides these more problem related outcomes the modeling process significantly improved the discussion process and relationships between stakeholders without the exploratory stakeholder participation phase of the pmb framework stages one to three it is likely that participatory modeling would not have been applied in the case study due to minimal funding time and expertise stakeholders were not aware of participatory modeling even though participatory water management was desired the pmb framework is thus a promising approach to support the widespread initiation and application of the participatory modeling method in water management practice watershed agencies can test the appropriateness of participatory modeling step by step during the exploratory phase of the pmb framework and decide from the insights gained whether more intensive involvement is appropriate in the specific case study the pmb framework needs to be used in an iterative way to deal with the complexity of water resources issues for example findings from individual interviews stage three can require a revision of the initial problem and stakeholder analysis stage one and process design stage two the use of the mtf for process design stage three allows for a systematic analysis of the participatory process and its context such a systematic process design supports process monitoring and assessment and based upon this an iterative adaptation of the process design to challenges and opportunities such as a change in stakeholder composition or funding options more systemic case specific challenges of stakeholder participation and requirements of institutionalized participatory modeling are addressed in stage five of the pmb framework of course the use of the mtf alone does not dissolve barriers to institutionalized participatory modeling such as inadequate funds or limited capacities however analyzing requirements for institutionalizing participatory modeling allows for a more strategic stakeholder selection stage one and process design stage two for instance by including stakeholders who can support capacity building or even act as process facilitators in the long term in addition the mtf can be used to systematically compare and to facilitate the exchange of experiences between cases knieper et al 2010 pahl wostl et al 2012 for example regarding barriers and drivers of participatory processes e g sendzimir et al 2010 schlüter et al 2010 and to help envision a more supportive institutional structure for participation e g halbe et al 2013 in this way challenges that were faced during the participatory modeling process can point to the need for broader changes in water governance systems further research is needed to gather more case specific data on barriers and drivers of participatory modeling processes as well as systematically reviewing and synthesizing such context specific factors into general findings 6 conclusions the proposed participatory model building pmb framework addresses the challenges of initiating designing and institutionalizing participatory model building processes in water resources management to date participatory modeling has resulted in promising outcomes under favorable contexts e g available funds such as research projects but widespread implementation is limited given the unfavorable contexts which often exist in practice e g insufficient time financial resources and facilitation skills the pmb framework provides a stepwise approach for water managers to move towards stakeholder involvement and integrated water resources planning and management starting with approaches that require little investment of finances and time as well as low levels of mediation skills stages one to three water managers and agencies can obtain insights on the need and applicability of a participatory approach in the event of positive experiences the process can proceed to the involvement stage stages four and five where stakeholders meet and discuss the causes and consequences of a water resources problem as well as policies and strategies for its solution the pmb framework highlights the importance of capacity building in the water sector to allow for independent implementation of participatory model building processes which is an important requirement for institutionalized participation case specific requirements for continuous and effective collaborative management processes can be analyzed using the management and transition framework mtf an analytical tool that allows for the integrated analysis and planning of water management processes the proposed pmb framework was tested in multiple case studies in canada québec and ontario cyprus pakistan and guatemala the results from the case study in québec were presented in detail in this paper and highlight the heterogeneity of stakeholder perspectives which in turn underlines the need for participatory and

7584,the behavior of co2 that coexists with ch4 and the effect of ch4 on the co2 stream need to be deeply analyzed and studied especially in the presence of water our previous studies investigated the breakthrough pressure and permeability of pure co2 in five partially saturated low permeability sandstone core samples from the ordos basin and we concluded that rocks with a small pore size and low permeability show considerable sealing capacity even under unsaturated conditions in this paper we selected three of these samples for co2 ch4 gas mixture breakthrough experiments under various degrees of water saturation the breakthrough experiments were performed by increasing the gas pressure step by step until breakthrough occurred then the effluent gas mixture was collected for chromatographic partitioning analysis the results indicate that ch4 significantly affects the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 the presence of ch4 in the gas mixture increases the interfacial tension and thus the breakthrough pressure therefore the injected gas mixture that contains the highest lowest mole fraction of ch4 results in the largest smallest breakthrough pressure the permeability of the gas mixture is greater than that for pure co2 because of ch4 and the effective permeability decreases with increased breakthrough pressure chromatographic partitioning of the effluent mixture gases indicates that ch4 breaks through ahead of co2 as a result of its weaker solubility in water correlations are established between 1 the breakthrough pressure and water saturation 2 the effective permeability and water saturation 3 the breakthrough pressure and effective permeability and 4 the mole fraction of co2 ch4 in the effluent mixture gases and water saturation these results deepen our understanding of the multi phase flow behavior in the porous media under unsaturated conditions which have implications for formulating emergency response plans for gas leakage into unsaturated zones finally knowing the flow characteristic of gas mixture can guide co2 storage co2 eor and co2 ecbm projects future studies should pay attention to the effects of saline water with different salt types and concentrations on the multi phase flow behavior with applications to geological co2 storage and energy storage using ch4 keywords co2 ch4 gas mixture multi phase flow breakthrough pressure low permeability sandstone partially saturated permeability 1 introduction the buildup of co2 in the atmosphere from industrial production processes and modern human activity appears to be causing pronounced climatic changes worldwide ipcc 2005 bachu 2009 scientists have been researching measures and developing techniques to prevent excessive anthropogenic co2 from reaching the atmosphere shukla et al 2010 the geologic storage of co2 has been widely recognized as an important method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions juanes et al 2006 three significant options for co2 geological sequestration to reduce co2 emissions are being explored 1 depleted oil and gas reservoirs 2 unminable coalbeds and 3 deep saline aquifers li et al 2017 zhao and yu 2017 geologic co2 sequestration is the process through which co2 is stored in reservoir formation rock for at least hundreds of years rezaeyan et al 2015 however the sealing capacity of these rocks must be tested because of the buoyant rise of co2 through pores hildenbrand and krooss 2003 song and zhang 2013 the sealing quality of a rock is determined by the gas breakthrough pressure and the quality of effective gas permeability after leakage the breakthrough pressure is essentially determined by the capillary pressure of an interconnected network of pores that are invaded by the gas phase which is closely related to the flow of water and gas in the pores li et al 2005 because changes in water saturation can alter the state of the gas water phase in rock pores as well as the percolating flow path leading to changes in breakthrough pressure and permeability thus multi phase flow characteristics under different degrees of water saturation must be studied deeply to understand the effect of water saturation on the gas breakthrough pressure and permeability researchers have conducted breakthrough experiments to measure breakthrough pressure and permeability schowalter 1979 gallé 2000 li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 however most of these previous studies focused on water saturated core samples hildenbrand et al 2004 chose 26 different water saturated specimens of various lithological compositions to investigate the correlations among the absolute permeability effective permeability and breakthrough pressure li et al 2005 measured the co2 breakthrough pressure for midale evaporite seal rock samples that were first saturated with weyburn formation brine an experimental investigation of the co2 breakthrough pressure and permeability of two initially water saturated pelitic caprock samples was conducted by wollenweber et al 2011 breakthrough tests were conducted on saturated shale or cement specimens by kim and santamarina 2013 additionally rezaeyan et al 2015 conducted breakthrough experiments on two brine saturated samples a shale sample and an anhydrite sample to analyze the breakthrough pressure and effective gas permeability however formation rock is not always under water saturated conditions when injecting millions of tons of co2 into the underground some of the pores in the rock become occupied by co2 and the water that was originally in the pores is removed the pores become variably saturated with co2 and water another important reason for investigating the breakthrough pressure of partially saturated rock is that co2 may leak into unsaturated zones and undergo secondary trapping by impermeable or low permeability rock oldenburg and unger 2003 recent studies on co2 transport in unsaturated zones showed that unsaturated zones could still attenuate co2 leakage jeffrey et al 2016 the low permeability sandstone in the ordos basin is typically considered a reservoir rock just as the conclusions described in zhao and yu 2017 however zhao and yu 2017 also proved that the breakthrough pressure of sandstone with small average pore radius or most probable pore radius could reach as high as 7 83 mpa under low water saturation conditions in other words low permeability sandstone plays an important role in preventing co2 from escaping into the air thus it is important to examine the breakthrough pressure of rocks with different degrees of water saturation breakthrough pressure and permeability measurements have been widely studied in the literature for pure co2 storage schowalter 1979 gallé 2000 hildenbrand et al 2004 li et al 2005 wollenweber et al 2011 boulin et al 2013 kim and santamarina 2013 however co2 with a purity of 100 cannot be found in nature and other gases are always mixed with co2 li et al 2014a rezaeyan et al 2015 from the perspective of economic or risk management the issue of other gases in the co2 stream that is stored in geological media is very important the common gases that accompany co2 are nitrogen n2 methane ch4 sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen dioxide no2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s metz et al 2005 austegard et al 2006 reported that the most common gas in co2 is ch4 co2 and ch4 naturally form from the decomposition diagenesis of organic matter within sediments and sedimentary rocks teasdale et al 2014 de visse et al 2008 suggested that ch4 with a concentration of 1 4 w w could be injected alongside co2 another important factor in the study of co2 ch4 gas mixtures is that co2 geological storage in depleted oil gas reservoirs and unminable coalbeds is an appealing option to mitigate co2 emissions into the atmosphere and enhance the recovery of oil and methane gunter et al 1997 2005 shukla et al 2010 fujioka et al 2010 busch and gensterblum 2011 the ordos basin has a large amount of coalbed methane li et al 2014b li and tang 2015 and natural gas resources gao and wang 2017 however the properties of a low permeability reservoir such as poor porosity and permeability inhibit the production and development of these resources yao et al 2013 yi et al 2015 cheng et al 2016 thus these oil gas reservoirs and coalbeds could be used to store co2 and potentially increase the recovery of oil and gas connell et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 in terms of geological storage the presence of ch4 in the co2 stream has both physical and geochemical influences especially in the presence of water bachu and bennion 2009 as reported the admixing of ch4 affects the compressibility of the injected co2 and reduces the storage capacity of the free phase amin et al 2014 moreover the leakage of these gases must be detected and remediated as quickly as possible all these factors imply the need to study the behavior of co2 ch4 gas mixtures and the effect of ch4 in the co2 stream breakthrough experiments on many of the gases that accompany co2 have been conducted although mostly without mixing these gases with co2 for example n2 has been widely used in breakthrough pressure measurements thomas et al 1968 schowalter 1979 li et al 2005 and hildenbrand et al 2002 2004 conducted laboratory measurements of the gas breakthrough pressure for pure n2 and pure ch4 zhang and yu 2016 investigated the effect of water saturation on the breakthrough pressure of ch4 although certain studies evaluated the breakthrough pressure and permeability of gas mixtures the proportion of co2 and other gases was not clear li et al 2005 or repeated tests were not performed rezaeyan et al 2015 in this paper we conduct a series of co2 ch4 gas mixture breakthrough experiments under various degrees of water saturation our previous study assessed the influence of water saturation on the breakthrough pressure and permeability of pure co2 these pure co2 breakthrough experiments were conducted on five low permeability sandstone samples from the ordos basin for the purpose of comparison three of the same samples were selected for the present study a detailed description of the sample properties experimental equipment and preparation of mixed gases is provided in the experimental materials and apparatus section the experimental methods include procedures for measuring the porosity permeability and breakthrough pressure of samples with different water saturations the experimental pressure and temperature in this section are close to the in situ conditions of co2 geologic storage as in our previous study thus our results realistically reflect the effect of ch4 in the presence of water on the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 the chromatographic partitioning of the two gases that break through the core sample is examined using gas chromatography 2 experimental materials and apparatus 2 1 rock cores the ordos basin has prospective potential for large co2 geologic sequestration because it is the second largest sedimentary basin in china chang et al 2013 tian et al 2015 xie et al 2015 this basin is known for its stability and gentle stratum because it is characterized mainly by subsidence with no large faults even after several crustal movements a number of energy related industries such as steelworks refineries and power plants are located in the ordos basin and emit millions of metric tons of co2 every year into the atmosphere thus the negativeeffectsof co2 must be managed and an economical and efficient method of storing co2 within the ordos basin without transporting it to other sites is required five cylindrical sandstone cores with relatively low permeability from the ordos basin were chosen for pure co2 breakthrough experiments in zhao and yu 2017 under various degrees of water saturation for comparative purposes three of the same cores were used for the breakthrough experiments with co2 ch4 gas mixtures in this study they were extracted from monitoring well no 2 from the shenhua group carbon capture and storage ccs project which is located in the northeastern part of the basin near ejin horo banner inner mongolia fig 1 the core samples were obtained from triassic and permian sandstone formations of the heshangou liujiagou and shiqianfeng groups fig 2 they are referred to as samples 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 3 these core samples were used to conduct aseriesofbreakthrough experiments in zhao and yu 2017 the porosity and permeability shown in table 1 were retested before our experiments additionally table 1 shows the depth diameter and length of the three core samples the mineral content of the cores was determined by x ray diffraction xrd analysis table 2 2 2 experimental apparatus fig 4 shows the experimental setup for the breakthrough pressure and permeability measurements this setup is composed of four main components as follows 1 a core clamping system serves as the core holder the core sample can be wrapped in a fluororubber sleeve and placed in a stainless steel core holder and the core holder is set horizontally in the thermostat this fluororubber sleeve is designed to withstand high acidity and pressure and has high elasticity 2 a gas injection system that is used to inject pure or impure co2 into the core holder at a constant pressure 20 mpa 3 a confining and back pressure system is constructed from a syringe pump which is used to create and maintain the confining pressure around the rock plug and back pressure at the outlet of the core holder to ensure that the confining pressure is always higher than the pore pressure and that the gas or water will flow out only when the pressure exceeds the back pressure 4 a measuring system is constructed from two pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of the core holder and a gas flow meter to measure the gas flow rate at the outlet the pressure and gas flow rate data are recorded by the computer every 30 s as shown in fig 4 the pipelines of the gas container and gas injection system the liquid injection system the core holder the back pressure system valves and pipelines between these systems are all thermostatically controlled the apparatus that is used to measure the porosity fig 5 includes a water bath system a gas cell a sample cell a vacuum unit a data collection unit two pressure gauges and six valves the gas cell is used to store the helium whereas the sample cell is used to store the core samples the main component of this system two cells and a connecting pipe is heated by the water bath system and the pressure in both cells is monitored by two pressure gauges the vacuum system removes the air from the core samples and pipelines the temperature and pressure are recorded every 60 s by the data collection system fig 6 shows the apparatus that is used to obtain a fully water saturated core sample this apparatus consists of a core container a liquid injection system a gas injection system a gas compression system and a vacuum pump system the core container can be placed under a vacuum by the vacuum pump system and the liquid injection system allows deionized water to enter the core container and saturate the core sample inside helium can be pressurized to a desired value by the gas compression system and injected into the core container by the gas injection system the pressure gauge that is connected to the core container shows the interior pressure 2 3 preparation of the mixed gases three types of synthetic gas mixtures gases a b and c were used to investigate the effect of ch4 on the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 each synthetic gas mixture contained different mole fractions of pure co2 and ch4 gas a included 95 mol co2 and 5 mol ch4 gas b included 85 mol co2 and 15 mol ch4 and gas c contained 75 mol co2 and 25 mol ch4 after preparing the gas mixtures gas chromatography gc 2014 was conducted to analyze the gas concentrations and the test results substantiated the accuracy of the gas ratios in the mixture thereby guaranteeing the reliability of the experimental results 3 experimental methods initially the three core samples were air dried under ventilation until their weight remained constant porosity and single phase permeability measurements were performed for these samples next the core samples were saturated to various degrees of water saturation to conduct the following breakthrough experiments during this step effective permeability measurements of the gas mixtures were performed after gas breakthrough was observed 3 1 porosity and permeability measurements the porosity and permeability of the core samples were both measured before the breakthrough experiments for the porosity measurements helium was used to significantly reduce possible measurement errors from gas adsorption the gas cell and sample cell with the core sample were first evacuated for 2 h then helium was injected into the gas cell and stabilized for 2 h at 1 2 mpa for the next two hours opening valve 5 allowed the helium to flow into the sample cell and enter the connected pores of the rock cores the entire system was maintained at 28 c by the water bath system during the experiment the void volumes of the empty sample cell vs and the sample cell with the core sample vs were measured to determine the porosity φ referring to zhao and yu 2017 then the porosity could be defined as follows plug and bruining 2007 1 φ 1 v s v s 1 4 π d 2 l in eq 1 vs and vs include the volume of the pipes between valves 5 and 6 d and l are the diameter and length of the rock core which are listed in table 1 for each sample three measurements were conducted to ensure accuracy and the final porosity was obtained by averaging the three measured values the maximum absolute deviation of the measurement results is 0 22 for sample 2 and the minimum relative deviation is only 0 02 for sample 3 according to the routine core analysis methods of the oil and gas industry in china i e professional standard sy t 5336 2006 china national petroleum company 2006 the highest allowable absolute deviation for porosity measurements should not exceed 0 5 additionally low pressure n2 and co2 adsorption lpa and high pressure mercury intrusion micp were applied to obtain pore size distributions of three samples according to wang and yu 2017 the low pressure adsorption of co2 is always used to characterize pores with diameters 2 nm the lpa of n2 can be used to characterize pores with diameters between 2 and 50 nm and micp is used to characterize pores with diameters 50 nm subsequently the absolute permeability of pure co2 was measured on the core samples before the breakthrough experiments co2 was injected into the dried core sample at a pressure of 0 5 0 03 mpa whereas the confining pressure was maintained above 2 0 mpa when the volumetric flow rate of the gas q that escaped from the outlet and the pressure at the inlet p 1 and outlet p 2 stabilized the permeability could be determined by the following equation huang et al 1984 2 k 2 p a q μ lz a p 1 2 p 2 2 z a where pa is the standard atmospheric pressure μ is the gas dynamic viscosity under the experimental conditions z is the compressibility factor under the experimental conditions za is the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure and l and a are the length and cross sectional area of the core respectively the gas dynamic viscosity and compressibility factor can be found in www ap1700 com and the data from this site are consistent with the united states national bureau of standards nist thermal physical parameters three measurements were conducted to test the accuracy the maximum relative deviation of the measurement results is 10 for sample 1 and the minimum relative deviation is only 1 for sample 2 based on the professional standard sy t 5336 2006 the highest allowable relative deviation should be less than 15 when the permeability of the core sample is smaller than 10 md after the breakthrough experiment the effective permeability of the gas mixture could be obtained using eq 2 to obtain this value we have to obtain the gas mixture dynamic viscosity and compressibility factor the dynamic viscosity of pure gas at a given pressure could be found in www ap1700 com and then the dynamic viscosity of the gas mixture could be determined by the following equation dean and stiel 1965 3 μ m y i μ i m i 1 2 y i m i 1 2 where μm is the dynamic viscosity of the gas mixture under the experimental conditions μi is the dynamic viscosity of component i in the gas mixture under the experimental conditions yi is the mole fraction of component i in the gas mixture and mi is the molecular weight of component i in addition the compressibility factor of the gas mixture could be determined based on amagat s law as follows 4 z m y i z i where zm is the compressibility factor of the gas mixture under the experimental conditions zi is the compressibility factor of component i in the gas mixture under the experimental conditions and yi is the mole fraction of component i in the gas mixture when we replace zi with the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure zia in eq 4 we can obtain the compressibility factor of the gas mixture at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure zma after determining the values of μm zm and zma we can calculate the absolute or effective permeability of the gas mixture km using eq 2 3 2 breakthrough pressure experiments prior to the breakthrough pressure measurements on the core samples an equal size stainless steel cylinder to simulate a zero porosity core sample was used to test the air tightness of the experimental apparatus the result indicated that the confining pressure of 20 mpa is sufficient to prevent gas leakage through possible channels between the sleeve and core sample although the inlet pressure was maintained at 20 mpa for 12 h gas leaks were not observed at the outlet section when the confining pressure was set to 20 mpa the step by step approach which is based on the high accuracy definition of breakthrough pressure schowalter 1979 li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 was used in this study before saturating the core samples breakthrough experiments were performed on the air dried core samples thus we could obtain the breakthrough pressure pbt and absolute permeability kabs of the gas mixture at water saturation sw 0 two experiments were conducted on each dried core sample to determine the experimental accuracy the comparison results show that the breakthrough pressure remains unchanged for samples 1 and 2 and the maximum relative deviation for sample 3 is 3 6 according to the professional standard sy t 5748 2013 china national petroleum company 2013 the highest allowable relative deviation should be less than 20 when the breakthrough pressure is smaller than 10 mpa subsequently we saturated the original air dried core samples with distilled water by first evacuating them to a pressure 0 1 mpa for 12 h then distilled water was injected and the sample was completely submerged in water to ensure uniform saturation subsequently 10 mpa of helium was applied to pressurize the system for at least 12 h until the weight of the sample remained constant at this stage a fully water saturated core sample was obtained and breakthrough pressure experiments could be conducted the details of the breakthrough experimental procedure can be found in zhao and yu 2017 during each test the injection pressure was increased stepwise until the gas broke through the sample the back pressure was set to 8 5 mpa so the initial pressure increase continued at a rapid pace when the injection pressure exceeded the supercritical pressure the pressure increment and interval time between the two pressure stages should be in strict accordance with sy t 5748 2013 table 3 in theory the pressure equilibrium between the wetting and nonwetting phase at the displacement front in the sample will be broken when an increment in pressure occurs therefore the nonwetting phase has to advance through the interconnected channels to reach a smaller pore where the differential pressure is balanced by a larger capillary pressure li et al 2005 this process was repeated until the gas broke through the smallest pore and formed a continuous flow through the sample subsequently the effective gas permeability could be measured during the breakthrough experiments the effective permeability varied with time as a function of water saturation hildenbrand et al 2002 2004 wollenweber et al 2011 rezaeyan et al 2015 the time scale of these literature studies usually exceeded 10 h and sometimes even reached 10 days however the permeability measurements lasted from 0 5 to 1 h in our study to obtain the effective permeability under a certain degree of water saturation the water had difficulty flowing through the pores because of the very low permeability of the samples additionally the back pressure was maintained at 8 5 mpa during the entire experiment which could have prevented water from escaping thus the water saturation did not significantly change in such a short time then the gas mixture effective permeability keff could be obtained from eq 2 by averaging the inlet and outlet pressure and the gas flow rate within this period the breakthrough experiments under various degrees of water saturation 0 sw 1 could involve the above procedure the method for measuring the effective permeability could also be used under different water saturations although the same sample with various degrees of water saturation had to be prepared based on the results and conclusions in section 4 1 several rounds of saturation could not alter the pore structure of the samples or affect the experimental results additionally the water saturated cores were air dried for varying lengths of time to obtain different degrees of water saturation and to avoid damaging the rock cores 5 s w m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 where sw is the water saturation m0 is the dry weight of the core sample m1 is the weight of the water saturated core sample and m2 is the residual weight of the core sample after being air dried for a given time 3 3 chromatographic partitioning analysis bachu and bennion 2009 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to examine the chromatographic partitioning of other gases in a co2 stream in this study a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan was applied for the chromatographic partitioning analysis after each breakthrough pressure experiment the effluent gas that broke through the core sample was collected twice at the outlet section of the core holder by gas collection bags the first collection was immediately performed after gas bubbles were observed at the outlet and the second collection was performed after the measurement of the gas mixture permeability then the collected gas mixture was uniformly injected into the gas chromatograph to analyze the mole fraction of each gas component in the effluent gas then we obtained two sets of data for the mole fraction of each gas composition by comparing the two sets of data and the original mole fraction of each gas composition in the gas mixture we deduced the fate of the injected co2 and ch4 and the order of their breakthrough 4 experimental results 4 1 porosity and permeability measurements the three core samples were used to conduct pure co2 breakthrough experiments in zhao and yu 2017 and were then adopted to conduct breakthrough experiments of gas mixtures in our study the purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of ch4 on the co2 breakthrough pressure and permeability of low permeability sandstone we compared the results of these two experiments for this purpose the properties porosity and permeability of the core samples had to remain consistent to ensure that the differences inthese twoexperimentalresults were caused by different gas components therefore we measured the sample porosity and permeability before both experiments and a comparison of the two sets of values is listed in table 4 the comparison shows that the absolute deviation of the porosity for all three core samples islessthan 0 20 and the smallest is approximately only 0 08 the maximum relative deviation for the permeability is 8 00 and the permeabilities before experiments i and ii are ofthesame order according to the professional standard sy t 5336 2006 the highest allowable absolute relative deviation for porosity permeability measurements should not exceed 0 5 15 hence all the sample properties could be regarded as unchanged which means the saturation process did not modify the pore structure the results of the measured pore size distribution from lpa and micp are shown in table 5 and fig 7 as mentioned above the lpa of co2 and n2 is used to characterize pores with diameters 2 nm and diameters between 2 and 50 nm respectively whereas micp is used to characterize pores with diameters 50 nm table 5 was created according to the classification of pores from the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac by rouquerol et al 1994 pores can be divided into three categories micropores pore diameters 2 nm mesopores pore diameters of 2 50 nm and macropores pore diameters 50 nm table 5 shows that the macropore volume for all three samples comprises a considerable proportion of the total pore volume in addition we obtained two different indices to evaluate the pore size the average pore radius rave and most probable pore radius rm rave is the average value of all the pore radii and rm is the pore radius with the highest probability the average pore radius of samples 1 3 is 0 160 0 151 and 0 035 µm respectively and the most probable pore radius is 0 713 1 760 and 0 028 µm 4 2 breakthrough pressure experiments each sample underwent eighteen breakthrough experiments which were conducted under six different degrees of water saturation 0 100 with three different gas mixtures all the experimental results are listed in table 6 and the breakthrough pressure measurement histories are provided in fig 8 only nine history curves under three different sw with three different gas mixtures for each sample are shown in fig 8 for clarity based on table 6 and fig 8 samples with a higher degree of water saturation have lower permeability and higher breakthrough pressure in addition the breakthrough pressures of samples 1 and 2 slightly increase with increasing water saturation whereas that of sample 3 obviously increases therefore the gas breakthrough time for sample 3 rises significantly with increased water saturation whereas this increase is small for samples 1 and 2 4 3 chromatographic partitioning analysis of the effluent gas the chromatographic partitioning of co2 and associated gas occurs during injection into the subsurface after each breakthrough experiment the gas that broke through the sample and flowed out from the outlet was collected twice considered the initial and second effluent gas respectively and then analyzed by the gas chromatograph the interval between the two collections exactly matched the time that was used for the permeability measurements 0 5 1 h the results are normalized as the mole fraction of a particular gas in the effluent gas then we compared the results to the mole fraction of the respective gas in the original injection gas as seen in fig 9 the two gas component mole fractions in both the initial and second effluent gases are quite close to their original concentration for all the breakthrough experiments that used gas a as the injected gas a similar situation occurred for gas b except for sample 3 the results of the chromatographic partitioning of sample 3 show an apparent deviation from the original gas concentration when using gas c the mole fraction of ch4 in the initial effluent gas is always larger than that in the second effluent gas both values obviously exceed the original mole fraction in the injected gas fig 9 a1 a3 whereas co2 exhibits the opposite trend fig 9 b1 b3 5 discussion 5 1 effect of water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure in the presence of ch4 the results of the gas mixture breakthrough experiments and the breakthrough pressure of pure co2 zhao and yu 2017 of these three identical samples are illustrated in fig 10 a comparison showed that the presence of ch4 in the injected gas mixture played an important role in increasing the breakthrough pressure which may have occurred because of the higher interfacial tension ift of the co2 ch4 water system compared to that of a pure co2 water system researches have been conducted to analyze the ift between water and co2 under both gaseous and supercritical conditions yang et al 2005 chiquet et al 2007 similarly the ift of impure co2 water has been researched in detail in recent years ren et al 2000 yan et al 2001 liu et al 2016 and these research studies covered a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions however these studies all came to a consistent conclusion that the presence of ch4 in the gas mixture increases the ift in addition liu et al 2016 found that the degree of this increase depends on the mole fraction of ch4 in the gas mixture a higher mole fraction of ch4 corresponds to a larger ift between the gas mixture and water such changes undoubtedly increase the breakthrough pressure of ch4 co2 mixtures compared to that of pure co2 therefore the injected gas mixture that contained the highest lowest mole fraction of ch4 produced the largest smallest breakthrough pressure according to the above discussion the breakthrough pressure of the gas mixtures is clearly higher than that of pure co2 because of the presence of ch4 however the breakthrough pressure is raised by increasing the water saturation in both cases the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water saturation could be expressed as an exponential function except in one case sample 2 with pure co2 as described by zhao and yu 2017 the pure co2 breakthrough pressure of sample 2 remained constant as the water saturation increased because the most probable pore radius of the sample reaches 1 760 µm therefore the breakthrough pressure was not affected by the increasing water saturation the exponential fitting curves for all three samples with different gas mixtures and pure co2 are shown in fig 10 the correlation coefficient r2 for sample 1 is higher than 0 93 for samples 2 and 3 the correlation coefficient also nearly reaches 0 9 the high correlation coefficients and good fits in fig 10 indicate that this exponential function pbt aebsw can accurately represent the relationship between pbt and sw the parameters a and b are constant for a specific sample but change for different gas mixtures the fitting parameter a equals pbt when sw is zero and represents the breakthrough pressure of the dried core sample table 7 shows that the parameter a for each sample increases with the increased mole fraction of ch4 in the injected gas mixture which is expected because the breakthrough pressure of the dried core samples presents a notable positive correlation with the mole fraction of ch4 according to the above discussion 5 2 effect of pore size on co2 breakthrough pressure in the presence of ch4 fig 10 shows that the breakthrough pressures of the three gas mixtures for each sample become larger when the water saturation is elevated which is also observed for the pure co2 breakthrough pressures of samples 1 and 3 however the breakthrough pressure of pure co2 in sample 2 remained constant as the water saturation increased because of its high most probable pore radius the same results are not observed for sample 2 when the injected gas contains ch4 which also indicates that the presence of ch4 significantly increases the breakthrough pressure however the direct connection between the pore size distribution and breakthrough pressure could not be ignored tables 5 and 6 show that a smaller macropore proportions in the sample corresponds to a greater breakthrough pressure for the gas mixture under the same water saturation sample 3 presents the highest proportion of mesopores and micropores and produces the largest breakthrough pressure the similar proportions of macropores 89 27 and 90 53 in samples 1 and 2 produce similar breakthrough pressure values 0 3 0 9 mpa and 0 4 0 7 mpa respectively the average or most probable pore radius is inversely correlated to the breakthrough pressure for sample 3 because its small rave and rm lead to the largest breakthrough pressure however this relationship is more complex for samples 1 and 2 although the average pore radius of sample 1 is slightly larger than that of sample 2 the breakthrough pressure of the former exceeds that of the latter when the water saturation become sufficiently high fig 11 this result likely occurred because the most probable pore radius of sample 1 0 713 µm is significantly smaller than that of sample 2 1 760 µm so the remaining pore sizes except for the highest frequency radius rm in sample 1 are much larger than those in sample 2 therefore the average pore sizes of these two samples are similar 0 160 µm and 0 151 µm as shown in fig 7 the pore volume of mesopores with a pore radius of 1 25 nm are greater in sample 2 than in sample 1 and the pore volume of pores with a radius 1 µm is smaller in sample 2 than in sample 1 notably the amount of water within the pores at the beginning of the water saturation process is small and distributed around the surfaces of small pores wu et al 2001 cieslinski and mosdorf 2005 by increasing the water saturation water films accumulate on the pore surfaces and narrow pores will be blocked before water begins to gather in larger pores hence the growth of the breakthrough pressure in sample 2 is more obvious than that in sample 1 at lower degree of water saturation however the main channels for gas flow become macropores once the water saturation becomes sufficiently high therefore sample 2 which has the largest most probable pore radius allows gas to advance more easily through interconnected channels 5 3 effect of water saturation on co2 permeability in the presence of ch4 a comparison was performed for the absolute and effective permeability among the gas mixtures and pure co2 according to the measured gas permeability after the breakthrough experiments in table 6 as shown in fig 12 the presence of ch4 in the gas mixtures increases the absolute permeability moreover higher ch4 mole fraction results in a larger absolute permeability the effective permeability was much lower than the absolute permeability because the effluent gases flow at relatively low gas saturation after breakthrough even under high pressure gradients only a small portion of the interconnected pore space is involved in this transport process hildenbrand et al 2004 decreasing the water saturation creates new gas flow pathways thereby enhancing gas saturation and increasing its effective permeability this finding is consistent with that observed in fig 13 the effective permeability of the gas mixtures decreases with increasing water saturation and their relationship can be described as an exponential function the high correlation coefficient up to 0 9999 indicates the goodnessofthe fit similar to the absolute permeability ch4 obviously influences the effective permeability fig 13 shows that the effective permeability for pure co2 at a given water saturation is lower than those for the gas mixtures and gas mixtures with higher ch4 mole fractions exhibit larger effective permeability regressions have been determined for the pbt and keff data from table 6 and their correlation could be described as a double logarithmic plot fig 14 the effective permeability decreases with increasing breakthrough pressure 5 4 effect of injection gas ch4 concentration on the chromatographic partitioning of the two gases chromatographic partitioning of various gases has been extensively used in the petroleum industry tang 1995 2005 illiassov and datta gupta 2002 bachu and bennion 2009 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to examine the chromatographic partitioning of other gases within a co2 stream that is injected into a deep saline aquifer for the purpose of co2 sequestration and their results indicated that the gas mixtures would chromatographically partition after advancing through the water saturated porous medium because of different solubility in the aquifer water in this study the effluent gas mixtures which were collected twice after each breakthrough experiment were analyzed by gas chromatography and all 108 test results for the co2 and ch4 mole fractions are shown in fig 9 the results showed that the gas mixtures chromatographically partitioned after advancing through a completely or partially water saturated porous medium the mole fractions of these two gas compositions in the effluent gas mixtures could be used to determine their sequence in breaking through the core sample if the mole fraction of a particular gas composition is close to or greater than its original concentration in the injection gas the respective gas is more easily advance through the sample and more likely to break through earlier based on the results in fig 9 the potential breakthrough of ch4 occurs more rapidly for higher concentrations of ch4 in the effluent gas which is consistentwith the conclusions of bachu and bennion 2009 the earlier breakthrough of ch4 relative to co2 is related to the gas solubility because co2 has a higher solubility in water than ch4 the co2 concentration is suppressed at the leading edge of the breakthrough gas therefore the migration of co2 through pores is restricted because of the much lower solubility of ch4 injection gases with higher ch4 concentrations are more likely to facilitate ch4 breakthrough for a given core sample a higher mole fraction of ch4 in the injection gas corresponds to a greater early breakthrough likelihood and higher concentration of ch4 in the effluent gas in all cases the mole fraction of ch4 co2 in the initial effluent gas is larger smaller than that in the second effluent gas which is expected because the dissolution of co2 reaches a saturation point over time therefore the decreasing solubility of co2 will increase the co2 concentration and decrease the ch4 concentration in the second effluent gas in the effluent gas of sample 3 the ch4 concentration was greater relative to the other two samples when gas b was injected as the feed gas this result can be explained by the higher co2 solubility under elevated pressure as the breakthrough pressure of sample 3 is much higher than those of samples 1 and 2 however these three samples shared a common feature for gas c in fig 9 the mole fraction of co2 ch4 basically decreases increases with the increased water saturation indicating a close connection between the co2 or ch4 mole fraction and the water saturation theoretically more co2 will be dissolved under higher water saturation producing smaller larger mole fractions of co2 ch4 in the effluent gas the higher correlation coefficients for the initial effluent gas in fig 15 demonstrate a linear relationship between the gas concentration and water saturation these findings are significant for understanding the fate of co2 ch4 gas mixtures in partially saturated porous media and developing emergency response plans in case of gas leakage into unsaturated zones 6 conclusions a series of breakthrough experiments were conducted under various degrees of water saturation using three gas mixtures with different proportions of co2 and ch4 the results were compared to those from pure co2 breakthrough experiments in our previous study we aimed to assess the effect of ch4 on the breakthrough pressure and permeability as well as the effects of different mole fractions of ch4 in the gas mixtures under different degrees of water saturation we found that the breakthrough pressure of gas mixtures is higher than that of pure co2 because the presence of ch4 increases the ift between gas and water in addition both the absolute and effective permeabilities of the gas mixtures increased with the presence of ch4 the increase in the breakthrough pressure and permeability is proportional to the mole fraction of ch4 in the gas mixture however as in the case of pure co2 the breakthrough pressure of gas mixture is increased by increasing the water saturation their relationship can be expressed as an exponential function pbt aebsw another similarity to the case of pure co2 is that the pore size distribution affects the breakthrough pressure of the gas mixture a sample with a smaller proportion of macropores or smaller pore radii both average and most probable tends to have a greater breakthrough pressure at the same degree of water saturation chromatographic partitioning results show that a gas mixture chromatographically partitions after advancing through a completely or partially water saturated porous medium because of the different solubilities of two gases since co2 is more soluble in water compared to ch4 under the experimental conditions migration of co2 through the pores is restricted thus ch4 gathers at the leading edge of the breakthrough gas facilitating the advancement and breakthrough of ch4 through the sample these results provide us with a better understanding of the behavior of injected co2 mixed with ch4 and help us explore the multi phase flow behavior for varying degrees of water saturation they also provide information applicable to formulating emergency response plans for gas leakage into unsaturated zones the flow characteristics of gas mixtures can help guide co2 enhanced oil recovery and co2 enhanced coalbed methane co2 eor and co2 ecbm projects salinity plays an important role in the gas water rock interactions and various types and concentrations of salts have different influences on gas solubility in water and adsorption amount onto rocks such changes can further affect the wetting and nonwetting phase distributions and flow behaviors future studies should pay attention to the effects of saline water with different salt types and concentrations on the multi phase flow behavior with applications to geological co2 storage and energy storage using ch4 acknowledgments we are very grateful for the assistance of the rock fracture workgroup this work

7584,the behavior of co2 that coexists with ch4 and the effect of ch4 on the co2 stream need to be deeply analyzed and studied especially in the presence of water our previous studies investigated the breakthrough pressure and permeability of pure co2 in five partially saturated low permeability sandstone core samples from the ordos basin and we concluded that rocks with a small pore size and low permeability show considerable sealing capacity even under unsaturated conditions in this paper we selected three of these samples for co2 ch4 gas mixture breakthrough experiments under various degrees of water saturation the breakthrough experiments were performed by increasing the gas pressure step by step until breakthrough occurred then the effluent gas mixture was collected for chromatographic partitioning analysis the results indicate that ch4 significantly affects the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 the presence of ch4 in the gas mixture increases the interfacial tension and thus the breakthrough pressure therefore the injected gas mixture that contains the highest lowest mole fraction of ch4 results in the largest smallest breakthrough pressure the permeability of the gas mixture is greater than that for pure co2 because of ch4 and the effective permeability decreases with increased breakthrough pressure chromatographic partitioning of the effluent mixture gases indicates that ch4 breaks through ahead of co2 as a result of its weaker solubility in water correlations are established between 1 the breakthrough pressure and water saturation 2 the effective permeability and water saturation 3 the breakthrough pressure and effective permeability and 4 the mole fraction of co2 ch4 in the effluent mixture gases and water saturation these results deepen our understanding of the multi phase flow behavior in the porous media under unsaturated conditions which have implications for formulating emergency response plans for gas leakage into unsaturated zones finally knowing the flow characteristic of gas mixture can guide co2 storage co2 eor and co2 ecbm projects future studies should pay attention to the effects of saline water with different salt types and concentrations on the multi phase flow behavior with applications to geological co2 storage and energy storage using ch4 keywords co2 ch4 gas mixture multi phase flow breakthrough pressure low permeability sandstone partially saturated permeability 1 introduction the buildup of co2 in the atmosphere from industrial production processes and modern human activity appears to be causing pronounced climatic changes worldwide ipcc 2005 bachu 2009 scientists have been researching measures and developing techniques to prevent excessive anthropogenic co2 from reaching the atmosphere shukla et al 2010 the geologic storage of co2 has been widely recognized as an important method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions juanes et al 2006 three significant options for co2 geological sequestration to reduce co2 emissions are being explored 1 depleted oil and gas reservoirs 2 unminable coalbeds and 3 deep saline aquifers li et al 2017 zhao and yu 2017 geologic co2 sequestration is the process through which co2 is stored in reservoir formation rock for at least hundreds of years rezaeyan et al 2015 however the sealing capacity of these rocks must be tested because of the buoyant rise of co2 through pores hildenbrand and krooss 2003 song and zhang 2013 the sealing quality of a rock is determined by the gas breakthrough pressure and the quality of effective gas permeability after leakage the breakthrough pressure is essentially determined by the capillary pressure of an interconnected network of pores that are invaded by the gas phase which is closely related to the flow of water and gas in the pores li et al 2005 because changes in water saturation can alter the state of the gas water phase in rock pores as well as the percolating flow path leading to changes in breakthrough pressure and permeability thus multi phase flow characteristics under different degrees of water saturation must be studied deeply to understand the effect of water saturation on the gas breakthrough pressure and permeability researchers have conducted breakthrough experiments to measure breakthrough pressure and permeability schowalter 1979 gallé 2000 li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 however most of these previous studies focused on water saturated core samples hildenbrand et al 2004 chose 26 different water saturated specimens of various lithological compositions to investigate the correlations among the absolute permeability effective permeability and breakthrough pressure li et al 2005 measured the co2 breakthrough pressure for midale evaporite seal rock samples that were first saturated with weyburn formation brine an experimental investigation of the co2 breakthrough pressure and permeability of two initially water saturated pelitic caprock samples was conducted by wollenweber et al 2011 breakthrough tests were conducted on saturated shale or cement specimens by kim and santamarina 2013 additionally rezaeyan et al 2015 conducted breakthrough experiments on two brine saturated samples a shale sample and an anhydrite sample to analyze the breakthrough pressure and effective gas permeability however formation rock is not always under water saturated conditions when injecting millions of tons of co2 into the underground some of the pores in the rock become occupied by co2 and the water that was originally in the pores is removed the pores become variably saturated with co2 and water another important reason for investigating the breakthrough pressure of partially saturated rock is that co2 may leak into unsaturated zones and undergo secondary trapping by impermeable or low permeability rock oldenburg and unger 2003 recent studies on co2 transport in unsaturated zones showed that unsaturated zones could still attenuate co2 leakage jeffrey et al 2016 the low permeability sandstone in the ordos basin is typically considered a reservoir rock just as the conclusions described in zhao and yu 2017 however zhao and yu 2017 also proved that the breakthrough pressure of sandstone with small average pore radius or most probable pore radius could reach as high as 7 83 mpa under low water saturation conditions in other words low permeability sandstone plays an important role in preventing co2 from escaping into the air thus it is important to examine the breakthrough pressure of rocks with different degrees of water saturation breakthrough pressure and permeability measurements have been widely studied in the literature for pure co2 storage schowalter 1979 gallé 2000 hildenbrand et al 2004 li et al 2005 wollenweber et al 2011 boulin et al 2013 kim and santamarina 2013 however co2 with a purity of 100 cannot be found in nature and other gases are always mixed with co2 li et al 2014a rezaeyan et al 2015 from the perspective of economic or risk management the issue of other gases in the co2 stream that is stored in geological media is very important the common gases that accompany co2 are nitrogen n2 methane ch4 sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen dioxide no2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s metz et al 2005 austegard et al 2006 reported that the most common gas in co2 is ch4 co2 and ch4 naturally form from the decomposition diagenesis of organic matter within sediments and sedimentary rocks teasdale et al 2014 de visse et al 2008 suggested that ch4 with a concentration of 1 4 w w could be injected alongside co2 another important factor in the study of co2 ch4 gas mixtures is that co2 geological storage in depleted oil gas reservoirs and unminable coalbeds is an appealing option to mitigate co2 emissions into the atmosphere and enhance the recovery of oil and methane gunter et al 1997 2005 shukla et al 2010 fujioka et al 2010 busch and gensterblum 2011 the ordos basin has a large amount of coalbed methane li et al 2014b li and tang 2015 and natural gas resources gao and wang 2017 however the properties of a low permeability reservoir such as poor porosity and permeability inhibit the production and development of these resources yao et al 2013 yi et al 2015 cheng et al 2016 thus these oil gas reservoirs and coalbeds could be used to store co2 and potentially increase the recovery of oil and gas connell et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 in terms of geological storage the presence of ch4 in the co2 stream has both physical and geochemical influences especially in the presence of water bachu and bennion 2009 as reported the admixing of ch4 affects the compressibility of the injected co2 and reduces the storage capacity of the free phase amin et al 2014 moreover the leakage of these gases must be detected and remediated as quickly as possible all these factors imply the need to study the behavior of co2 ch4 gas mixtures and the effect of ch4 in the co2 stream breakthrough experiments on many of the gases that accompany co2 have been conducted although mostly without mixing these gases with co2 for example n2 has been widely used in breakthrough pressure measurements thomas et al 1968 schowalter 1979 li et al 2005 and hildenbrand et al 2002 2004 conducted laboratory measurements of the gas breakthrough pressure for pure n2 and pure ch4 zhang and yu 2016 investigated the effect of water saturation on the breakthrough pressure of ch4 although certain studies evaluated the breakthrough pressure and permeability of gas mixtures the proportion of co2 and other gases was not clear li et al 2005 or repeated tests were not performed rezaeyan et al 2015 in this paper we conduct a series of co2 ch4 gas mixture breakthrough experiments under various degrees of water saturation our previous study assessed the influence of water saturation on the breakthrough pressure and permeability of pure co2 these pure co2 breakthrough experiments were conducted on five low permeability sandstone samples from the ordos basin for the purpose of comparison three of the same samples were selected for the present study a detailed description of the sample properties experimental equipment and preparation of mixed gases is provided in the experimental materials and apparatus section the experimental methods include procedures for measuring the porosity permeability and breakthrough pressure of samples with different water saturations the experimental pressure and temperature in this section are close to the in situ conditions of co2 geologic storage as in our previous study thus our results realistically reflect the effect of ch4 in the presence of water on the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 the chromatographic partitioning of the two gases that break through the core sample is examined using gas chromatography 2 experimental materials and apparatus 2 1 rock cores the ordos basin has prospective potential for large co2 geologic sequestration because it is the second largest sedimentary basin in china chang et al 2013 tian et al 2015 xie et al 2015 this basin is known for its stability and gentle stratum because it is characterized mainly by subsidence with no large faults even after several crustal movements a number of energy related industries such as steelworks refineries and power plants are located in the ordos basin and emit millions of metric tons of co2 every year into the atmosphere thus the negativeeffectsof co2 must be managed and an economical and efficient method of storing co2 within the ordos basin without transporting it to other sites is required five cylindrical sandstone cores with relatively low permeability from the ordos basin were chosen for pure co2 breakthrough experiments in zhao and yu 2017 under various degrees of water saturation for comparative purposes three of the same cores were used for the breakthrough experiments with co2 ch4 gas mixtures in this study they were extracted from monitoring well no 2 from the shenhua group carbon capture and storage ccs project which is located in the northeastern part of the basin near ejin horo banner inner mongolia fig 1 the core samples were obtained from triassic and permian sandstone formations of the heshangou liujiagou and shiqianfeng groups fig 2 they are referred to as samples 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 3 these core samples were used to conduct aseriesofbreakthrough experiments in zhao and yu 2017 the porosity and permeability shown in table 1 were retested before our experiments additionally table 1 shows the depth diameter and length of the three core samples the mineral content of the cores was determined by x ray diffraction xrd analysis table 2 2 2 experimental apparatus fig 4 shows the experimental setup for the breakthrough pressure and permeability measurements this setup is composed of four main components as follows 1 a core clamping system serves as the core holder the core sample can be wrapped in a fluororubber sleeve and placed in a stainless steel core holder and the core holder is set horizontally in the thermostat this fluororubber sleeve is designed to withstand high acidity and pressure and has high elasticity 2 a gas injection system that is used to inject pure or impure co2 into the core holder at a constant pressure 20 mpa 3 a confining and back pressure system is constructed from a syringe pump which is used to create and maintain the confining pressure around the rock plug and back pressure at the outlet of the core holder to ensure that the confining pressure is always higher than the pore pressure and that the gas or water will flow out only when the pressure exceeds the back pressure 4 a measuring system is constructed from two pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of the core holder and a gas flow meter to measure the gas flow rate at the outlet the pressure and gas flow rate data are recorded by the computer every 30 s as shown in fig 4 the pipelines of the gas container and gas injection system the liquid injection system the core holder the back pressure system valves and pipelines between these systems are all thermostatically controlled the apparatus that is used to measure the porosity fig 5 includes a water bath system a gas cell a sample cell a vacuum unit a data collection unit two pressure gauges and six valves the gas cell is used to store the helium whereas the sample cell is used to store the core samples the main component of this system two cells and a connecting pipe is heated by the water bath system and the pressure in both cells is monitored by two pressure gauges the vacuum system removes the air from the core samples and pipelines the temperature and pressure are recorded every 60 s by the data collection system fig 6 shows the apparatus that is used to obtain a fully water saturated core sample this apparatus consists of a core container a liquid injection system a gas injection system a gas compression system and a vacuum pump system the core container can be placed under a vacuum by the vacuum pump system and the liquid injection system allows deionized water to enter the core container and saturate the core sample inside helium can be pressurized to a desired value by the gas compression system and injected into the core container by the gas injection system the pressure gauge that is connected to the core container shows the interior pressure 2 3 preparation of the mixed gases three types of synthetic gas mixtures gases a b and c were used to investigate the effect of ch4 on the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 each synthetic gas mixture contained different mole fractions of pure co2 and ch4 gas a included 95 mol co2 and 5 mol ch4 gas b included 85 mol co2 and 15 mol ch4 and gas c contained 75 mol co2 and 25 mol ch4 after preparing the gas mixtures gas chromatography gc 2014 was conducted to analyze the gas concentrations and the test results substantiated the accuracy of the gas ratios in the mixture thereby guaranteeing the reliability of the experimental results 3 experimental methods initially the three core samples were air dried under ventilation until their weight remained constant porosity and single phase permeability measurements were performed for these samples next the core samples were saturated to various degrees of water saturation to conduct the following breakthrough experiments during this step effective permeability measurements of the gas mixtures were performed after gas breakthrough was observed 3 1 porosity and permeability measurements the porosity and permeability of the core samples were both measured before the breakthrough experiments for the porosity measurements helium was used to significantly reduce possible measurement errors from gas adsorption the gas cell and sample cell with the core sample were first evacuated for 2 h then helium was injected into the gas cell and stabilized for 2 h at 1 2 mpa for the next two hours opening valve 5 allowed the helium to flow into the sample cell and enter the connected pores of the rock cores the entire system was maintained at 28 c by the water bath system during the experiment the void volumes of the empty sample cell vs and the sample cell with the core sample vs were measured to determine the porosity φ referring to zhao and yu 2017 then the porosity could be defined as follows plug and bruining 2007 1 φ 1 v s v s 1 4 π d 2 l in eq 1 vs and vs include the volume of the pipes between valves 5 and 6 d and l are the diameter and length of the rock core which are listed in table 1 for each sample three measurements were conducted to ensure accuracy and the final porosity was obtained by averaging the three measured values the maximum absolute deviation of the measurement results is 0 22 for sample 2 and the minimum relative deviation is only 0 02 for sample 3 according to the routine core analysis methods of the oil and gas industry in china i e professional standard sy t 5336 2006 china national petroleum company 2006 the highest allowable absolute deviation for porosity measurements should not exceed 0 5 additionally low pressure n2 and co2 adsorption lpa and high pressure mercury intrusion micp were applied to obtain pore size distributions of three samples according to wang and yu 2017 the low pressure adsorption of co2 is always used to characterize pores with diameters 2 nm the lpa of n2 can be used to characterize pores with diameters between 2 and 50 nm and micp is used to characterize pores with diameters 50 nm subsequently the absolute permeability of pure co2 was measured on the core samples before the breakthrough experiments co2 was injected into the dried core sample at a pressure of 0 5 0 03 mpa whereas the confining pressure was maintained above 2 0 mpa when the volumetric flow rate of the gas q that escaped from the outlet and the pressure at the inlet p 1 and outlet p 2 stabilized the permeability could be determined by the following equation huang et al 1984 2 k 2 p a q μ lz a p 1 2 p 2 2 z a where pa is the standard atmospheric pressure μ is the gas dynamic viscosity under the experimental conditions z is the compressibility factor under the experimental conditions za is the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure and l and a are the length and cross sectional area of the core respectively the gas dynamic viscosity and compressibility factor can be found in www ap1700 com and the data from this site are consistent with the united states national bureau of standards nist thermal physical parameters three measurements were conducted to test the accuracy the maximum relative deviation of the measurement results is 10 for sample 1 and the minimum relative deviation is only 1 for sample 2 based on the professional standard sy t 5336 2006 the highest allowable relative deviation should be less than 15 when the permeability of the core sample is smaller than 10 md after the breakthrough experiment the effective permeability of the gas mixture could be obtained using eq 2 to obtain this value we have to obtain the gas mixture dynamic viscosity and compressibility factor the dynamic viscosity of pure gas at a given pressure could be found in www ap1700 com and then the dynamic viscosity of the gas mixture could be determined by the following equation dean and stiel 1965 3 μ m y i μ i m i 1 2 y i m i 1 2 where μm is the dynamic viscosity of the gas mixture under the experimental conditions μi is the dynamic viscosity of component i in the gas mixture under the experimental conditions yi is the mole fraction of component i in the gas mixture and mi is the molecular weight of component i in addition the compressibility factor of the gas mixture could be determined based on amagat s law as follows 4 z m y i z i where zm is the compressibility factor of the gas mixture under the experimental conditions zi is the compressibility factor of component i in the gas mixture under the experimental conditions and yi is the mole fraction of component i in the gas mixture when we replace zi with the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure zia in eq 4 we can obtain the compressibility factor of the gas mixture at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure zma after determining the values of μm zm and zma we can calculate the absolute or effective permeability of the gas mixture km using eq 2 3 2 breakthrough pressure experiments prior to the breakthrough pressure measurements on the core samples an equal size stainless steel cylinder to simulate a zero porosity core sample was used to test the air tightness of the experimental apparatus the result indicated that the confining pressure of 20 mpa is sufficient to prevent gas leakage through possible channels between the sleeve and core sample although the inlet pressure was maintained at 20 mpa for 12 h gas leaks were not observed at the outlet section when the confining pressure was set to 20 mpa the step by step approach which is based on the high accuracy definition of breakthrough pressure schowalter 1979 li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 was used in this study before saturating the core samples breakthrough experiments were performed on the air dried core samples thus we could obtain the breakthrough pressure pbt and absolute permeability kabs of the gas mixture at water saturation sw 0 two experiments were conducted on each dried core sample to determine the experimental accuracy the comparison results show that the breakthrough pressure remains unchanged for samples 1 and 2 and the maximum relative deviation for sample 3 is 3 6 according to the professional standard sy t 5748 2013 china national petroleum company 2013 the highest allowable relative deviation should be less than 20 when the breakthrough pressure is smaller than 10 mpa subsequently we saturated the original air dried core samples with distilled water by first evacuating them to a pressure 0 1 mpa for 12 h then distilled water was injected and the sample was completely submerged in water to ensure uniform saturation subsequently 10 mpa of helium was applied to pressurize the system for at least 12 h until the weight of the sample remained constant at this stage a fully water saturated core sample was obtained and breakthrough pressure experiments could be conducted the details of the breakthrough experimental procedure can be found in zhao and yu 2017 during each test the injection pressure was increased stepwise until the gas broke through the sample the back pressure was set to 8 5 mpa so the initial pressure increase continued at a rapid pace when the injection pressure exceeded the supercritical pressure the pressure increment and interval time between the two pressure stages should be in strict accordance with sy t 5748 2013 table 3 in theory the pressure equilibrium between the wetting and nonwetting phase at the displacement front in the sample will be broken when an increment in pressure occurs therefore the nonwetting phase has to advance through the interconnected channels to reach a smaller pore where the differential pressure is balanced by a larger capillary pressure li et al 2005 this process was repeated until the gas broke through the smallest pore and formed a continuous flow through the sample subsequently the effective gas permeability could be measured during the breakthrough experiments the effective permeability varied with time as a function of water saturation hildenbrand et al 2002 2004 wollenweber et al 2011 rezaeyan et al 2015 the time scale of these literature studies usually exceeded 10 h and sometimes even reached 10 days however the permeability measurements lasted from 0 5 to 1 h in our study to obtain the effective permeability under a certain degree of water saturation the water had difficulty flowing through the pores because of the very low permeability of the samples additionally the back pressure was maintained at 8 5 mpa during the entire experiment which could have prevented water from escaping thus the water saturation did not significantly change in such a short time then the gas mixture effective permeability keff could be obtained from eq 2 by averaging the inlet and outlet pressure and the gas flow rate within this period the breakthrough experiments under various degrees of water saturation 0 sw 1 could involve the above procedure the method for measuring the effective permeability could also be used under different water saturations although the same sample with various degrees of water saturation had to be prepared based on the results and conclusions in section 4 1 several rounds of saturation could not alter the pore structure of the samples or affect the experimental results additionally the water saturated cores were air dried for varying lengths of time to obtain different degrees of water saturation and to avoid damaging the rock cores 5 s w m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 where sw is the water saturation m0 is the dry weight of the core sample m1 is the weight of the water saturated core sample and m2 is the residual weight of the core sample after being air dried for a given time 3 3 chromatographic partitioning analysis bachu and bennion 2009 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to examine the chromatographic partitioning of other gases in a co2 stream in this study a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan was applied for the chromatographic partitioning analysis after each breakthrough pressure experiment the effluent gas that broke through the core sample was collected twice at the outlet section of the core holder by gas collection bags the first collection was immediately performed after gas bubbles were observed at the outlet and the second collection was performed after the measurement of the gas mixture permeability then the collected gas mixture was uniformly injected into the gas chromatograph to analyze the mole fraction of each gas component in the effluent gas then we obtained two sets of data for the mole fraction of each gas composition by comparing the two sets of data and the original mole fraction of each gas composition in the gas mixture we deduced the fate of the injected co2 and ch4 and the order of their breakthrough 4 experimental results 4 1 porosity and permeability measurements the three core samples were used to conduct pure co2 breakthrough experiments in zhao and yu 2017 and were then adopted to conduct breakthrough experiments of gas mixtures in our study the purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of ch4 on the co2 breakthrough pressure and permeability of low permeability sandstone we compared the results of these two experiments for this purpose the properties porosity and permeability of the core samples had to remain consistent to ensure that the differences inthese twoexperimentalresults were caused by different gas components therefore we measured the sample porosity and permeability before both experiments and a comparison of the two sets of values is listed in table 4 the comparison shows that the absolute deviation of the porosity for all three core samples islessthan 0 20 and the smallest is approximately only 0 08 the maximum relative deviation for the permeability is 8 00 and the permeabilities before experiments i and ii are ofthesame order according to the professional standard sy t 5336 2006 the highest allowable absolute relative deviation for porosity permeability measurements should not exceed 0 5 15 hence all the sample properties could be regarded as unchanged which means the saturation process did not modify the pore structure the results of the measured pore size distribution from lpa and micp are shown in table 5 and fig 7 as mentioned above the lpa of co2 and n2 is used to characterize pores with diameters 2 nm and diameters between 2 and 50 nm respectively whereas micp is used to characterize pores with diameters 50 nm table 5 was created according to the classification of pores from the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac by rouquerol et al 1994 pores can be divided into three categories micropores pore diameters 2 nm mesopores pore diameters of 2 50 nm and macropores pore diameters 50 nm table 5 shows that the macropore volume for all three samples comprises a considerable proportion of the total pore volume in addition we obtained two different indices to evaluate the pore size the average pore radius rave and most probable pore radius rm rave is the average value of all the pore radii and rm is the pore radius with the highest probability the average pore radius of samples 1 3 is 0 160 0 151 and 0 035 µm respectively and the most probable pore radius is 0 713 1 760 and 0 028 µm 4 2 breakthrough pressure experiments each sample underwent eighteen breakthrough experiments which were conducted under six different degrees of water saturation 0 100 with three different gas mixtures all the experimental results are listed in table 6 and the breakthrough pressure measurement histories are provided in fig 8 only nine history curves under three different sw with three different gas mixtures for each sample are shown in fig 8 for clarity based on table 6 and fig 8 samples with a higher degree of water saturation have lower permeability and higher breakthrough pressure in addition the breakthrough pressures of samples 1 and 2 slightly increase with increasing water saturation whereas that of sample 3 obviously increases therefore the gas breakthrough time for sample 3 rises significantly with increased water saturation whereas this increase is small for samples 1 and 2 4 3 chromatographic partitioning analysis of the effluent gas the chromatographic partitioning of co2 and associated gas occurs during injection into the subsurface after each breakthrough experiment the gas that broke through the sample and flowed out from the outlet was collected twice considered the initial and second effluent gas respectively and then analyzed by the gas chromatograph the interval between the two collections exactly matched the time that was used for the permeability measurements 0 5 1 h the results are normalized as the mole fraction of a particular gas in the effluent gas then we compared the results to the mole fraction of the respective gas in the original injection gas as seen in fig 9 the two gas component mole fractions in both the initial and second effluent gases are quite close to their original concentration for all the breakthrough experiments that used gas a as the injected gas a similar situation occurred for gas b except for sample 3 the results of the chromatographic partitioning of sample 3 show an apparent deviation from the original gas concentration when using gas c the mole fraction of ch4 in the initial effluent gas is always larger than that in the second effluent gas both values obviously exceed the original mole fraction in the injected gas fig 9 a1 a3 whereas co2 exhibits the opposite trend fig 9 b1 b3 5 discussion 5 1 effect of water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure in the presence of ch4 the results of the gas mixture breakthrough experiments and the breakthrough pressure of pure co2 zhao and yu 2017 of these three identical samples are illustrated in fig 10 a comparison showed that the presence of ch4 in the injected gas mixture played an important role in increasing the breakthrough pressure which may have occurred because of the higher interfacial tension ift of the co2 ch4 water system compared to that of a pure co2 water system researches have been conducted to analyze the ift between water and co2 under both gaseous and supercritical conditions yang et al 2005 chiquet et al 2007 similarly the ift of impure co2 water has been researched in detail in recent years ren et al 2000 yan et al 2001 liu et al 2016 and these research studies covered a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions however these studies all came to a consistent conclusion that the presence of ch4 in the gas mixture increases the ift in addition liu et al 2016 found that the degree of this increase depends on the mole fraction of ch4 in the gas mixture a higher mole fraction of ch4 corresponds to a larger ift between the gas mixture and water such changes undoubtedly increase the breakthrough pressure of ch4 co2 mixtures compared to that of pure co2 therefore the injected gas mixture that contained the highest lowest mole fraction of ch4 produced the largest smallest breakthrough pressure according to the above discussion the breakthrough pressure of the gas mixtures is clearly higher than that of pure co2 because of the presence of ch4 however the breakthrough pressure is raised by increasing the water saturation in both cases the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water saturation could be expressed as an exponential function except in one case sample 2 with pure co2 as described by zhao and yu 2017 the pure co2 breakthrough pressure of sample 2 remained constant as the water saturation increased because the most probable pore radius of the sample reaches 1 760 µm therefore the breakthrough pressure was not affected by the increasing water saturation the exponential fitting curves for all three samples with different gas mixtures and pure co2 are shown in fig 10 the correlation coefficient r2 for sample 1 is higher than 0 93 for samples 2 and 3 the correlation coefficient also nearly reaches 0 9 the high correlation coefficients and good fits in fig 10 indicate that this exponential function pbt aebsw can accurately represent the relationship between pbt and sw the parameters a and b are constant for a specific sample but change for different gas mixtures the fitting parameter a equals pbt when sw is zero and represents the breakthrough pressure of the dried core sample table 7 shows that the parameter a for each sample increases with the increased mole fraction of ch4 in the injected gas mixture which is expected because the breakthrough pressure of the dried core samples presents a notable positive correlation with the mole fraction of ch4 according to the above discussion 5 2 effect of pore size on co2 breakthrough pressure in the presence of ch4 fig 10 shows that the breakthrough pressures of the three gas mixtures for each sample become larger when the water saturation is elevated which is also observed for the pure co2 breakthrough pressures of samples 1 and 3 however the breakthrough pressure of pure co2 in sample 2 remained constant as the water saturation increased because of its high most probable pore radius the same results are not observed for sample 2 when the injected gas contains ch4 which also indicates that the presence of ch4 significantly increases the breakthrough pressure however the direct connection between the pore size distribution and breakthrough pressure could not be ignored tables 5 and 6 show that a smaller macropore proportions in the sample corresponds to a greater breakthrough pressure for the gas mixture under the same water saturation sample 3 presents the highest proportion of mesopores and micropores and produces the largest breakthrough pressure the similar proportions of macropores 89 27 and 90 53 in samples 1 and 2 produce similar breakthrough pressure values 0 3 0 9 mpa and 0 4 0 7 mpa respectively the average or most probable pore radius is inversely correlated to the breakthrough pressure for sample 3 because its small rave and rm lead to the largest breakthrough pressure however this relationship is more complex for samples 1 and 2 although the average pore radius of sample 1 is slightly larger than that of sample 2 the breakthrough pressure of the former exceeds that of the latter when the water saturation become sufficiently high fig 11 this result likely occurred because the most probable pore radius of sample 1 0 713 µm is significantly smaller than that of sample 2 1 760 µm so the remaining pore sizes except for the highest frequency radius rm in sample 1 are much larger than those in sample 2 therefore the average pore sizes of these two samples are similar 0 160 µm and 0 151 µm as shown in fig 7 the pore volume of mesopores with a pore radius of 1 25 nm are greater in sample 2 than in sample 1 and the pore volume of pores with a radius 1 µm is smaller in sample 2 than in sample 1 notably the amount of water within the pores at the beginning of the water saturation process is small and distributed around the surfaces of small pores wu et al 2001 cieslinski and mosdorf 2005 by increasing the water saturation water films accumulate on the pore surfaces and narrow pores will be blocked before water begins to gather in larger pores hence the growth of the breakthrough pressure in sample 2 is more obvious than that in sample 1 at lower degree of water saturation however the main channels for gas flow become macropores once the water saturation becomes sufficiently high therefore sample 2 which has the largest most probable pore radius allows gas to advance more easily through interconnected channels 5 3 effect of water saturation on co2 permeability in the presence of ch4 a comparison was performed for the absolute and effective permeability among the gas mixtures and pure co2 according to the measured gas permeability after the breakthrough experiments in table 6 as shown in fig 12 the presence of ch4 in the gas mixtures increases the absolute permeability moreover higher ch4 mole fraction results in a larger absolute permeability the effective permeability was much lower than the absolute permeability because the effluent gases flow at relatively low gas saturation after breakthrough even under high pressure gradients only a small portion of the interconnected pore space is involved in this transport process hildenbrand et al 2004 decreasing the water saturation creates new gas flow pathways thereby enhancing gas saturation and increasing its effective permeability this finding is consistent with that observed in fig 13 the effective permeability of the gas mixtures decreases with increasing water saturation and their relationship can be described as an exponential function the high correlation coefficient up to 0 9999 indicates the goodnessofthe fit similar to the absolute permeability ch4 obviously influences the effective permeability fig 13 shows that the effective permeability for pure co2 at a given water saturation is lower than those for the gas mixtures and gas mixtures with higher ch4 mole fractions exhibit larger effective permeability regressions have been determined for the pbt and keff data from table 6 and their correlation could be described as a double logarithmic plot fig 14 the effective permeability decreases with increasing breakthrough pressure 5 4 effect of injection gas ch4 concentration on the chromatographic partitioning of the two gases chromatographic partitioning of various gases has been extensively used in the petroleum industry tang 1995 2005 illiassov and datta gupta 2002 bachu and bennion 2009 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to examine the chromatographic partitioning of other gases within a co2 stream that is injected into a deep saline aquifer for the purpose of co2 sequestration and their results indicated that the gas mixtures would chromatographically partition after advancing through the water saturated porous medium because of different solubility in the aquifer water in this study the effluent gas mixtures which were collected twice after each breakthrough experiment were analyzed by gas chromatography and all 108 test results for the co2 and ch4 mole fractions are shown in fig 9 the results showed that the gas mixtures chromatographically partitioned after advancing through a completely or partially water saturated porous medium the mole fractions of these two gas compositions in the effluent gas mixtures could be used to determine their sequence in breaking through the core sample if the mole fraction of a particular gas composition is close to or greater than its original concentration in the injection gas the respective gas is more easily advance through the sample and more likely to break through earlier based on the results in fig 9 the potential breakthrough of ch4 occurs more rapidly for higher concentrations of ch4 in the effluent gas which is consistentwith the conclusions of bachu and bennion 2009 the earlier breakthrough of ch4 relative to co2 is related to the gas solubility because co2 has a higher solubility in water than ch4 the co2 concentration is suppressed at the leading edge of the breakthrough gas therefore the migration of co2 through pores is restricted because of the much lower solubility of ch4 injection gases with higher ch4 concentrations are more likely to facilitate ch4 breakthrough for a given core sample a higher mole fraction of ch4 in the injection gas corresponds to a greater early breakthrough likelihood and higher concentration of ch4 in the effluent gas in all cases the mole fraction of ch4 co2 in the initial effluent gas is larger smaller than that in the second effluent gas which is expected because the dissolution of co2 reaches a saturation point over time therefore the decreasing solubility of co2 will increase the co2 concentration and decrease the ch4 concentration in the second effluent gas in the effluent gas of sample 3 the ch4 concentration was greater relative to the other two samples when gas b was injected as the feed gas this result can be explained by the higher co2 solubility under elevated pressure as the breakthrough pressure of sample 3 is much higher than those of samples 1 and 2 however these three samples shared a common feature for gas c in fig 9 the mole fraction of co2 ch4 basically decreases increases with the increased water saturation indicating a close connection between the co2 or ch4 mole fraction and the water saturation theoretically more co2 will be dissolved under higher water saturation producing smaller larger mole fractions of co2 ch4 in the effluent gas the higher correlation coefficients for the initial effluent gas in fig 15 demonstrate a linear relationship between the gas concentration and water saturation these findings are significant for understanding the fate of co2 ch4 gas mixtures in partially saturated porous media and developing emergency response plans in case of gas leakage into unsaturated zones 6 conclusions a series of breakthrough experiments were conducted under various degrees of water saturation using three gas mixtures with different proportions of co2 and ch4 the results were compared to those from pure co2 breakthrough experiments in our previous study we aimed to assess the effect of ch4 on the breakthrough pressure and permeability as well as the effects of different mole fractions of ch4 in the gas mixtures under different degrees of water saturation we found that the breakthrough pressure of gas mixtures is higher than that of pure co2 because the presence of ch4 increases the ift between gas and water in addition both the absolute and effective permeabilities of the gas mixtures increased with the presence of ch4 the increase in the breakthrough pressure and permeability is proportional to the mole fraction of ch4 in the gas mixture however as in the case of pure co2 the breakthrough pressure of gas mixture is increased by increasing the water saturation their relationship can be expressed as an exponential function pbt aebsw another similarity to the case of pure co2 is that the pore size distribution affects the breakthrough pressure of the gas mixture a sample with a smaller proportion of macropores or smaller pore radii both average and most probable tends to have a greater breakthrough pressure at the same degree of water saturation chromatographic partitioning results show that a gas mixture chromatographically partitions after advancing through a completely or partially water saturated porous medium because of the different solubilities of two gases since co2 is more soluble in water compared to ch4 under the experimental conditions migration of co2 through the pores is restricted thus ch4 gathers at the leading edge of the breakthrough gas facilitating the advancement and breakthrough of ch4 through the sample these results provide us with a better understanding of the behavior of injected co2 mixed with ch4 and help us explore the multi phase flow behavior for varying degrees of water saturation they also provide information applicable to formulating emergency response plans for gas leakage into unsaturated zones the flow characteristics of gas mixtures can help guide co2 enhanced oil recovery and co2 enhanced coalbed methane co2 eor and co2 ecbm projects salinity plays an important role in the gas water rock interactions and various types and concentrations of salts have different influences on gas solubility in water and adsorption amount onto rocks such changes can further affect the wetting and nonwetting phase distributions and flow behaviors future studies should pay attention to the effects of saline water with different salt types and concentrations on the multi phase flow behavior with applications to geological co2 storage and energy storage using ch4 acknowledgments we are very grateful for the assistance of the rock fracture workgroup this work
