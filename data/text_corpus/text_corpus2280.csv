11400,the use of urine and urine derived products can supplement chemical fertilisers there is little information on the use of urine products in agriculture particularly in south africa a laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to determine effects of urine derived sources on nitrogen n release in soil a 5 2 factorial in a completely randomised design was used with two soils differing in clay and carbon contents and five nitrogen n sources unamended control urine struvite effluent stuvite struvite effluent nitrified urine concentrate a follow up tunnel pot trial was conducted to determine effects of the urine derived n sources on dry matter production of perennial ryegrass the experiment was conducted with the cartref soil as a 6 2 factorial in a completely randomised design with the same n sources as in the incubation experiment applied either once off or split replicated three times in the cartref soil lower clay and c ammonium n declined from 1000 to about 3 mg kg from day one to day 70 while nitrate n increased significantly from 0 3 mg kg to about 400 mg kg during the same period conversely ammonium n declined from 100 mg kg to 8 5 mg kg in the inanda soil higher clay and c while nitrate n did not significantly increase split application of urine derived n sources resulted in higher cumulative dry matter 873 993 kg ha than once off application 602 727 kg ha when split applied only struvite effluent resulted in higher drymatter than struvite effluent struvite while once off application resulted in higher drymatter in the nuc 725 kg ha and urine 707 kg ha than struvite effluent 602 kg ha and struvite effluent struvite 663 kg ha the study indicate that urine derived nitrogen sources particularly nitrified urine concentrate can release nitrogen in soil and increase drymatter production of perennial ryegrass particularly with split application keywords ammonium n dry matter production nitrate n nitrified urine concentrate struvite effluent urine 1

struvite production further leads to the need for disposal of the effluent struvite effluent drangert 1998 besides making struvite urine can also be nitrified directly to produce a nutrient source with more of nitrate n than ammonium n giving a product called nitrified urine concentrate nuc which could be important for crop production limited research work has been on the use of urine mnkeni et al 2008 and struvite nongqwenga et al 2017 use for crop production in south africa moreover there is paucity of data on the use of nitrified urine concentrate and struvite effluent in agriculture bonvin 2013 particularly in rsa the objectives of this study were to determine effects urine derived sources on i n release during incubation in soil and ii dry matter production of perennial ryegrass in a pot trial 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil preparation and mixing the cartref soil classified as a typic haplaquept was collected from an arable field in kwadinabakubo area hillcrest south africa 29 46 48 s and 30 45 46 e the inanda soil classified as a rhodic hapludox was collected from arable land at worlds view area 29 33 28 s and 30 18 36 e in kwazulu natal these are among the most important agricultural soils in the kwazulu natal province of south africa the soil samples were taken from the 0 to 30 cm depth using an auger air dried and sieved using a 5 mm sieve table 1 below shows the characteristics of the soils used in the study the soils were both acidic ph 4 with the cartref having 11 clay 0 5 c and 0 08 n and the inanda had 23 clay 6 0 c and 0 56 n 2 2 urine based fertilizer materials most of the urine based plant nutrient sources used in this study was obtained from an experimental site at newlands mashu durban 29 46 3 94 s and 30 58 44 16 e these consisted of stored urine u collected from households around durban using urine diverting ud system struvite s processed from source separated urine and the resultant struvite effluent se remaining after the precipitation of struvite the struvite and struvite effluent were processed at a reactor plant at the newlands mashu experimental site urine used in this study was two weeks old stored in a green plastic tank exposed to outside environmental conditions the concentrated nitrified urine nuc was obtained from eawag switzerland prior to application to the soil the nutrient sources u se and nuc were characterized for n concentration hence urine and urine separated samples of plant nutrient sources were analysed for ammonium n and nitrate n using a 2011 thermo scientific gallery sample analyser and results were obtained in mg l struvite contained 5 7 n in the treatment where struvite effluent was added with struvite half of the total n requirement was supplied by struvite and another half was supplied by struvite effluent phosphorus content was also analysed following method used by worsfold et al 2016 hence for each fertilizer source u se and nuc 2 ml aliquot of the extract was placed in a 50 ml beaker in triplicates and diluted 100 times as p was expected to be high in all samples except for se to which p was expected to be very low since most of the p is precipitated in struvite production colour reagent 10 ml was added slowly to the solution mixed by shaking and allowed to stand for 45 min after which the absorbance was read at 670 nm on a spectrophotometer 2 3 soil incubation studies experimental procedures and design the aerobic incubation experiment was conducted with fertilizer treated soils over a 70 day period under controlled room temperature conditions maintained at 25 c and at 80 relative humidity this experiment was designed as a 5 2 factorial treatment structure replicated 3 times giving 30 experimental units two kg of each of the two soils was filled in ventilated containers the soils were amended with either urine struvite effluent struvite effluent struvite concentrated nitrified urine and no fertilizer the control and replicated three times moisture was adjusted to 100 of whc corrected and maintained at 70 100 whc based on periodic determination of weight loss throughout the study period non destructive sampling was used to collect soil samples from the treatments at days 0 1 2 4 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 and 70 days of the incubation 2 3 1 extraction and analysis of ammonium n the soil samples 5 g were weighed into conical flasks 50 ml potassium chloride 2 m kcl dispensed and the flasks were shaken at 180 cycles per minute on the reciprocal shaker for 30 min okalebo et al 2002 samples were then filtered through bowmen 250 nm filter papers and soil sample extracts were then analysed using 2011 thermo scientific gallery sample analyser 2 4 planting experimental procedure and trial design the experiment was designed as a 6 2 factorial treatment structure replicated 3 times giving 36 experimental units 1 kg pots the factors included six nutrient sources urine struvite effluent struvite effluent struvite nitrified urine 2 3 2 npk and no fertilizer the second factor had two application method once off and split application the split application was done 3 times once after each cut however the control treatments npk and no fertilizer were applied once at recommended rates to meet crop nutrient requirements the experiment was conducted in control environment facility cef at the agriculture campus of the university of kwazulu natal pietermaritzburg south africa tunnel conditions were maintained at 26 c air temperature and 65 atmospheric humidity 2 4 1 fertilizer application during planting phosphorous was highly deficient in the soils and application rates were based on n requirements with the assumption that k will not be limiting the correction for p was done by difference between p supplied by the urine derived source and p fertiliser requirements based on fertiliser recommendation for the cartref soil the extra p was added as single superphosphate ssp as shown on table 2 however p was not limiting in the s se treatment as extra p was supplied by struvite s all additional p supplement ssp was all applied at sowing when 24 2 mg was to be achieved since p is immobile in the soil all fertilizers were added and mixed homogeneously with the soil 2 4 2 planting ryegrass seeds were broadcasted at the rate of 25 kg seed per hectare into1kg soil containing pots this translated into about a gram g of perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l seeds to be sown per pot different plant nutrient sources fertilizers calculated on the basis of n crop requirements for perennial ryegrass was added to the 1 kg pots containing soil deionized water was applied as an irrigation source to maintain 70 moisture content throughout the experiment by experimental unit weight loss method pots were randomized three times a week to give each treatment unit an equal chance of being in any position throughout the study and minimize errors associated with being in a position 2 4 3 plant growth measurements and the determination of dry matter production harvesting was done at pre determined intervals based on crop growth rates 20 cm plant height at 35 45 63 and 79 days after sowing before the harvesting data collection was done on the following crop growth variables seedling emergence after 14 days and seedling emergence rate ser to determine plant height ten healthy growing leaves from each treatment were marked and measured for height using a 30 cm ruler at harvest fresh mass and dry mass was determined as follows plants were cut 5 cm above soil surface at all cuts harvested plants were weighed for the determination of fresh biomass and dried at 60 c for 72 h for the determination of dry mass plants samples were than subsequently taken to the cedara department of agriculture and environmental affairs division of plant fertility analysis for plant tissue analysis 2 5 data analysis data analysis for both soil incubation and pot experiment was carried out using the general linear model repeated measures using the genstat 17 statistical package was used to compare treatment means and the interactions statistical significance was determined at the 5 probability level 3 results 3 1 nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in fertilizer materials as it was expected samples were very high in n urine struvite effluent and nitrified urine concentrate contained 4656 4578 and 35483 mg n l respectively nitrogen was the highest in the nitrified urine concentrate nuc treatment with urine and struvite effluent having almost similar levels phosphorous in the materials was also the highest in nitrified urine followed by urine with struvite effluent having the lowest table 3 3 2 soil incubation experiment 3 2 1 soil ph there were no significant differences p 0 05 observed among fertilizer treatments at the different rates in terms of ph level however soil ph increased with incubation time fig 1 the initial ph was 4 0 and it increased to between 5 6 and 6 6 after 70 days of incubation after fertilizer n sources application in the cartref sand soil ph increase significantly the initial soil ph was 4 0 and it increased to between ph of 5 6 and 6 6 however there were no significant differences among the treatments in the inanda soil acidic ph did not increased significantly the initial soil ph was 4 1 and it increased to between ph 4 4 and 5 2 hence remained in the acidic range at the end of the incubation period fig 1 3 2 2 ammonium n and nitrate n concentrations in cartref soil the incubation results showed in that ammonium n decreased with time after incubation fig 2 treatments where struvite effluent was added with struvite powder had significantly p 0 05 lower ammonium n release than all treatments fig 2 the rest of the treatments did not differ significantly p 0 05 from each other in terms of ammonium n release but had higher levels of ammonium n than the control up to 63 days of incubation time fig 2 nitrate n increased significantly with time during the incubation period fig 3 however there were significant differences p 0 05 when comparing treatments nitrified urine concentrate nuc released significantly more nitrate n than all other treatments evidently nitrified urine concentrate was the first after 28 days to show significant nitrate n increase fig 3 other nutrient source amended treatments did not differ among each other however they all had significantly higher nitrate n release than the control after 49 days of incubation significant loss of mineral n was also observed nevertheless all treatments had higher levels of mineral n than the control throughout the study fig 3 3 2 3 ammonium n and nitrate n concentrations in inanda soil the incubation results showed that ammonium n reduced with time over the 70 day incubation period fig 2 nitrate n did not increase significantly nevertheless the nuc treatment released significantly higher nitrates than other treatments and all other treatments did not differ significantly fig 3 the nuc treatment had significantly higher nitrate n than the control throughout the study tables 4 and 5 3 3 tunnel pot experiment 3 3 1 dry matter production in perennial ryegrass dry matter production increased significantly p 0 05 fig 4 nevertheless there were significant p 0 05 differences observed between the treatments with respect to dry matter production when comparing interaction between treatments u s e s e s and nuc application method split and once off and cuts 4 dry matter production is shown to increased significantly with time after each cut and it declined with time after cut 3 at cut 4 fig 4 all treatments u s e s e s nuc and npk had significantly higher dry matter than the control treatment fig 4 however nuc responded significantly p 0 05 different within cuts the nuc had significantly p 0 05 higher dry matter yield than all treatments there were no significant differences between npk urine and urine products with respect to dry matter production dry matter production declined significantly p 0 05 in all the treatments u s e s e s nuc and npk at the 4th cut with respect to application methods the treatment where the application rate was split had significantly high dry matter production 315 kg ha compared with the once off application 265 kg ha fig 5 nuc had the highest dry matter production followed by struvite effluent se u and s e s the means were 301 289 286 and 284 kg ha respectively 3 3 2 cumulative dry matter in perennial ryegrass the split application method had significantly p 0 05 high cumulative dry matter than the once off application method fig 5 however there were no significant differences among treatments within split rate application method likewise in once off application method 3 3 3 plant nutrient uptake from the waste based fertilizer products and urine and urine separated tissue nutrient concentration in perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l perennial ryegrass nutrient uptake from source supplied by urine and urine separated increased significantly however the control treatment still did not accumulate enough weight to be analyzed as a results it was not analyzed the concentrations of p mg k na zn and cu showed significance differences among treatments u s e s e s nuc and npk the concentration of n ca fe and mn in perennial ryegrass tissue did not differ significantly among all treatments all urine based fertilizer nutrients sources did not differ significantly p 0 05 in p and mg concentrations the urine treatment had significantly lower p than 3 2 3 npk with nuc and s e s having significantly higher levels of mg than the npk others did not differ significantly from the npk all urine based nutrient sources had significantly higher tissue na and less cu and k than npk the treatment u had significantly higher zn than other treatments which all had similar levels 3 4 discussion the high ammonium n observed at the initial stages of incubation in both soil types could be explained by the conversion of the high urea in urine to ammonium n murugan and swarnam 2013 the lower ammonium n in the inanda than the cartref soil could be explained by higher exchangeable acidity which could have limited microbial activity this was supported by the lack of increase in nitrate n in the inanda soil the decline in ammonium n was explained by nitrification as supported by the associated increase in nitrate n during the nitrification process ammonium n is oxidised by nitrifying bacteria resulting in decrease in ammonium n and increase in the nitrate n contents johnson et al 2005 although ammonium n declined from 1000 to about 3 mg kg nitrate n only increased upto 300 mg kg the lack of congruency in nitrate n increase low as opposed to high ammonium n depletion suggested that n was being lost from the soil possibly due to volatilization and ammonification by converting ammonium n into ammonia n gas andersson 2015 the liquid nature of the n sources used could have impacted on significant n loss mnkeni and austin 2009 reported that liquid ammonium n fertilisers tends to evaporate quickly to the air than solid feritilisers in inanda the lack of increases in nitrate n and mineral n were attributed to lack of microorganism s activity to initiate and facilitate mineralization process due to higher exchangeable acidity as shown by the low ph which did not increased with incubation time most of the microorganisms that are responsible for nitrification are not active at acidic condition because of aluminium toxicity mnkeni and austin 2009 aluminium is prevalent at acidic soil condition murugan and swarnam 2013 aluminium impair the functioning of microorganisms monnet et al 2002 moreover in acidic condition most nutrients are not available and microorganisms need the nutrient for their own metabolism this is also explained by the fact that quantities of nitrogen calcium phosphorus and magnesium are generally lower at ph of 5 5 or less wortman 2015 the higher nitrate n in the nuc treatments throughout the incubation period is explained by the higher initial nitrate n in this product than the others the higher ammonium n and nitrate n at the early and later stages respectively than the control suggested that all the urine based nutrient sources could contribute significantly in supplying n for crop growth irrespective of soil type the higher dry matter in the soil treated with urine based nutrient sources than the control suggested that these materials can be used as fertilizer materials to supply nitrogen the initially high ammonium n followed by increase in nitrate n in the cartref soil during the incubation study showed that urine based sources could increase availability of n than unamended soils the greater available n than the control resulted in greater n uptake and drymatter yield of ryegrass this was in agreement with smith 2012 who reported perennial ryegrass is high yielding on irrigated conditions with proper fertilization the higher dry matter yield in the nuc treatment was in response to greater available nitrogen as supported by the mineral n results from the incubation study the higher ammonium n and nitrate n during the early and late stages of incubation respectively suggested that this treatment would make more n available for plant growth plants prefer taking up nitrate n than ammonium n although both species are plant available nyamangara et al 2009 the higher nitrate n in the nuc treatment therefore supported the ryegrass growth better while the tissue n concentrations for all the urine based nutrient sources were similar the dry matter of nuc was higher which suggest a greater n uptake than the other sources the decline in ryegrass yield at the fourth harvest suggested that the nutrients were getting depleted murugan and swarnam 2013 this could be explained by nutrient uptake during earlier harvests and possible losses due to leaching and ammonia volatilization johnson et al 2005 the decline in total mineral n during the incubation study indicated that n was being lost from the system resulting in decline in its availability to plants both volatilization and leaching could explain these changes johnson et al 2005 nyamangara et al 2009 in a soil where there are growing plants the mineral n could be volatilized leached or taken up by the plants mnkeni and austin 2009 nyamangara et al 2009 and murugan and swarnam 2013 reported that mineral n is susceptible to leaching beyond root zone and most of can volatilise with two days if not managed well otherwise plants can take it up for yield production over time the soil mineral n gets depleted resulting in lower uptake nongqwenga et al 2017 the decline in dry matter after the third harvest suggested that if this pasture grass is to be fertilized with urine based nutrient sources more fertilizer material may need to be added after three harvests alternatively split application may need to be practiced to avoid losses and maximize yields the higher dry matter for split application than for once off suggest that greater n was taken up and resulted in greater biomass accumulation the incubation study showed significant decline in ammonium n 1000 3 mg kg and an increase in nitrate n upto 300 mg kg during the same perion suggestion that n losses occurred and as such split application would be essential this is in agreement with smith 2012 who reported that rate of application must be split evenly as possible to meet ryegrass growth needs after harvest although the findings of the incubation trial appeared to show elevated ec levels due to urine based nutrient sources the salts did not show any negative effects on the ryegrass however this could be explained by franch 2010 in that perennial ryegrass is tolerant to wide salinity levels even though there were no salinity effects on the ryegrass such effects need to be monitored if these fertilizer materials are to be repeatedly used 3 5 conclusion amending soils particularly cartref with urine derived sources increases ammonium n and nitrate n availability with higher nitrate n where nitrified urine treatment is used urine and urine derived sources particularly nitrified urine concentrate were effective sources of nitrogen for perennial ryegrass production particularly when split application was used the significant uptake of sodium by perennial ryegrass suggests that possible changes in aggregate stability need to be monitored where these n sources are used further studies needs to focus on i potential nitrogen losses and ii aggregate stability of soils fertilized with urine derived nutrient sources acknowledgements the authors sincerely thank full

between ph of 5 6 and 6 6 however there were no significant differences among the treatments in the inanda soil acidic ph did not increased significantly the initial soil ph was 4 1 and it increased to between ph 4 4 and 5 2 hence remained in the acidic range at the end of the incubation period fig 1 3 2 2 ammonium n and nitrate n concentrations in cartref soil the incubation results showed in that ammonium n decreased with time after incubation fig 2 treatments where struvite effluent was added with struvite powder had significantly p 0 05 lower ammonium n release than all treatments fig 2 the rest of the treatments did not differ significantly p 0 05 from each other in terms of ammonium n release but had higher levels of ammonium n than the control up to 63 days of incubation time fig 2 nitrate n increased significantly with time during the incubation period fig 3 however there were significant differences p 0 05 when comparing treatments nitrified urine concentrate nuc released significantly more nitrate n than all other treatments evidently nitrified urine concentrate was the first after 28 days to show significant nitrate n increase fig 3 other nutrient source amended treatments did not differ among each other however they all had significantly higher nitrate n release than the control after 49 days of incubation significant loss of mineral n was also observed nevertheless all treatments had higher levels of mineral n than the control throughout the study fig 3 3 2 3 ammonium n and nitrate n concentrations in inanda soil the incubation results showed that ammonium n reduced with time over the 70 day incubation period fig 2 nitrate n did not increase significantly nevertheless the nuc treatment released significantly higher nitrates than other treatments and all other treatments did not differ significantly fig 3 the nuc treatment had significantly higher nitrate n than the control throughout the study tables 4 and 5 3 3 tunnel pot

increased significantly with time after each cut and it declined with time after cut 3 at cut 4 fig 4 all treatments u s e s e s nuc and npk had significantly higher dry matter than the control

between npk urine and urine products with respect to dry matter production dry matter production declined significantly p 0 05 in all the treatments u s e s e s nuc and npk at the 4th cut with respect to application methods the treatment where the application rate was split had significantly high dry matter production 315 kg ha compared with the once off application 265 kg ha fig 5 nuc had the highest dry matter production followed by struvite effluent se u and s e s the means were 301 289 286 and 284 kg ha respectively 3 3 2 cumulative dry matter in perennial ryegrass the split application method had significantly p 0 05 high cumulative dry matter than the once off application method fig 5 however there were no significant differences among treatments within split rate application method likewise in once off application method 3 3 3 plant nutrient uptake from the waste based fertilizer products and urine and urine separated tissue nutrient concentration in perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l perennial ryegrass nutrient uptake from source supplied by urine and urine separated increased significantly however the control treatment still did not accumulate enough weight to be analyzed as a results it was not analyzed the concentrations of p mg k na zn and cu showed significance differences among treatments u s e s e s nuc and npk the concentration of n ca fe and mn in perennial ryegrass tissue did not differ significantly among all treatments all urine based fertilizer nutrients sources did not differ significantly p 0 05 in p and mg concentrations the urine treatment had significantly lower p than 3 2 3 npk with nuc and s e s having significantly higher levels of mg than the npk others did not differ significantly from the npk all urine based nutrient sources had significantly higher tissue na and less cu and k than npk the treatment u had significantly higher zn than other treatments which all had similar levels 3 4 discussion the high ammonium n observed at the initial stages of incubation in both soil types could be explained by the conversion of the high urea in urine to ammonium n murugan and swarnam 2013 the lower ammonium n in the inanda than the cartref soil could be explained by higher exchangeable acidity which could have limited microbial activity this was supported by the lack of increase in nitrate n in the inanda soil the decline in ammonium n was explained by nitrification as supported by the associated increase in nitrate n during the nitrification process ammonium n is oxidised by nitrifying bacteria resulting in decrease in ammonium n and increase in the nitrate n contents johnson et al 2005 although ammonium n declined from 1000 to about 3 mg kg nitrate n only increased upto 300 mg kg the lack of congruency in nitrate n increase low as opposed to high ammonium n depletion suggested that n was being lost from the soil possibly due to volatilization and ammonification by converting ammonium n into ammonia n gas andersson 2015 the liquid nature of the n sources used could have impacted on significant n loss mnkeni and austin 2009 reported that liquid ammonium n fertilisers tends to evaporate quickly to the air than solid feritilisers in inanda the lack of increases in nitrate n and mineral n were attributed to lack of microorganism s activity to initiate and facilitate mineralization process due to higher exchangeable acidity as shown by the low ph which did not increased with incubation time most of the microorganisms that are responsible for nitrification are not active at acidic condition because of aluminium toxicity mnkeni and austin 2009 aluminium is prevalent at acidic soil condition murugan and swarnam 2013 aluminium impair the functioning of microorganisms monnet et al 2002 moreover in acidic condition most nutrients are not available and microorganisms need the nutrient for their own metabolism this is also explained by the fact that quantities of nitrogen calcium phosphorus and magnesium are generally lower at ph of 5 5 or less wortman 2015 the higher nitrate n in the nuc treatments throughout the incubation period is explained by the higher initial nitrate n in this product than the others the higher ammonium n and nitrate n at the early and later stages respectively than the control suggested that all the urine based nutrient sources could contribute significantly in supplying n for crop growth irrespective of soil type the higher dry matter in the soil treated with urine based nutrient sources than the control suggested that these materials can be used as fertilizer materials to supply nitrogen the initially high ammonium n followed by increase in nitrate n in the cartref soil during the incubation study showed that urine based sources could increase availability of n than unamended soils the greater available n than the control resulted in greater n uptake and drymatter yield of ryegrass this was in agreement with smith 2012 who reported perennial ryegrass is high yielding on irrigated conditions with proper fertilization the higher dry matter yield in the nuc treatment was in response to greater available nitrogen as supported by the mineral n results from the incubation study the higher ammonium n and nitrate n during the early and late stages of incubation respectively suggested that this treatment would make more n available for plant growth plants prefer taking up nitrate n than ammonium n although both species are plant available nyamangara et al 2009 the higher nitrate n in the nuc treatment therefore supported the ryegrass growth better while the tissue n concentrations for all the urine based nutrient sources were similar the dry matter of nuc was higher which suggest a greater n uptake than the other sources the decline in ryegrass yield at the fourth harvest suggested that the nutrients were getting depleted murugan and swarnam 2013 this could be explained by nutrient uptake during earlier harvests and possible losses due to leaching and ammonia volatilization johnson et al 2005 the decline in total mineral n during the incubation study indicated that n was being lost from the system resulting in decline in its availability to plants both volatilization and leaching could explain these changes johnson et al 2005 nyamangara et al 2009 in a soil where there are growing plants the mineral n could be volatilized leached or taken up by the plants mnkeni and austin 2009 nyamangara et al 2009 and murugan and swarnam 2013 reported that mineral n is susceptible to leaching beyond root zone and most of can volatilise with two days if not managed well otherwise plants can take it up for yield production over time the soil mineral n gets depleted resulting in lower uptake nongqwenga et al 2017 the decline in dry matter after the third harvest suggested that if this pasture grass is to be fertilized with urine based nutrient sources more fertilizer material may need to be added after three harvests alternatively split application may need to be practiced to avoid losses and maximize yields the higher dry matter for split application than for once off suggest that greater n was taken up and resulted in greater biomass accumulation the incubation study showed significant decline in ammonium n 1000 3 mg kg and an increase in nitrate n upto 300 mg kg during the same perion suggestion that n losses occurred and as such split application would be essential this is in agreement with smith 2012 who reported that rate of application must be split evenly as possible to meet ryegrass growth needs after harvest although the findings of the incubation trial appeared to show elevated ec levels due to urine based nutrient sources the salts did not show any negative effects on the ryegrass however this could be explained by franch 2010 in that perennial ryegrass is tolerant to wide salinity levels even though there were no salinity effects on the ryegrass such effects need to be monitored if these fertilizer materials are to be repeatedly used 3 5 conclusion amending soils particularly cartref with urine derived sources increases ammonium n and nitrate n availability with higher nitrate n where nitrified urine treatment is used urine and urine derived sources particularly nitrified urine concentrate were effective sources of nitrogen for perennial ryegrass production particularly when split application was used the significant uptake of sodium by perennial ryegrass suggests that possible changes in aggregate stability need to be monitored where these n sources are used further studies needs to focus on i potential nitrogen losses and ii aggregate stability of soils fertilized with urine derived nutrient sources acknowledgements the authors sincerely thank full

11401,crop coefficient kc based estimation of crop water consumption is one of the most commonly used methods for irrigation management spectral modeling of kc is possible due to the high correlations between kc and the crop phenologic development and spectral reflectance in this study cotton evapotranspiration was measured in the field using several methods including eddy covariance surface renewal and heat pulse kc was estimated as the ratio between reference evapotranspiration and the measured cotton evapotranspiration in addition a time series of sentinel 2 imagery was processed to produce 22 vegetation indices vis based on the sensor s unique spectral bands empirical kc vi models were derived and ranked according to their prediction error in accordance with previous studies we found a strong correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and kc r2 0 94 and yet we also identified other spectral indices that are more strongly correlated to kc the indices that were found to be the most suitable for kc prediction were based on the red and red edge bands mtci rep and s2rep this progress in estimating cotton water consumption using satellite imagery that are available at no cost is a leap forward towards the development of crop irrigation requirements models consequently this work sets the scene for near real time irrigation decision support systems keywords eddy covariance remote sensing irrigation evapotranspiration spectral modeling 1 introduction monitoring the changes of soil and crops status in agricultural fields throughout the growing season is key in increasing the production efficiency as the crop develops from seedling to a fully mature plant its transpiration changes accordingly and so do the crop water requirements in the early stages of the growing season the majority of the evapotranspiration is attributed to evaporation from the soil surface yet as the crop develops the relative contribution of transpiration to the evapotranspiration increases as the vegetation cover increases and eventually declines with maturity and senescence allen et al 1998 therefore information about the crop evapotranspiration etc which represents the combined water loss due to evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from the crop can facilitate better irrigation planning and ultimately water use efficiency the crop coefficient kc approach for estimating etc relies on the estimation of reference evapotranspiration from a hypothetical crop et0 such that etc kc x et0 allen et al 1998 while et0 is either calculated based on standard meteorological measurements using the penman monteith method or based on pan evaporation measurements kc is derived experimentally per crop and soil type and thus separates the climatic demand from the plant response duchemin et al 2006 kumar et al 2012 the united nations food and agricultural organization fao has provided details on the development and use of kc values for different crops in different parts of the world allen et al 1998 however kc has been shown to vary between sites and between seasons v kumar et al 2015 additionally in cases of atypical crop development and water use patterns caused by weather anomalies adopting the fao recommended kc values often results with imprecise etc estimations hunsaker et al 2003 as a result local adaptations to the fao recommended kc values are implemented to form local kc tables but even these sometimes fail to capture deviations from standard conditions due to specific fertilization variations in crop planting density and stress factors such as pests v kumar et al 2015 in addition the spatial variation in etc due to spatial heterogeneity in soil characteristics such as water holding capacity and nutrients availability is not reflected in standard kc tables accordingly in the absence of reliable real time information about etc there is a need for better kc estimates one approach to address this need is by using satellite remote sensing imagery this technology is attractive for modeling kc since it provides a synoptic coverage at fixed time intervals and can therefore monitor changes over time rozenstein and adamowski 2017a b moreover spectral vegetation indices vis derived from remote sensing imagery are highly correlated with crop characteristics including biomass leaf area index lai plant height and yield thenkabail et al 2000 duchemin et al 2006 park et al 2017 similarly vis can serve as near real time surrogates for kc since they depict a similar temporal pattern jackson et al 1980 kamble et al 2013 although the commonly used normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is known to saturate at lai 3 asner et al 2004 there is a similarity between the ndvi lai and kc lai curves suggesting that both plant transpiration and light absorption increase roughly at the same rate at the beginning of the season and then saturates duchemin et al 2006 since both kc and ndvi saturate at about the same time the loss of accuracy in the estimate of high lai due to ndvi saturation will have little impact on the accuracy of transpiration estimates and in addition the relationship between ndvi and kc is linear duchemin et al 2006 in order to model kc using vis most previous studies employed etc field measurements using lysimeters or eddy covariance systems kamble et al 2013 er raki et al 2013 park et al 2017 jin et al 2017 in other studies field measurements were not conducted to estimate kc but some adaptations from fao recommendations were made for the local meteorological conditions e g ray and dadhwal 2001 farg et al 2012 hence ground truth i e evapotranspiration measurements in the field can be used as training data for kc prediction models based on remote sensing vis the basic limitation of satellite remote sensing application for irrigation management is the compromise between the sensor s revisit time and spatial resolution sensors with a short revisit time such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis that provides daily coverage are characterized by a coarse spatial resolution 250 m while sensors with medium spatial resolution such as the landsat series are characterized by longer revisit times 16 days cloudy conditions further reduce the temporal resolution for all optical sensors thus posing another limitation on operational applications irrigation management decisions for field crop should ideally be based on a dense time series of imagery that are fine grained enough to distinguish between field plots commercial high spatial resolution satellite sensors such as the worldview series rapideye geoeye quickbird and ikonos are not routinely employed for crop monitoring because their imagery are not public domain and come at a significant cost rendering them too expensive for most operational agricultural applications therefore in spite of established kc vis models the limited availability of imagery with suitable temporal and spatial resolutions at no or low cost hindered the development of worldwide operational systems to estimate kc from vis and prevented wide remote sensing application for near real time irrigation decisions the successful recent deployment of the two sentinel 2 satellites creates a unique opportunity for operational kc estimates sentinel 2 multispectral spaceborne imagery with a 5 day revisit time obtained by the combination of sentinel 2 a and sentinel 2b data can potentially create a dense kc time series at 10 m spatial resolution which would allow the application of this technique even for small fields frampton et al 2013 it was recently demonstrated that a combination of landsat 8 30 m 16 day revisit deimos 1 22 m 3 day revisit and the spot4 take5 experiment 20 m 5 day revisit can produce an observation frequency similar to sentinel 2 a and sentinel 2b albeit at a lower spatial resolution battude et al 2017 additionally most of the vis that have been previously employed for this task were based on bands covering the visible and near infrared nir spectral regions since these bands were traditionally available for sensors like landsat and spot thenkabail et al 2000 battude et al 2017 sentinel 2 also features those traditional bands alongside additional bands in the red edge region that is very sensitive to crop characteristics such as leaf area index viña et al 2011 frampton et al 2013 nguy robertson et al 2014 the above literature review suggests that sentinel 2 imagery offers an acceptable compromise between the revisit time and spatial resolution with increased spectral abilities for vegetation monitoring compared to previous public domain spaceborne imagery hence the overarching aim of this research was to develop methodology to estimate cotton water consumption based on sentinel 2 imagery the key objectives of this study were to 1 estimate daily etc experimentally in the field and 2 develop empirical models that link etc with remotely sensed spectral indices from sentinel 2 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the measurements took place during the summer of 2016 in a cotton field near gedera in the shfela region in israel fig 1 this field was chosen because it was relatively flat and large enough to contain most of the flux footprint measured by the eddy covariance system described in section 2 2 1 field had a trapeze shape with a mean length of 780 m and mean width of 540 m the long dimension was oriented east west see fig 1 right cotton cv pima was sowed in the soil in east west rows on march 10 2016 and was drip fertigated precipitation and irrigation during the growing season are plotted in fig 2 the irrigation was stopped on september 5 2016 and the cotton was harvested on october 5 2016 field measurements were conducted during july and august 2016 the local summer climate is rainless with little variation from day to day according to data supplied by the agro meteorology unit of the israel ministery of agriculture and rural development from the revadim meteorological station about 4 km south of the experiment location between january 2008 and december 2016 the annual average number of rainy days i e rainfall 1 mm was 51 with an annual average rainfall of 469 mm there was no rainfall during the summer months june through august the annual average and the growing season average march september of meteorological data from 2008 to 2016 were relative humidity 64 6 and 64 4 respectively relative humidity at 12 00 gmt 49 9 and 47 7 respectively mean daily air temperature 20 2 and 22 8 c respectively mean daily minimum air temperature 15 4 and 17 5 c respectively and corresponding mean daily maximum temperature 25 5 and 28 3 c respectively 2 2 agro meteorological measurements these measurements were conducted to determine et0 and etc from which the crop coefficient kc was calculated et0 was calculated based on meteorological data and etc was measured by three approaches eddy covariance surface renewal and heat pulse 2 2 1 reference evapotranspiration et0 the agro meteorology unit of the israel ministery of agriculture and rural development regularly estimates the reference evapotranspiration et0 at selected locations across israel in this study et0 was calculated according to the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 based on meteorological measurements of temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar irradiance at the revadim meteorological station located about 4 km south of the study site this public domain data is available for download from http www meteo co il 2 2 2 eddy covariance ec direct measurements of etc actual crop evapotranspiration were done by an eddy covariance system that measured latent le and sensible h heat fluxes an eddy covariance ec system was deployed at a height of 3 65 m on a tower located within the field fig 1b at a position that allowed a fetch of about 400 m for the prevailing northwesterly wind the system consisted of a three axis ultrasonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific logan ut usa that measured the wind speed vector and sonic temperature and an infra red gas analyzer irga model li 7500 li cor lincoln ne usa that measured water vapor concentration to minimize wind distortion effects the csat3 anemometer head was oriented towards the approximate direction of the predominant wind raw signals from the ec system were sampled at 20 hz signals were recorded on a cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa and later processed by the eddypro software li cor lincoln ne usa to generate the flux data the eddypro software estimated the distance of the 90 flux footprint of each 30 min data point later used to select the analysis polygon see section 2 3 1 ec evapotranspiration data were used for doys 180 189 195 206 211 213 215 217 221 228 243 244 249 251 256 257 2 2 3 surface energy balance the validity of the ec flux measurements is commonly examined by analysing the energy balance closure wilson et al 2002 in this analysis half hourly values of consumed energy of latent and sensible heat le h are regressed against corresponding values of the available energy rn g where rn is net radiation and g is soil heat flux additional measurements facilitated energy balance closure analysis net radiation rn was measured with a net radiometer q 7 1 rebs seattle wa usa installed at 3 65 m height on the same pole of the ec system air temperature and relative humidity were measured by a sensor hmp45 campbell sci logan ut usa positioned at a height of 3 5 m within a ventilated radiation shield soil heat flux g was measured with four soil heat flux plates hft 3 1 rebs seattle wa usa installed at a depth of 0 08 m within the soil and two thermocouples type t copper constantan that were installed in the soil layer above each plate at depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m total of 8 thermocouples the calculation of soil heat flux and storage was done similarly to the procedure described by rosa et al 2013 and tanny et al 2006 thirty minute averages of measured variables net radiation soil heat flux and soil temperatures were recorded on a cr23x data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa all the equipment was powered by car batteries that were charged during the day by solar panels 2 2 4 surface renewal sr the surface renewal method estimates h the sensible heat flux from high frequency single point temperature measurement and then extracts the evapotranspiration as a residual of the energy balance closure paw u et al 1995 the method proved reliable for cotton evapotranspiration measurements rosa and tanny 2015 in the present field experiment a miniature thermocouple type t 50 μm in diameter coco 002 omega eng uk was installed at 1 5 m height on the same mast of the ec system the sensor measured air temperature at 10 hz and raw data was recorded on a cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa sensible heat flux calculated by sr data analysis spano et al 1997 was calibrated against direct ec measurements and the calibration coefficient was utilized during periods when ec data were unavailable sr evapotranspiration data were used for doys 207 210 and 218 220 2 2 5 heat pulse sap flow measurements were conducted using the heat pulse technique sensors were installed in 12 cotton plants about 200 m west of the position of the ec mast in the present analysis we assume that for the high density cotton field soil evaporation is negligible hence evapotranspiration and transpiration are equal sf transpiration data were used for doys 235 242 245 248 252 255 258 261 2 2 6 derivation of the crop coefficient kc the crop coefficient was derived according to allen et al 1998 1 k c e t c e t o where e t c is the crop evapotraspiration as measured by eddy covariance surface renewal or sap flow method our gold standard was the eddy covariance measurement however at times the eddy covariance system failed creating a gap in the time series during the days that the eddy covariance system did not provide data e t c was estimated using either the surface renewal or the sap flow measurements 2 3 satellite measurements 2 3 1 pre processing a total of seven relatively cloud free sentinel 2 a images acquired during the cotton growing season were analyzed in this study including five images that coincide with our agro meteorological measurements the images were atmospherically corrected using sen2cor louis et al 2016 and processed using the sentinel 2 toolbox an extension of sentinel application platform snap gascon and ramoino 2017 in order to select the pixels for analysis a polygon defining the borders of the cotton field was demarked fig 3 a furthermore the point density of the 90 flux footprint of eddy covariance measurements taken between 7 am and 6 pm was calculated fig 3b a threshold of 0 018 points per m2 was selected to create a second polygon representing the area from which most of the flux measured by the eddy covariance system was originated fig 3c cloud and cloud shadow masks were generated for the five sentinel 2 a images that coincide with the agro meteorological measurements the intersection between the field borders the area that represents the flux footprint and the cloud masks defined the polygon of the analysis area fig 3d 2 3 2 spectral indices we applied the 22 vegetation indices included in snap to all of the images throughout the growing season table 1 linear regression models were developed for the time series of field measured kc and the time series of each spectral index r2 and root mean square error rmse values were calculated for every model the kc ndvi model developed in this study was compared to other similar models from the literature that were developed for cotton montgomery et al 2015 and with a general field crop model kamble et al 2013 in addition the field measured kc values and the estimates of kc ndvi models were compared with the recommended kc for cotton in this region that is provided by the israeli extension service 3 results energy balance closure was analyzed in order to verify the eddy covariance flux measurements fig 4 the 0 96 slope which represents a nearly perfect closure and high coefficient of determination r2 0 92 between le h and rn g demonstrate that the eddy covariance fluxes were reliable in determining the crop evapotranspiration the mid late season kc demonstrates a very similar temporal pattern to ndvi fig 5 linear regression models between each of the 22 vis and kc were derived fig 6 and most of these models show high correlation between kc and the sentinel 2 vis table 2 these results strengthen the case for using vis as surrogates for kc the three best models ranked according to rmse are based on vi composed of bands covering the red and red edge spectral bands mtci rep s2rep models based on five more indices arvi savi msavi2 ipvi msavi performed better in predicting kc than the popularly used ndvi however despite its hinge on red and red edge bands ireci pssra and mcari did not perform better than ndvi for predicting kc comparison of the ndvi model developed in this study with models from the literature kamble et al 2013 montgomery et al 2015 shows an increase of about one order of magnitude in rmse in the other models fig 7 even though the kamble et al 2013 model is a general model developed for multiple field crops and the montgomery et al 2015 model was developed for cotton both have similar prediction errors and they both over estimate kc by about 0 2 compared to our field measurements and by 0 04 to 0 36 compared to the standard recommendation by the israeli extension service fig 8 the israeli extension service recommendation was higher than the measured kc for most of the time except for one point at the end of the season fig 8 therefore following the standard israeli extension service kc table recommendations the montgomery et al 2015 model or the kamble et al 2013 model would lead to excess irrigation 4 discussion our results suggest that most vis that are based on sentinel 2 bands are suitable predictors for cotton kc and that those based on the red and red edge spectral bands mtci rep and s2rep are the best ones in contrast to previous studies that mostly used vis based on red and nir bands ndvi savi etc to model kc our study suggests that we can now develop more accurate models using the new sentinel 2 compared to previous sensors e g landsat this result is in agreement with previous studies that showed that red edge based vis correlate better with chlorophyll content and lai viña et al 2011 frampton et al 2013 nguy robertson et al 2014 therefore it is not surprising that these indices exhibited the highest correlations with our field measured kc our kc estimation models for cotton were different from the standard kc recommendations by ies and different from literature kc estimates based on vi ndvi models this suggests that kc vi models are specific to local conditions and accordingly their development and application should be crop and region specific to achieve the best kc estimation therefore published kc vi models should be very carefully adapted for use in different settings than the ones they were developed in our field measurements were carried out during the mid late stages of the growing season this can explain the extremely high correlation we found for some kc vi models peaks in evaporation following irrigation or rain events and the sensitivity of some vis to the soil top layer wetness usually result with lower kc vi correlations at the beginning of the season when the vegetation is sparse and higher at the end of the season since the vegetation even senescent is limiting soil evaporation e g duchemin et al 2006 thus the models presented in this paper still require further testing and possibly adaptations to extend their application to the entire growing season in a future study we intend to perform eddy covariance measurements throughout the growing season to validate and improve the models developed in this study in addition kc estimates are based on an assumption that the commercial field where the experiment took place was well watered which is the common practice of cotton growers in this region and indeed the irrigation fig 2 was consistently higher than the field measurements of crop evapotranspiration the reason for this assumption is that kc vi models based on optical remote sensing data do not allow estimating actual evapotranspiration but provide a maximal value that would be observed if water were readily available in the soil duchemin et al 2006 therefore at this stage the present remote sensing based kc estimates may prove inaccurate for a water stressed crop while our study was conducted during the summer of 2016 when data from only sentinel 2 a was available nowadays sentinel 2b is already in orbit and operational thus for future studies the technique demonstrated in this paper can be applied at double the temporal resolution even with only sentinel 2 a at our disposal we were able to obtain seven clear images during the mid late growing season unlike other studies that interpolated the vi time series between satellite image acquisition to compensate for the low temporal resolution of imagery e g duchemin et al 2006 we did not perform any interpolation and relied solely on actual sentinel 2 measurements to ensure that the model is calibrated using actual field measurements since our field measurements were not entirely continuous we did not measure etc on every day and as a result our models are based on only five out of the seven available images together sentinel 2 a and sentinel 2b offer better revisit time 5 days vs 16 days and better spatial resolution 10 m vs 30 m compared to landsat 8 however landsat 8 s thermal infrared sensor tirs does provide information on the land surface temperature rozenstein et al 2014 that is not available from sentinel 2 and therefore in the context of modeling evapotranspiration landsat 8 is still extremely valuable senay et al 2016 moreover the harmonized landsat sentinel 2 data set that is currently under development masek et al 2015 flood 2017 can further improve the revisit time at the expense of spatial resolution the harmonized product resolution is 30 m and the loss of red edge based indices since landsat 8 operational land imager oli does not include red edge bands 5 conclusion sentinel 2 is superior to older generations of public domain satellite data in terms of spatial temporal and spectral resolutions this allows for the first time to estimate kc an important parameter for irrigation management at a high frequency that can support irrigation decisions at a fine spatial resolution of 10 m that well captures within field variability and at higher accuracy than before owing to the sensor s unique spectral bands that cover the red edge region acknowledgmentsthis study was partially supported by an aro start up grant

season is key in increasing the production efficiency as the crop develops from seedling to a fully mature plant its transpiration changes accordingly and so do the crop water requirements in the early stages of the growing season the majority of the evapotranspiration is attributed to evaporation from the soil surface yet as the crop develops the relative contribution of transpiration to the evapotranspiration increases as the vegetation cover increases and eventually declines with maturity and senescence allen et al 1998 therefore information about the crop evapotranspiration etc which represents the combined water loss due to evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from the crop can facilitate better irrigation planning and ultimately water use efficiency the crop coefficient kc approach for estimating etc relies on the estimation of reference evapotranspiration from a hypothetical crop et0 such that etc kc x et0 allen et al 1998 while et0 is either calculated based on standard meteorological measurements using the penman monteith method or based on pan evaporation measurements kc is derived experimentally per crop and soil type and thus separates the climatic demand from the plant response duchemin et al 2006 kumar et al 2012 the united nations food and agricultural organization fao has provided details on the development and use of kc values for different crops in different parts of the world allen et al 1998 however kc has been shown to vary between sites and between seasons v kumar et al 2015 additionally in cases of atypical crop development and water use patterns caused by weather anomalies adopting the fao recommended kc values often results with imprecise etc estimations hunsaker et al 2003 as a result local adaptations to the fao recommended kc values are implemented to form local kc tables but even these sometimes fail to capture deviations from standard conditions due to specific fertilization variations in crop planting density and stress factors such as pests v kumar et al 2015 in addition the spatial variation in etc due to spatial heterogeneity in soil characteristics such as water holding capacity and nutrients availability is not reflected in standard kc tables accordingly in the absence of reliable real time information about etc there is a need for better kc estimates one approach to address this need is by using satellite remote sensing imagery this technology is attractive for modeling kc since it provides a synoptic coverage at fixed time intervals and can therefore monitor changes over time rozenstein and adamowski 2017a b moreover spectral vegetation indices vis derived from remote sensing imagery are highly correlated with crop characteristics including biomass leaf area index lai plant height and yield thenkabail et al 2000 duchemin et al 2006 park et al 2017 similarly vis can serve as near real time surrogates for kc since they depict a similar temporal pattern jackson et al 1980 kamble et al 2013 although the commonly used normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is known to saturate at lai 3 asner et al 2004 there is a similarity between the ndvi lai and kc lai curves suggesting that both plant transpiration and light absorption increase roughly at the same rate at the beginning of the season and then saturates duchemin et al 2006 since both kc and ndvi saturate at about the same time the loss of accuracy in the estimate of high lai due to ndvi saturation will have little impact on the accuracy of transpiration estimates and in addition the relationship between ndvi and kc is linear duchemin et al 2006 in order to model kc using vis most previous studies employed etc field measurements using lysimeters or eddy covariance systems kamble et al 2013 er raki et al 2013 park et al 2017 jin et al 2017 in other studies field measurements were not conducted to estimate kc but some adaptations from fao recommendations were made for the local meteorological conditions e g ray and dadhwal 2001 farg et al 2012 hence ground truth i e evapotranspiration measurements in the field can be used as training data for kc prediction models based on remote sensing vis the basic limitation of satellite remote sensing application for irrigation management is the compromise between the sensor s revisit time and spatial resolution sensors with a short revisit time such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis that provides daily coverage are characterized by a coarse spatial resolution 250 m while sensors with medium spatial resolution such as the landsat series are characterized by longer revisit times 16 days cloudy conditions further reduce the temporal resolution for all optical sensors thus posing another limitation on operational applications irrigation management decisions for field crop should ideally be based on a dense time series of imagery that are fine grained enough to distinguish between field plots commercial high spatial resolution satellite sensors such as the worldview series rapideye geoeye quickbird and ikonos are not routinely employed for crop monitoring because their imagery are not public domain and come at a significant cost rendering them too expensive for most operational agricultural applications therefore in spite of established kc vis models the limited availability of imagery with suitable temporal and spatial resolutions at no or low cost hindered the development of worldwide operational systems to estimate kc from vis and prevented wide remote sensing application for near real time irrigation decisions the successful recent deployment of the two sentinel 2 satellites creates a unique opportunity for operational kc estimates sentinel 2 multispectral spaceborne imagery with a 5 day revisit time obtained by the combination of sentinel 2 a and sentinel 2b data can potentially create a dense kc time series at 10 m spatial resolution which would allow the application of this technique even for small fields frampton et al 2013 it was recently demonstrated that a combination of landsat 8 30 m 16 day revisit deimos 1 22 m 3 day revisit and the spot4 take5 experiment 20 m 5 day revisit can produce an observation frequency similar to sentinel 2 a and sentinel 2b albeit at a lower spatial resolution battude et al 2017 additionally most of the vis that have been previously employed for this task were based on bands covering the visible and near infrared nir spectral regions since these bands were traditionally available for sensors like landsat and spot thenkabail et al 2000 battude et al 2017 sentinel 2 also features those traditional bands alongside additional bands in the red edge region that is very sensitive to crop characteristics such as leaf area index viña et al 2011 frampton et al 2013 nguy robertson et al 2014 the above literature review suggests that sentinel 2 imagery offers an acceptable compromise between the revisit time and spatial resolution with increased spectral abilities for vegetation monitoring compared to previous public domain spaceborne imagery hence the overarching aim of this research was to develop methodology to estimate cotton water consumption based on sentinel 2 imagery the key objectives of this study were to 1 estimate daily etc experimentally in the field and 2 develop empirical models that link etc with remotely sensed spectral indices from sentinel 2 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the measurements took place during the summer of 2016 in a cotton field near gedera in the shfela region in israel fig 1 this field was chosen because it was relatively flat and large enough to contain most of the flux footprint measured by the eddy covariance system described in section 2 2 1 field had a trapeze shape with a mean length of 780 m and mean width of 540 m the long dimension was oriented east west see fig 1 right cotton cv pima was sowed in the soil in east west rows on march 10 2016 and was drip fertigated precipitation and irrigation during the growing season are plotted in fig 2 the irrigation was stopped on september 5 2016 and the cotton was harvested on october 5 2016 field measurements were conducted during july and august 2016 the local summer climate is rainless with little variation from day to day according to data supplied by the agro meteorology unit of the israel ministery of agriculture and rural development from the revadim meteorological station about 4 km south of the experiment location between january 2008 and december 2016 the annual average number of rainy days i e rainfall 1 mm was 51 with an annual average rainfall of 469 mm there was no rainfall during the summer months june through august the annual average and the growing season average march september of meteorological data from 2008 to 2016 were relative humidity 64 6 and 64 4 respectively relative humidity at 12 00 gmt 49 9 and 47 7 respectively mean daily air temperature 20 2 and 22 8 c respectively mean daily minimum air temperature 15 4 and 17 5 c respectively and corresponding mean daily maximum temperature 25 5 and 28 3 c respectively 2 2 agro meteorological measurements these measurements were conducted to determine et0 and etc from which the crop coefficient kc was calculated et0 was calculated based on meteorological data and etc was measured by three approaches eddy covariance surface renewal and heat pulse 2 2 1 reference evapotranspiration et0 the agro meteorology unit of the israel ministery of agriculture and rural development regularly estimates the reference evapotranspiration et0 at selected locations across israel in this study et0 was calculated according to the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 based on meteorological measurements of temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar irradiance at the revadim meteorological station located about 4 km south of the study site this public domain data is available for download from http www meteo co il 2 2 2 eddy covariance ec direct measurements of etc actual crop evapotranspiration were done by an eddy covariance system that measured latent le and sensible h heat fluxes an eddy covariance ec system was deployed at a height of 3 65 m on a tower located within the field fig 1b at a position that allowed a fetch of about 400 m for the prevailing northwesterly wind the system consisted of a three axis ultrasonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific logan ut usa that measured the wind speed vector and sonic temperature and an infra red gas analyzer irga model li 7500 li cor lincoln ne usa that measured water vapor concentration to minimize wind distortion effects the csat3 anemometer head was oriented towards the approximate direction of the predominant wind raw signals from the ec system were sampled at 20 hz signals were recorded on a cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa and later processed by the eddypro software li cor lincoln ne usa to generate the flux data the eddypro software estimated the distance of the 90 flux footprint of each 30 min data point later used to select the analysis polygon see section 2 3 1 ec evapotranspiration data were used for doys 180 189 195 206 211 213 215 217 221 228 243 244 249 251 256 257 2 2 3 surface energy balance the validity of the ec flux measurements is commonly examined by analysing the energy balance closure wilson et al 2002 in this analysis half hourly values of consumed energy of latent and sensible heat le h are regressed against corresponding values of the available energy rn g where rn is net radiation and g is soil heat flux additional measurements facilitated energy balance closure analysis net radiation rn was measured with a net radiometer q 7 1 rebs seattle wa usa installed at 3 65 m height on the same pole of the ec system air temperature and relative humidity were measured by a sensor hmp45 campbell sci logan ut usa positioned at a height of 3 5 m within a ventilated radiation shield soil heat flux g was measured with four soil heat flux plates hft 3 1 rebs seattle wa usa installed at a depth of 0 08 m within the soil and two thermocouples type t copper constantan that were installed in the soil layer above each plate at depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m total of 8 thermocouples the calculation of soil heat flux and storage was done similarly to the procedure described by rosa et al 2013 and tanny et al 2006 thirty minute averages of measured variables net radiation soil heat flux and soil temperatures were recorded on a cr23x data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa all the equipment was powered by car batteries that were charged during the day by solar panels 2 2 4 surface renewal sr the surface renewal method estimates h the sensible heat flux from high frequency single point temperature measurement and then extracts the evapotranspiration as a residual of the energy balance closure paw u et al 1995 the method proved reliable for cotton evapotranspiration measurements rosa and tanny 2015 in the present field experiment a miniature thermocouple type t 50 μm in diameter coco 002 omega eng uk was installed at 1 5 m height on the same mast of the ec system the sensor measured air temperature at 10 hz and raw data was recorded on a cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa sensible heat flux calculated by sr data analysis spano et al 1997 was calibrated against direct ec measurements and the calibration coefficient was utilized during periods when ec data were unavailable sr evapotranspiration data were used for doys 207 210 and 218 220 2 2 5 heat pulse sap flow measurements were conducted using the heat pulse technique sensors were installed in 12 cotton plants about 200 m west of the position of the ec mast in the present analysis we assume that for the high density cotton field soil evaporation is negligible hence evapotranspiration and transpiration are equal sf transpiration data were used for doys 235 242 245 248 252 255 258 261 2 2 6 derivation of the crop coefficient kc the crop coefficient was derived according to allen et al 1998 1 k c e t c e t o where e t c is the crop evapotraspiration as measured by eddy covariance surface renewal or sap flow method our gold standard was the eddy covariance measurement however at times the eddy covariance system failed creating a gap in the time series during the days that the eddy covariance system did not provide data e t c was estimated using either the surface renewal or the sap flow measurements 2 3 satellite measurements 2 3 1 pre processing a total of seven relatively cloud free sentinel 2 a images acquired during the cotton growing season were analyzed in this study including five images that coincide with our agro meteorological measurements the images were atmospherically corrected using sen2cor louis et al 2016 and processed using the sentinel 2 toolbox an extension of sentinel application platform snap gascon and ramoino 2017 in order to select the pixels for analysis a polygon defining the borders of the cotton field was demarked fig 3 a furthermore the point density of the 90 flux footprint of eddy covariance measurements taken between 7 am and 6 pm was calculated fig 3b a threshold of 0 018 points per m2 was selected to create a second polygon representing the area from which most of the flux measured by the eddy covariance system was originated fig 3c cloud and cloud shadow masks were generated for the five sentinel 2 a images that coincide with the agro meteorological measurements the intersection between the field borders the area that represents the flux footprint and the cloud masks defined the polygon of the analysis area fig 3d 2 3 2 spectral indices we applied the 22 vegetation indices included in snap to all of the images throughout the growing season table 1 linear regression models were developed for the time series of field measured kc and the time series of each spectral index r2 and root mean square error rmse values were calculated for every model the kc ndvi model developed in this study was compared to other similar models from the literature that were developed for cotton montgomery et al 2015 and with a general field crop model kamble et al 2013 in addition the field measured kc values and the estimates of kc ndvi models were compared with the recommended kc for cotton in this region that is provided by the israeli extension service 3 results energy balance closure was analyzed in order to verify the eddy covariance flux measurements fig 4 the 0 96 slope which represents a nearly perfect closure and high coefficient of determination r2 0 92 between le h and rn g demonstrate that the eddy covariance fluxes were reliable in determining the crop evapotranspiration the mid late season kc demonstrates a very similar temporal pattern to ndvi fig 5 linear regression models between each of the 22 vis and kc were derived fig 6 and most of these models show high correlation between kc and the sentinel 2 vis table 2 these results strengthen the case for using vis as surrogates for kc the three best models ranked according to rmse are based on vi composed of bands covering the red and red edge spectral bands mtci rep s2rep models based on five more indices arvi savi msavi2 ipvi msavi performed better in predicting kc than the popularly used ndvi however despite its hinge on red and red edge bands ireci pssra and mcari did not perform better than ndvi for predicting kc comparison of the ndvi model developed in this study with models from the literature kamble et al 2013 montgomery et al 2015 shows an increase of about one order of magnitude in rmse in the other models fig 7 even though the kamble et al 2013 model is a general model developed for multiple field crops and the montgomery et al 2015 model was developed for cotton both have similar prediction errors and they both over estimate kc by about 0 2 compared to our field measurements and by 0 04 to 0 36 compared to the standard recommendation by the israeli extension service fig 8 the israeli extension service recommendation was higher than the measured kc for most of the time except for one point at the end of the season fig 8 therefore following the standard israeli extension service kc table recommendations the montgomery et al 2015 model or the kamble et al 2013 model would lead to excess irrigation 4 discussion our results suggest that most vis that are based on sentinel 2 bands are suitable predictors for cotton kc and that those based on the red and red edge spectral bands mtci rep and s2rep are the best ones in contrast to previous studies that mostly used vis based on red and nir bands ndvi savi etc to model kc our study suggests that we can now develop more accurate models using the new sentinel 2 compared to previous sensors e g landsat this result is in agreement with previous studies that showed that red edge based vis correlate better with chlorophyll content and lai viña et al 2011 frampton et al 2013 nguy robertson et al 2014 therefore it is not surprising that these indices exhibited the highest correlations with our field measured kc our kc estimation models for cotton were different from the standard kc recommendations by ies and different from literature kc estimates based on vi ndvi models this suggests that kc vi models are specific to local conditions and accordingly their development and application should be crop and region specific to achieve the best kc estimation therefore published kc vi models should be very carefully adapted for use in different settings than the ones they were developed in our field measurements were carried out during the mid late stages of the growing season this can explain the extremely high correlation we found for some kc vi models peaks in evaporation following irrigation or rain events and the sensitivity of some vis to the soil top layer wetness usually result with lower kc vi correlations at the beginning of the season when the vegetation is sparse and higher at the end of the season since the vegetation even senescent is limiting soil evaporation e g duchemin et al 2006 thus the models presented in this paper still require further testing and possibly adaptations to extend their application to the entire growing season in a future study we intend to perform eddy covariance measurements throughout the growing season to validate and improve the models developed in this study in addition kc estimates are based on an assumption that the commercial field where the experiment took place was well watered which is the common practice of cotton growers in this region and indeed the irrigation fig 2 was consistently higher than the field measurements of crop evapotranspiration the reason for this assumption is that kc vi models based on optical remote sensing data do not allow estimating actual evapotranspiration but provide a maximal value that would be observed if water were readily available in the soil duchemin et al 2006 therefore at this stage the present remote sensing based kc estimates may prove inaccurate for a water stressed crop while our study was conducted during the summer of 2016 when data from only sentinel 2 a was available nowadays sentinel 2b is already in orbit and operational thus for future studies the technique demonstrated in this paper can be applied at double the temporal resolution even with only sentinel 2 a at our disposal we were able to obtain seven clear images during the mid late growing season unlike other studies that interpolated the vi time series between satellite image acquisition to compensate for the low temporal resolution of imagery e g duchemin et al 2006 we did not perform any interpolation and relied solely on actual sentinel 2 measurements to ensure that the model is calibrated using actual field measurements since our field measurements were not entirely continuous we did not measure etc on every day and as a result our models are based on only five out of the seven available images together sentinel 2 a and sentinel 2b offer better revisit time 5 days vs 16 days and better spatial resolution 10 m vs 30 m compared to landsat 8 however landsat 8 s thermal infrared sensor tirs does provide information on the land surface temperature rozenstein et al 2014 that is not available from sentinel 2 and therefore in the context of modeling evapotranspiration landsat 8 is still extremely valuable senay et al 2016 moreover the harmonized landsat sentinel 2 data set that is currently under development masek et al 2015 flood 2017 can further improve the revisit time at the expense of spatial resolution the harmonized product resolution is 30 m and the loss of red edge based indices since landsat 8 operational land imager oli does not include red edge bands 5 conclusion sentinel 2 is superior to older generations of public domain satellite data in terms of spatial temporal and spectral resolutions this allows for the first time to estimate kc an important parameter for irrigation management at a high frequency that can support irrigation decisions at a fine spatial resolution of 10 m that well captures within field variability and at higher accuracy than before owing to the sensor s unique spectral bands that cover the red edge region acknowledgmentsthis study was partially supported by an aro start up grant

11402,the treated wastewater tww reuse in crop irrigation is becoming a frequent practice in areas with limited water resources this alternative water may be considered as nutrients source that can fill the water deficit however tww contains high salts concentration and may negatively affect plant performances the ability of short term irrigation with tww in order to improve young olive olea europaea l cv chetoui performance was studied one year old olive plants were subjected for four months to different concentrations 33 50 and 100 of tww as compared to the control olive plants results showed that irrigation with tww induced an enrichment of plant tissues with macro and micronutrients this enhancement significantly p 0 05 improved the photosynthesis activity soluble sugars and thus plant growth the irrigation with undiluted tww was more efficient than diluted tww in ameliorating the physiological performance of young olive plants therefore tww seems to be an interesting bio fertilizer of young olive plant when applied for a short period keywords olea europaea treated wastewater nutrient uptake photosynthesis growth 1 introduction in the recent years the irrigated areas expansion has caused a decrease in the availability of fresh water as irrigation is fundamental for the development of agriculture garcía ruiz et al 2011 generally agriculture is the major consumer of water as it accounts for around 70 of all global water use winpenny et al 2010 alternative sources of water like treated wastewater tww could be a useful option to satisfy different agricultural needs uzen et al 2016 recently tww reuse in agriculture is gradually becoming a frequent practice in areas with limited sources of water petousi et al 2015 the potential benefits in using tww for irrigation purposes include i reducing fresh water demand ii recycling nutrients and iii minimizing the discharge of pollutants into the waterways hanjraa et al 2012 according to martínez et al 2013 tww is a rich source of nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k and micro nutrients which reduce the need for chemical fertilizers resulting in net cost savings to farmers kiziloglu et al 2008 showed that wastewater irrigation increases the availability of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium as well as micro elements to plants which lead to increase the yields of cauliflower and red cabbage many studies related to tww application in agriculture were developed for several crops including eggplant tomato cirelli et al 2012 lemon pedrero et al 2012 chickpea tak et al 2013 and cotton uzen et al 2016 these authors showed the benefits of tww irrigation in increasing the biomass and the production in improving the plant mineral status and in reducing the fertilizers application rates indeed tekaya et al 2016 reported that tww irrigation improved the growth and increased the photosynthetic capacity of olive tree olea europaea l however some disadvantages like salinization of soil sensitive plants damage and contamination by coliforms such as escherichia coli that represent a public health are still a concern cirelli et al 2012 bedbabis et al 2015 interestingly it was suggested that good agricultural practices executed with planning and management may reduce these undesirable consequences who 2006 in tunisia oleiculture is considered as one of the main economical and agricultural sectors this species known for its tolerance to drought wang et al 2018 and salinity chehab et al 2018 constituted the most important crop recently in water scarce countries such as tunisia tww was used as an additional water resource for plant irrigation according to hentati et al 2014 in the mediterranean basin tunisia is considered as a country suffering of a high level of water scarcity to a large extent tww may be considered as an important source of nutrients for olive crop production which can reduce the chemical fertilizer application the response of young olive plants olea europaea l cv chetoui face to tww irrigation remains unknown the objective of this study was to examine the comportment of young olive plants irrigated with different concentrations 33 50

leaf and root tissues with increasing tww concentration the enhancement in na k ca2 mg2 and p contents were 42 50 77 75 and 22 in leaves and 33 77 68 40 and 30 in roots respectively for t3 treated plants as compared to control ones the micronutrients contents in leaves and roots were presented in table 5 obtained results showed clearly that the irrigation with different concentrations of tww significantly p 0 05 enhanced the concentrations of cu2 zn2 and fe3 in the leaves and the roots of young olive plants in comparison to control ones the highest values were also noticed in t3 treated

weight plant height and leaf area of all applied treatments were presented in table 6 according to the obtained results irrigation with tww increased these parameters it should be noted that the highest increase of plant growth and biomass was recorded in the t3 treated plants 3 3 gas exchange parameters fig 1 shows that irrigation with either undiluted or diluted tww caused a significant p 0

different concentrations 33 50 and 100 of tww in the leaves of olive plants fig 2 the obtained results showed that irrigation with tww increased this parameter this increase was more pronounced in t3 treated plants than t2 and t1 treated plants as compared to control plants the total chlorophyll content increased in t1 treated plants by 9 while in the t3 treatment this parameter increased by 49 in comparison to the control plants 3 5 soluble sugars and starch contents varying concentrations 33 50 and 100 of tww irrigation significantly p 0 05 increased the soluble sugars content in the leaves of young olive plants nevertheless the content of starch was reduced fig 3 the highest content of soluble sugars and the lowest content of starch were obtained in the t3 treated plants in comparison to t1 treatment the soluble sugars content in the leaves of t3 treated plants increased by 27 while the starch content decreased by 32 4 discussion the results of the current study indicated that different concentrations of tww significantly p 0 05 increased the contents of macronutrient k ca2 mg2 and p and micronutrients cu2 zn2 and fe3 in the leaves and the roots of olive plants tables 4 and 5 the increase of macro and micronutrients contents in the tissues of olive plants can be explained by the greater amounts of these ions supplied by the tww according to anwar et al 2016 tww irrigation improved the uptake of beneficial nutrients such as k p cu2 and zn2 of mint mentha arvensis l and fenugreek trigonella foenum l those nutrients play an important role in different physiological mechanisms including plant growth and development cellular turgor osmotic adjustment and membrane stability acosta motos et al 2015 cantabella et al 2017 from the obtained results irrigation with tww resulted in higher accumulation of na in roots than in leaves table 4 these results suggest that roots of olive plants appeared to act as an effective barrier against the transport and excessive accumulation of na into the aerial parts photosynthetically active similar observations were noted by acosta motos et al 2014 who reported that tolerant myrtle myrtus communis l plants accumulated more na in roots than in leaves under tww irrigation in addition pedrero et al 2018 showed that the excess of na in the tww did not affect the concentration of k and ca2 in leaves of nectarine prunus persica l trees according to gómez bellot et al 2014 the negative effect of high na level in tww was overcome by the effect of beneficial ions such as mg2 k and p that improved the physiological status of plants without decreasing its development the effect of irrigation with tww on the growth and the development of several plants species was studied by several authors tak et al 2013 dhir and srivastava 2014 petousi et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 reported that tww irrigation reduced the vegetative growth of mandarin citrus clementina l trees in addition in euonymus euonymus japonica l plants the tww irrigation decreased root dry weight gómez bellot et al 2014 referring to these authors the excess salinity of tww may affect plant biomass however in this study the different concentrations of tww increased young olive plant growth biomass plant height and leaf area in comparison to the control ones similar results were reported by tak et al 2013 in chickpea cicer arietinum l plants which noted that irrigation with tww increased the plant dry and fresh weights by increasing photosynthetic activity in the same way zema et al 2012 reported that the ameliorative growth effect of tww on arundo donax l and typha latifolia l could be due to the improvement of mineral status in the present study tww irrigation promoted olive plant growth directly by facilitating resource acquisition k p and micronutrients irrigation with different tww concentrations for a short period and especially in the t3 treatment was found to be beneficial in ameliorating the gas exchange parameters pn gs and e in fact the tww contained considerable amounts of nutrients that are considered essential for enhancing photosynthetic activity zn2 stomatal regulation k and cl as well as for chlorophyll biosynthesis mg2 tekaya et al 2016 faizan et al 2014 reported that the irrigation with tww enriched soils with nutrients and organic matter which lead to increase plants photosynthetic performance in the same way tekaya et al 2016 reported that the use of tww is recommended to irrigate olive plant in fact this water is a rich source of essential nutrients that contribute to ameliorate the photosynthetic capacity the response of plant to irrigation with tww seems to be very variable and depends on many different conditions such as macro and micronutrients concentrations salts concentration plant species and irrigation period in this study the increase of net photosynthesis rate observed in t3 treated plants may be linked to i the mineral status improvement tables 4 and 5 and or ii the increase of leaf area table 6 that could increase the light absorption and optimize the assimilation of co2 and therefore the photosynthetic capacity the increase of total chlorophyll content in t3 treated plants could be related to the photosynthetic behavior this result is in agreement with the findings of helaly et al 2018 who showed that tww irrigation positively affected the total chlorophyll content of mango mangifera indica l trees salinity stimulates chlorophyll degradation and affects chlorophyll synthesis by inducing the activity of the degrading enzyme chlorophylase sevengor et al 2011 nevertheless our results showed that na was not concentrated enough in the leaves to cause photochemical damage the present data indicated that tww application induced a significant p 0 05 enhancement of soluble sugars content in the olive leaves in contrast starch content decreased according to several studies tww application lead to an increase in the soluble sugars content of plants gupta et al 2010 hashem et al 2013 a positive correlation between soluble sugars accumulation and stress tolerance in plants was reported by rosa et al 2009 and sami et al 2016 in fact soluble sugars function as osmoprotectants that stabilize the membrane maintain water homeostasis and enhance antioxidant defense mechanisms in this study the increase in soluble sugars content and the decrease of starch content observed in the leaves of young olive plants irrigated with different concentrations of tww can be resulted from the degradation of starch into soluble sugars this mechanism may allow plants to satisfy the energy requirements for physiological activity 5 conclusions the present study showed the beneficial effect of tww irrigation during four months in olive plants cv chetoui the irrigation with undiluted tww was the more efficient in ameliorating the physiological performance of young olive plants than diluted one as compared to control plants irrigated with tap water tww played an important role in the enrichment of plant tissues with macro and micronutrients this enrichment had a beneficial effect in increasing photosynthetic capacity soluble sugars content and then plant growth according to these results tww can be used as a good fertilizer for young olive plant due to its considerable amounts of essential nutrients thus tww may be applied for a short period to irrigate young olive plants in order to conserve fresh water and to minimize the use of chemical fertilizer acknowledgements the authors wish to

11402,the treated wastewater tww reuse in crop irrigation is becoming a frequent practice in areas with limited water resources this alternative water may be considered as nutrients source that can fill the water deficit however tww contains high salts concentration and may negatively affect plant performances the ability of short term irrigation with tww in order to improve young olive olea europaea l cv chetoui performance was studied one year old olive plants were subjected for four months to different concentrations 33 50 and 100 of tww as compared to the control olive plants results showed that irrigation with tww induced an enrichment of plant tissues with macro and micronutrients this enhancement significantly p 0 05 improved the photosynthesis activity soluble sugars and thus plant growth the irrigation with undiluted tww was more efficient than diluted tww in ameliorating the physiological performance of young olive plants therefore tww seems to be an interesting bio fertilizer of young olive plant when applied for a short period keywords olea europaea treated wastewater nutrient uptake photosynthesis growth 1 introduction in the recent years the irrigated areas expansion has caused a decrease in the availability of fresh water as irrigation is fundamental for the development of agriculture garcía ruiz et al 2011 generally agriculture is the major consumer of water as it accounts for around 70 of all global water use winpenny et al 2010 alternative sources of water like treated wastewater tww could be a useful option to satisfy different agricultural needs uzen et al 2016 recently tww reuse in agriculture is gradually becoming a frequent practice in areas with limited sources of water petousi et al 2015 the potential benefits in using tww for irrigation purposes include i reducing fresh water demand ii recycling nutrients and iii minimizing the discharge of pollutants into the waterways hanjraa et al 2012 according to martínez et al 2013 tww is a rich source of nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k and micro nutrients which reduce the need for chemical fertilizers resulting in net cost savings to farmers kiziloglu et al 2008 showed that wastewater irrigation increases the availability of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium as well as micro elements to plants which lead to increase the yields of cauliflower and red cabbage many studies related to tww application in agriculture were developed for several crops including eggplant tomato cirelli et al 2012 lemon pedrero et al 2012 chickpea tak et al 2013 and cotton uzen et al 2016 these authors showed the benefits of tww irrigation in increasing the biomass and the production in improving the plant mineral status and in reducing the fertilizers application rates indeed tekaya et al 2016 reported that tww irrigation improved the growth and increased the photosynthetic capacity of olive tree olea europaea l however some disadvantages like salinization of soil sensitive plants damage and contamination by coliforms such as escherichia coli that represent a public health are still a concern cirelli et al 2012 bedbabis et al 2015 interestingly it was suggested that good agricultural practices executed with planning and management may reduce these undesirable consequences who 2006 in tunisia oleiculture is considered as one of the main economical and agricultural sectors this species known for its tolerance to drought wang et al 2018 and salinity chehab et al 2018 constituted the most important crop recently in water scarce countries such as tunisia tww was used as an additional water resource for plant irrigation according to hentati et al 2014 in the mediterranean basin tunisia is considered as a country suffering of a high level of water scarcity to a large extent tww may be considered as an important source of nutrients for olive crop production which can reduce the chemical fertilizer application the response of young olive plants olea europaea l cv chetoui face to tww irrigation remains unknown the objective of this study was to examine the comportment of young olive plants irrigated with different concentrations 33 50

11403,double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching pm an effective drought resistant farming technology has been widely used in the semi arid areas of china and increased crop yields by more than 30 however where this technology has been applied in successive years the annual balance of soil water has been affected and the risk of soil desiccation exacerbated a 6 year field experiment had been conducted on the semiarid loess plateau to find a new mode of ecological security and economic efficiency under pm conditions the two treatments were i pm with continuous maize cropping pm c and ii pm with maize fababean rotation pm r the vertical variation of soil water along profile and the interannual variation of soil water cumulative water consumption biomass and yield benefit and water economic yield were investigated the results showed that the depth of soil water consumption of pm c was extended downward by 60 cm from 2009 to 2014 but it did not vary in pm r the maximum depth of soil water consumption were 280 cm and 220 cm in pm c and pm r respectively compared with the pre seeding stage in 2009 soil water storage in the 0 300 cm depth in 2014 ha for pm c decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 cm soil layer and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layer however in the pm r treatment the soil water storage in the 0 300 cm depth in 2014 ha increased by 28 36 mm resulting from an increase of 47 86 mm in the 0 140 cm soil layer and a decrease of 19 50 mm in the 140 300 cm layer pm r significantly improved crop water consumption in the post flowering period and the ratio of water consumption in post flowering to total significantly increased by 19 54 51 09 p 0 05 the biomass and grain yield for pm r were significantly lower than for pm c by 21 36 and 59 14 respectively however there were no significant differences in benefit mainly because the price of fababean was higher the soil water depletion in 6 years of pm r decreased significantly and therefore water economic yield was significantly higher than for pm c this suggested that pm r alleviated the over consumption of deep soil water and the water depletion depth which caused by continuous maize cropping in pm c and so achieved significantly higher water economic yield by reducing soil water depletion and provided stable economic benefit consequently pm r represents a sustainable ecological economic secure and replicable planting mode keywords semi arid area maize fababean rotation soil water balance economic effects ridge and furrow with plastic mulching 1 introduction there are 0 85 billion people living in hunger worldwide mainly in developing countries and the global food demand continues to increase sanchez and swaminathan 2005 zhang et al 2007 sapna and neeraj 2014 the food self sufficiency rate of china was 88 38 in 2012 tang 2014 which was lower than the internationally recognized red line rate of 95 wang et al 2009 this food gap is huge especially in poor areas where average annual consumption of food per person is 195 kg equivalent to 73 9 of the national average and 36 4 of farmers cannot meet the basic ration demand zhang 2011 therefore improving food production capacity in poor areas is essential to national food security the food deficit in the northwest loess plateau of china is historical because of insufficient natural resources and a fragile ecological environment maize is the most important crop for grain production but its yield does not exceed 4 5 t ha 1 when using traditional planting technology in this area fang et al 2015 however with the introduction of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching technology in 2006 yield increased up to 8 81 t ha 1 wang et al 2011a 2013 dong et al 2017 during 2006 2013 the average annual increase of grain was 856 000 t in the northwest loess plateau of china enough to feed 2 14 million people and increase income by 1 75 billion yuan however with the advent of plastic mulching high water consumption crops e g maize were planted continuously threatening the interannual balance of soil water the soil water storage capacity at depths below 2 m was reduced the risk of soil desiccation increased and threatened the soil water ecology chen et al 2008a 2008b wang et al 2011a 2012 2013 fan et al 2014 dong et al 2017 the ecologically negative effects of continuous maize cropping with plastic mulch have aroused the concern of many scholars and it is necessary to find a new mode for ecological security and economic efficiency studies have shown that maize and other crop rotations can increase yields al kaisi and yin 2004 wilhelm and wortmann 2004 improve soil organic carbon input and improve land use efficiency gu et al 2017 in addition legume cereal crop rotations and deep shallow root crop rotations are important measures to optimize soil water utilization li et al 2008 the stable sown area of fababean is up to 96 000 ha in gansu province accounting for about 40 of the area of fababean in china based on relatively low water consumption high prices and strong nitrogen fixing ability it is frequently used for intercropping or rotation crops zhang et al 2016 hou et al 2016 therefore this experiment selected fababean as a rotation crop for a rotation system of legumes cereals deep shallow root to alleviate the negative ecological effects of continuous maize cropping combined with mulching the regulation of water and nutrient in the pre and post flowering period is one of the main methods to optimize resource utilization and increase yield nishioka and okumura 2008 dordas 2009 xie et al 2016 guo et al 2016 studies have shown that potato and legume intercropping can increase potato water uptake in the post flowering period significantly improve land productivity without negative effects on soil water sustainability zhang et al 2016 hou et al 2016 the rotation adjusts water depletion processes in the pre and post flowering periods thus affecting yield however there has been little relevant research the soil water temporal spatial variation soil water depletion biomass and yield benefit and economic water use efficiency ewue of maize fababean rotation were analyzed during 2009 2014 the effect of maize fababean rotation on soil water depletion economic benefit was evaluated to clarify the function of

were sown on april 23 harvesting on october 13 in 2013 maize were sown on april 17 and harvested on october 19 fababean were sown on march 20 and harvested on august 17 in 2014 the flowering period of maize is around july 23 and fababean is around may 28 treatments received 225 kg n maize or 120 kg n fababean ha 1 and maize and fababean received 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 the fertilizer is applied once before sowing in each year 2 2 precipitation and air temperature precipitation and air temperature according to come from meteorological data statistics at dingxi experimental station of gansu academy of agricultural sciences 2 3 measurement of soil water storage the soil water content ws was measured at 20 cm step intervals in the 0 300 cm soil profile on six soil cores randomly collected from furrows in each plot while the soil samples collected by drilling equipment and loaded into aluminum box after the fresh weight weighed the soil sample oven dried at 105 c for 8 10 h and then measured the dry weight the soil water content w w calculated according to formula 1 the soil water storage sws calculated by formula 2 1 ws fw dw dw aw where fw is fresh weight of soil sample with aluminum box dw is dry weight of soil sample with aluminum box aw is the weight of aluminum box 2 sws mm ws b d where b is soil bulk density unit is g cm3 and d is soil depth unit is cm the average soil water content for the 0 300 cm depth from each sampling date was used in statistical analysis 2 4 total evapotranspiration calculation the total evapotranspiration et calculated using the following formula 3 et swsbf swsh pi where swsbf is soil water storage before sowing stage swsh is soil water storage after harvesting and pi is precipitation during the cropgrowing period the wue water use efficiency was calculated as yield divided by et because the annual precipitation is around 400 mm the annual evaporation reaches to 1500 mm in the experimental area so the percolation always ignored generally 2

tested by least significant difference duncan multiple comparison method p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and air temperature at the experimental site the annual and growth period precipitation was highest in 2013 and lowest in 2009 fig 2 annual precipitation was 323 1 355 1 346 4 484 4 551 9 and 489 5 mm during 2009 2014 respectively about 55 of the annual precipitation occurred during august september the precipitation during maize and fababean growth period were 276 7 459 7 mm and 205 4 249 5 mm respectively during maize and fababean growth period it was highest in 2013 and 2012 were 459 7 and 249 5 mm but lowest at 2009 and 2010 were 276 7 and 205 4 mm of the total annual precipitation events of 3 mm accounted for 63 29 56 98 60 76 52 44 43 90 and 42 22 in 2009 2014 respectively the average air temperature was 7 12 6 91 6 60 6 33 7 19 and 6 96 c during 2009 2014 respectively the highest air temperature occurred at june 25 2009 july 29 2010 august 12 2011 august 10 2012 july 1 2013 and july 26 2014 it were 22 75 25 6 23 6 22 4 21 3 and 22 6 c and the lowest air temperature recorded at november 19 2009 january 12 2010 january 11 2011 january 23 2012 december 21 2013 and february 10 2014 it were 12 1 13 0 19 8 13 6 and 11 9 c during 2009 2014 in the maize and fababean growth period the highest average air temperature was occurred at 2013 the lowest occurred at 2012 it were 7 19and 6 38 c 3 2 soil moisture dynamics both treatments were sown with maize in 2009 as compared to before sowing the soil water storage of pm c and pm r at harvesting stage decreased by 72 49 and 71 98 mm respectively in the 40 200 cm soil layer there were only six precipitation events with 5 mm during july august in 2010 and drought was serious however maize and fababean demand a great amount of water during this period and soil water storage of pm c and pm r at harvesting stage decreased by 114 19 and 45 92 mm in the 0 200 cm soil layer respectively and that of pm c was close to or below the soil water storage at wilting point in the 60 120 cm layer in 2011 soil water storage of pm c at harvesting stage decreased in the 20 280 cm soil layer closed to the soil water storage at wilting point in the 40 80 cm layer however that of pm r decreased only in the 20 200 cm layer compared to that before sowing in this year precipitation was relatively abundant during maize jointing tasselling and filling stage in 2012 and a reduction of soil water storage for pm c of only 10 53 mm occurred in the 100 200 cm soil layer and 17 54 mm for pm r in the 0 100 cm layer annual precipitation was 551 9 mm in 2013 and a reduction in soil water storage of 25 49 mm occurred in the 160 280 cm layer for pm c and of 12 97 mm in the 40 80 cm layer for pm r the capacity of soil water storage increased in the pre sowing period in 2014 but there was no effective rainfall from july to early august and soil water storage of pm c decreased by 78 80 mm in the 60 300 cm soil layer and by 12 34 mm only in the 80 140 cm layer for pm r the annual water depletion of pm c was 344 79 377 99 331 21 519 45 385 61 and 478 87 mm and that of pm r was 342 7 175 47 376 06 310 26 405 21 and 403 21 mm during 2009 2014 respectively these results indicate that soil water depletion of the different planting systems was related to rainfall distribution and the crop grown and soil water depletion of pm r was 18 76 115 41 and significantly p 0 05 lower than that of pm c fig 3 3 3 changes of soil water depletion depth depth of soil water depletion related to the crop planted and precipitation distribution closely fig 4 in 2009 for both treatments the depth of soil water depletion was the same at 220 cm because both had maize planted in 2010 precipitation occurred mainly in may and late june drought was severe after maize tasseling after 23 july however precipitation was abundant during the flowering period of fababean about 28 may depth of soil water depletion in pm c extended downwards to 260 cm it was 200 cm in pm r in 2011 that of pm c continued to extend downwards to 280 cm but that for pm r remained at 200 cm in 2012 precipitation occurred mainly during may august and the soil water depletion depths of pm c and pm r were 240 and 100 cm respectively in 2013 precipitation occurred mainly in may august and early september with both treatments sown with maize the soil water depletion depth of pm c was 280 cm and that of pm r was 120 cm there was drought during flowering of maize and fababean in 2014 and soil water depletion was greater than for 2013 280 and 220 cm for pm c and pm r respectively after 6 years of planting the depth of soil water depletion for pm c extended downwards by 60 cm while that for pm r did not change 3 4 soil water status of different cropping systems after 6 years of planting with the increasing of planting years the water storage capacity of lower layers decreased significantly and there was a significant difference between pm c and pm r fig 5 soil water storage decreased in the 60 300 cm soil layer for pm c and in the 140 300 cm layer for pm r after 6 years of planting soil water storage of pm c decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 cm layer and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layer however pm r increased by 28 36 mm which resulted from an increase of 47 86 mm in the 0 140 cm layer and a decrease of 19 50 mm in the 140 300 cm layer thus pm r can improve soil moisture status maintain soil water balance and achieve the sustainable utilization of soil water 3 5 water use status in pre and post flowering periods the flowering periods of maize and fababean were in late july and late may respectively the crop water consumption related to soil water storage in the pre seeding stage the precipitation distribution and the crop planted table 1 after 6 years of cultivation pm r improved soil water storage in the pre seeding stage by 39 90 mm but it decreased by 91 81 mm in pm c the improved soil water storage increased water consumption in the post flowering period with the ratio of water consumption in post flowering to total of pm r significantly p 0 05 increased by 43 22 76 31 compared with pm c the increase of post flowering water consumption was beneficial to biomass accumulation 3 6 crop growth benefits and ecological under different cropping systems during 2009 2014 the plant body of fababean was smaller than that of maize therefore total biomass and grain yield of pm r were significantly lower than pm c p 0 05 and the ratio of biomass in post flowering to total biomass of pm r was significantly higher than pm c in 2010 2012 and 2014 pm r had planted fababean table 2 during the 6 year planting period the crop growth periods of pm c and pm r differed and total precipitation was 2201 20 mm for pm c and 1727 70 mm for pm r the total crop water consumption during the crop growth period total biomass grain yield and water use efficiency of grain of pm c increased by 21 11 21 36 59 14 and 31 45 respectively there was significant difference p 0 05 and total water use efficiency of biomass did not differ between the treatments the crop planted had a significant impact on benefit and et fig 6 there were no significant differences in yield and et of pm c and pm r in 2009 2011 and 2013 p 0 05 because both treatments were sown with maize in 2010 2012 and 2014 maize was planted in pm c and fababean in pm r the et of pm c was 115 41 67 42 and 18 76 greater than for pm r respectively with significant differences p 0 05 the yield of maize was higher but price was lower than for fababean resulting in no significant p 0 05 differences in the benefits of pm c and pm r benefit and et affected ewue fig 6 maize was planted in pm c and pm r in 2009 2011 and 2013 and the ewue did not differ significantly p 0 05 between the two treatments however in 2010 2012 and 2014 ewue for pm r was 99 52 27 87 and 21 44 greater than for pm c respectively with significant differences p 0 05 after 6 years of planting the total benefit was 88 694 87 yuan ha 1 for pm c and 88 094 65 yuan ha 1 for pm r and not significantly different p 0 05 the total amount of water consumption for pm c was 2012 90 mm significantly higher than for pm r p 0 05 however compared to pm c average ewue for pm r was 20 29 higher and significant differences p 0 05 pm r maintained a stable benefit with lower water consumption significantly improved ewue and so had a positive effect on farmland soil water balance and agricultural sustainable development 4 discussion 4 1 depth of soil water depletion and risk of soil desiccation increased in continuous maize cropping continuous maize cropping with plastic film covering resulted in an increase in the amount and depth of soil water depletion in dryland areas of the loess plateau continuous high yield has led to continuous decreases in the effective water content of the soil reservoir under 320 mm rainfall conditons soil water is over consumed if maize is continuously cropped for more than 2 3 years chen et al 2008b wang et al 2011b 2012 xie et al 2015 soil desiccation characterized by a persistent deficit of soil water below 2 m has become a serious risk to continuous high yield in dryland areas of the loess plateau chen et al 2008b wang et al 2011b 2012 xie et al 2015 dong et al 2017 in this study soil water storage of pm c continuous cropping decreased by 197 66 mm in the 60 300 cm soil layer and the depth of soil water depletion extended downwards from 220 to 280 cm figs 3 5 consistent with previous research dordas 2009 tang 2014 fang et al 2015 xie et al 2016 during the first three years of the experiment 2009 2011 precipitation was about 340 mm and soil water storage of pm c was close to the soil water storage at wilting point in the 40 80 cm layer 2010 and the 60 120 cm 2011 layer soil water had been over consumed however different studies have shown that soil water storage is affected by precipitation in the 0 200 cm layer and changes below 200 cm can reflect the long term effects on soil water storage wang et al 2016 these conflicting findings need further investigation during the second three years of the experiment 2012 2014 precipitation was about 500 mm and soil water storage of both treatments was higher than that at wilting point in the 0 300 cm soil layer however the climatic characteristics of strong spatiotemporal variability in precipitation chen et al 2016 result in an ecological risk of continuous maize cropping and a persistent water deficit will lead to irreversible soil desiccation in this region 4 2 maize fababean rotation reduced soil water depletion in the 140 300 cm layer and optimized the soil moisture status soil resources i e fertilizer water and microbes are used efficiently in rotation systems by heterogeneous complementary of different crop biological characteristics studies have revealed that rotation is conducive to alleviating drought schlegel et al 2017 promoting efficient transformation of resources and comprehensive balanced and sustained use of soil water schillinger 2016 and stable long term outputs jat et al 2014 legume cereal crop rotation or deep shallow root crop rotation is an important measure to optimize soil water use li et al 2008 in this study pm r improved the soil moisture status in the 140 300 cm layer and optimized the soil water use status figs 4 and 5 in this study the changes of soil water consumption depth and soil water storage in different soil layers in the rotation system were supplemented and refined as compared with the existing research li et al 2008 jat et al 2014 schillinger 2016 schlegel et al 2017 4 3 rotation promoted post flowering biomass accumulation by regulating water consumption pre and post flowering and improved ewue regulating crop water consumption in pre and post flowering periods is one of the main ways to optimize natural resource use efficiency and increase crop yield dordas 2009 xie et al 2016 nishioka and okumura 2008 guo et al 2016 in this six year study the pm r rotation significantly promoted water consumption in the post flowering period and the percentage of post flowring water consumption in total water consumption was significantly higher than that of pm c p 0 05 the possible reason was that rotation significantly improved soil storage before sowing table 1 and plastic film mulching inhibited evaporation stored more water at early stage and apply to crop uptake at the late stage wang et al 2013 for the entire rotation system stability of income economic benefits and ecological benefits are fundamental factors in determining whether a rotation system should be promoted jat et al 2014 in this study pm r total water consumption biomass grain yield and average water use efficiency of grain in pm r decreased by 21 11 21 36 59 14 and 31 45 respectively there were significant difference p 0 05 table 3 because fababean aboveground is less than maize grain yield of fababean was less than that of maize but the price was higher and so benefit did not significantly differ between pm c and pm r water consumption accumulated of pm r significantly decreased and ewue significantly increased both p 0 05 therefore pm r significantly improved economic benefits and ecological sustainability with significantly reduced water consumption consistent with previous research jat et al 2014 5 conclusions as compared with pm c the depth of soil water depletion of pm r did not increase from 2009 to 2014 and its maximum depth was 220 cm pm r optimizes soil moisture conditions especially in 0 140 cm soil layers which soil water storage increased by 47 86 mm after six year planting the crop water consumption in the post flowering period improved in pm r significantly and the ratio of water consumption in post flowering to total significantly increased by 19 54 51 09 p 0 05 grain yield of pm r were significantly decreased by 59 14 than pm c but there were no significant differences in benefit mainly because the price of fababean was higher consequently pm r maintained stable benefit with low water cost and significantly increased ewue could be promoted as a method for sustainable development of double ridge and furrows with plastic

11403,double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching pm an effective drought resistant farming technology has been widely used in the semi arid areas of china and increased crop yields by more than 30 however where this technology has been applied in successive years the annual balance of soil water has been affected and the risk of soil desiccation exacerbated a 6 year field experiment had been conducted on the semiarid loess plateau to find a new mode of ecological security and economic efficiency under pm conditions the two treatments were i pm with continuous maize cropping pm c and ii pm with maize fababean rotation pm r the vertical variation of soil water along profile and the interannual variation of soil water cumulative water consumption biomass and yield benefit and water economic yield were investigated the results showed that the depth of soil water consumption of pm c was extended downward by 60 cm from 2009 to 2014 but it did not vary in pm r the maximum depth of soil water consumption were 280 cm and 220 cm in pm c and pm r respectively compared with the pre seeding stage in 2009 soil water storage in the 0 300 cm depth in 2014 ha for pm c decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 cm soil layer and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layer however in the pm r treatment the soil water storage in the 0 300 cm depth in 2014 ha increased by 28 36 mm resulting from an increase of 47 86 mm in the 0 140 cm soil layer and a decrease of 19 50 mm in the 140 300 cm layer pm r significantly improved crop water consumption in the post flowering period and the ratio of water consumption in post flowering to total significantly increased by 19 54 51 09 p 0 05 the biomass and grain yield for pm r were significantly lower than for pm c by 21 36 and 59 14 respectively however there were no significant differences in benefit mainly because the price of fababean was higher the soil water depletion in 6 years of pm r decreased significantly and therefore water economic yield was significantly higher than for pm c this suggested that pm r alleviated the over consumption of deep soil water and the water depletion depth which caused by continuous maize cropping in pm c and so achieved significantly higher water economic yield by reducing soil water depletion and provided stable economic benefit consequently pm r represents a sustainable ecological economic secure and replicable planting mode keywords semi arid area maize fababean rotation soil water balance economic effects ridge and furrow with plastic mulching 1 introduction there are 0 85 billion people living in hunger worldwide mainly in developing countries and the global food demand continues to increase sanchez and swaminathan 2005 zhang et al 2007 sapna and neeraj 2014 the food self sufficiency rate of china was 88 38 in 2012 tang 2014 which was lower than the internationally recognized red line rate of 95 wang et al 2009 this food gap is huge especially in poor areas where average annual consumption of food per person is 195 kg equivalent to 73 9 of the national average and 36 4 of farmers cannot meet the basic ration demand zhang 2011 therefore improving food production capacity in poor areas is essential to national food security the food deficit in the northwest loess plateau of china is historical because of insufficient natural resources and a fragile ecological environment maize is the most important crop for grain production but its yield does not exceed 4 5 t ha 1 when using traditional planting technology in this area fang et al 2015 however with the introduction of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching technology in 2006 yield increased up to 8 81 t ha 1 wang et al 2011a 2013 dong et al 2017 during 2006 2013 the average annual increase of grain was 856 000 t in the northwest loess plateau of china enough to feed 2 14 million people and increase income by 1 75 billion yuan however with the advent of plastic mulching high water consumption crops e g maize were planted continuously threatening the interannual balance of soil water the soil water storage capacity at depths below 2 m was reduced the risk of soil desiccation increased and threatened the soil water ecology chen et al 2008a 2008b wang et al 2011a 2012 2013 fan et al 2014 dong et al 2017 the ecologically negative effects of continuous maize cropping with plastic mulch have aroused the concern of many scholars and it is necessary to find a new mode for ecological security and economic efficiency studies have shown that maize and other crop rotations can increase yields al kaisi and yin 2004 wilhelm and wortmann 2004 improve soil organic carbon input and improve land use efficiency gu et al 2017 in addition legume cereal crop rotations and deep shallow root crop rotations are important measures to optimize soil water utilization li et al 2008 the stable sown area of fababean is up to 96 000 ha in gansu province accounting for about 40 of the area of fababean in china based on relatively low water consumption high prices and strong nitrogen fixing ability it is frequently used for intercropping or rotation crops zhang et al 2016 hou et al 2016 therefore this experiment selected fababean as a rotation crop for a rotation system of legumes cereals deep shallow root to alleviate the negative ecological effects of continuous maize cropping combined with mulching the regulation of water and nutrient in the pre and post flowering period is one of the main methods to optimize resource utilization and increase yield nishioka and okumura 2008 dordas 2009 xie et al 2016 guo et al 2016 studies have shown that potato and legume intercropping can increase potato water uptake in the post flowering period significantly improve land productivity without negative effects on soil water sustainability zhang et al 2016 hou et al 2016 the rotation adjusts water depletion processes in the pre and post flowering periods thus affecting yield however there has been little relevant research the soil water temporal spatial variation soil water depletion biomass and yield benefit and economic water use efficiency ewue of maize fababean rotation were analyzed during 2009 2014 the effect of maize fababean rotation on soil water depletion economic benefit was evaluated to clarify the function of rotation with mulching on the increase of land productivity and sustainability of interannual soil water storage on the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and the experimental

season from 2009 to 2014 that is double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching with continuous maize cropping pm c the maize continuously cultivated in 2009 2014 in this treatment the double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching with maize fababean rotation pm r the maize and fababean rotated each year from 2009 to 2014 in this treatment in two treatments maize was seeded 5 8 cm deep into soil with moisture content of 10 15 using a maize sower with 30 cm spacing in mid april giving a planting density of approximately 60 000 plants ha 1 in pm r treatment fababean was seeded 6 8 cm deep into soil with moisture content of 10 15 using a fababean sower with 8 cm spacing in mid march giving a planting density of approximately 225 000 plants ha 1 the method of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching comprised a wide ridge of height 10 cm and width of 70 cm and a narrow ridge of height 15 cm and width 40 cm which were mulched with plastic film fig 1 and seeds were sown in the furrow all treatments were non tillaged and plastic film was covered in place for all years all treatments were arranged in a randomized complete design with three replications the area of each plot was 6 m 10 m 60 m2 maize were planted on april 20th and harvested on october 13th in 2009 maize was planted on april 16th harvested on october 16th fababean were planted on march 15th harvested on

before sowing in each year 2 2 precipitation and air temperature precipitation and air temperature according to come from meteorological data statistics at dingxi experimental station of gansu academy of agricultural sciences 2 3 measurement of soil water storage the soil water content ws was measured at 20 cm step intervals in the 0 300 cm soil profile on six soil cores randomly collected from furrows in each plot while the soil samples collected by drilling equipment and loaded into aluminum box after the fresh weight weighed the soil sample oven dried at 105 c for 8 10 h and then measured the dry weight the soil water content w w calculated according to formula 1 the soil water storage sws calculated by formula 2 1 ws fw dw dw aw where fw is fresh weight of soil sample with aluminum box dw is dry weight of soil sample with aluminum box aw is the weight of aluminum box 2 sws mm ws b d where b is soil bulk density unit is g cm3 and d is soil depth unit is cm the average soil water content for the 0 300 cm depth from each sampling date was used in statistical analysis 2 4 total evapotranspiration calculation the total evapotranspiration et calculated using the following formula 3 et swsbf swsh pi where swsbf is soil water storage before sowing stage swsh is soil water storage after harvesting and pi is precipitation during the cropgrowing period the wue water use efficiency was calculated as yield divided by et because the annual precipitation is around 400 mm the annual evaporation reaches to 1500 mm in the experimental area so the percolation always ignored generally 2

tested by least significant difference duncan multiple comparison method p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and air temperature at the experimental site the annual and growth period precipitation was highest in 2013 and lowest in 2009 fig 2 annual precipitation was 323 1 355 1 346 4 484 4 551 9 and 489 5 mm during 2009 2014 respectively about 55 of the annual precipitation occurred during august september the precipitation during maize and fababean growth period were 276 7 459 7 mm and 205 4 249 5 mm respectively during maize and fababean growth period it was highest in 2013 and 2012 were 459 7 and 249 5 mm but lowest at 2009 and 2010 were 276 7 and 205 4 mm of the total annual precipitation events of 3 mm accounted for 63 29 56 98 60 76 52 44 43 90 and 42 22 in 2009 2014 respectively the average air temperature was 7 12 6 91 6 60 6 33 7 19 and 6 96 c during 2009 2014 respectively the highest air temperature occurred at june 25 2009 july 29 2010 august 12 2011 august 10 2012 july 1 2013 and july 26 2014 it were 22 75 25 6 23 6 22 4 21 3 and 22 6 c and the lowest air temperature recorded at november 19 2009 january 12 2010 january 11 2011 january 23 2012 december 21 2013 and february 10 2014 it were 12 1 13 0 19 8 13 6 and 11 9 c during 2009 2014 in the maize and fababean growth period the highest average air temperature was occurred at 2013 the lowest occurred at 2012 it were 7 19and 6 38 c 3 2 soil moisture dynamics both treatments were sown with maize in 2009 as compared to before sowing the soil water storage of pm c and pm r at harvesting stage decreased by 72 49 and 71 98 mm respectively in the 40 200 cm soil layer there were only six precipitation events with 5 mm during july august in 2010 and drought was serious however maize and fababean demand a great amount of water during this period and soil water storage of pm c and pm r at harvesting stage decreased by 114 19 and 45 92 mm in the 0 200 cm soil layer respectively and that of pm c was close to or below the soil water storage at wilting point in the 60 120 cm layer in 2011 soil water storage of pm c at harvesting stage decreased in the 20 280 cm soil layer closed to the soil water storage at wilting point in the 40 80 cm layer however that of pm r decreased only in the 20 200 cm layer compared to that before sowing in this year precipitation was relatively abundant during maize jointing tasselling and filling stage in 2012 and a reduction of soil water storage for pm c of only 10 53 mm occurred in the 100 200 cm soil layer and 17 54 mm for pm r in the 0 100 cm layer annual precipitation was 551 9 mm in 2013 and a reduction in soil water storage of 25 49 mm occurred in the 160 280 cm layer for pm c and of 12 97 mm in the 40 80 cm layer for pm r the capacity of soil water storage increased in the pre sowing period in 2014 but there was no effective rainfall from july to early august and soil water storage of pm c decreased by 78 80 mm in the 60 300 cm soil layer and by 12 34 mm only in the 80 140 cm layer for pm r the annual water depletion of pm c was 344 79 377 99 331 21 519 45 385 61 and 478 87 mm and that of pm r was 342 7 175 47 376 06 310 26 405 21 and 403 21 mm during 2009 2014 respectively these results indicate that soil water depletion of the different planting systems was related to rainfall distribution and the crop grown and soil water depletion of pm r was 18 76 115 41 and significantly p 0 05 lower than that of pm c fig 3 3 3 changes of soil water depletion depth depth of soil water depletion related to the crop planted and precipitation distribution closely fig 4 in 2009 for both treatments the depth of soil water depletion was the same at 220 cm because both had maize planted in 2010 precipitation occurred mainly in may and late june drought was severe after maize tasseling after 23 july however precipitation was abundant during the flowering period of fababean about 28 may depth of soil water depletion in pm c extended downwards to 260 cm it was 200 cm in pm r in 2011 that of pm c continued to extend downwards to 280 cm but that for pm r remained at 200 cm in 2012 precipitation occurred mainly during may august and the soil water depletion depths of pm c and pm r were 240 and 100 cm respectively in 2013 precipitation occurred mainly in may august and early september with both treatments sown with maize the soil water depletion depth of pm c was 280 cm and that of pm r was 120 cm there was drought during flowering of maize and fababean in 2014 and soil water depletion was greater than for 2013 280 and 220 cm for pm c and pm r respectively after 6 years of planting the depth of soil water depletion for pm c extended downwards by 60 cm while that for pm r did not change 3 4 soil water status of different cropping systems after 6 years of planting with the increasing of planting years the water storage capacity of lower layers decreased significantly and there was a significant difference between pm c and pm r fig 5 soil water storage decreased in the 60 300 cm soil layer for pm c and in the 140 300 cm layer for pm r after 6 years of planting soil water storage of pm c decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 cm layer and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layer however pm r increased by 28 36 mm which resulted from an increase of 47 86 mm in the 0 140 cm layer and a decrease of 19 50 mm in the 140 300 cm layer thus pm r can improve soil moisture status maintain soil water balance and achieve the sustainable utilization of soil water 3 5 water use status in pre and post flowering periods the flowering periods of maize and fababean were in late july and late may respectively the crop water consumption related to soil water storage in the pre seeding stage the precipitation distribution and the crop planted table 1 after 6 years of cultivation pm r improved soil water storage in the pre seeding stage by 39 90 mm but it decreased by 91 81 mm in pm c the improved soil water storage increased water consumption in the post flowering period with the ratio of water consumption in post flowering to total of pm r significantly p 0 05 increased by 43 22 76 31 compared with pm c the increase of post flowering water consumption was beneficial to biomass accumulation 3 6 crop growth benefits and ecological under different cropping systems during 2009 2014 the plant body of fababean was smaller than that of maize therefore total biomass and grain yield of pm r were significantly lower than pm c p 0 05 and the ratio of biomass in post flowering to total biomass of pm r was significantly higher than pm c in 2010 2012 and 2014 pm r had planted fababean table 2 during the 6 year planting period the crop growth periods of pm c and pm r differed and total precipitation was 2201 20 mm for pm c and 1727 70 mm for pm r the total crop water consumption during the crop growth period total biomass grain yield and water use efficiency of grain of pm c increased by 21 11 21 36 59 14 and 31 45 respectively there was significant difference p 0 05 and total water use efficiency of biomass did not differ between the treatments the crop planted had a significant impact on benefit and et fig 6 there were no significant differences in yield and et of pm c and pm r in 2009 2011 and 2013 p 0 05 because both treatments were sown with maize in 2010 2012 and 2014 maize was planted in pm c and fababean in pm r the et of pm c was 115 41 67 42 and 18 76 greater than for pm r respectively with significant differences p 0 05 the yield of maize was higher but price was lower than for fababean resulting in no significant p 0 05 differences in the benefits of pm c and pm r benefit and et affected ewue fig 6 maize was planted in pm c and pm r in 2009 2011 and 2013 and the ewue did not differ significantly p 0 05 between the two treatments however in 2010 2012 and 2014 ewue for pm r was 99 52 27 87 and 21 44 greater than for pm c respectively with significant differences p 0 05 after 6 years of planting the total benefit was 88 694 87 yuan ha 1 for pm c and 88 094 65 yuan ha 1 for pm r and not significantly different p 0 05 the total amount of water consumption for pm c was 2012 90 mm significantly higher than for pm r p 0 05 however compared to pm c average ewue for pm r was 20 29 higher and significant differences p 0 05 pm r maintained a stable benefit with lower water consumption significantly improved ewue and so had a positive effect on farmland soil water balance and agricultural sustainable development 4 discussion 4 1 depth of soil water depletion and risk of soil desiccation increased in continuous maize cropping continuous maize cropping with plastic film covering resulted in an increase in the amount and depth of soil water depletion in dryland areas of the loess plateau continuous high yield has led to continuous decreases in the effective water content of the soil reservoir under 320 mm rainfall conditons soil water is over consumed if maize is continuously cropped for more than 2 3 years chen et al 2008b wang et al 2011b 2012 xie et al 2015 soil desiccation characterized by a persistent deficit of soil water below 2 m has become a serious risk to continuous high yield in dryland areas of the loess plateau chen et al 2008b wang et al 2011b 2012 xie et al 2015 dong et al 2017 in this study soil water storage of pm c continuous cropping decreased by 197 66 mm in the 60 300 cm soil layer and the depth of soil water depletion extended downwards from 220 to 280 cm figs 3 5 consistent with previous research dordas 2009 tang 2014 fang et al 2015 xie et al 2016 during the first three years of the experiment 2009 2011 precipitation was about 340 mm and soil water storage of pm c was close to the soil water storage at wilting point in the 40 80 cm layer 2010 and the 60 120 cm 2011 layer soil water had been over consumed however different studies have shown that soil water storage is affected by precipitation in the 0 200 cm layer and changes below 200 cm can reflect the long term effects on soil water storage wang et al 2016 these conflicting findings need further investigation during the second three years of the experiment 2012 2014 precipitation was about 500 mm and soil water storage of both treatments was higher than that at wilting point in the 0 300 cm soil layer however the climatic characteristics of strong spatiotemporal variability in precipitation chen et al 2016 result in an ecological risk of continuous maize cropping and a persistent water deficit will lead to irreversible soil desiccation in this region 4 2 maize fababean rotation reduced soil water depletion in the 140 300 cm layer and optimized the soil moisture status soil resources i e fertilizer water and microbes are used efficiently in rotation systems by heterogeneous complementary of different crop biological characteristics studies have revealed that rotation is conducive to alleviating drought schlegel et al 2017 promoting efficient transformation of resources and comprehensive balanced and sustained use of soil water schillinger 2016 and stable long term outputs jat et al 2014 legume cereal crop rotation or deep shallow root crop rotation is an important measure to optimize soil water use li et al 2008 in this study pm r improved the soil moisture status in the 140 300 cm layer and optimized the soil water use status figs 4 and 5 in this study the changes of soil water consumption depth and soil water storage in different soil layers in the rotation system were supplemented and refined as compared with the existing research li et al 2008 jat et al 2014 schillinger 2016 schlegel et al 2017 4 3 rotation promoted post flowering biomass accumulation by regulating water consumption pre and post flowering and improved ewue regulating crop water consumption in pre and post flowering periods is one of the main ways to optimize natural resource use efficiency and increase crop yield dordas 2009 xie et al 2016 nishioka and okumura 2008 guo et al 2016 in this six year study the pm r rotation significantly promoted water consumption in the post flowering period and the percentage of post flowring water consumption in total water consumption was significantly higher than that of pm c p 0 05 the possible reason was that rotation significantly improved soil storage before sowing table 1 and plastic film mulching inhibited evaporation stored more water at early stage and apply to crop uptake at the late stage wang et al 2013 for the entire rotation system stability of income economic benefits and ecological benefits are fundamental factors in determining whether a rotation system should be promoted jat et al 2014 in this study pm r total water consumption biomass grain yield and average water use efficiency of grain in pm r decreased by 21 11 21 36 59 14 and 31 45 respectively there were significant difference p 0 05 table 3 because fababean aboveground is less than maize grain yield of fababean was less than that of maize but the price was higher and so benefit did not significantly differ between pm c and pm r water consumption accumulated of pm r significantly decreased and ewue significantly increased both p 0 05 therefore pm r significantly improved economic benefits and ecological sustainability with significantly reduced water consumption consistent with previous research jat et al 2014 5 conclusions as compared with pm c the depth of soil water depletion of pm r did not increase from 2009 to 2014 and its maximum depth was 220 cm pm r optimizes soil moisture conditions especially in 0 140 cm soil layers which soil water storage increased by 47 86 mm after six year planting the crop water consumption in the post flowering period improved in pm r significantly and the ratio of water consumption in post flowering to total significantly increased by 19 54 51 09 p 0 05 grain yield of pm r were significantly decreased by 59 14 than pm c but there were no significant differences in benefit mainly because the price of fababean was higher consequently pm r maintained stable benefit with low water cost and significantly increased ewue could be promoted as a method for sustainable development of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching technology in the semi arid area of the northwest loess plateau china authors contributions experimental design h l w x c z x f y h z h y j f and y f m instruments installation and data

11404,soil erosion by water is one of the main causes of land degradation and reduced agricultural productivity in africa leading to an estimated annual loss in crop yield of 280 million tons to reverse this problem various indigenous and recently introduced cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques have been implemented these include fanya juu 1 1 a kiswahili word referring to throw uphill corresponding to the csb swc structure built by throwing soil upslope from a ditch soil bunds stone bunds bench terraces vegetative barriers and tied ridges in this review we analyze and synthesize the results of various studies that focused on the effects of csb swc techniques on runoff soil loss soil properties crop yield and biomass in sub saharan africa ssa introduction of various csb swc techniques was found to reduce runoff and soil loss by 13 71 and 39 83 respectively more than 80 of the reviewed scientific studies showed a positive effect on crop yield mainly due to retention of nutrients and moisture the effect of csb swc techniques on crop yield varies with rainfall and slope with most of the csb swc techniques improving crop yields in low rainfall areas fanya juu and soil bunds were effective on relatively gentle slopes while hedgerows and stone bunds were effective even on moderately steep slopes however studies across ssa indicate that some csb swc techniques could have negative side effects such as waterlogging also these techniques are associated with the occupation of significant areas of cultivable land thus they require proper design and implementation in most cases csb swc techniques are economically feasible due to improved crop yield and low labor opportunity costs however implementation may be hampered by high construction costs small landholding size land tenure insecurity and low short term benefits effectiveness and benefits of csb swc can be improved by their integration with other land management techniques such as soil fertility amendments and conservation tillage keywords cross slope barrier soil moisture terrace economic feasibility trade offs 1 introduction soil quality and water availability are major factors determining global food production obtained from only 12 of the earth s land surface faostat 2015 soil erosion one of the main causes of soil degradation is common in many regions troeh et al 1991 removing 75 billion tons of soil annually pimentel et al 1995 agricultural activities are responsible for 75 of global soil erosion affecting 80 of the world s cultivated soils pimentel 2006 and adversely impacting food production on 40 of the agricultural land bossio et al 2010 retaining soil quality and increasing soil water availability is a challenge of paramount importance for the production of food for the increasing global population agricultural productivity and food security have been particularly challenging in most countries in sub saharan africa ssa where soil quality and soil water availability are major limiting factors agriculture in ssa is also important as it provides employment for about 70 of its more than 1 billion inhabitants rockström et al 2010 serdeczny et al 2016 world bank 2016 africa is among the continents that suffer much from soil erosion and land degradation pimentel et al 1995 nyssen et al 2009 the problem of soil erosion is most severe in the densely populated highlands of east africa place et al 2006 as a result africa loses 280 million tons annually of crop yield with an estimated economic value of 127 billion usd year 1 unep 2015 the severity of soil erosion and its consequences in some ssa countries was already recognized in the 1930 s and 1940 s young 1990 but the implementation of effective countermeasures remains a challenge throughout the region the severity and spread of soil erosion depend mainly on the management of agricultural land cultivation of marginal lands by the increasing population decreasing area per capita landholding has aggravated soil erosion in africa willcocks and twomlow 1993 furthermore the nature of soils such as susceptibility to crusting spaan et al 2005 the erosive and torrential nature of the rainfall angima et al 2002 babalola et al 2007 and the steepness of slopes make soil erosion severe in the ssa in addition about 50 of the soil in africa is categorized as arenosols leptosols and ferrasols all having low inherent fertility due to limited nutrient reserves and water retention capacity jones et al 2013 tully et al 2015 erosion further degrades hydrological properties of the soil through the decrease of soil organic matter content and consequently declining aggregate stability and water holding capacity while increasing soil crusting accordingly erosion reduces water use efficiency and increases drought stress tsubo and walker 2007 stroosnijder 2009 the excessive removal of essential plant nutrients and soil organic matter by erosion can impede the physical biological and chemical functioning of soil ultimately soil erosion and degradation imperil crop production and food security for instance annual agricultural production declines of 0 5 1 in burkina faso niemeijer and mazzucato 2002 and 1 2 in ethiopia adgo et al 2013 have been observed ninety five percent of the african agricultural land is rain fed rockström 2004 and 41 of the land area in ssa is estimated to receive less than 600 mm rainfall annually vohland and barry 2009 considering the rainfall threshold to create sufficient soil moisture for a given crop e g 500 mm to grow maize wiyo et al 2000 there is a significant risk of water shortage for plants in ssa rockström et al 2010 world bank 2017 in semi arid areas of ssa long dry spells and drought occur once or twice in every ten years and the affected areas are characterized by a potential evapotranspiration being greater than rainfall during half of the year mupangwa et al 2006 examples of severe droughts have been reported for burkina faso in 1970 s reij et al 2005 malawi in 1980s and 1990s wiyo and feyen 1999 ethiopia in 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s bekele and drake 2003 biazin and sterk 2013 and south africa tsubo and walker 2007 to solve soil degradation and soil water scarcity problems farmers in the nile basin have developed and implemented cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques that fit their specific agricultural activities during the last 7000 years lowdermilk 1948 roose 2008 applied csb swc techniques involve features that are meant to obstruct surface runoff and soil loss examples of indigenous csb swcs sometimes called ethno engineering include trenches and terraces in some rain fed yet water deficient areas where stones are available farmers built stone bunds to limit surface runoff and soil erosion while retaining water critchley et al 1994 for instance the konso people in ethiopia adopted and continuously implemented stone bunds for more than 500 years to improve and sustain crop production in dry areas beshah 2003 stone bunds also have been used for many years in other parts of ssa including ghana mali cameroon and malawi reij et al 1996 mainly on steep sloping lands wocat 2011 besides stone bunds other indigenous and introduced csb swc practices have been adopted in different parts of the ssa small pits bunds fanya juu 2 2 a kiswahili word referring to throw uphill corresponding to the csb swc structure built by throwing soil upslope from a ditch ridges and grass strips have long been used to conserve water for crop production in dry areas of some countries such as tanzania mali burkina faso niger sudan and kenya critchley et al 1994 malley et al 2004 for instance the matengo people in tanzania practice ngoro planting pits for more than 200 years to harvest and conserve rainwater malley et al 2004 planting pits labeled zai tessa towalen are well adopted in west africa lahmar et al 2012 and common in mali and burkina faso reij et al 1996 and niger baidu forson 1999 in eastern sudan teras or small earthen bunds are common and used to conserve water and nutrients niemeijer 1998 fanya juu a combination of ditch and earth embankment has been adopted in kenya ellis jones and tengberg 2000 ridges a combination of a small furrow and soil embankment are practiced in west cameroon tchawa 1996 in tanzania miraba or scattered grass strips have been traditionally practiced mwango et al 2015a upon increased recognition of the negative impacts of water shortage soil erosion and land degradation on agricultural production the governments in several countries of the ssa emphasized the promotion and implementation of csb swc techniques since the 1950 s young 1990 thus indigenous practices in combination with novel techniques developed and tested in other areas were introduced for wider implementations depending on local conditions several techniques have been tested and adapted on station and on farm prior to promotion and implementation in cultivated lands of ssa babalola et al 2007 table 1 selected csb swc techniques developed and tested in different parts of ssa often vary with edaphic climatic topographic and crop characteristics and their interactions here we present a comprehensive and updated review and synthesis on effects of csb swc in diverse agro ecological and socio economic conditions of ssa the aim of the review is to examine and synthesize the effects of csb swc on surface runoff soil and nutrient loss and crop yield in ssa to this aim various studies from across the ssa were accessed online in google scholar and web of science using combinations of keywords such as soil and water conservation crop yield and biomass soil loss runoff soil property fanya juu soil bund stone bund terrace bench terrace grass strip hedgerow vegetative barrier ridges tied ridge pits and names of countries in ssa in addition to the relative effects of csb swc on runoff soil loss soil properties and crop yield the importance of rainfall and slope on the efficiency of various csb swc techniques was assessed the economic feasibility of csb swc s and the associated socio economic and institutional aspects influencing their implementation and management were also examined 2 scope and overview of csb swc techniques in ssa small ditches and planting pits can collect surface runoff and store water ultimately abating soil erosion in addition other physical barriers in general parallel to the contour lines may limit surface runoff such barriers may consist of bunds made of soil or other materials such as stone crop residue and wood accordingly various forms of csb swc techniques such as stone bunds lines soil bunds fanya juu bench terraces vegetative barriers trash lines and ridges tied ridges are practiced in different parts of ssa wocat 2011 fig 1 the choice of techniques depends on biophysical characteristics availability of construction materials and land management experiences of farmers here we emphasize the commonly practiced csb swc techniques in ssa table 1 utilized in annual cropping systems and assess their effect on surface runoff soil loss soil moisture distribution nutrients and soil organic matter content and crop yields 3 effect of csb swc on runoff and soil moisture csb swc techniques reduce surface runoff on average by 13 71 fig 2 level fanya juu reduces surface runoff on average by 71 whereas stone bunds bench terraces tied ridges and trash lines reduce it by 51 57 effects of csb swc on runoff varies from place to place based on rainfall slope and selected technique for instance studies in ethiopia herweg and ludi 1999 and tanzania tenge et al 2011 indicate that level fanya juu reduced surface runoff by 54 95 whereas level soil bunds in ethiopia reduced the surface runoff by 17 94 herweg and ludi 1999 amare et al 2014 in both fanya juu and soil bunds the ditch and soil embankments are designed to obstruct and temporarily store surface runoff and thus reduce cumulative surface flow level and graded fanya juu and graded soil bunds limit surface runoff effectively in lands with a small slope and their effect was smaller at the greater slope graded soil bunds were effective in high rainfall conditions table 4 research in kenya ethiopia and burkina faso indicated that stone bunds reduced surface runoff in most cases by more than 50 in tunyai semi arid kenya where rainfall in the cropping season was 243 mm 3 months stone bunds reduced surface runoff by 86 wakindiki and ben hur 2002 in ethiopia stone bunds reduced surface runoff by 64 68 in anjeni rainfall of 1690 mm year 1 assefa 2007 and in tigray rainfall of 724 mm year 1 taye et al 2013 the effectiveness of stone bunds increased with decreased spacing zougmore et al 2000 but this demands additional labor stones and cultivable area the mean reduction in surface runoff by grass strips and hedgerows was 56 and 61 respectively grass strips reduced surface runoff in nigeria babalola et al 2007 oku and aiyelari 2013 ethiopia welle et al 2006 and tanzania tenge et al 2005 on average by 25 60 but lower effectiveness was observed in burkina faso zougmoré et al 2004 in kenya hedgerows reduced surface runoff by 77 kiepe 1996 10 50 kinama et al 2007 and 16 angima et al 2002 newly established vegetative barriers are little effective in decreasing surface runoff but their ability increases when vegetation stiffness and density gradually increase the effect of such barriers is species dependent welle et al 2006 in tigray of ethiopia tied ridges reduced surface runoff by 60 70 and 49 for rainfall volumes of 341 mm 292 mm and 507 mm respectively araya and stroosnijder 2010 in north wollo ethiopia where rainfall in the cropping season was less than 500 mm tied ridges reduced surface runoff with the highest efficiency about 97 of surface runoff retained at the smaller slope 1 5 mchugh et al 2007 tied ridges in machanga kenya reduced surface runoff by 51 and 58 during the short and long rainy season respectively okeyo et al 2014 the effect of tied ridges on reducing surface runoff was negatively correlated with the slope table 4 indicating its smaller effectiveness on steep sloping land mchugh et al 2007 the retained surface runoff by csb swc infiltrates gradually in the root zone and improves plant available water reddy 2016 studies indicate that croplands applying csb swc techniques including bench terraces in tanzania tenge et al 2011 tied ridges and rock bunds in burkina faso hulugalle 1987 hulugalle et al 1990 fanya juu and tied ridges in zimbabwe motsi et al 2004 and vegetative barriers in kenya guto et al 2012 showed a higher soil moisture in anjenie watershed of northwestern ethiopia terraces enabled an additional crop growing season by using residual moisture adgo et al 2013 the storage and horizontal flow of moisture in areas between csb swc techniques favor crop growth during critical dry spells according to a study in zimbabwe water collected in contour ridges combined with infiltration pits efficiently benefited a small area about 3 m upslope and downslope of the structure on flat slopes whereas areas at greater distance benefited less mupangwa et al 2012 nyakudya et al 2014 4 effect of csb swc on soil loss the effectiveness of csb swc techniques on reducing soil loss depends on the combined role of the types of the techniques rainfall soil properties vegetation cover and slope morgan 2005 taye et al 2013 ninety six percent of the reviewed scientific reports n 140 indicate that csb swc measures could reduce soil erosion table 2 fig 3 on average csb swc techniques decreased soil loss by 39 83 fig 3 the average soil loss reduced by tied ridges was about 40 but it can control more than 60 tenge et al 2011 okeyo et al 2014 whereas for level fanya juu in kenya tanzania and ethiopia this was more than 70 herweg and ludi 1999 tenge et al 2011 soil bunds retained nearly half of the soil assefa 2007 adimassu et al 2014 grass strips reduced soil loss by about 50 zougmoré et al 2009 fig 3 the effectiveness of these vegetative barriers is gradual compared to other csb swc techniques because their development into terraces which also depends on species is a slow process for instance in ethiopia studies demonstrated that vetiver grass was more effective than desho and setaria grasses welle et al 2006 elephant grass reduced soil loss more than tephrosia local and vetiver grasses amare et al 2014 in nigeria water erosion was reduced through the closer spacing of the vegetative barriers oku and aiyelari 2013 vegetative barriers do not require excessive labor but in many semi arid areas they are difficult to establish and sustain in dry seasons thus grass strips can better reduce soil loss in areas where rainfall affects its growth favorably table 4 stone bunds reduced average soil loss by more than 60 wakindiki and ben hur 2002 gebrernichael et al 2005 teshome et al 2013 and work well even on steep sloping lands these techniques are mainly important in situations where stones are available and clearing excess stones from agricultural land is required however exhausting rock fragments for building the stone bunds reduces stones to dissipate surface runoff and prevent splash erosion nyssen et al 2001 the rate of soil loss from fanya juu soil bunds stone bunds and vegetative barriers is expected to decrease gradually as sediment accumulates at the upslope side of the barrier and land surface is ultimately transformed to a flatter slope banda et al 1994 commonly labeled as bench terrace this means that in the areas in between the csb swc techniques the slope and thus the surface runoff velocity and soil loss tend to decrease mekonnen et al 2015 depending on upslope erosion and sediment transport bench terraces can form in a limited number of years e g for fanya juu they may form in 7 years herweg and ludi 1999 this results in sedimentation of several tens of cm of topsoil in the narrow space upslope of the barrier kagabo et al 2013 this also involves the accumulation of nutrients studies indicate synergy of two or more csb swc techniques at the farm level in the blue nile basin of ethiopia where fanya juu was coupled with conservation tillage the efficiency of trapping sediment and surface runoff increased temesgen et al 2012 also strengthening of soil bunds with grasses reduced soil loss and made the land occupied by the barrier productive amare et al 2014 the minimum tillage practiced on cropland in between successive vegetative barriers also reduced soil loss in kenya guto et al 2012 it is also noted that integration of grass and woody plant in vegetative barriers increased the efficiency of erosion control kinama et al 2007 5 effect of csb swc on retention of nutrients and soil organic carbon in general csb swc techniques reduce sediment transport including soil organic matter which also contains nutrients like nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k from cultivated lands zougmoré et al 2009 adimassu et al 2014 the csb swc induced retention of nutrients and soil organic carbon soc is largest just upslope from the barrier and smallest in the downslope dercon et al 2003 siriri et al 2005 amare et al 2013 kagabo et al 2013 however also uniform soil properties in the area between csb swc techniques have been reported damene 2012 which might be attributed to aged and nearly level benches in general csb swc techniques result in locally enhanced contents of soc nutrients and cation exchange capacity cec for instance the bench terraces in nyamasheke district of rwanda a 30 year old fanya juu in kenya tugizimana 2011 and a 5 year old fanya juu in goromti watershed of ethiopia hailu et al 2012 stored more soc than adjacent reference plots in addition to soc increased soil n and p were found in croplands treated with soil bunds in wollo area of ethiopia asnake 2016 stone lines in northern burkina faso zougmore et al 2002 soil and stone bunds in gondor area of ethiopia getnet 2014 and soil bunds in mirab abaya district of ethiopia bezabih 2015 higher cec was also reported for croplands treated with csb swc techniques than for reference plots in anjenie mengistu et al 2016 and ambachia hailu 2017 ethiopia vegetative barriers may improve soil quality through organic matter input and n fixation depending on species composition but appropriate management is required to minimize competition with adjacent crops guto et al 2012 enhanced soc soil n p and k were observed in grass strips in tanzania mwango et al 2015b in kenya more k was observed in hedgerows and grass strips mutegi et al 2008 because of reduced erosion and mineralization of freshly added litterfall to the surface soil banda et al 1994 the importance of csb swc for increased soc and soil nutrients is not seen everywhere and several cases showing insignificant changes for instance after 5 years of stone lines no significant change in k was observed in burkina faso zougmore et al 2002 fanya juu management for nearly three decades showed no significant differences in soc soil n and p in anjenie watershed of ethiopia mengistu et al 2016 and in n in kenya saiz et al 2016 when compared to reference plots also a 5 10 years old fanya juu in goromti watershed of ethiopia hailu et al 2012 and soil and stone bunds managed for 4 9 years in bokole watershed of southern ethiopia wolka et al 2011 did not result in significant changes in cec k and p insignificant change was also reported for soc associated with grass strips for about two years in kenya mutegi et al 2008 and stone bunds and tied ridges in burkina faso hulugalle et al 1990 6 effect of csb swc on crop yield and biomass about 80 of the reviewed studies revealed that csb swc techniques have a positive effect on crop yield and biomass production the extents of increase in crop yield vary according to type of the csb swc and characteristics of the areas table 3 fig 4 a study of the effect of fanya juu in eastern ethiopia revealed that it could have a promising effect on maize yield with 7 5 to 87 increase araso et al 2016 also other studies showed a positive but highly variable effect of fanya juu on crop yields these include 80 increase of maize yield in zimbabwe motsi et al 2004 less than 5 to nearly 168 increase of maize and bean yields in tanzania tenge et al 2011 at some experimental sites treated with graded fanya juu e g in ethiopia the relative change in crop yield was small 14 increase and sometimes even negative 50 decrease herweg and ludi 1999 the decrease in crop yields due to fanya juu was found for croplands in ethiopia adimassu et al 2017 decreases occurred in areas with high rainfall and steep slopes table 4 in ethiopia after 25 years of fanya juu upslope from the ditch showed higher yield of wheat and maize than downslope areas amare et al 2013 a study on 5 sloping land of west hararghe ethiopia indicated that the soil bunds fanya chini increased maize yield by 1 02 t ha 1 or 20 1 in the first year and 1 3 t ha 1 or 45 in the second year compared to untreated land araso et al 2016 in tanzania the soil bunds increased rice production by 0 32 t ha 1 or 35 to 0 67 t ha 1 or 108 compared to the reference plot in rain fed cultivation raes et al 2007 in rwanda contour bunds increased bean yield by 0 06 t ha 1 20 5 more than reference tugizimana 2011 some studies reported a decline in crop yield for instance 7 decline in barley yield in croplands treated with graded soil bunds was observed in central ethiopia adimassu et al 2014 long term experiments on graded soil bunds in ethiopia indicated 5 increase to 39 decline in crop yield herweg and ludi 1999 with regard to stone bunds 81 of the reviewed analyses n 32 reported positive effects whereas in some dry areas more than 200 increase in crop yield was recorded studies indicated positive effects of stone bunds on maize yield in kenya wakindiki and ben hur 2002 and tanzania rwehumbiza et al 1999 and on sorghum yield in ethiopia alemayehu et al 2006 and burkina faso hulugalle et al 1990 it was reported that stone bunds resulted in a relatively higher crop yield in areas with low rainfall than in areas with high rainfall kassie et al 2008 thus its effect on yield was negatively correlated with rainfall table 4 in ethiopia stone bunds resulted in higher yield of sorghum at upslope than downslope of the bund alemayehu et al 2006 non uniformity in crop yield being higher at the upslope side and lower at downslope side was also reported by other studies vagen et al 1999 vancampenhout et al 2006 trash lines bench terraces grass strips and hedgerows predominantly showed a positive effect on crop yield table 3 trash lines increased maize yield in kenya kiome and stocking 1995 wakindiki and ben hur 2002 bench terraces increased maize and bean yield in tanzania and rwanda tenge et al 2011 tugizimana 2011 grass strips and hedgerows are cheap to establish but may suppress grain yield so that higher yield can be observed at the center in between the strips guto et al 2012 even though a high number of studies using grass strips observed positive effects on crop yield table 3 babalola et al 2007 mwango et al 2015b a significant number of studies reported adverse herweg and ludi 1999 zougmoré et al 2004 kinama et al 2007 mutegi et al 2008 and null effects rwehumbiza et al 1999 hedgerows showed positive effects on maize yield in kenya mutegi et al 2008 and malawi banda et al 1994 by contrast decreases in maize and cowpea yields were found in kenya kinama et al 2007 tied ridges are the most frequently tested csb swc technique for conserving moisture and improving crop yield in low rainfall areas 1000 mm year 1 about 83 of the reviewed trials n 159 showed a positive effect of tied ridges on crop yields table 3 this confirms an earlier review on tillage research for eastern africa specifically ethiopia kenya tanzania and malawi where tied ridging also was found to have positive effects on grain yield biamah et al 1993 for instance sorghum in burkina faso hulugalle et al 1990 ethiopia mesfin et al 2009 and sudan kara et al 2008 showed positive results also maize in kenya kiome and stocking 1995 and ethiopia belay et al 1998 biazin and stroosnijder 2012 responded positively the tied ridges aim at retaining the rain falling on ridge and furrow in soils with low infiltration rate or poor drainage especially in areas with intensive rainfall waterlogging may occur causing a negative effect on yield jensen et al 2003 thus the response of maize crop to different forms of ridging and planting may vary with soil types for example tied ridges on entisol did not improve maize yield whereas those on vertisol increased yield belay et al 1998 planting on ridges or in furrows also affects the access to moisture and the exposure to waterlogging in kenya the cowpea yield grown by intercropping declined by 0 08 mg ha 1 in one season and increased by 211 in another when tied ridging was compared with ox plow with no csb swc techniques miriti et al 2012 the role of tied ridges on yield depends on soil characteristics rainfall crop type and relative planting positions on ridge in furrow for instance implementing tied ridges on less sloping land and in low intense rainfall areas mchugh et al 2007 araya and stroosnijder 2010 planting crops like sorghum in furrows brhane et al 2006 and growing plants such as pulses on ridges brhane and wortmann 2008 resulted in increasing crop yield this effect was more beneficial in areas with moisture stress or low rainfall wiyo and feyen 1999 annual rainfall of 500 700 mm jensen et al 2003 coarse textured soil and rainfall with poor distribution intense for some time followed by little rain gebrekidan 2003 by contrast a study in malawi showed that tied ridges have limited benefit in coarse textured soil in which a higher proportion of the water is immediately lost through drainage wiyo et al 2000 planting on ridges especially in dry areas has depressed crop yield because ridges are relatively elevated and have lower moisture during dry spells vogel 1993 it has been argued that practicing tied ridges has no benefit at above average rainfall araya and stroosnijder 2010 and in high rainfall conditions 700 900 mm per year stephens and hess 1999 wiyo et al 2000 jensen et al 2003 this is because in high rainfall areas moisture stress may not challenge crop performance and thus crop yield our correlation analysis for tied ridge systems table 4 including studies with mean annual rainfall of 400 mm 1300 mm showed no relationship between yield and rainfall combining the csb swc techniques with other management activities may further enhance crop yields in nigeria crop yield was improved when grass strips were combined with mulching of cropland babalola et al 2007 furthermore integrating tied ridges with mulching in semi arid areas improved crop yield biomass and soil moisture in swaziland ndlangamandla et al 2016 and crop yield in ethiopia belay et al 1998 it was also noted that integration of grass and woody plant in vegetative barriers improved crop yield in kenya mutegi et al 2008 integrating csb swc techniques can increase fertilizer and water use efficiency of crops the effect of residual n and p fertilizer on crop became superior when combined with tied ridges belay et al 1998 the application of farmyard manure in croplands treated with tied ridges increased grain yield in ethiopia when compared without tied ridges biazin and stroosnijder 2012 in burkina faso soil water storage and water use efficiency of crop increased when compost and manure was applied in croplands with barriers of stone rows and grass strips compared with no barrier and mineral treatments especially in years with reliable rainfall distribution zougmoré et al 2004 csb swc techniques like stone bunds increased crop biomass in ethiopia alemayehu et al 2006 kenya wakindiki and ben hur 2002 and tanzania rwehumbiza et al 1999 grass strips also improved crop biomass except in some cases herweg and ludi 1999 zougmoré et al 2004 about 73 of the analyses n 96 on tied ridges reported higher biomass of crop compared with reference plots table 3 crop biomass when retained on croplands after harvest essentially builds soil organic matter lal 2006 which in turn increases resistance of the soil to erosion due to improved aggregate stability reduced crusting problem and high water retention capacity bossio et al 2010 in ssa increased crop biomass production is also relevant as it contributes to livestock forage fuel wood and construction material all uses which compete with its role as soil quality enhancer 7 economic feasibility of csb swc among smallholder farmers crop yield and biomass are major benefits which are principally valued in economic feasibility estimates by farmers several economic feasibility studies of csb swc techniques across ssa have been published kiome and stocking 1995 tenge et al 2005 teshome et al 2013 matere et al 2016 tesfaye et al 2016 in west usambara highlands of tanzania bench terraces fanya juu and grass strips were found to be economically attractive with the maximum net present value 3 3 the difference in current cash inflow and outflow of 608 usd per ha 1 at 8 discount of future return mainly at low labor opportunity cost tenge et al 2005 tenge et al 2005 also showed that the net present value decreases for steeper slope and unstable soil a study in kenya indicated that terraces tied ridges and trash lines were profitable mainly at null labor opportunity cost and if integrated with soil fertility enhancement options kiome and stocking 1995 for semi arid areas of kenya fanya juu showed positive economic benefits matere et al 2016 in gedeb watershed ethiopia a study covering 750 households at the altitudinal range of 1500 to 3500 m above sea level the benefit cost ratio was estimated as 1 24 0 9 and 1 03 for soil bunds stone bunds and fanya juu respectively tesfaye et al 2016 in debre mewi and anjeni watersheds of ethiopia soil bunds fanya juu and stone bunds were profitable despite fluctuations due to different assumptions e g with and without grass yield changes dimensions of the structures as expected profitability was influenced highly by assumed changes in crop yield teshome et al 2013 in anjeni ethiopia terraces developed from fanya juu and grass strips improved crop yield and hence the return showing a higher net benefit 185 usd ha 1 year 1 for barley than for maize 34 5 usd ha 1 year 1 and teff 20 9 usd ha 1 year 1 this resulted in estimated net present value of 1542 usd in 50 years adgo et al 2013 in eastern ethiopia soil bunds and stone bunds were shown to increase crop yields which resulted in a positive net return for smallholder farmers thus these interventions are considered important technologies to avert dry condition and climate change bekele 2005 some studies reported that csb swc techniques requiring high labor cost for construction and periodic repairing or techniques that fail to produce increased crop yield did not secure net profits hengsdijk et al 2005 kassie et al 2011 bizoza and de graaff 2012 a study of stone bunds in tigray northern ethiopia showed a decrease or insignificant increase in crop yield resulting in insufficient return especially for crops sown on optimal sowing dates hengsdijk et al 2005 in contrast to the reports reviewed in preceding paragraph fanya juu in anjeni watershed of ethiopia annual rainfall 1690 mm elevation 2100 2500 m resulted in estimated crop income decline of 9 16 usd ha 1 kassie et al 2011 which is a rare case in rwanda bench terraces were not profitable unless special considerations were made for labor lower opportunity cost and manure cost bizoza and de graaff 2012 8 socio economic and institutional aspects of csb swc in ssa in the1970 s and 1980 s government led csb swc techniques were widely implemented in ssa through incentives including food for work and paid labor that was mainly supported by donors wocat 2011 the smallholder farmers adoption was low despite wide technical and political promotion and the observed positive effects of the techniques on reducing soil erosion improving crop yields and increasing net economic returns various socio economic and institutional factors limited adoption for instance contour ridges and bunds were massively promoted and implemented during colonial periods in ssa but following independence the interventions were demolished or abandoned since they were regarded as coercion tasks young 1990 the total landholding can affect implementation and wider adoptions of the csb swc techniques several studies reported that owning smaller farm area discourages farmers to practice csb swc in uganda mugonola et al 2013 burkina faso sidibé 2005 ethiopia amsalu and de graaff 2007 anley et al 2007 kassie et al 2011 tesfaye et al 2014 and tanzania mbaga semgalawe and henk 2000 because csb swc techniques may occupy up to 20 of the cultivable area depending on slope soil stability and type of the technique stroosnijder 2009 in west usambara highlands of tanzania bench terraces fanya juu and grass strips occupied cultivable area of 5 42 8 40 and 1 15 respectively tenge et al 2005 in ethiopia fanya juu soil bunds and stone bunds were estimated to occupy 6 9 6 7 and 5 5 5 of the area respectively teshome et al 2013 it has been also estimated that contour ridges in zimbabwe consumed 15 of the cultivable land area nyamadzawo et al 2013 however some studies suggested that farmers owning a relatively large area of land tended to neglect the adoption of the csb swc measures teshome et al 2016 the contradicting effects of landholding size on adoption of csb swc techniques might indicate that the interplay of landholding with other factors might be more important than the factor itself also labor availability may affect adoption of most csb swc techniques land to productive labor ratio age and sex of the household heads indicators of the availability of labor affected adoption of csb swc techniques a high land to labor ratio caused a negative effect on the adoption of soil bunds and fanya juu terraces in dedo area of ethiopia anley et al 2007 households led by the male were more inclined to adopt grass strips in uganda and dead contour bunds in gwanda district of zimbabwe munamati and nyagumbo 2010 in rwanda female headed households showed a poor adoption rate of bench terraces bizoza 2014 in tanzania the participation in labor sharing groups had a positive effect on adoption of fanya juu terraces bench terraces ditches grass strips and trash lines mbaga semgalawe and henk 2000 tied ridges construction required about 33 additional labor than conventional cultivation nyamadzawo et al 2013 and it was argued that the return in grain yield cannot compensate for the labor demand even in under climate uncertainty this inhibited its dissemination in southern africa wiyo and feyen 1999 and in kenya mutuku 2016 in ethiopia households with higher labor capacity were willing to practice soil bunds fanya juu and stone bunds bewket 2007 tesfaye et al 2014 teshome et al 2016 livestock number educational level and perceived severity of soil erosion and the benefits of csb swc to mitigate soil erosion affected adoption increased numbers of owned livestock discouraged farmers to practice csb swc techniques as they do not economically depend on crop production alone mugonola et al 2013 also the educational level of household heads showed a positive role on the construction and adoption of stone bunds in northern burkina faso sidibé 2005 bench terrace in rwanda bizoza 2014 soil bunds and fanya juu in dedo area of ethiopia anley et al 2007 and some csb swc techniques in nigeria junge et al 2009 however people with a higher education level tended to engage preferably in off farm activities rather than in labor intensive work on csb swc techniques as was reported for machakos area of kenya mutuku 2016 studies in different parts of ssa indicated that the recognized severity of soil erosion problems motivated smallholder farmers to implement csb swc techniques baidu forson 1999 tadesse and belay 2004 wildemeersch et al 2013 especially on sloping lands bekele and drake 2003 damtew et al 2015 this was to acquire perceived profitability due to improved crop yield in the short term baidu forson 1999 tenge et al 2004 amsalu and de graaff 2007 for the rural poor who primarily rely on agricultural production the low immediate benefit of some csb swc techniques discouraged their implementation shiferaw et al 2009 institutional factors such as access to extension services information and land tenure can influence adoption of csb swc measures in ssa access to training experts advice peer discussions and media e g television radio are helpful to facilitate the construction and adoption of csb swc measures training opportunity and access to extension services were shown to enhance implementation in niger baidu forson 1999 tanzania tenge et al 2004 kenya mutuku 2016 mali bodnár et al 2006 and ethiopia anley et al 2007 damtew et al 2015 teshome et al 2016 membership in farmers organization played a positive role in stone bunds construction in northern burkina faso sidibé 2005 as it helps in obtaining information and sharing experience risk attitude and land tenure arrangements also influence implementation of csb swc for instance efforts in reducing risks arising from climate or technology failure on crop yield affected csb swc acceptability shiferaw et al 2009 and had a negative effect on adoption baidu forson 1999 the risk aversion preferences of farmers like the tendency to prioritize the current low production without csb swc techniques affected their adoption lee 2005 therefore it was recommended to consider these factors by increasing tenure security awareness through formal education extension and off farm income options teklewold and kohlin 2011 the tenure issue influenced farmers acceptance of the csb swc techniques in ethiopia bewket 2007 and tanzania tenge et al 2004 in malawi the land tenure insecurity reduced adoption of csb swc by 9 lovo 2016 9 discussion the effect of csb swc techniques on improving crop yield was dependent on rainfall characteristics types of crop slope and soil the observed yield improvement was mainly due to retained soil moisture nutrients and soc hedgerows in addition can access nutrients from deeper parts of the soil may fix nitrogen depending on species and can enrich surface soils through litterfall most csb swc techniques support crop production more in areas where rainfall is not high but sufficient and temporal distribution is scattered reddy 2016 with dry spells of 2 4 weeks rockström 2004 this is partly because moisture may not be a limiting factor for crop production in high rainfall areas thus the effect of csb swc on crop yield was negatively correlated with rainfall for the majority of the techniques including level fanya juu graded soil bunds stone bunds and trash lines also graded fanya juu and graded soil bunds which were built in high rainfall areas 935 1690 mm year 1 showed small effects on crop yields furthermore after intense rainfall the backwater in non permeable constructions such as fanya juu and tied ridges created waterlogging in slow draining soils thus adversely affecting the performance of intolerant crops herweg and ludi 1999 however there are water scarce conditions where slow draining soil increases moisture availability and enhances crop yield in tied ridges belay et al 1998 the selection of crop types e g tolerant to waterlogging and identification of planting position on the ridge or in furrow can assist in coping with rainfall effects hedgerows and grass strips grow better in areas with sufficient rainfall and contribute to protection against moisture and nutrient loss thus their effect on crop yield was positively correlated with rainfall embankment of fanya juu and soil bunds are less stable and occupy the more cultivable area in steep slope and thus slope showed negative correlation on the effect of these techniques on crop yield stone bunds trash lines grass strip and hedgerows are stable on relatively steeper slopes csb swc techniques retaining moisture and nutrients in upslope areas produced greater yield upslope than downslope by contrast downslope of the constructions the soil gradually loses its surface layer due to erosion thus becoming less fertile vancampenhout et al 2006 accordingly accessibility of retained nutrients by crops growing in areas in between csb swc techniques cannot be equated with the quantity lost from untreated plots due to the non uniformity farmers destroy some barriers in 10 years interval at most which is after about 2 3 years of forming a bench terrace siriri et al 2005 similarly in south africa farmers destroyed earth contour bunds spread trapped sediment and rebuild every 2 3 years philliphs howard and oche 1996 such experiences were reported also for stone bunds in bokole watershed ethiopia wolka et al 2013 in addition to the non uniformity in sediment deposition there are situations in which grass strips and hedgerows compete for sunlight moisture and nutrient and influence crop production the majority of csb swc techniques reduce the volume of surface runoff due to their ability to retain water and enhance infiltration their effectiveness in reducing the volume of surface runoff also varies with the types of the techniques slope and rainfall studies showed that tied ridges fanya juu and graded soil bunds were less effective on steeper slopes due to less stability of the soil embankment with regard to rainfall the graded soil bunds fit in high rainfall conditions due to their ability to discharge excess surface runoff the grass strips also function in high rainfall areas as rain favors their growth and stiffness however torrential rainfall events in the tropics create concentrated surface runoff that can break through this barrier resulting in increased surface flow poor management of the techniques for instance failure to repair periodically can cause concentrated water breaking through the top of embankment which is highly erosive causing breaking them before the formation of bench terrace can also reinstate the runoff most studies show that csb swc techniques reduce soil loss due to decreased volume and velocity of the surface runoff moreover roots of grass strips and hedgerows anchor soil particles and reduce soil loss stone bunds and grass strips are stable and thus can reduce soil loss even on steep slopes on average the soil loss reduced by level fanya juu is high especially in low rainfall areas since both its ditch and embankment serve as a barrier the mean soil loss reduced by tied ridges was relatively small due to its shallow ditches for water and sediment retention the average soil loss reduced by the csb swc techniques appeared sometimes not adequate when compared with average soil formation rate per year for instance it was reported that terraces in ethiopia lose more than 30 t ha 1 year 1 even after three decades of development subhatu et al 2017 tamene et al 2017 soil loss may to some extent be compensated by soil formation however the topsoil lost by erosion is richer in organic matter and essential nutrients e g n p and k than the newly formed soils from the parent material since soil formation is much slower in dry areas where conserving water and soil fertility is crucial for crop production the csb swc techniques need to be judged by the change of soc nutrients and moisture reduced soil loss implies increased availability of nutrients and soil organic carbon in most of the croplands treated with csb swc techniques when compared with reference plots studies showed the insignificant change in nutrients and soc due to some csb swc techniques this is partly related to the limited nutrient inputs for some techniques such as soil bunds stone bunds and fanya juu also these techniques retain trapped nutrients in the ditch and upslope from the structures causing limited soil fertility elsewhere in the area between the structures the majority of the reviewed studies show that csb swc techniques are economically feasible at the farm level due to improved yield and biomass since the rural poor have limited job options labor opportunity cost is often low which positively contributes to estimates of economic benefits insignificant economic benefits of csb swc techniques as reported in some studies were due to minor improvements in crop yield per unit area due to waterlogging and insignificant improvement in retained nutrient and moisture also the cultivable area occupied by the csb swc techniques e g fanya juu and soil bunds in ethiopia adimassu et al 2017 may limit crop yield effects and reduce the economic feasibility economic feasibility may be limited due to high construction labor demand of some the techniques if the roles of csb swc techniques on flood control recharging groundwater reducing off site effects of transported sediment and nutrients were accounted for at the watershed scale the economic feasibility would be greater effects on watershed hydrological processes can influence crop yield for instance by affecting cropland siltation and availability of irrigation water implementation of csb swc techniques involves some trade offs that affect their adoption it has been highlighted that major trade offs were related to high construction labor demand and the land area occupied by the techniques stone bunds bench terraces fanya juu and soil bunds demand high labor about 150 500 person ha 1 day 1 wolka 2014 and the shortage of labor highly affect their adoption this indicates that nutrient depletion and land degradation are also associated with poverty unep 2015 given a small area of cultivated land owned per household the areas occupied by csb swc techniques are usually not amenable to farmers 10 conclusion in ssa soil degradation and soil water deficits are major threats to crop production and food security in the past five decades various cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques have been introduced and adopted in different parts of sub saharan africa the roles of these techniques on surface runoff soil loss soil properties crop yield and biomass production varied based on the type of techniques the biophysical condition of the landscape soil properties rainfall and crop as well as their interactions this review shows that majority of the studies found positive effect of csb swc techniques on reducing soil loss and surface runoff retained nutrients and moisture enhanced crop production in general moisture and nutrients were concentrated near csb swc structures especially at the upslope sides and induced spatial variability in soil fertility and crop yield integrating these csb swc techniques with other land management activities such as soil fertility management conservation tillage and mulching could further improve productivity and efficiency the effects of csb swc techniques on crop yield become more prominent in low rainfall conditions in high rainfall areas the level fanya juu stone bunds and trash lines may have adverse effects on crop yield and hence other csb swc alternatives may be preferred soil bunds fanya juu and tied ridges perform better in reducing soil loss and surface runoff and enhancing crop yield in cultivated land on small slopes despite the common assumptions that csb swc measures may not be cost effective and profitable the review of several studies in ssa shows that the csb swcs were profitable in many circumstances the benefit cost analysis principally valued the grain yield and aboveground biomass which are fundamental and of ultimate interest of the smallholder farmers the indirect benefits of the csb swc techniques such as groundwater recharging and controlling flood and sedimentation risks are important for society at large but commonly ignored despite recognized benefits and profits the implementation of csb swc techniques is hindered in several areas mainly due to high labor demand and small landholdings effects of csb swc techniques are dominantly found to be site specific thus choice and management of appropriate techniques require detailed understanding of all relevant climatic soil quality and socio economic factors studies accounting for their benefit at a watershed scale are important to help to assess their importance for the society at large acknowledgement the

11404,soil erosion by water is one of the main causes of land degradation and reduced agricultural productivity in africa leading to an estimated annual loss in crop yield of 280 million tons to reverse this problem various indigenous and recently introduced cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques have been implemented these include fanya juu 1 1 a kiswahili word referring to throw uphill corresponding to the csb swc structure built by throwing soil upslope from a ditch soil bunds stone bunds bench terraces vegetative barriers and tied ridges in this review we analyze and synthesize the results of various studies that focused on the effects of csb swc techniques on runoff soil loss soil properties crop yield and biomass in sub saharan africa ssa introduction of various csb swc techniques was found to reduce runoff and soil loss by 13 71 and 39 83 respectively more than 80 of the reviewed scientific studies showed a positive effect on crop yield mainly due to retention of nutrients and moisture the effect of csb swc techniques on crop yield varies with rainfall and slope with most of the csb swc techniques improving crop yields in low rainfall areas fanya juu and soil bunds were effective on relatively gentle slopes while hedgerows and stone bunds were effective even on moderately steep slopes however studies across ssa indicate that some csb swc techniques could have negative side effects such as waterlogging also these techniques are associated with the occupation of significant areas of cultivable land thus they require proper design and implementation in most cases csb swc techniques are economically feasible due to improved crop yield and low labor opportunity costs however implementation may be hampered by high construction costs small landholding size land tenure insecurity and low short term benefits effectiveness and benefits of csb swc can be improved by their integration with other land management techniques such as soil fertility amendments and conservation tillage keywords cross slope barrier soil moisture terrace economic feasibility trade offs 1 introduction soil quality and water availability are major factors determining global food production obtained from only 12 of the earth s land surface faostat 2015 soil erosion one of the main causes of soil degradation is common in many regions troeh et al 1991 removing 75 billion tons of soil annually pimentel et al 1995 agricultural activities are responsible for 75 of global soil erosion affecting 80 of the world s cultivated soils pimentel 2006 and adversely impacting food production on 40 of the agricultural land bossio et al 2010 retaining soil quality and increasing soil water availability is a challenge of paramount importance for the production of food for the increasing global population agricultural productivity and food security have been particularly challenging in most countries in sub saharan africa ssa where soil quality and soil water availability are major limiting factors agriculture in ssa is also important as it provides employment for about 70 of its more than 1 billion inhabitants rockström et al 2010 serdeczny et al 2016 world bank 2016 africa is among the continents that suffer much from soil erosion and land degradation pimentel et al 1995 nyssen et al 2009 the problem of soil erosion is most severe in the densely populated highlands of east africa place et al 2006 as a result africa loses 280 million tons annually of crop yield with an estimated economic value of 127 billion usd year 1 unep 2015 the severity of soil erosion and its consequences in some ssa countries was already recognized in the 1930 s and 1940 s young 1990 but the implementation of effective countermeasures remains a challenge throughout the region the severity and spread of soil erosion depend mainly on the management of agricultural land cultivation of marginal lands by the increasing population decreasing area per capita landholding has aggravated soil erosion in africa willcocks and twomlow 1993 furthermore the nature of soils such as susceptibility to crusting spaan et al 2005 the erosive and torrential nature of the rainfall angima et al 2002 babalola et al 2007 and the steepness of slopes make soil erosion severe in the ssa in addition about 50 of the soil in africa is categorized as arenosols leptosols and ferrasols all having low inherent fertility due to limited nutrient reserves and water retention capacity jones et al 2013 tully et al 2015 erosion further degrades hydrological properties of the soil through the decrease of soil organic matter content and consequently declining aggregate stability and water holding capacity while increasing soil crusting accordingly erosion reduces water use efficiency and increases drought stress tsubo and walker 2007 stroosnijder 2009 the excessive removal of essential plant nutrients and soil organic matter by erosion can impede the physical biological and chemical functioning of soil ultimately soil erosion and degradation imperil crop production and food security for instance annual agricultural production declines of 0 5 1 in burkina faso niemeijer and mazzucato 2002 and 1 2 in ethiopia adgo et al 2013 have been observed ninety five percent of the african agricultural land is rain fed rockström 2004 and 41 of the land area in ssa is estimated to receive less than 600 mm rainfall annually vohland and barry 2009 considering the rainfall threshold to create sufficient soil moisture for a given crop e g 500 mm to grow maize wiyo et al 2000 there is a significant risk of water shortage for plants in ssa rockström et al 2010 world bank 2017 in semi arid areas of ssa long dry spells and drought occur once or twice in every ten years and the affected areas are characterized by a potential evapotranspiration being greater than rainfall during half of the year mupangwa et al 2006 examples of severe droughts have been reported for burkina faso in 1970 s reij et al 2005 malawi in 1980s and 1990s wiyo and feyen 1999 ethiopia in 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s bekele and drake 2003 biazin and sterk 2013 and south africa tsubo and walker 2007 to solve soil degradation and soil water scarcity problems farmers in the nile basin have developed and implemented cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques that fit their specific agricultural activities during the last 7000 years lowdermilk 1948 roose 2008 applied csb swc techniques involve features that are meant to obstruct surface runoff and soil loss examples of indigenous csb swcs sometimes called ethno engineering include trenches and terraces in some rain fed yet water deficient areas where stones are available farmers built stone bunds to limit surface runoff and soil erosion while retaining water critchley et al 1994 for instance the konso people in ethiopia adopted and continuously implemented stone bunds for more than 500 years to improve and sustain crop production in dry areas beshah 2003 stone bunds also have been used for many years in other parts of ssa including ghana mali cameroon and malawi reij et al 1996 mainly on steep sloping lands wocat 2011 besides stone bunds other indigenous and introduced csb swc practices have been adopted in different parts of the ssa small pits bunds fanya juu 2 2 a kiswahili word referring to throw uphill corresponding to the csb swc structure built by throwing soil upslope from a ditch ridges and grass strips have long been used to conserve water for crop production in dry areas of some countries such as tanzania mali burkina faso niger sudan and kenya critchley et al 1994 malley et al 2004 for instance the matengo people in tanzania practice ngoro planting pits for more than 200 years to harvest and conserve rainwater malley et al 2004 planting pits labeled zai tessa towalen are well adopted in west africa lahmar et al 2012 and common in mali and burkina faso reij et al 1996 and niger baidu forson 1999 in eastern sudan teras or small earthen bunds are common and used to conserve water and nutrients niemeijer 1998 fanya juu a combination of ditch and earth embankment has been adopted in kenya ellis jones and tengberg 2000 ridges a combination of a small furrow and soil embankment are practiced in west cameroon tchawa 1996 in tanzania miraba or scattered grass strips have been traditionally practiced mwango et al 2015a upon increased recognition of the negative impacts of water shortage soil erosion and land degradation on agricultural production the governments in several countries of the ssa emphasized the promotion and implementation of csb swc techniques since the 1950 s young 1990 thus indigenous practices in combination with novel techniques developed and tested in other areas were introduced for wider implementations depending on local conditions several techniques have been tested and adapted on station and on farm prior to promotion and implementation in cultivated lands of ssa babalola et al 2007 table 1 selected csb swc techniques developed and tested in different parts of ssa often vary with edaphic climatic topographic and crop characteristics and their interactions here we present a comprehensive and updated review and synthesis on effects of csb swc in diverse agro ecological and socio economic conditions of ssa the aim of the review is to examine and synthesize the effects of csb swc on surface runoff soil and nutrient loss and crop yield in ssa to this aim various studies from across the ssa were accessed online in google scholar and web of science using combinations of keywords such as soil and water conservation crop yield and biomass soil loss runoff soil property fanya juu soil bund stone bund terrace bench terrace grass strip hedgerow vegetative barrier ridges tied ridge pits and names of countries in ssa in addition to the relative effects of csb swc on runoff soil loss soil properties and crop yield the importance of rainfall and slope on the efficiency of various csb swc techniques was assessed the economic feasibility of csb swc s and the associated socio economic and institutional aspects influencing their implementation and management were also examined 2 scope and overview of csb swc techniques in ssa small ditches and planting pits can collect surface runoff and store water ultimately abating soil erosion in addition other physical barriers in general parallel to the contour lines may limit surface runoff such barriers may consist of bunds made of soil or other materials such as stone crop residue and wood accordingly various forms of csb swc techniques such as stone bunds lines soil bunds fanya juu bench terraces vegetative barriers trash lines and ridges tied ridges are practiced in different parts of ssa wocat 2011 fig 1 the choice of techniques depends on biophysical characteristics availability of construction materials and land management experiences of farmers here we emphasize the commonly practiced csb swc techniques in ssa table 1 utilized in annual cropping systems and assess their effect on surface runoff soil loss soil moisture distribution nutrients and soil organic matter content and crop yields 3 effect of csb swc on runoff and soil moisture csb swc techniques reduce surface runoff on average by 13 71 fig 2 level fanya juu reduces surface runoff on average by 71 whereas stone bunds bench terraces tied ridges and trash lines reduce it by 51 57 effects of csb swc on runoff varies from place to place based on rainfall slope and selected technique for instance studies in ethiopia herweg and ludi 1999 and tanzania tenge et al 2011 indicate that level fanya juu reduced surface runoff by 54 95 whereas level soil bunds in ethiopia reduced the surface runoff by 17 94 herweg and ludi 1999 amare et al 2014 in both fanya juu and soil bunds the ditch and soil embankments are designed to obstruct and temporarily store surface runoff and thus reduce cumulative surface flow level and graded fanya juu and graded soil bunds limit surface runoff effectively in lands with a small slope and their effect was smaller at the greater slope graded soil bunds were effective in high rainfall conditions table 4 research in kenya ethiopia and burkina faso indicated that stone bunds reduced surface runoff in most cases by more than 50 in tunyai semi arid kenya where rainfall in the cropping season was 243 mm 3 months stone bunds reduced surface runoff by 86 wakindiki and ben hur 2002 in ethiopia stone bunds reduced surface runoff by 64 68 in anjeni rainfall of 1690 mm year 1 assefa 2007 and in tigray rainfall of 724 mm year 1 taye et al 2013 the effectiveness of stone bunds increased with decreased spacing zougmore et al 2000 but this demands additional labor stones and cultivable area the mean reduction in surface runoff by grass strips and hedgerows was 56 and 61 respectively grass strips reduced surface runoff in nigeria babalola et al 2007 oku and aiyelari 2013 ethiopia welle et al 2006 and tanzania tenge et al 2005 on average by 25 60 but lower effectiveness was observed in burkina faso zougmoré et al 2004 in kenya hedgerows reduced surface runoff by 77 kiepe 1996 10 50 kinama et al 2007 and 16 angima et al 2002 newly established vegetative barriers are little effective in decreasing surface runoff but their ability increases when vegetation stiffness and density gradually increase the effect of such barriers is species dependent welle et al 2006 in tigray of ethiopia tied ridges reduced surface runoff by 60 70 and 49 for rainfall volumes of 341 mm 292 mm and 507 mm respectively araya and stroosnijder 2010 in north wollo ethiopia where rainfall in the cropping season was less than 500 mm tied ridges reduced surface runoff with the highest efficiency about 97 of surface runoff retained at the smaller slope 1 5 mchugh et al 2007 tied ridges in machanga kenya reduced surface runoff by 51 and 58 during the short and long rainy season respectively okeyo et al 2014 the effect of tied ridges on reducing surface runoff was negatively correlated with the slope table 4 indicating its smaller effectiveness on steep sloping land mchugh et al 2007 the retained surface runoff by csb swc infiltrates gradually in the root zone and improves plant available water reddy 2016 studies indicate that croplands applying csb swc techniques including bench terraces in tanzania tenge et al 2011 tied ridges and rock bunds in burkina faso hulugalle 1987 hulugalle et al 1990 fanya juu and tied ridges in zimbabwe motsi et al 2004 and vegetative barriers in kenya guto et al 2012 showed a higher soil moisture in anjenie watershed of northwestern ethiopia terraces enabled an additional crop growing season by using residual moisture adgo et al 2013 the storage and horizontal flow of moisture in areas between csb swc techniques favor crop growth during critical dry spells according to a study in zimbabwe water collected in contour ridges combined with infiltration pits efficiently benefited a small area about 3 m upslope and downslope of the structure on flat slopes whereas areas at greater distance benefited less mupangwa et al 2012 nyakudya et al 2014 4 effect of csb swc on soil loss the effectiveness of csb swc techniques on reducing soil loss depends on the combined role of the types of the techniques rainfall soil properties vegetation cover and slope morgan 2005 taye et al 2013 ninety six percent of the reviewed scientific reports n 140 indicate that csb swc measures could reduce soil erosion table 2 fig 3 on average csb swc techniques decreased soil loss by 39 83 fig 3 the average soil loss reduced by tied ridges was about 40 but it can control more than 60 tenge et al 2011 okeyo et al 2014 whereas for level fanya juu in kenya tanzania and ethiopia this was more than 70 herweg and ludi 1999 tenge et al 2011 soil bunds retained nearly half of the soil assefa 2007 adimassu et al 2014 grass strips reduced soil loss by about 50 zougmoré et al 2009 fig 3 the effectiveness of these vegetative barriers is gradual compared to other csb swc techniques because their development into terraces which also depends on species is a slow process for instance in ethiopia studies demonstrated that vetiver grass was more effective than desho and setaria grasses welle et al 2006 elephant grass reduced soil loss more than tephrosia local and vetiver grasses amare et al 2014 in nigeria water erosion was reduced through the closer spacing of the vegetative barriers oku and aiyelari 2013 vegetative barriers do not require excessive labor but in many semi arid areas they are difficult to establish and sustain in dry seasons thus grass strips can better reduce soil loss in areas where rainfall affects its growth favorably table 4 stone bunds reduced average soil loss by more than 60 wakindiki and ben hur 2002 gebrernichael et al 2005 teshome et al 2013 and work well even on steep sloping lands these techniques are mainly important in situations where stones are available and clearing excess stones from agricultural land is required however exhausting rock fragments for building the stone bunds reduces stones to dissipate surface runoff and prevent splash erosion nyssen et al 2001 the rate of soil loss from fanya juu soil bunds stone bunds and vegetative barriers is expected to decrease gradually as sediment accumulates at the upslope side of the barrier and land surface is ultimately transformed to a flatter slope banda et al 1994 commonly labeled as bench terrace this means that in the areas in between the csb swc techniques the slope and thus the surface runoff velocity and soil loss tend to decrease mekonnen et al 2015 depending on upslope erosion and sediment transport bench terraces can form in a limited number of years e g for fanya juu they may form in 7 years herweg and ludi 1999 this results in sedimentation of several tens of cm of topsoil in the narrow space upslope of the barrier kagabo et al 2013 this also involves the accumulation of nutrients studies indicate synergy of two or more csb swc techniques at the farm level in the blue nile basin of ethiopia where fanya juu was coupled with conservation tillage the efficiency of trapping sediment and surface runoff increased temesgen et al 2012 also strengthening of soil bunds with grasses reduced soil loss and made the land occupied by the barrier productive amare et al 2014 the minimum tillage practiced on cropland in between successive vegetative barriers also reduced soil loss in kenya guto et al 2012 it is also noted that integration of grass and woody plant in vegetative barriers increased the efficiency of erosion control kinama et al 2007 5 effect of csb swc on retention of nutrients and soil organic carbon in general csb swc techniques reduce sediment transport including soil organic matter which also contains nutrients like nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k from cultivated lands zougmoré et al 2009 adimassu et al 2014 the csb swc induced retention of nutrients and soil organic carbon soc is largest just upslope from the barrier and smallest in the downslope dercon et al 2003 siriri et al 2005 amare et al 2013 kagabo et al 2013 however also uniform soil properties in the area between csb swc techniques have been reported damene 2012 which might be attributed to aged and nearly level benches in general csb swc techniques result in locally enhanced contents of soc nutrients and cation exchange capacity cec for instance the bench terraces in nyamasheke district of rwanda a 30 year old fanya juu in kenya tugizimana 2011 and a 5 year old fanya juu in goromti watershed of ethiopia hailu et al 2012 stored more soc than adjacent reference plots in addition to soc increased soil n and p were found in croplands treated with soil bunds in wollo area of ethiopia asnake 2016 stone lines in northern burkina faso zougmore et al 2002 soil and stone bunds in gondor area of ethiopia getnet 2014 and soil bunds in mirab abaya district of ethiopia bezabih 2015 higher cec was also reported for croplands treated with csb swc techniques than for reference plots in anjenie mengistu et al 2016 and ambachia hailu 2017 ethiopia vegetative barriers may improve soil quality through organic matter input and n fixation depending on species composition but appropriate management is required to minimize competition with adjacent crops guto et al 2012 enhanced soc soil n p and k were observed in grass strips in tanzania mwango et al 2015b in kenya more k was observed in hedgerows and grass strips mutegi et al 2008 because of reduced erosion and mineralization of freshly added litterfall to the surface soil banda et al 1994 the importance of csb swc for increased soc and soil nutrients is not seen everywhere and several cases showing insignificant changes for instance after 5 years of stone lines no significant change in k was observed in burkina faso zougmore et al 2002 fanya juu management for nearly three decades showed no significant differences in soc soil n and p in anjenie watershed of ethiopia mengistu et al 2016 and in n in kenya saiz et al 2016 when compared to reference plots also a 5 10 years old fanya juu in goromti watershed of ethiopia hailu et al 2012 and soil and stone bunds managed for 4 9 years in bokole watershed of southern ethiopia wolka et al 2011 did not result in significant changes in cec k and p insignificant change was also reported for soc associated with grass strips for about two years in kenya mutegi et al 2008 and stone bunds and tied ridges in burkina faso hulugalle et al 1990 6 effect of csb swc on crop yield and biomass about 80 of the reviewed studies revealed that csb swc techniques have a positive effect on crop yield and biomass production the extents of increase in crop yield vary according to type of the csb swc and characteristics of the areas table 3 fig 4 a study of the effect of fanya juu in eastern ethiopia revealed that it could have a promising effect on maize yield with 7 5 to 87 increase araso et al 2016 also other studies showed a positive but highly variable effect of fanya juu on crop yields these include 80 increase of maize yield in zimbabwe motsi et al 2004 less than 5 to nearly 168 increase of maize and bean yields in tanzania tenge et al 2011 at some experimental sites treated with graded fanya juu e g in ethiopia the relative change in crop yield was small 14 increase and sometimes even negative 50 decrease herweg and ludi 1999 the decrease in crop yields due to fanya juu was found for croplands in ethiopia adimassu et al 2017 decreases occurred in areas with high rainfall and steep slopes table 4 in ethiopia after 25 years of fanya juu upslope from the ditch showed higher yield of wheat and maize than downslope areas amare et al 2013 a study on 5 sloping land of west hararghe ethiopia indicated that the soil bunds fanya chini increased maize yield by 1 02 t ha 1 or 20 1 in the first year and 1 3 t ha 1 or 45 in the second year compared to untreated land araso et al 2016 in tanzania the soil bunds increased rice production by 0 32 t ha 1 or 35 to 0 67 t ha 1 or 108 compared to the reference plot in rain fed cultivation raes et al 2007 in rwanda contour bunds increased bean yield by 0 06 t ha 1 20 5 more than reference tugizimana 2011 some studies reported a decline in crop yield for instance 7 decline in barley yield in croplands treated with graded soil bunds was observed in central ethiopia adimassu et al 2014 long term experiments on graded soil bunds in ethiopia indicated 5 increase to 39 decline in crop yield herweg and ludi 1999 with regard to stone bunds 81 of the reviewed analyses n 32 reported positive effects whereas in some dry areas more than 200 increase in crop yield was recorded studies indicated positive effects of stone bunds on maize yield in kenya wakindiki and ben hur 2002 and tanzania rwehumbiza et al 1999 and on sorghum yield in ethiopia alemayehu et al 2006 and burkina faso hulugalle et al 1990 it was reported that stone bunds resulted in a relatively higher crop yield in areas with low rainfall than in areas with high rainfall kassie et al 2008 thus its effect on yield was negatively correlated with rainfall table 4 in ethiopia stone bunds resulted in higher yield of sorghum at upslope than downslope of the bund alemayehu et al 2006 non uniformity in crop yield being higher at the upslope side and lower at downslope side was also reported by other studies vagen et al 1999 vancampenhout et al 2006 trash lines bench terraces grass strips and hedgerows predominantly showed a positive effect on crop yield table 3 trash lines increased maize yield in kenya kiome and stocking 1995 wakindiki and ben hur 2002 bench terraces increased maize and bean yield in tanzania and rwanda tenge et al 2011 tugizimana 2011 grass strips and hedgerows are cheap to establish but may suppress grain yield so that higher yield can be observed at the center in between the strips guto et al 2012 even though a high number of studies using grass strips observed positive effects on crop yield table 3 babalola et al 2007 mwango et al 2015b a significant number of studies reported adverse herweg and ludi 1999 zougmoré et al 2004 kinama et al 2007 mutegi et al 2008 and null effects rwehumbiza et al 1999 hedgerows showed positive effects on maize yield in kenya mutegi et al 2008 and malawi banda et al 1994 by contrast decreases in maize and cowpea yields were found in kenya kinama et al 2007 tied ridges are the most frequently tested csb swc technique for conserving moisture and improving crop yield in low rainfall areas 1000 mm year 1 about 83 of the reviewed trials n 159 showed a positive effect of tied ridges on crop yields table 3 this confirms an earlier review on tillage research for eastern africa specifically ethiopia kenya tanzania and malawi where tied ridging also was found to have positive effects on grain yield biamah et al 1993 for instance sorghum in burkina faso hulugalle et al 1990 ethiopia mesfin et al 2009 and sudan kara et al 2008 showed positive results also maize in kenya kiome and stocking 1995 and ethiopia belay et al 1998 biazin and stroosnijder 2012 responded positively the tied ridges aim at retaining the rain falling on ridge and furrow in soils with low infiltration rate or poor drainage especially in areas with intensive rainfall waterlogging may occur causing a negative effect on yield jensen et al 2003 thus the response of maize crop to different forms of ridging and planting may vary with soil types for example tied ridges on entisol did not improve maize yield whereas those on vertisol increased yield belay et al 1998 planting on ridges or in furrows also affects the access to moisture and the exposure to waterlogging in kenya the cowpea yield grown by intercropping declined by 0 08 mg ha 1 in one season and increased by 211 in another when tied ridging was compared with ox plow with no csb swc techniques miriti et al 2012 the role of tied ridges on yield depends on soil characteristics rainfall crop type and relative planting positions on ridge in furrow for instance implementing tied ridges on less sloping land and in low intense rainfall areas mchugh et al 2007 araya and stroosnijder 2010 planting crops like sorghum in furrows brhane et al 2006 and growing plants such as pulses on ridges brhane and wortmann 2008 resulted in increasing crop yield this effect was more beneficial in areas with moisture stress or low rainfall wiyo and feyen 1999 annual rainfall of 500 700 mm jensen et al 2003 coarse textured soil and rainfall with poor distribution intense for some time followed by little rain gebrekidan 2003 by contrast a study in malawi showed that tied ridges have limited benefit in coarse textured soil in which a higher proportion of the water is immediately lost through drainage wiyo et al 2000 planting on ridges especially in dry areas has depressed crop yield because ridges are relatively elevated and have lower moisture during dry spells vogel 1993 it has been argued that practicing tied ridges has no benefit at above average rainfall araya and stroosnijder 2010 and in high rainfall conditions 700 900 mm per year stephens and hess 1999 wiyo et al 2000 jensen et al 2003 this is because in high rainfall areas moisture stress may not challenge crop performance and thus crop yield our correlation analysis for tied ridge systems table 4 including studies with mean annual rainfall of 400 mm 1300 mm showed no relationship between yield and rainfall combining the csb swc techniques with other management activities may further enhance crop yields in nigeria crop yield was improved when grass strips were combined with mulching of cropland babalola et al 2007 furthermore integrating tied ridges with mulching in semi arid areas improved crop yield biomass and soil moisture in swaziland ndlangamandla et al 2016 and crop yield in ethiopia belay et al 1998 it was also noted that integration of grass and woody plant in vegetative barriers improved crop yield in kenya mutegi et al 2008 integrating csb swc techniques can increase fertilizer and water use efficiency of crops the effect of residual n and p fertilizer on crop became superior when combined with tied ridges belay et al 1998 the application of farmyard manure in croplands treated with tied ridges increased grain yield in ethiopia when compared without tied ridges biazin and stroosnijder 2012 in burkina faso soil water storage and water use efficiency of crop increased when compost and manure was applied in croplands with barriers of stone rows and grass strips compared with no barrier and mineral treatments especially in years with reliable rainfall distribution zougmoré et al 2004 csb swc techniques like stone bunds increased crop biomass in ethiopia alemayehu et al 2006 kenya wakindiki and ben hur 2002 and tanzania rwehumbiza et al 1999 grass strips also improved crop biomass except in some cases herweg and ludi 1999 zougmoré et al 2004 about 73 of the analyses n 96 on tied ridges reported higher biomass of crop compared with reference plots table 3 crop biomass when retained on croplands after harvest essentially builds soil organic matter lal 2006 which in turn increases resistance of the soil to erosion due to improved aggregate stability reduced crusting problem and high water retention capacity bossio et al 2010 in ssa increased crop biomass production is also relevant as it contributes to livestock forage fuel wood and construction material all uses which compete with its role as soil quality enhancer 7 economic feasibility of csb swc among smallholder farmers crop yield and biomass are major benefits which are principally valued in economic feasibility estimates by farmers several economic feasibility studies of csb swc techniques across ssa have been published kiome and stocking 1995 tenge et al 2005 teshome et al 2013 matere et al 2016 tesfaye et al 2016 in west usambara highlands of tanzania bench terraces fanya juu and grass strips were found to be economically attractive with the maximum net present value 3 3 the difference in current cash inflow and outflow of 608 usd per ha 1 at 8 discount of future return mainly at low labor opportunity cost tenge et al 2005 tenge et al 2005 also showed that the net present value decreases for steeper slope and unstable soil a study in kenya indicated that terraces tied ridges and trash lines were profitable mainly at null labor opportunity cost and if integrated with soil fertility enhancement options kiome and stocking 1995 for semi arid areas of kenya fanya juu showed positive economic benefits matere et al 2016 in gedeb watershed ethiopia a study covering 750 households at the altitudinal range of 1500 to 3500 m above sea level the benefit cost ratio was estimated as 1 24 0 9 and 1 03 for soil bunds stone bunds and fanya juu respectively tesfaye et al 2016 in debre mewi and anjeni watersheds of ethiopia soil bunds fanya juu and stone bunds were profitable despite fluctuations due to different assumptions e g with and without grass yield changes dimensions of the structures as expected profitability was influenced highly by assumed changes in crop yield teshome et al 2013 in anjeni ethiopia terraces developed from fanya juu and grass strips improved crop yield and hence the return showing a higher net benefit 185 usd ha 1 year 1 for barley than for maize 34 5 usd ha 1 year 1 and teff 20 9 usd ha 1 year 1 this resulted in estimated net present value of 1542 usd in 50 years adgo et al 2013 in eastern ethiopia soil bunds and stone bunds were shown to increase crop yields which resulted in a positive net return for smallholder farmers thus these interventions are considered important technologies to avert dry condition and climate change bekele 2005 some studies reported that csb swc techniques requiring high labor cost for construction and periodic repairing or techniques that fail to produce increased crop yield did not secure net profits hengsdijk et al 2005 kassie et al 2011 bizoza and de graaff 2012 a study of stone bunds in tigray northern ethiopia showed a decrease or insignificant increase in crop yield resulting in insufficient return especially for crops sown on optimal sowing dates hengsdijk et al 2005 in contrast to the reports reviewed in preceding paragraph fanya juu in anjeni watershed of ethiopia annual rainfall 1690 mm elevation 2100 2500 m resulted in estimated crop income decline of 9 16 usd ha 1 kassie et al 2011 which is a rare case in rwanda bench terraces were not profitable unless special considerations were made for labor lower opportunity cost and manure cost bizoza and de graaff 2012 8 socio economic and institutional aspects of csb swc in ssa in the1970 s and 1980 s government led csb swc techniques were widely implemented in ssa through incentives including food for work and paid labor that was mainly supported by donors wocat 2011 the smallholder farmers adoption was low despite wide technical and political promotion and the observed positive effects of the techniques on reducing soil erosion improving crop yields and increasing net economic returns various socio economic and institutional factors limited adoption for instance contour ridges and bunds were massively promoted and implemented during colonial periods in ssa but following independence the interventions were demolished or abandoned since they were regarded as coercion tasks young 1990 the total landholding can affect implementation and wider adoptions of the csb swc techniques several studies reported that owning smaller farm area discourages farmers to practice csb swc in uganda mugonola et al 2013 burkina faso sidibé 2005 ethiopia amsalu and de graaff 2007 anley et al 2007 kassie et al 2011 tesfaye et al 2014 and tanzania mbaga semgalawe and henk 2000 because csb swc techniques may occupy up to 20 of the cultivable area depending on slope soil stability and type of the technique stroosnijder 2009 in west usambara highlands of tanzania bench terraces fanya juu and grass strips occupied cultivable area of 5 42 8 40 and 1 15 respectively tenge et al 2005 in ethiopia fanya juu soil bunds and stone bunds were estimated to occupy 6 9 6 7 and 5 5 5 of the area respectively teshome et al 2013 it has been also estimated that contour ridges in zimbabwe consumed 15 of the cultivable land area nyamadzawo et al 2013 however some studies suggested that farmers owning a relatively large area of land tended to neglect the adoption of the csb swc measures teshome et al 2016 the contradicting effects of landholding size on adoption of csb swc techniques might indicate that the interplay of landholding with other factors might be more important than the factor itself also labor availability may affect adoption of most csb swc techniques land to productive labor ratio age and sex of the household heads indicators of the availability of labor affected adoption of csb swc techniques a high land to labor ratio caused a negative effect on the adoption of soil bunds and fanya juu terraces in dedo area of ethiopia anley et al 2007 households led by the male were more inclined to adopt grass strips in uganda and dead contour bunds in gwanda district of zimbabwe munamati and nyagumbo 2010 in rwanda female headed households showed a poor adoption rate of bench terraces bizoza 2014 in tanzania the participation in labor sharing groups had a positive effect on adoption of fanya juu terraces bench terraces ditches grass strips and trash lines mbaga semgalawe and henk 2000 tied ridges construction required about 33 additional labor than conventional cultivation nyamadzawo et al 2013 and it was argued that the return in grain yield cannot compensate for the labor demand even in under climate uncertainty this inhibited its dissemination in southern africa wiyo and feyen 1999 and in kenya mutuku 2016 in ethiopia households with higher labor capacity were willing to practice soil bunds fanya juu and stone bunds bewket 2007 tesfaye et al 2014 teshome et al 2016 livestock number educational level and perceived severity of soil erosion and the benefits of csb swc to mitigate soil erosion affected adoption increased numbers of owned livestock discouraged farmers to practice csb swc techniques as they do not economically depend on crop production alone mugonola et al 2013 also the educational level of household heads showed a positive role on the construction and adoption of stone bunds in northern burkina faso sidibé 2005 bench terrace in rwanda bizoza 2014 soil bunds and fanya juu in dedo area of ethiopia anley et al 2007 and some csb swc techniques in nigeria junge et al 2009 however people with a higher education level tended to engage preferably in off farm activities rather than in labor intensive work on csb swc techniques as was reported for machakos area of kenya mutuku 2016 studies in different parts of ssa indicated that the recognized severity of soil erosion problems motivated smallholder farmers to implement csb swc techniques baidu forson 1999 tadesse and belay 2004 wildemeersch et al 2013 especially on sloping lands bekele and drake 2003 damtew et al 2015 this was to acquire perceived profitability due to improved crop yield in the short term baidu forson 1999 tenge et al 2004 amsalu and de graaff 2007 for the rural poor who primarily rely on agricultural production the low immediate benefit of some csb swc techniques discouraged their implementation shiferaw et al 2009 institutional factors such as access to extension services information and land tenure can influence adoption of csb swc measures in ssa access to training experts advice peer discussions and media e g television radio are helpful to facilitate the construction and adoption of csb swc measures training opportunity and access to extension services were shown to enhance implementation in niger baidu forson 1999 tanzania tenge et al 2004 kenya mutuku 2016 mali bodnár et al 2006 and ethiopia anley et al 2007 damtew et al 2015 teshome et al 2016 membership in farmers organization played a positive role in stone bunds construction in northern burkina faso sidibé 2005 as it helps in obtaining information and sharing experience risk attitude and land tenure arrangements also influence implementation of csb swc for instance efforts in reducing risks arising from climate or technology failure on crop yield affected csb swc acceptability shiferaw et al 2009 and had a negative effect on adoption baidu forson 1999 the risk aversion preferences of farmers like the tendency to prioritize the current low production without csb swc techniques affected their adoption lee 2005 therefore it was recommended to consider these factors by increasing tenure security awareness through formal education extension and off farm income options teklewold and kohlin 2011 the tenure issue influenced farmers acceptance of the csb swc techniques in ethiopia bewket 2007 and tanzania tenge et al 2004 in malawi the land tenure insecurity reduced adoption of csb swc by 9 lovo 2016 9 discussion the effect of csb swc techniques on improving crop yield was dependent on rainfall characteristics types of crop slope and soil the observed yield improvement was mainly due to retained soil moisture nutrients and soc hedgerows in addition can access nutrients from deeper parts of the soil may fix nitrogen depending on species and can enrich surface soils through litterfall most csb swc techniques support crop production more in areas where rainfall is not high but sufficient and temporal distribution is scattered reddy 2016 with dry spells of 2 4 weeks rockström 2004 this is partly because moisture may not be a limiting factor for crop production in high rainfall areas thus the effect of csb swc on crop yield was negatively correlated with rainfall for the majority of the techniques including level fanya juu graded soil bunds stone bunds and trash lines also graded fanya juu and graded soil bunds which were built in high rainfall areas 935 1690 mm year 1 showed small effects on crop yields furthermore after intense rainfall the backwater in non permeable constructions such as fanya juu and tied ridges created waterlogging in slow draining soils thus adversely affecting the performance of intolerant crops herweg and ludi 1999 however there are water scarce conditions where slow draining soil increases moisture availability and enhances crop yield in tied ridges belay et al 1998 the selection of crop types e g tolerant to waterlogging and identification of planting position on the ridge or in furrow can assist in coping with rainfall effects hedgerows and grass strips grow better in areas with sufficient rainfall and contribute to protection against moisture and nutrient loss thus their effect on crop yield was positively correlated with rainfall embankment of fanya juu and soil bunds are less stable and occupy the more cultivable area in steep slope and thus slope showed negative correlation on the effect of these techniques on crop yield stone bunds trash lines grass strip and hedgerows are stable on relatively steeper slopes csb swc techniques retaining moisture and nutrients in upslope areas produced greater yield upslope than downslope by contrast downslope of the constructions the soil gradually loses its surface layer due to erosion thus becoming less fertile vancampenhout et al 2006 accordingly accessibility of retained nutrients by crops growing in areas in between csb swc techniques cannot be equated with the quantity lost from untreated plots due to the non uniformity farmers destroy some barriers in 10 years interval at most which is after about 2 3 years of forming a bench terrace siriri et al 2005 similarly in south africa farmers destroyed earth contour bunds spread trapped sediment and rebuild every 2 3 years philliphs howard and oche 1996 such experiences were reported also for stone bunds in bokole watershed ethiopia wolka et al 2013 in addition to the non uniformity in sediment deposition there are situations in which grass strips and hedgerows compete for sunlight moisture and nutrient and influence crop production the majority of csb swc techniques reduce the volume of surface runoff due to their ability to retain water and enhance infiltration their effectiveness in reducing the volume of surface runoff also varies with the types of the techniques slope and rainfall studies showed that tied ridges fanya juu and graded soil bunds were less effective on steeper slopes due to less stability of the soil embankment with regard to rainfall the graded soil bunds fit in high rainfall conditions due to their ability to discharge excess surface runoff the grass strips also function in high rainfall areas as rain favors their growth and stiffness however torrential rainfall events in the tropics create concentrated surface runoff that can break through this barrier resulting in increased surface flow poor management of the techniques for instance failure to repair periodically can cause concentrated water breaking through the top of embankment which is highly erosive causing breaking them before the formation of bench terrace can also reinstate the runoff most studies show that csb swc techniques reduce soil loss due to decreased volume and velocity of the surface runoff moreover roots of grass strips and hedgerows anchor soil particles and reduce soil loss stone bunds and grass strips are stable and thus can reduce soil loss even on steep slopes on average the soil loss reduced by level fanya juu is high especially in low rainfall areas since both its ditch and embankment serve as a barrier the mean soil loss reduced by tied ridges was relatively small due to its shallow ditches for water and sediment retention the average soil loss reduced by the csb swc techniques appeared sometimes not adequate when compared with average soil formation rate per year for instance it was reported that terraces in ethiopia lose more than 30 t ha 1 year 1 even after three decades of development subhatu et al 2017 tamene et al 2017 soil loss may to some extent be compensated by soil formation however the topsoil lost by erosion is richer in organic matter and essential nutrients e g n p and k than the newly formed soils from the parent material since soil formation is much slower in dry areas where conserving water and soil fertility is crucial for crop production the csb swc techniques need to be judged by the change of soc nutrients and moisture reduced soil loss implies increased availability of nutrients and soil organic carbon in most of the croplands treated with csb swc techniques when compared with reference plots studies showed the insignificant change in nutrients and soc due to some csb swc techniques this is partly related to the limited nutrient inputs for some techniques such as soil bunds stone bunds and fanya juu also these techniques retain trapped nutrients in the ditch and upslope from the structures causing limited soil fertility elsewhere in the area between the structures the majority of the reviewed studies show that csb swc techniques are economically feasible at the farm level due to improved yield and biomass since the rural poor have limited job options labor opportunity cost is often low which positively contributes to estimates of economic benefits insignificant economic benefits of csb swc techniques as reported in some studies were due to minor improvements in crop yield per unit area due to waterlogging and insignificant improvement in retained nutrient and moisture also the cultivable area occupied by the csb swc techniques e g fanya juu and soil bunds in ethiopia adimassu et al 2017 may limit crop yield effects and reduce the economic feasibility economic feasibility may be limited due to high construction labor demand of some the techniques if the roles of csb swc techniques on flood control recharging groundwater reducing off site effects of transported sediment and nutrients were accounted for at the watershed scale the economic feasibility would be greater effects on watershed hydrological processes can influence crop yield for instance by affecting cropland siltation and availability of irrigation water implementation of csb swc techniques involves some trade offs that affect their adoption it has been highlighted that major trade offs were related to high construction labor demand and the land area occupied by the techniques stone bunds bench terraces fanya juu and soil bunds demand high labor about 150 500 person ha 1 day 1 wolka 2014 and the shortage of labor highly affect their adoption this indicates that nutrient depletion and land degradation are also associated with poverty unep 2015 given a small area of cultivated land owned per household the areas occupied by csb swc techniques are usually not amenable to farmers 10 conclusion in ssa soil degradation and soil water deficits are major threats to crop production and food security in the past five decades various cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques have been introduced and adopted in different parts of sub saharan africa the roles of these techniques on surface runoff soil loss soil properties crop yield and biomass production varied based on the type of techniques the biophysical condition of the landscape soil properties rainfall and crop as well as their interactions this review shows that majority of the studies found positive effect of csb swc techniques on reducing soil loss and surface runoff retained nutrients and moisture enhanced crop production in general moisture and nutrients were concentrated near csb swc structures especially at the upslope sides and induced spatial variability in soil fertility and crop yield integrating these csb swc techniques with other land management activities such as soil fertility management conservation tillage and mulching could further improve productivity and efficiency the effects of csb swc techniques on crop yield become more prominent in low rainfall conditions in high rainfall areas the level fanya juu stone bunds and trash lines may have adverse effects on crop yield and hence other csb swc alternatives may be preferred soil bunds fanya juu and tied ridges perform better in reducing soil loss and surface runoff and enhancing crop yield in cultivated land on small slopes despite the common assumptions that csb swc measures may not be cost effective and profitable the review of several studies in ssa shows that the csb swcs were profitable in many circumstances the benefit cost analysis principally valued the grain yield and aboveground biomass which are fundamental and of ultimate interest of the smallholder farmers the indirect benefits of the csb swc techniques such as groundwater recharging and controlling flood and sedimentation risks are important for society at large but commonly ignored despite recognized benefits and profits the implementation of csb swc techniques is hindered in several areas mainly due to high labor demand and small landholdings effects of csb swc techniques are dominantly found to be site specific thus choice and management of appropriate techniques require detailed understanding of all relevant climatic soil quality and socio economic factors studies accounting for their benefit at a watershed scale are important to help to assess their importance for the society at large acknowledgement the
