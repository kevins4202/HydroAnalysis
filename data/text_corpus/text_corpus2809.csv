14045,ozone is a strong oxidant and have been effectively used for the degradation and mineralization of organic pollutants however the increase in the toxicity and disposal of the recalcitrant organics standalone ozonation process is not effective and sustainable solution for the treatment of industrial wastewater containing recalcitrant it is therefore necessary to provide a summary of success of hybrid ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment along with the reaction mechanism for enhancing the molecular ozone reactivity the paper presents a detailed review of hybrid ozonation process as a combination of two different techniques to enhance the hydroxyl radical formation thereby increasing the process efficiency an extensive review on the mechanism and application of these hybrid ozonation processes for degradation mineralization detoxification of different organic pollutants present in the industrial wastewater is reported keywords ozonation advanced oxidation process hybrid ozonation process industrial wastewater hydroxyl radical degradation 1 introduction water is the most basic requirement of life on earth and utilized to carry out the different household and industrial activities in recent years the whole world is facing water crises due to the rapid development of polluting industries such as pharmaceuticals distilleries textile fertilizers tanneries and mining industries increasing living standards human population and urbanization there by leading to the production of toxic and recalcitrant wastewater containing hazardous pollutants 1 2 161 3 these recalcitrant compounds are resistant to biological treatment due to the low biodegradability index and characterized by high chemical oxygen demand and low biological oxygen demand values 160 4 5 the presence of these non biodegradable organic compounds in wastewater even in little extent causes serious problems to public health since they are potential carcinogens endocrine disrupting and toxic to living organisms these non biodegradable and hazardous pollutants enter the environment primarily through industries it is therefore essential to treat industrial wastewater on priority basis the biological treatment of most industrial wastewater is found to be ineffective due to the presence of recalcitrant contaminants bod5 cod 0 2 in the wastewater as the biological methods are generally employed for the wastewater treatment at bod5 cod ratio of greater than 0 4 6 generally advanced oxidation methods are used to degrade the industrial wastewater containing biorefractory pollutants however despite of high degradation efficiency of advanced oxidation methods it necessitates controlled operating conditions high energy input which increases the process cost and it sometimes only transforms the recalcitrant contaminants from liquid phase to solid phase 7 the efficient treatment system for the wastewater treatment is the basic need of the present society in order to treat industrial wastewater effectively the research scope should include the biodegradability enhancement along with degradation as well as the mineralization of recalcitrant organic compounds that is the conversion of the complex aromatic compounds to simple aliphatic compounds to the highest stable state of water and carbon dioxide or to more easily degradable compounds that can be treated further biologically advanced oxidation processes aops can be a promising option to treat industrial wastewater as it a most powerful method for the removal of any kind of organic contaminants the principle of the advanced oxidation processis the generation of highly oxidizing radicals specially the hydroxyl radical oh e 2 8 v versus nhe capable of oxidizing high recalcitrant contaminants to co2and h2o hydroxyl radicals produced in aops attack the organic molecules by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the molecule through a common pathway as reported by sameena et al 6 the process can be described as follows 1 o h r h h 2 o r 2 r h 2 o 2 r o h o h 3 r o 2 r o o 4 r o o r h r o o h r aops generally comprises of a many individual processes that include ozone o3 fenton hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv wet air oxidation wao sonication and several coupled processes like peroxone o3 h2o2 ultra violet light with peroxide uv h2o2 peroxone and ultraviolet light o3 h2o2 uv o3 tio2 electron beam irradiation o3 tio2 h2o2 systems 8 13 among the different existing aops the ozonation process emerging as very promising and alternative wastewater technique which generates no sludge and residual ozone also decomposes into water and oxygen 14 ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent with high oxidation potential of 2 07 v and reacts with the organic compounds either directly as a molecular ozone or indirectly through hydroxyl free radical generation in a chain reaction mechanism generally the effective biological oxidation of organic macromolecules is difficult because of their too large size which prohibits the microbial cell wall infusion in general organic macromolecules may simply be too large to infuse cell walls which prohibits their effective biological oxidation ozone breakdown these large molecules into short chain intermediate products that can enter cells and becomes readily biodegradable as the decreased molecular size enhances the biological oxidation rate also the reaction between ozone and organic molecules outcomes in hydroxyl free radical which is a highly reactive and unstable compound that have a higher oxidation potential than ozone due to the unstable nature of hydroxyl free radical it immediately undergoes a chemical reaction to become stable by gaining the missing electron 15 ozonation can be carried out at room temperature and pressure it is a cleaner process for wastewater treatment with no sludge generation however this method has two main drawbacks the first is low oxidation efficiency due to the selective nature of ozone limited mass transfer and slow rate of reaction the second is related to the high energy consumption for ozone generation that makes it costly hence the technologies are required to increase the efficiency of the ozonation process at low cost with high efficiency catalytic hybrid ozonation is a promising technology for the wastewater treatment as it can reduce operating cost reaction time to achieve the same degradation efficiency with increased rate of degradation and mineralization of recalcitrant organic compounds present in the wastewater many researches were escorted to further improve the efficiency of ozonation process in combination with alkaline solution o3 oh uv o3 uv peroxone o3 h2o2 catalytic ozonation for the degradation and mineralization of refractory organics present in the industrial wastewater thus the present paper reviewed the detailed reaction mechanism of hybrid ozonation process fig 1 to form the more reactive hydroxyl radical for effective degradation of organic pollutants along with the short summary of the experimental results of the hybrid ozonation processes reported so far 2 ozone ozone is a very powerful oxidizing agent comprised of one week single bond and one strong double bond the inter convertible two resonance structure of ozone exist due to which molecular ozone can react as a dipole agent either electrophile or nucleophile fig 2 ozone is an unstable gas and reacts with the substances in wastewater in two different ways either directly as molecular ozone or indirectly through the formation of secondary oxidants i e hydroxyl radicals these two different reaction pathways lead to the formation of different oxidation products and are controlled by different types of kinetics therefore the decomposition kinetics of ozone must be known to predict the oxidation effects of ozone and ozone consumption rate 2 1 indirect reaction mechanism indirect reaction mechanism involves hydroxyl radical which has an unpaired electron hydroxyl radicals are highly unstable and immediately reacts with the other molecules to gain missing electron the ozone radical mechanism involves three different steps initiation propagation and termination fig 3 2 1 1 initiation step the first step is the decay of ozone where the reaction between ozone and hydroxide ions leads to the formation of one superoxide anion o2 and one hydroperoxyl radical ho2 which are in acid base equilibrium pka 4 8 with a rate constant value of 70 m 1s 1 k1 5 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 6 h o 2 o 2 h 2 1 2 propagation step the superoxide anion o2 then reacts with ozone to form an ozonide anion o3 with rate constant of 1 6 109 m 1s 1 k2 which immediately decomposes to oh radical via hydrogen trioxide ho3 formation k3 1 1 105 m 1s 1 the ozonide anion and hydrogen trioxide are in acid base equilibrium pka 6 2 7 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 8 h o 3 o 3 h 9 h o 3 o h o 2 the hydroxyl radical further reacts with ozone to form ho4 k4 2x 109 m 1s 1 that decomposes to hydroperoxyl radical on reaction with oxygen k5 2 8 104 m 1s 1 and here the chain reaction starts 10 o h o 3 h o 4 11 h o 4 o 2 h o 2 hydroxyl radical also react with organic molecule r which can act as the promotors and form organic radical r 12 h 2 r o h h r h 2 o organic peroxy radicals roo can also be formed if the oxygen is present that can again start the chain reaction 13 h r o 2 h r o 2 14 h r o 2 r h o 2 15 h r o 2 r o o h 2 1 3 termination step some organic and inorganic molecules react with oh to form secondary radicals that do not produce superoxide radicals ho2 o2 these scavengers generally terminate the chain reaction and inhibit ozone decay the carbonate can act as the scavenger with the rate constant value 4 2 108 m 1s 1 k6 whereas the bicarbonate can act as the hydroxyl radical scavenger with the rate constant of k7 1 5 107 m 1s 1 16 o h c o 3 2 c o 3 o h 17 o h h c o 3 h c o 3 o h the two radicals may also react to terminate the chain reaction as follows k8 3 7 1010 m 1s 1 18 o h o h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 direct reaction the direct reaction of molecular ozone with organic compounds is a selective reaction with slow reaction rate constants in the range of 1 0 106 m 1s 1 the molecular ozone reacts with the unsaturated bond due to its dipolar structure and leads to splitting of the bond ozone reacts faster the with organic water contaminants depending upon their degree of nucleophilicity or electron density the overall reaction of ozone indicates that three ozone molecules are required to produce two hydroxyl radicals as show below 19 3 o 3 o h h 2 o h 4 o 2 the ozonation process has been successfully adopted in the last few decades for the treatment of industrial wastewater containing toxic and recalcitrant organic contaminants table 1 the use of ozone is dependent on the target of the ozonation processes in each type of wastewater at preliminary stages ozone is used for detoxification disinfection and sludge reduction whereas the most common application of ozone is for micro pollutant removal cod reduction and decolorization indeed a number of studies have been validated the efficiency of the ozone process as a pretreatment option for wastewater treatment 11 12 16 for example the ozone process has been used to decolorize the digital textile printing wastewater where after ozone dose of 17 7 g s l only 12 of cod was removed whereas 66 of color was removed this is because the chromophores present in the dyes are easily cleaved by ozone but entire oxidation of dyes for cod removal required more ozone dose of 255 g s l where 63 of cod and 81 of colour were removed 17 the design and doses of ozonation system mainly depends on the color causing compounds and on the cod load of the wastewater in a study the wastewater containing direct dye sirius blue sbrr with initial dye concentration of 400 mg l has shown 90 58 color removal at ozone dose of 24 03 g m3 whereas the anthraquinone dye wastewater c i reactive blue 19 has shown 100 color removal with the initial dye concentration of 200 mg l at ozone dose of 25 g m3 18 19 because ozonation reaction for color removal takes few minutes due to the chemical structure of the color causing compounds whereas for cod reduction it takes several hours 20 21 the efficiency of ozone is also ph dependent as at acidic ph molecular ozone expected to attack and degrade the organic compounds while at alkaline ph ozonation process follows several oxidation mechanisms through hydroxyl radical formation jose et al carried out the experiments to determine the effect of ph during ozonation process for the treatment of synthetic samples of citrus wastewater where the efficiencies after 60 min of reaction time required for total real color removal reached values of around 40 and rose up to 46 when the ph was increased up to 10 22 ozone reactivity is also dependent on the chemical structure redox properties of reactants and ozone doses adams et al 1997 turhan and uzman showed phenol removal from the aqueous solution of phenol containing four different initial concentrations 25 50 75 and 100 mg l at three different ozone doses of 2 4 and 6 g lh where they have found phenol degradation increased with the increasing o3concentration especially for two phenol concentrations 50 mg land 75 mg l turhan uzman 2008 ozonation process has also been applied as a pretreatment option for the biodegradability enhancement of recalcitrant wastewater with low biodegradability index bi 0 2 it has been presented that ozonation pretreatment with 4 6 g hr of ozone dose has led biodegradability enhancement of complex biomethanated distillery wastewater from an initial bi of 0 16 to 0 71 at the end of 10 h of ozonation period sameena et al 2019 also in similar studies ozone pretreatment has shown biodegradability enhancement of complex recalcitrant wastewater as theozonation of wastewater transforms or converts the recalcitrant present in the wastewater to the low molecular weight biodegradable organic compounds contributing to the biodegradability enhancement of the wastewater 16 though it is essential to monitor the oxidative by products during ozonation process as the ozonation pretreatment sometimes results in the production of more toxic and stable intermediates and end products in a relative study for refinery effluent the oxygenated volatile organic compounds o voc were analyzed before and after oxidative treatment using ozone where they have found that the reduction depends on the strength of the oxidizing agent and the dose used during treatment however the investigations described reveal that excessively strong oxidation results in an increase in o voc content 23 some authors have reported toxicity removal of wastewater after ozonation pretreatment due to the conversion of recalcitrant organic compounds to low molecular weight organic compounds that are more biodegradable to further treat using biological methods 16 sameena et al 2019 suvidha et al 2015 2 3 ozone nano bubbles the efficiency of ozone for the treatment of organics contaminated wastewater is limited by its slow dissolution rate and rapid decomposition in the aqueous phase micro nano bubbles mnbs are a novel method to prolong the reactivity of the ozone in the aqueous phase thereby accelerating the treatment of the contaminant nano ozone bubbles are nanoscopic bubbles in aqueous solutions and have longer lifespans as well as high specific areas when compared to the macro bubbles and hence can destroy pathogens efficiently thus indicating tremendous potential for wastewater treatment the diffusion of gas into water depends on several factors such as gas solubility temperature gas concentration solution pressure bubble size and internal gas pressure the ozone is a very soluble gas in the water at 25 c ozone solubility is 109 mg l the solubility of oxygen is 8 mg l ozone is 13 times more soluble than oxygen however when ozone is supplied as bubbles due to high buoyancy they rapidly leave the solution without having sufficient time for ozone to dissolve in water so when using nano bubbles due to its reduction in buoyancy it will stay in the solution comparably longer time as well as since smaller bubbles inside pressure is higher and it will increase the diffusion rates so it will allow the gas to be supersaturated in water batagoda et al 2018 moreover many authors showed that the ozone mnbs can greatly improve remediation efficiency and represent an innovative technology for in situ remediation of organics contaminated groundwater 29 rudy and jhonny 2017 jazmin and jhonny 2017 as the gas water interfacial area of bubbles and the associated mass transfer coefficient kl control the rate of gas transfer into water nbs have higher interfacial area per volume of gas and longer lifetime in water days versus seconds than micro or larger bubbles this results in higher efficiency of gas partitioning into water and presents opportunities to revolutionize water treatment processes that depend on efficient gas transfer 30 in addition to enhancing ozone gas dissolution ozone mnbs effectively generate hydroxyl radicals that are highly effective in decomposing the organic molecules in both acidic and alkaline water environment 31 33 besides mineralization of organic substances mnbs ozonation is also applied to removal of inorganic materials in water khuntia et al 33 studied the removal of ammonia which is major source of undesirable odor from aqueous solution using ozone mnbs they found that microbubble aided ozonation was a faster process and it can be applied under a wider range of ph unlike the biological degradation of ammonia khuntia et al 34 has also shown application of mnbs ozonation to the oxidation of arsenic which is one of the most toxic element found in groundwater the more toxic form as iii was as well effectively oxidized under wide range of ph in a pilot plant by using ozone microbubbles in both ammonia and arsenic oxidation the intensive generation of radicals by the ozone mnbs enabled the removal under acidic condition in a study for the wastewater treatment using ozone micro nano bubbles deessiree et al 2019 reported 90 2 and 92 5 bod and cod removal from hospital wastewater through ozone air micro nano bubbles treatment in another study the concentration of tce in groundwater showed significant reduction during the ozone micro nano bubbles treatment and an overall removal of 99 was reached after six days 35 furthermore industrial wastewater which contained high salinity concentration was chosen as the target contaminant and the treatment efficiency by ozone mnbs was studied ozone mnbs showed significant treatment effect on wastewater with high salinity with the cod decreasing 63 after the 14 h treatment the quantity and size of the mnbs affect their mass transfer efficiency larger amounts of the mnbs result in larger total surface area and increases the mass transfer flux from bubbles to solution and smaller bubble size results in higher internal pressure and larger specific area 29 benazir and jhonny 2017 observed the reductions of thermotolelant coliforms presents in marine water the initial thermotolerant coliform concentration was 1400 cfu 100 ml after applying the air ozone micro nanobubbles the coliforms concentration was reduced to 56 cfu 100 ml in another study author reported the 95 degradation of methyl orange in tenth minute in surface water treatment ozone mnbs showed great oxidation ability in water treatment and groundwater remediation 3 ozone uv radiation o3 uv the advanced oxidation process with ozone and uv radiation is initiated by the photolysis of ozone the photodecomposition of ozone leads to hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical formation at uv radiation less than 310 nm as shown by the scheme 20 o 3 h 2 o h v h 2 o 2 o 2 the further reaction of ozone with hydrogen peroxide is considered to be very slow reaction with a rate constant of 6 5 10 2 m 1s 1 21 o 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 o h o 2 in addition hydrogen peroxide on photolysis by uv radiation produces two hydroxyl radicals also the hydrogen peroxide undergoes in acid base equilibrium reaction pk 11 65 to form one h3o and peroxyl anion ho2 22 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 23 h 2 o 2 h 2 o h 3 o h o 2 in chain propagation reaction both ozone and hydrogen peroxide reacts with the hydroxyl radical to form the peroxyl ho2 and superoxide radicals o2 with rate constant of 1 1 108 m 1s 1 and 2 7 107 m 1s 1 respectively 24 o h o 3 o 2 h o 2 25 o h h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o h the superoxide radical reacts with hydroxyl radical in a propagation reaction scheme to yield hydroxyl ion oh rate constant of1 1010 m 1s 1 at ph 7 9 26 o h o 2 o h o 2 hydroxyl radical even reacts with hydroxyl ion to yield o rate constant of1 3 1010 m 1s 1 on the other side the superoxide radical again reacts with ozone to form o3 k 1 6 109 m 1s 1 which further yields hydroxyl radical and hydroxyl ion during propagation reaction at alkaline ph with rate constant value of 9 4 107 m 1s 1 27 o h o h h 2 o o 28 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 29 o 3 h 2 o o h o h o 2 in chain reaction ozone reacts with peroxyl ion and results in superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical formation k 5 5 106 m 1s 1 30 o 3 h o 2 o 2 o h o 2 in a termination step hydroxyl peroxyl and superoxide radicals on recombination form hydrogen peroxide which can be photolyzed again and under an excess concentration of hydrogen peroxide the scavenging reaction becomes predominant the rate constants of recombination steps are 8 3 105 m 1s 1 4 2 109 m 1s 1 and 9 7 107 m 1s 1 respectively 31 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 32 o h o h h 2 o 2 33 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 o 2 o h under an excess of h2o2the scavenging reaction may start as follows k 5 109 m 1s 1 34 o h h o 2 h 2 o o 2 this system contains three components to produce oh radicals or to oxidize the pollutants for subsequent reactions i e uv radiation ozone and hydrogen peroxide thus depending on the experimental conditions direct and indirect ozone reactions with the pollutant are possible also the combination of uv o3 and h2o2 can produce oh that contributes to overall results the oxidation results of methyl methacrylate mma in the aqueous solution by the o3 uv treatment after the reaction time of 30 min at o3 dose of 10 mg l uv with power of 35 96 w m2 resulted the removal of mma and cod were 96 and 22 respectively the degradation of cod could further increase to 51 in 120 min it is due to that the presence of the uv radiation would decompose the dissolved ozone concentration and accompany the generation of oh radicals simultaneously as the oh radicals have greater reactivity toward the organic compounds to enhance the mineralization 36 moreover mineralization of organic carbon present in the wastewater was also observed by other researchers 28 37 however the decolorization of azo dye took 11 min for both o3 as well as for o3 uv processes the two decolorization curves of o3and uv o3almost overlapped implying that the presence or absence of uv radiation hardly affects the decolorization rate thus it can be seen that the chemical structures of azo dyes affect the decolorization efficiency during o3 uv process 38 such a behavior was normally attributed to ph effect pillai et al 39 showed that there was a decrease of ph for the o3 uv system from initial value 8 5 6 9 at the end unlike single o3system which showed a more acidic ph of 4 5 as final in spite of the fact that the final ph of the o3 uv system was within the convenient range 4 9 for sufficient contribution from radical generation path 14 its failure to show remarkable improvement over the simple o3system could be associated with the intense coloration and strong absorption of the uv light by the chromospheres present in tpa terephthalic acid wastewater so that production of oh radical was blocked the application of o3 uv process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 2 4 ozone hydrogen peroxide o3 h2o2 in the last decades h2o2 has been widely used as an oxidant to remove the recalcitrant pollutants from the different industrial wastewater 43 44 the combined o3 h2o2 system provides better removal of organic contaminants because h2o2 accelerates the decomposition of ozone to form the hydroxyl radicals by the electron transfer mechanism as represented by the following equations the o3 h2o2 process known as the peroxone that includes the oxidation of pollutant by direct and indirect ozone reaction mechanism hydrogen peroxide reacts with ozone when present as an anion ho2 the reaction rate is dependent on the initial concentration of ozone hydrogen peroxide 35 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h p k a 11 8 36 h o 2 o 3 h o 2 o 3 k 2 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 the reaction of ozone with the undissociated hydrogen peroxide which would lead to a loss of ozone and hydrogen peroxide is negligible 37 h 2 o 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 10 2 m 1 s 1 the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and ozonide anion o3 produced in the above equation then enter the chain reaction of the indirect pathway to produce oh the overall reaction can be depicted as follows where two ozone molecule produce two oh 38 o 3 h 2 o 2 2 o h 3 o 2 h2o2 has a strong pollutant degradation ability even if present in a trace amount with ozone hydrogen peroxide not only increases the rate of reaction but also improves the wastewater quality but residual h2o2 is harmful for the microorganism and environment therefore ozonation process is suggested to combine with small amount of h2o2 that can improve the process efficiency by the production of hydroxyl free radical without any negative effect on the subsequent biological or tertiary treatment processes the reaction rate and the process efficiency of the combined o3 h2o2 system is higher than that of ozonation system alone although the h2o2 o3 ratio and ph of the treatment system should be deliberated carefully for the best performance of the combined system as the excess h2o2 starts scavenging the hydroxyl radicals thereby lowering the process efficiency in a similar context 45 46 reported 95 abatement of tetrachloro 1 3 butadienes tcbds and 40 abatement of hexa chloro 1 3 butadiene hcbd at the ozone dose of 0 5 mg land 4 mg lrespectively whereas on addition of h2o2 lower abatement efficiencies of the detected compounds observed due to the decreased ozone reactivity because of the fast transformation of ozone to hydroxyl radical by h2o2 it is due the scavenging of hydroxyl radical by added h2o2 and also reported the 8 increase of hydroxyl radical scavenging rate s 1 for h2o2 o3 2 0 w w and o3 2 0 mg l however the peroxone process was found to be more effective in color removal than the ozone alone process when h2o2 was added in ratios greater than 0 3 wt h2o2 wt o3 the 0 7 wt h2o2 wt o3 ratio was the optimum condition to remove color using uf filtered water this was likely due to the scavenging effect of oh which was consumed by excessive h2o2 concentrations yoon et al 2014 jiao et al 47 reported that with the increased concentration of h2o2nb nitrobenzene removal efficiency increased firstly and then decreased it is known from oxidation mechanism that hydroxyl radical oh plays a major role in oxidative degradation of organic matters 23 as presented in formulas 4 5 the decomposed intermediate product of h2o2 ho2 can react with ozone to promote oh generation thus to improve nb removal however when h2o2 concentration was higher than a certain value excess h2o2 would react with oh as formula 6 therefore oh concentration decreased and then nb removal efficiency decreased 39 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 40 h o 2 o 3 o h o o 2 41 h 2 o 2 o h h 2 o h o 2 whereas shokri et al 48 showed that the efficiency of the degradation of ot ortho toluidine was raised up to a plateau region with increase in initial dosage of h2o2 in this condition additional amount of hydrogen peroxide had no further effect because recombination of hydroxyl radicals happened with excess amounts of h2o2 the same results were also reported by others 49 50 chueca et al 2015 reported the inactivation of e coli in the peroxone system is led by an indirect pathway given that the combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide accelerates the decomposition of o3by h2o2and therefore favors the production of high energy hydroxyl radicals the presence of hydrogen peroxide is known to promote ozone decomposition to form hydroxyl radicals thus improving ozonation degradation and mineralization efficiency with this phenomenon several authors have reported the biodegradability enhancement of recalcitrant wastewater 49 51 guiju et al 2014 9 the application of o3 h2o2 process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 3 5 o3 electrocoagulation o3 ec the electrocoagulation ec process is defined as the degradation or removal of suspended solids colloidal material dissolved solids and metals from the water and wastewater by introducing the coagulant through electrochemical reactions ec reactor consists of electrolytic cell with one anode and cathode in ec operation when current is applied the electrode plates are sacrificed which are generally fe or al electrode thus increasing the concentration of metals ions in the solution these metals ions act as the destabilizing agent and neutralizes the particle charges thereby removes the pollutants from the wastewater either by coagulation and precipitation that can be removed further by floatation the following reactions takes place during the ec process at the anode 42 m s m a q n n e 43 2 h 2 o l 4 h a q o 2 g 4 e at the catode 44 m a q n n e m s 45 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 2 o h a q metal anode generates highly charged cations that destabilizes the charge of contaminants by the formation of polyvalent polyhdroxide complexes when electricity applied these complexes form the aggregates with the pollutants because of their high adsorption properties in addition when wastewater passed through the electric field contaminants may be removed by ionization hydrolysis electrolysis and free radical formation process 55 this process has been proven to be very effective in removing contaminants from water and is characterized by reduced sludge production no requirement of chemicals and ease of operation there are several parameters which affects the ec process efficiency such as electrode material electrode distance electrode arrangements ph current density reaction time wastewater conductivity temperature and reactor design however the single ec process is not found an effective method for the treatment of complex industrial wastewater coupling ec method with aops such as ozone is a promising technology for the removal of highly toxic organic and inorganic compounds from the wastewater the mechanism of electrocoagulation ozone process can be described by the following equations 46 o 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 47 o 3 h o 2 2 o 2 h o 48 o 3 m 2 m o 2 o 2 49 m o 2 h 2 o m 3 h o h o 50 m o 2 m 2 2 h 2 m 3 h 2 o ozone is a strong oxidant and reacts with the wastewater organics either directly as molecular ozone or indirectly through hydroxyl radical formation in ec ozonation process when ozone applied into the ec system the metal ions catalyzes the ozone decomposition to produce more hydroxyl radicals ozone directly reacts with the m2 to give the intermediate mo2 that further converted to hydroxyl radical in addition the ho2 radical formed during ozone decomposition recombines to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 where fenton or fenton like reaction can also takes place and improves the process efficiency by reacting with fe ii or fe iii species if the iron electrodes were used most studies have focused on the efficiency of a specific pollutant removal manipulating parameters such as conductivity ph current density electrode materials etc duringo3 ec process song et al 2016 reported that the decolorization efficiency clearly increased with the increase of ph from 2 0 10 0 and then dropped to 10 at ph 12 0 fe2 fe3 conversion can explain this result for the iron electrodes at high ph some of the hydroxide ions may be oxidized at the anode reducing the production of iron ions in addition fe oh 6 3 or fe oh 4 ions which lacks the capacity for decolorization 56 may be present at high ph these factors lead to reduced color removal efficiency at high ph whereas at lower ph values the main oxidant remains as molecular ozone rather than hydroxyl radicals formed from ozone decomposition molecular ozone has a lower oxidizing potential and are higher selective than hydroxyl radicals leading to a decolorization decrease 57 additionally the protons in the solution are reduced to h2at the cathode preventing the production of the hydroxide ions fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 which are disadvantageous for colorant precipitation and fe oh 3species may also be present under acidic conditions 56 the combined electrochemical ec er and ozonation treatment of grey wastewater gww has shown reduction in codt by 91 31 toc by 84 59 cods by 90 17 and doc by 82 11 indicating that process promotes sufficient production of coagulant agent and reactive oxygen species and consequently ensures higher removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from gww 58 the applied current density in the ec er cell causes an anodic dissolution of aluminum electrode into wastewater and a cathodic reduction of o2 the coagulant agent al oh 3produced in situ has a large surface area beneficial for a rapid adsorption of organic compounds and trapping of colloidal particles 59 61 furthermore the removal of organic compounds is mainly attributed to the direct and indirect oxidation mechanism h2o2electrochemically generated at the cathode is able to modify and oxidize the structure of non biodegradable organic particles 62 while the ozone contribution can be attributed to the electrophilic nature of the direct attack of o3molecule and the indirect attack via oh radicals generated in the ozonation process 63 current density and effluent concentration are important parameters for controlling the reaction rate in most of the hybrid electrochemical processes the combined effect of current density and effluent cod concentration on cod removal efficiency and power consumption were carried out by assaithambi et al 2016 and they have found that the cod removal efficiency was increased with an increase in current density at any value of effluent cod concentration due to the increased current density a larger amount of fe2 was produced via anodic metal dissolution causing coagulation and formation of more bubbles at the cathode causing flotation 64 the application of o3 ec process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 4 6 catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation process is classified as homogenous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process where ozone decomposition is catalyzed by transition metal ions and solid catalyst respectively which accelerates the ozone decomposition and hydroxyl radical formation 6 1 homogeneous catalytic ozonation the two mechanism are available in the literature for homogenous catalytic ozonation process to decompose ozone by transition metal ions 1 decomposition of ozone by metal ions leading to the generation of free radicals 72 74 2 complexes formation between organic molecule and the catalyst and subsequent oxidation of the complex 75 77 the most common used metal ions in homogenous catalytic ozonation process as an effective catalyst are mn ii fe iii fe ii co ii cu ii zn ii and cr iii 78 80 in general the presence of metals as catalyst exerted positive effect on the efficiency of ozonation process by generation more hydroxyl radicals than o3 alone the reaction mechanism of fe ii catalyzed ozonation process can be expressed as follows 51 o 3 h o 2 h o 2 52 o 3 h o 2 2 o 2 o h 53 f e 2 o 3 f e 3 o 3 54 o 3 h o 2 o h 55 f e 2 o 3 f e o 2 o 2 56 f e o 2 h 2 o f e 3 o h o h 57 f e 3 o 3 h 2 o f e o 2 o h o 2 h 58 2 h o 2 h 2

industrial wastewater table 5 ferrous is considered as the most promising homogenous metal catalyst because of low price leading to the low treatment cost also like fe iii it does not precipitate out as insoluble ferrous hydroxide fe oh 2 at higher ph 4 because of its highly soluble products ksp fe oh 3 3 10 39 ksp fe oh 2 8 10 16 the mineralization of dcp using catalytic ozonation process with mn2 as catalyst was studied where they have used dmpo as spin trap reagent to trap hydroxyl radicals fig 4 the presence of strong dmpo oh bond confirms the more hydroxyl radical formation during catalyzed ozonation process with mn2 and resulted in highest mineralization of dcp 69 also they have proposed the following dcp degradation mechanism using ozone alone and ozone with mn2 to improve the efficiency of ozonation process for bi enhancement of bmdww biomethanated distillery wastewater sameena et al 2019 has applied combination of ozone with fe2 as the addition of fe2 to ozone catalyzes the ozonation process by producing more hydroxyl free radicals leading to the enhanced rate of organic contaminant removal and mineralization where they have observed 3 5 fold increase in the biodegradability index bi of bmdww however further higher fe2 concentration has not resulted in significant increase in the bi values as the excess amount of fe2 starts consuming hydroxyl radicals resulting in the decreased process efficiency also zylan and ince 86 reported that feso4 was found to be more efficient for the degradation of ibp 84 ibp decay due to the formation of h 2 o 2 ho 2 pair as a result of reaction of fe2 with ozone which are distinctively more reactive than o3 despite of high catalytic activity of metal ions during ozonation process removal of metal ions from the treated water becomes mandatory and catalytic activity is limited to low concentration of metal ions up to several mg l table 5 these circumstances of homogenous catalytic ozonation process motivated the researchers to lead their research in the direction of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process which has becomes more popular in the present scenario the application of homogenous catalytic ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 5 6 2 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation metal oxides such as mno2 tio2 al2o3 feooh and ceo2 metals cu ru pt co on supports sio2 al2o3 tio2 ceo2 activated carbon and zeolites modified with metals are the most widely used catalyst in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process there are two possible mechanisms of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process either ozone decomposition on reduced oxidized form of metal deposited on the surface of a solid support or decomposition of ozone on lewis centers of the metal oxides however the efficiency of the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process depends on the several factors like ph of the solution catalyst and its surface properties therefore the mechanism of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process using different catalyst needs to be understand 6 2 1 metal oxides the removal of 2 methylisoborneol mib from drinking water using aluminum oxides γ alooh and γ al2o3 has been studied where 98 4 and 27 5 removal of mib was obtained in catalyzed ozonation by γ alooh and γ al2o3respectively the possible reaction mechanism of catalyzed ozonation by aluminum oxides was proposed and illustrated in fig 5 the adsorbed water molecule on the oxides surface dissociated intooh and h on introduction of hao and rao into the aqueous solution to form surface hydroxyl group the mib was then absorbed by the surface hydroxyl group on hao and hydroxyl radical formation inhibited due to the adsorption process during the catalytic ozone decomposition where the main reaction mechanism was solid surface domination reaction and generation of oh was solely due to the ozone decomposition these ozone and few oh further oxidize mib into co2 and h2o whereas the main reaction mechanism for mib decomposition using rao was hydroxyl radical reaction initially the mib was absorbed by the surface and the pores of rao the ozone decomposition initiated by surface hydroxyl group on rao to generate oh which oxidizes mib non selectively into co2 and h2o the higher removal efficiency of mib using rao during catalytic ozone decomposition is due to the more oh generation 87 in a study the degradation efficiency of cbz carbamazepine in single and catalytic ozonation process using fe3o4 ceo2 mwcnts as efficient catalyst was 50 3 and 64 1 after 4 min reaction this result implied that the production of hydroxyl radicals accelerated the removal rate with addition of catalyst 88 consequently the amount of catalyst played an important role in the catalytic ozonation process which influenced the volume of oh generated author have reported increased cod removal efficiency of tannery wastewater with an increase in the mn cu al2o3catalyst loading during catalytic ozonation process 89 this observation might be the result of increasing the quantity of the catalyst whereby the overall active surface area was enhanced therefore the availability of additional active sites on the catalyst surface led to an increase in the rate of oh production per unit of o3conversion many researchershave also reported that an increase in the catalyst quantity was of benefit for the degradation of organic pollutants 90 93 another point which has to be emphasized is the effect of ph on the activity of metal oxides during ozonation process it can be seen from the results reported by roshani et al 91 that the activity of mn al2o3decreases by the increase of ph from 2 to 7 4 whereas it increases by increasing the ph from 7 4 10 on the other hand cu al2o3experiences a maximum in toc removal by increasing the ph from 2 to 5 6 deionized water the activity of cu al2o3decreases by further increase of ph from 5 6 10 there are a number of factors such as the electronic properties of metal oxides pzc of the catalysts adsorption of btz by products on the surface of the catalyst and the mechanism of the reaction which influence the catalysts activity at different values of ph it is believed that the electronic properties and pzc of the catalysts are the most important parameters affecting toc removal in fact the surface charge of catalysts and the ability of catalysts to transfer electrons to ozone control the rate of toc removal ozone has electrophilic and nucleophilic nature which can interact with the catalyst surface at acidic or basic conditions by exchanging electrons with metal oxides this results in decomposition of ozone and generation of oh radicals necessary for toc removal however not all transition metal oxides are favorable in electron transfer with ozone at acidic or basic condition cu has limited formal oxidation states up to 4 limiting its ability to participate in the catalytic cycle at acidic or basic conditions this makes cu show the highest catalytic activity at ph near the pzc of cu al2o3which leads to the reaction of ozone with sur face hydroxyl groups to decompose ozone 34 on the other hand mn is an exceptional transition metal oxide which can exist at several oxidation state from 2 to 7 this gives an advantage to mn which can be active in a wide range of ph conditions by being able to receive or donate electrons to ozone at acidic and basic ph levels this capability of mn ensures that ozone can be decomposed by interacting with mn at all ph values at neutral ph the surface of mn is covered with stable hydroxyl groups with zero charge which are less effective in decomposition of ozone therefore it can be inferred that the difference in the ability of cu and mn to transfer electrons to ozone under different surface charges different solution ph is likely the main reason of observing different catalytic activity for cu al2o3and mn al2o3 furthermore it is worth considering that a significant catalyst load might initiate a series of issues such as difficulties with the separation and recovery of the catalyst and increased cost of wastewater treatment 6 2 2 metals on supports possible mechanisms of catalytic ozonation in the presence of metals on supports are presented in fig 6 94 ozone or hydroxyl radicals attacked the adsorbed organics on the catalyst surface to form oxidation products which desorb into the bulk solution in the first mechanism whereas ozone and organic molecules adsorb on the catalyst surface in the second mechanism ozone oxidizes the metal on the reduced metal catalyst surface to form oh radicals also the adsorbed organic molecules on the catalyst surface oxidize to give reduced catalyst mreda by an electron transfer reaction with the desorption of organic radical species from the catalyst ho or o3 further oxidizes the desorbed organic radical species in the bulk solution the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation in the presence of metals on support differs from the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation on metal oxides due to the no generation of hydroxyl free radicals instead the reaction takes place on the surface of the catalyst or the formation of complexes results in the catalytic effect 6 2 3 activated carbon the activated carbon acts as the both adsorbent and catalyst during ozonation process the effective decolorization and organic contaminant degradation by anozonation with activated carbon as catalyst has been reported in many studies table 6 although use of activated carbon has many disadvantages such as activated carbon easily get saturated and regeneration or even replacement is required for further effective removal of pollutants the combination of activated carbon with ozone was found to be an attractive method for industrial wastewater treatment activated carbon accelerates the generation of hydroxyl radicals by anozone transformation during catalytic process the hydroxyl radicals formed are free to react with the organic compounds in the aqueous phase and not bound to the surface of activated carbon the efficiency of activated carbon to produce hydroxyl radical by decomposing ozone is mainly dependent on the surface properties of the carbon the basal plane electrons and basic oxygenated surface groups chromene and pyrones acts as the lewis base are responsible for the ozone decomposition the active species oh ions and h2o2 formed during reduction of ozone on the surface of the activated carbon initiates the decomposition of ozone in aqueous phase the lewis base basic lewis sites are located at π electron rich regions chromenes and pyrones reacts with h2o and forms the electron donor acceptor complexes as follows 99 61 c π 2 h 2 o c π h 3 o o h the π electron acts as the catalytic center of reaction and reduces ozone to hydroxyl ion and hydrogen peroxide 62 o 3 h 2 o 2 e o 2 2 o h catalytic decomposition of ozone by activated carbon depends to a great

formed that lowers the catalytic decomposition of ozone however ph 6 hydroxyl radicals are formed as a result of adsorption of ozonide and atomic oxygen on the catalyst surface the catalytic ozonation of heavy oil refining wastewater horw was investigated over activated carbon supported iron oxides fac catalysts using activated carbon ac as the reference 100 accordingly the increased cod removal efficiency in fac ozone system primarily resulted from enhanced catalytic ozonation which indicated that iron oxide can improve surface active sites transform more ozone into secondary oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals certainly surface fe active sites in fac catalyst were increased with iron content increasing on activated carbon however overloaded iron can enhance ac surface area covering which inevitably lead to some loss of non fe surface active sites originally presented in ac 100 apart from activated carbon other forms of carbon such as multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts carbon xerogels and carbon nanofibers cnfs have been shown to have the potential to be effective solutions as a catalyst for the ozonation process for the wastewater treatment the modification of the surface properties of carbon materials have been known to influence their catalytic properties in particular the presence of surface heteroatoms such as oxygen sulfur and nitrogen has been shown to significantly affect the catalytic activity of carbon materials in catalytic ozonation the application of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 6 6 2 4 photo catalyzed ozonation the photocatalytic oxidation has been widely studied for wastewater treatment and many review papers were published 101 102 ozonation in combination with photocatalyst results in a new advanced oxidation method known as photocatalytic ozonation which has a different mechanism of oxidation from ozonation process due to the presence of photocatalyst 102 photocatalytic process is based on the production of photoactivated electron hole pair by exciting the surface of the photocatalyst using uv vis radiationin an aqueous medium simultaneously ozone molecule adsorbs on the photocatalyst surface resulting in the generation of active oxygen radicals which leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals on reaction with water

required for the generation of hydroxyl radical in the presence of oxygen 103 the photo catalyzed ozonation process was reported to be effective for the degradation of monochloroacetic acid and dimethyl 2 2 2 trichloro l hydroxyethylphosphonate dep present in water with smaller effect on phenolic compounds degradation suggested that the photocatalysts are more effective for hydrophilic compounds degradation as compared to aromatic compounds 104 the considerable enhancement in the degradation efficiency of n compounds such as such as alkylamines alkanolamines heterocyclic and aromatic n compounds has been reported using combined photo catalysis and ozonation process as compared to either photo catalysis or ozonation alone 105 the photo catalyzed ozonation process for the degradation of natural organic matter nom in ground water has been studied where the ozonation process catalyzed with tio2resulted in a higher degree of total organic matter content reduction in the course of catalytic ozonation in an acidic medium ozone as an electron donor is coordinated to the acidic sites on the catalyst surface ti4 ozone decomposition at the sites of lewis acid on the metal surface leads to the formation of o radicals which are more reactive than ozone itself and favor nom oxidation by an indirect mechanism via o radical jelena et al 2012 the effect of ph on the o3 tio2 gac process was studied from 3 0 9 0 by ferreiro et al 106 or the treatment of genotoxic aniline wastewater because this range is closely related to the ionic species in solution considering the aniline dissociation pka 80 c 6 h 5 n h 2 a q h 2 o c 6 h 5 n h 3 a q o h a q p k a 4 61 the concentration of anilinium cations is negligible at ph 4 61 consequently the reaction rate is expected to increase under basic conditions which is also enhanced by a parallel increase in hydroxyl radical generation conversely at acidic ph below 4 61 the greater presence of anilinium cations and a positively charged catalyst surface would justify a significant reduction in the degradation rate thus the overall reactivity of aniline towards ozone increases from 5 9 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 1 5 to 1 4 10 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 in a study for photo catalyzed ozonation process negligible toc removal obtained when ozone applied alone whereas the application of tio2 catalyzed ozonation process resulted in 60 toc removal with complete decolorization of textile effluent 107 the application of photo catalyzed ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 6 7 nano catalyzed ozonation in this process nanomaterials are used as catalyst during ozonation process to produce more hydroxyl radicals to degrade the organic contaminant present in the wastewater the materials having particle size 100 nm known as the nanomaterials nanomaterials posses different surface properties compared to their parent molecule as a consequence of increased surface area due to the small particle size several studies have been reported the successful application of nanomaterials such as nanoparticles nano powder and nano membranes for wastewater treatment the high specific surface area to volume mass ratio fast dissolution high reactivity strong sorption supermagenatism quantum confinement effect and localized surface plasmon resonance improves the adsorption property of sorbent materials thereby increasing the process efficiency the studied nanoparticles are mainly fe3o4 mgo nanocomposite made of two or more different materials zero valent iron etc table 8 the use of nanomaterials in combination with ozone is a promising option for wastewater treatment due to its easy application high reactivity and high efficiency gholamreza and maryam 2009 have reported the degradation and biodegradability improvement of reactive red 198 azo dye using catalytic ozonation with mgo nanocrystals they reported increased cod and color removal at alkaline ph which is due to the increased availability of hydroxide ion and enhanced ozone decomposition resulted in the formation of more hydroxyl and mgo hydroxyl radicalsand proposed the following mechanism 81 o 3 m g o s m g

formation in the aqueous solution and decomposition of ozone takes place on the surface of mgo to form active radicals in the last decade nzvi has been widely used for the degradation of hazardous recalcitrant contaminants present in the groundwater and wastewater due to its high surface area and reactivity the addition of nzvi to the ozonation system improves the efficiency of the oxidation process by producing more hydroxyl radicals as there are two extra electrons per fe atom to form the oh radical that can be explained by the following reactions 108 sameena et al 2019 84 f e 0 2 o 3 2 o 3 f e 2 85 f e 2 o 3 o 3 f e 3 86 o 3 h o 2 o h in a similar study the phenolphthalein degradation using zero valent iron nanoparticles in combination of ozone reported 98 removal of phenolphthalein and and suggested the increased phenolphthalein degradation is because of the addition of nzvi 108 catalytic ozonation treatment of fluoxetine was carried out using different doses of nano γ alumina catalyst increasing dosage of the nano catalyst from 0 0 1 g l 1 enhanced gradually the removal efficiency of fluoxetine the reason is that applying a higher amount of catalyst provides more active sites for physical adsorption of ozone and results in increased ozone decomposition into oh radicals also ratio of hydroxyl radical to molecular ozone concentrations increases whereas at low concentrations of the catalyst efficiency of fluoxetine removal reduces with increased concentration of fluoxetine in water media since the oxidation process is dominated by direct mechanism developed using the existing ozone molecules abbas et al 2018 it has been reported by rahimi et al 109 that increased ph increased the efficiency of dye removal from 61 at ph 4 78 at ph 10 about 16 while the highest efficiency of dye removal in catalytic ozonation process with magnetic carbonaceous nanocomposite as catalyst was achieved at ph 8 95 since the structural properties of the pollutants will change with ph and the effect of ph on the catalytic degradation can be explained as electrostatic interaction between target contaminant and the catalyst surface properties that measured by phzpc ph at zero point charge 110 hence during the oxidation process the ph of solution and the phzpc of catalyst are the important factors that affect the contaminant treatment mechanism 111 in this case the phzpc of catalyst was 7 7 that indicated that the catalyst surface has basic properties and these basic functional groups located on the surface of the catalyst are thought to be responsible for ozone decomposition resulting in the generation of reactive radical species and better oxidation of recalcitrant colored contaminants 112 the application of nanocatalytic ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 7 8 limitations of hybrid processes ozonation used both as a standalone technological process and in combination with other oxidation processes offers a high effectiveness of oxidation of a variety of organic contaminants however ozone is a strong oxidant it can be hazardous to handle moreover leakage corrosion and excess ozone gas treatment which may lead to frequent operation and maintenance of ozone contact tanks and pipping also the treatment costs of ozone and hybrid ozonation technologies were expensive and not feasible the generation of secondary pollutants during treatment of effluents using hybrid process is a big problem these secondary pollutants can be more toxic and hazardous to the further treatment stages as compared to the parent pollutant which indicates the need of monitoring of intermediate compounds and selection of the optimal method for the treatment in nano catalysed ozonation process the nanoparticles used have been produced mainly using chemical methods which have the disadvantage to use expensive and or toxic reagents and to produce undesirable by products 9 benefits of hybrid processes ozone has been successfully used in a vast number of applications ranging from producing drinking water to treating wastewater as well as in many chemical industrial systems such as textile distillery and pulp and paper processing etc unfortunately due to the low degradation efficiency and mass transfer limitation of ozonation process hybrid ozonation processes have been studied and is particularly attractive for wastewater treatment because hybrid ozonation processes can destroy most hazardous organic contaminants such as dyes phenolic compounds pesticides organochlorides pharmaceutical and ammonium compounds a major drawback of ozonation processes is the high operation cost caused by the installation of an expensive ozone generation unit and the cost of electricity application of hybrid ozonation process overcomes this drawback of ozonation process to some extent by the degradation of contaminants present in the wastewater at higher rate with greater efficiency the catalyzed ozonation process using metals such as iron does not lead to the generation of sludge at any ph in the range of 3 7 and this represents another advantage of the hybrid process the application of iron nanoparticles coupled with ozonation improves the mass transfer in the system which results in a faster process able to react in a wide range of ph the easy application high reactivity low solubility in water non toxicity and efficiency of nanoparticles makes it a promising option for the wastewater treatment the recent development of ozone micro nano bubbles technology offers great advantage as it reduces the doses of ozone and reaction time required to degrade the same extent of contaminant due to its longer lifespans as well as high specific areas that apparently can reduce the operational and capital cost of hybrid ozonation process and makes it more feasible and sustainable technology for future application 10 economic aspects of hybrid ozonation processes despite the efficacy of hybrid ozonation process and its synergistic effects on the decomposition of pollutants in water and wastewater economic aspects must also be considered comparing ozonation process which consumes electricity for ozone generation to hybrid ozonation process which requires supplementary electrical energy and chemicals addition at first glance hybrid ozonation systems appear to be more expensive than simple ozonation process and may not be economically admissible however a better cost assessment of these oxidation techniques for wastewater treatment could be determined by evaluating the specific energy consumption for each oxidation system where the energy consumed during the oxidation process is apportioned to the amount of decomposed materials yunho et al 2016 reported that the required energy for the degradation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma present in municipal wastewater was e 0 158 kw h m 3 for the uv h2o2 e 0 095 kw h m 3 for the o3 h2o2 e 0 126 kw h m 3 for the o3 uv and e 0 176 kw h m 3 for the o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 whereas for o3 it was e 0 25 kw h m 3 these combined processes require less energy compared to o3alone at the same micropollutant abatement levels due to the higher energy efficiency of ozonation and the synergism of combined treatment similarly pillai et al 39 have shown that specific energy consumption for the treatment of terephthalic acid wastewater using ozone alone o3 uv assisted ozonation o3 uv h2o2and uv assisted ozonation o3 h2o2 uv and fe2 catalyzed ozonation o3 fe2 was31 3 kw h m 3 58 6 kw h m 3 32 1 kw h m 3 and 21 3 kw h m 3 respectively where the degradation efficiency in terms of cod removal was 43 53 45 and 47 respectively which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of catalyzed ozonation process o3 fe2 likewise in terms of power consumed per amount of treated pollutant aziz et al 65 ascertained that the ozone electrocoagulation system had the highest power consumption in order to achieve 100 cod removal from the distillery effluent but only 18 75 cod removal efficiency was obtained with single ozonation process however azbar et al 40 compared various advanced oxidation processes and chemical treatment methods for cod and color removal from a polyester and acetate fiber dyeing effluent and found that treatment cost for simple ozonation process was 5 28 m 3 compared to 6 38 m 3 for o3 uv process whereas it was lowest of 0 07 m 3 for chemical methods such as feso4 7h2o based upon these studies it appears that depending on parameters such as pollutant properties concentration of ozone and pollutant experimental variables reactor design etc hybrid ozonation can be more cost effective than single ozonation process in the oxidation of some pollutants under optimum operational conditions but this conclusion cannot be generalized for all cases 11 conclusions and recommendations this review has shown principles advantages and limitations as well as the performances and some of the successful applications of hybrid ozonation process in removal of organic and inorganic pollutants decolorization and disinfection in water and wastewater the intense hydroxyl radical generation as a result of combined effect of hybrid process enables effective removal of the pollutants in a wide range of ph and the highly improved ozone utilization related to efficient mass transfer make the technology sustainable though the hybrid methods are not economically viable techniques to degrade large quantum of effluent disposed by the industries therefore it is desirable to use hybrid ozonation process for partial degradation of recalcitrant or biodegradability enhancement of wastewater so that it can be further treated using biological methods and making the process economically feasible these hybrid methods expected to reduce the reactor size and decrease the operating cost however the oxidants added during the pretreatment should be completely eliminated before subjecting to the biological treatment as they may act as inhibitors to the microorganism the existing applications and lab scale research works on the kinetic reaction of the technology illustrate the promising potential applicability of these hybrid processes in industries however there is no published study on the actual amount of energy saved by using hybrid processes over the other conventional treatment methods therefore study considering the additional energy consumption in degrading the pollutants using hybrid processes should be conducted to reach on a perceptible comparison the hybrid ozonation process showed high efficiency in the removal of contaminants from the wastewater but the removal mechanism has not yet been ascertained for most of the pollutants hence the major attention should be devoted in the future on the identification of reaction intermediates development of rate expressions based on established reaction mechanisms identification of scale up parameters and criteria for cost effectiveness although a systematic procedure consisted on using model substances and evaluating toxicity and biodegradability during and after the degradation process the assessment of chemical parameters overall such as cod and more accurate such as chromatography is usually reported it is necessary to carry out the more pilot plant scale experiments with real industrial wastewater from the industrial application point of view more studies on how system characteristics enhance or limit the individual and global efficiencies and eventually the overall treatment cost must be performed furthermore competition for the chemical oxidant by the contaminants and multiple substrate kinetics for the hybrid process must be studied in addition to the experimental and modeling work the aspect most lacking in hybrid process for the treatment of hardly biodegradable specific industrial wastewater is the performance of complete economic studies which could present this innovative technology as a cost competitive one moreover the use of solar energy could improve the treatment efficiency of these technologies and could be a more economic solution for the wastewater treatment and recycle declaration of competing interest the paper presents a detailed review of hybrid ozonation process as a combination of two different

14045,ozone is a strong oxidant and have been effectively used for the degradation and mineralization of organic pollutants however the increase in the toxicity and disposal of the recalcitrant organics standalone ozonation process is not effective and sustainable solution for the treatment of industrial wastewater containing recalcitrant it is therefore necessary to provide a summary of success of hybrid ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment along with the reaction mechanism for enhancing the molecular ozone reactivity the paper presents a detailed review of hybrid ozonation process as a combination of two different techniques to enhance the hydroxyl radical formation thereby increasing the process efficiency an extensive review on the mechanism and application of these hybrid ozonation processes for degradation mineralization detoxification of different organic pollutants present in the industrial wastewater is reported keywords ozonation advanced oxidation process hybrid ozonation process industrial wastewater hydroxyl radical degradation 1 introduction water is the most basic requirement of life on earth and utilized to carry out the different household and industrial activities in recent years the whole world is facing water crises due to the rapid development of polluting industries such as pharmaceuticals distilleries textile fertilizers tanneries and mining industries increasing living standards human population and urbanization there by leading to the production of toxic and recalcitrant wastewater containing hazardous pollutants 1 2 161 3 these recalcitrant compounds are resistant to biological treatment due to the low biodegradability index and characterized by high chemical oxygen demand and low biological oxygen demand values 160 4 5 the presence of these non biodegradable organic compounds in wastewater even in little extent causes serious problems to public health since they are potential carcinogens endocrine disrupting and toxic to living organisms these non biodegradable and hazardous pollutants enter the environment primarily through industries it is therefore essential to treat industrial wastewater on priority basis the biological treatment of most industrial wastewater is found to be ineffective due to the presence of recalcitrant contaminants bod5 cod 0 2 in the wastewater as the biological methods are generally employed for the wastewater treatment at bod5 cod ratio of greater than 0 4 6 generally advanced oxidation methods are used to degrade the industrial wastewater containing biorefractory pollutants however despite of high degradation efficiency of advanced oxidation methods it necessitates controlled operating conditions high energy input which increases the process cost and it sometimes only transforms the recalcitrant contaminants from liquid phase to solid phase 7 the efficient treatment system for the wastewater treatment is the basic need of the present society in order to treat industrial wastewater effectively the research scope should include the biodegradability enhancement along with degradation as well as the mineralization of recalcitrant organic compounds that is the conversion of the complex aromatic compounds to simple aliphatic compounds to the highest stable state of water and carbon dioxide or to more easily degradable compounds that can be treated further biologically advanced oxidation processes aops can be a promising option to treat industrial wastewater as it a most powerful method for the removal of any kind of organic contaminants the principle of the advanced oxidation processis the generation of highly oxidizing radicals specially the hydroxyl radical oh e 2 8 v versus nhe capable of oxidizing high recalcitrant contaminants to co2and h2o hydroxyl radicals produced in aops attack the organic molecules by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the molecule through a common pathway as reported by sameena et al 6 the process can be described as follows 1 o h r h h 2 o r 2 r h 2 o 2 r o h o h 3 r o 2 r o o 4 r o o r h r o o h r aops generally comprises of a many individual processes that include ozone o3 fenton hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv wet air oxidation wao sonication and several coupled processes like peroxone o3 h2o2 ultra violet light with peroxide uv h2o2 peroxone and ultraviolet light o3 h2o2 uv o3 tio2 electron beam irradiation o3 tio2 h2o2 systems 8 13 among the different existing aops the ozonation process emerging as very promising and alternative wastewater technique which generates no sludge and residual ozone also decomposes into water and oxygen 14 ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent with high oxidation potential of 2 07 v and reacts with the organic compounds either directly as a molecular ozone or indirectly through hydroxyl free radical generation in a chain reaction mechanism generally the effective biological oxidation of organic macromolecules is difficult because of their too large size which prohibits the microbial cell wall infusion in general organic macromolecules may simply be too large to infuse cell walls which prohibits their effective biological oxidation ozone breakdown these large molecules into short chain intermediate products that can enter cells and becomes readily biodegradable as the decreased molecular size enhances the biological oxidation rate also the reaction between ozone and organic molecules outcomes in hydroxyl free radical which is a highly reactive and unstable compound that have a higher oxidation potential than ozone due to the unstable nature of hydroxyl free radical it immediately undergoes a chemical reaction to become stable by gaining the missing electron 15 ozonation can be carried out at room temperature and pressure it is a cleaner process for wastewater treatment with no sludge generation however this method has two main drawbacks the first is low oxidation efficiency due to the selective nature of ozone limited mass transfer and slow rate of reaction the second is related to the high energy consumption for ozone generation that makes it costly hence the technologies are required to increase the efficiency of the ozonation process at low cost with high efficiency catalytic hybrid ozonation is a promising technology for the wastewater treatment as it can reduce operating cost reaction time to achieve the same degradation efficiency with increased rate of degradation and mineralization of recalcitrant organic compounds present in the wastewater many researches were escorted to further improve the efficiency of ozonation process in combination with alkaline solution o3 oh uv o3 uv peroxone o3 h2o2 catalytic ozonation for the degradation and mineralization of refractory organics present in the industrial wastewater thus the present paper reviewed the detailed reaction mechanism of hybrid ozonation process fig 1 to form the more reactive hydroxyl radical for effective degradation of organic pollutants along with the short summary of the experimental results of the hybrid ozonation processes reported so far 2 ozone ozone is a very powerful oxidizing agent comprised of one week single bond and one strong double bond the inter convertible two resonance structure of ozone exist due to which molecular ozone can react as a dipole agent either electrophile or nucleophile fig 2 ozone is an unstable gas and reacts with the substances in wastewater in two different ways either directly as molecular ozone or indirectly through the formation of secondary oxidants i e hydroxyl radicals these two different reaction pathways lead to the formation of different oxidation products and are controlled by different types of kinetics therefore the decomposition kinetics of ozone must be known to predict the oxidation effects of ozone and ozone consumption rate 2 1 indirect reaction mechanism indirect reaction mechanism involves hydroxyl radical which has an unpaired electron hydroxyl radicals are highly unstable and immediately reacts with the other molecules to gain missing electron the ozone radical mechanism involves three different steps initiation propagation and termination fig 3 2 1 1 initiation step the first step is the decay of ozone where the reaction between ozone and hydroxide ions leads to the formation of one superoxide anion o2 and one hydroperoxyl radical ho2 which are in acid base equilibrium pka 4 8 with a rate constant value of 70 m 1s 1 k1 5 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 6 h o 2 o 2 h 2 1 2 propagation step the superoxide anion o2 then reacts with ozone to form an ozonide anion o3 with rate constant of 1 6 109 m 1s 1 k2 which immediately decomposes to oh radical via hydrogen trioxide ho3 formation k3 1 1 105 m 1s 1 the ozonide anion and hydrogen trioxide are in acid base equilibrium pka 6 2 7 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 8 h o 3 o 3 h 9 h o 3 o h o 2 the hydroxyl radical further reacts with ozone to form ho4 k4 2x 109 m 1s 1 that decomposes to hydroperoxyl radical on reaction with oxygen k5 2 8 104 m 1s 1 and here the chain reaction starts 10 o h o 3 h o 4 11 h o 4 o 2 h o 2 hydroxyl radical also react with organic molecule r which can act as the promotors and form organic radical r 12 h 2 r o h h r h 2 o organic peroxy radicals roo can also be formed if the oxygen is present that can again start the chain reaction 13 h r o 2 h r o 2 14 h r o 2 r h o 2 15 h r o 2 r o o h 2 1 3 termination step some organic and inorganic molecules react with oh to form secondary radicals that do not produce superoxide radicals ho2 o2 these scavengers generally terminate the chain reaction and inhibit ozone decay the carbonate can act as the scavenger with the rate constant value 4 2 108 m 1s 1 k6 whereas the bicarbonate can act as the hydroxyl radical scavenger with the rate constant of k7 1 5 107 m 1s 1 16 o h c o 3 2 c o 3 o h 17 o h h c o 3 h c o 3 o h the two radicals may also react to terminate the chain reaction as follows k8 3 7 1010 m 1s 1 18 o h o h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 direct reaction the direct reaction of molecular ozone with organic compounds is a selective reaction with slow reaction rate constants in the range of 1 0 106 m 1s 1 the molecular ozone reacts with the unsaturated bond due to its dipolar structure and leads to splitting of the bond ozone reacts faster the with organic water contaminants depending upon their degree of nucleophilicity or electron density the overall reaction of ozone indicates that three ozone molecules are required to produce two hydroxyl radicals as show below 19 3 o 3 o h h 2 o h 4 o 2 the ozonation process has been successfully adopted in the last few decades for the treatment of industrial wastewater containing toxic and recalcitrant organic contaminants table 1 the use of ozone is dependent on the target of the ozonation processes in each type of wastewater at preliminary stages ozone is used for detoxification disinfection and sludge reduction whereas the most common application of ozone is for micro pollutant removal cod reduction and decolorization indeed a number of studies have been validated the efficiency of the ozone process as a pretreatment option for wastewater treatment 11 12 16 for example the ozone process has been used to decolorize the digital textile printing wastewater where after ozone dose of 17 7 g s l only 12 of cod was removed whereas 66 of color was removed this is because the chromophores present in the dyes are easily cleaved by ozone but entire oxidation of dyes for cod removal required more ozone dose of 255 g s l where 63 of cod and 81 of colour were removed 17 the design and doses of ozonation system mainly depends on the color causing compounds and on the cod load of the wastewater in a study the wastewater containing direct dye sirius blue sbrr with initial dye concentration of 400 mg l has shown 90 58 color removal at ozone dose of 24 03 g m3 whereas the anthraquinone dye wastewater c i reactive blue 19 has shown 100 color removal with the initial dye concentration of 200 mg l at ozone dose of 25 g m3 18 19 because ozonation reaction for color removal takes few minutes due to the chemical structure of the color causing compounds whereas for cod reduction it takes several hours 20 21 the efficiency of ozone is also ph dependent as at acidic ph molecular ozone expected to attack and degrade the organic compounds while at alkaline ph ozonation process follows several oxidation mechanisms through hydroxyl radical formation jose et al carried out the experiments to determine the effect of ph during ozonation process for the treatment of synthetic samples of citrus wastewater where the efficiencies after 60 min of reaction time required for total real color removal reached values of around 40 and rose up to 46 when the ph was increased up to 10 22 ozone reactivity is also dependent on the chemical structure redox properties of reactants and ozone doses adams et al 1997 turhan and uzman showed phenol removal from the aqueous solution of phenol containing four different initial concentrations 25 50 75 and 100 mg l at three different ozone doses of 2 4 and 6 g lh where they have found phenol degradation increased with the increasing o3concentration especially for two phenol concentrations 50 mg land 75 mg l turhan uzman 2008 ozonation process has also been applied as a pretreatment option for the biodegradability enhancement of recalcitrant wastewater with low biodegradability index bi 0 2 it has been presented that ozonation pretreatment with 4 6 g hr of ozone dose has led biodegradability enhancement of complex biomethanated distillery wastewater from an initial bi of 0 16 to 0 71 at the end of 10 h of ozonation period sameena et al 2019 also in similar studies ozone pretreatment has shown biodegradability enhancement of complex recalcitrant wastewater as theozonation of wastewater transforms or converts the recalcitrant present in the wastewater to the low molecular weight biodegradable organic compounds contributing to the biodegradability enhancement of the wastewater 16 though it is essential to monitor the oxidative by products during ozonation process as the ozonation pretreatment sometimes results in the production of more toxic and stable intermediates and end products in a relative study for refinery effluent the oxygenated volatile organic compounds o voc were analyzed before and after oxidative treatment using ozone where they have found that the reduction depends on the strength of the oxidizing agent and the dose used during treatment however the investigations described reveal that excessively strong oxidation results in an increase in o voc content 23 some authors have reported toxicity removal of wastewater after ozonation pretreatment due to the conversion of recalcitrant organic compounds to low molecular weight organic compounds that are more biodegradable to further treat using biological methods 16 sameena et al 2019 suvidha et al 2015 2 3 ozone nano bubbles the efficiency of ozone for the treatment of organics contaminated wastewater is limited by its slow dissolution rate and rapid decomposition in the aqueous phase micro nano bubbles mnbs are a novel method to prolong the reactivity of the ozone in the aqueous phase thereby accelerating the treatment of the contaminant nano ozone bubbles are nanoscopic bubbles in aqueous solutions and have longer lifespans as well as high specific areas when compared to the macro bubbles and hence can destroy pathogens efficiently thus indicating tremendous potential for wastewater treatment the diffusion of gas into water depends on several factors such as gas solubility temperature gas concentration solution pressure bubble size and internal gas pressure the ozone is a very soluble gas in the water at 25 c ozone solubility is 109 mg l the solubility of oxygen is 8 mg l ozone is 13 times more soluble than oxygen however when ozone is supplied as bubbles due to high buoyancy they rapidly leave the solution without having sufficient time for ozone to dissolve in water so when using nano bubbles due to its reduction in buoyancy it will stay in the solution comparably longer time as well as since smaller bubbles inside pressure is higher and it will increase the diffusion rates so it will allow the gas to be supersaturated in water batagoda et al 2018 moreover many authors showed that the ozone mnbs can greatly improve remediation efficiency and represent an innovative technology for in situ remediation of organics contaminated groundwater 29 rudy and jhonny 2017 jazmin and jhonny 2017 as the gas water interfacial area of bubbles and the associated mass transfer coefficient kl control the rate of gas transfer into water nbs have higher interfacial area per volume of gas and longer lifetime in water days versus seconds than micro or larger bubbles this results in higher efficiency of gas partitioning into water and presents opportunities to revolutionize water treatment processes that depend on efficient gas transfer 30 in addition to enhancing ozone gas dissolution ozone mnbs effectively generate hydroxyl radicals that are highly effective in decomposing the organic molecules in both acidic and alkaline water environment 31 33 besides mineralization of organic substances mnbs ozonation is also applied to removal of inorganic materials in water khuntia et al 33 studied the removal of ammonia which is major source of undesirable odor from aqueous solution using ozone mnbs they found that microbubble aided ozonation was a faster process and it can be applied under a wider range of ph unlike the biological degradation of ammonia khuntia et al 34 has also shown application of mnbs ozonation to the oxidation of arsenic which is one of the most toxic element found in groundwater the more toxic form as iii was as well effectively oxidized under wide range of ph in a pilot plant by using ozone microbubbles in both ammonia and arsenic oxidation the intensive generation of radicals by the ozone mnbs enabled the removal under acidic condition in a study for the wastewater treatment using ozone micro nano bubbles deessiree et al 2019 reported 90 2 and 92 5 bod and cod removal from hospital wastewater through ozone air micro nano bubbles treatment in another study the concentration of tce in groundwater showed significant reduction during the ozone micro nano bubbles treatment and an overall removal of 99 was reached after six days 35 furthermore industrial wastewater which contained high salinity concentration was chosen as the target contaminant and the treatment efficiency by ozone mnbs was studied ozone mnbs showed significant treatment effect on wastewater with high salinity with the cod decreasing 63 after the 14 h treatment the quantity and size of the mnbs affect their mass transfer efficiency larger amounts of the mnbs result in larger total surface area and increases the mass transfer flux from bubbles to solution and smaller bubble size results in higher internal pressure and larger specific area 29 benazir and jhonny 2017 observed the reductions of thermotolelant coliforms presents in marine water the initial thermotolerant coliform concentration was 1400 cfu 100 ml after applying the air ozone micro nanobubbles the coliforms concentration was reduced to 56 cfu 100 ml in another study author reported the 95 degradation of methyl orange in tenth minute in surface water treatment ozone mnbs showed great oxidation ability in water treatment and groundwater remediation 3 ozone uv radiation o3 uv the advanced oxidation process with ozone and uv radiation is initiated by the photolysis of ozone the photodecomposition of ozone leads to hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical formation at uv radiation less than 310 nm as shown by the scheme 20 o 3 h 2 o h v h 2 o 2 o 2 the further reaction of ozone with hydrogen peroxide is considered to be very slow reaction with a rate constant of 6 5 10 2 m 1s 1 21 o 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 o h o 2 in addition hydrogen peroxide on photolysis by uv radiation produces two hydroxyl radicals also the hydrogen peroxide undergoes in acid base equilibrium reaction pk 11 65 to form one h3o and peroxyl anion ho2 22 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 23 h 2 o 2 h 2 o h 3 o h o 2 in chain propagation reaction both ozone and hydrogen peroxide reacts with the hydroxyl radical to form the peroxyl ho2 and superoxide radicals o2 with rate constant of 1 1 108 m 1s 1 and 2 7 107 m 1s 1 respectively 24 o h o 3 o 2 h o 2 25 o h h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o h the superoxide radical reacts with hydroxyl radical in a propagation reaction scheme to yield hydroxyl ion oh rate constant of1 1010 m 1s 1 at ph 7 9 26 o h o 2 o h o 2 hydroxyl radical even reacts with hydroxyl ion to yield o rate constant of1 3 1010 m 1s 1 on the other side the superoxide radical again reacts with ozone to form o3 k 1 6 109 m 1s 1 which further yields hydroxyl radical and hydroxyl ion during propagation reaction at alkaline ph with rate constant value of 9 4 107 m 1s 1 27 o h o h h 2 o o 28 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 29 o 3 h 2 o o h o h o 2 in chain reaction ozone reacts with peroxyl ion and results in superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical formation k 5 5 106 m 1s 1 30 o 3 h o 2 o 2 o h o 2 in a termination step hydroxyl peroxyl and superoxide radicals on recombination form hydrogen peroxide which can be photolyzed again and under an excess concentration of hydrogen peroxide the scavenging reaction becomes predominant the rate constants of recombination steps are 8 3 105 m 1s 1 4 2 109 m 1s 1 and 9 7 107 m 1s 1 respectively 31 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 32 o h o h h 2 o 2 33 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 o 2 o h under an excess of h2o2the scavenging reaction may start as follows k 5 109 m 1s 1 34 o h h o 2 h 2 o o 2 this system contains three components to produce oh radicals or to oxidize the pollutants for subsequent reactions i e uv radiation ozone and hydrogen peroxide thus depending on the experimental conditions direct and indirect ozone reactions with the pollutant are possible also the combination of uv o3 and h2o2 can produce oh that contributes to overall results the oxidation results of methyl methacrylate mma in the aqueous solution by the o3 uv treatment after the reaction time of 30 min at o3 dose of 10 mg l uv with power of 35 96 w m2 resulted the removal of mma and cod were 96 and 22 respectively the degradation of cod could further increase to 51 in 120 min it is due to that the presence of the uv radiation would decompose the dissolved ozone concentration and accompany the generation of oh radicals simultaneously as the oh radicals have greater reactivity toward the organic compounds to enhance the mineralization 36 moreover mineralization of organic carbon present in the wastewater was also observed by other researchers 28 37 however the decolorization of azo dye took 11 min for both o3 as well as for o3 uv processes the two decolorization curves of o3and uv o3almost overlapped implying that the presence or absence of uv radiation hardly affects the decolorization rate thus it can be seen that the chemical structures of azo dyes affect the decolorization efficiency during o3 uv process 38 such a behavior was normally attributed to ph effect pillai et al 39 showed that there was a decrease of ph for the o3 uv system from initial value 8 5 6 9 at the end unlike single o3system which showed a more acidic ph of 4 5 as final in spite of the fact that the final ph of the o3 uv system was within the convenient range 4 9 for sufficient contribution from radical generation path 14 its failure to show remarkable improvement over the simple o3system could be associated with the intense coloration and strong absorption of the uv light by the chromospheres present in tpa terephthalic acid wastewater so that production of oh radical was blocked the application of o3 uv process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 2 4 ozone hydrogen peroxide o3 h2o2 in the last decades h2o2 has been widely used as an oxidant to remove the recalcitrant pollutants from the different industrial wastewater 43 44 the combined o3 h2o2 system provides better removal of organic contaminants because h2o2 accelerates the decomposition of ozone to form the hydroxyl radicals by the electron transfer mechanism as represented by the following equations the o3 h2o2 process known as the peroxone that includes the oxidation of pollutant by direct and indirect ozone reaction mechanism hydrogen peroxide reacts with ozone when present as an anion ho2 the reaction rate is dependent on the initial concentration of ozone hydrogen peroxide 35 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h p k a 11 8 36 h o 2 o 3 h o 2 o 3 k 2 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 the reaction of ozone with the undissociated hydrogen peroxide which would lead to a loss of ozone and hydrogen peroxide is negligible 37 h 2 o 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 10 2 m 1 s 1 the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and ozonide anion o3 produced in the above equation then enter the chain reaction of the indirect pathway to produce oh the overall reaction can be depicted as follows where two ozone molecule produce two oh 38 o 3 h 2 o 2 2 o h 3 o 2 h2o2 has a strong pollutant degradation ability even if present in a trace amount with ozone hydrogen peroxide not only increases the rate of reaction but also improves the wastewater quality but residual h2o2 is harmful for the microorganism and environment therefore ozonation process is suggested to combine with small amount of h2o2 that can improve the process efficiency by the production of hydroxyl free radical without any negative effect on the subsequent biological or tertiary treatment processes the reaction rate and the process efficiency of the combined o3 h2o2 system is higher than that of ozonation system alone although the h2o2 o3 ratio and ph of the treatment system should be deliberated carefully for the best performance of the combined system as the excess h2o2 starts scavenging the hydroxyl radicals thereby lowering the process efficiency in a similar context 45 46 reported 95 abatement of tetrachloro 1 3 butadienes tcbds and 40 abatement of hexa chloro 1 3 butadiene hcbd at the ozone dose of 0 5 mg land 4 mg lrespectively whereas on addition of h2o2 lower abatement efficiencies of the detected compounds observed due to the decreased ozone reactivity because of the fast transformation of ozone to hydroxyl radical by h2o2 it is due the scavenging of hydroxyl radical by added h2o2 and also reported the 8 increase of hydroxyl radical scavenging rate s 1 for h2o2 o3 2 0 w w and o3 2 0 mg l however the peroxone process was found to be more effective in color removal than the ozone alone process when h2o2 was added in ratios greater than 0 3 wt h2o2 wt o3 the 0 7 wt h2o2 wt o3 ratio was the optimum condition to remove color using uf filtered water this was likely due to the scavenging effect of oh which was consumed by excessive h2o2 concentrations yoon et al 2014 jiao et al 47 reported that with the increased concentration of h2o2nb nitrobenzene removal efficiency increased firstly and then decreased it is known from oxidation mechanism that hydroxyl radical oh plays a major role in oxidative degradation of organic matters 23 as presented in formulas 4 5 the decomposed intermediate product of h2o2 ho2 can react with ozone to promote oh generation thus to improve nb removal however when h2o2 concentration was higher than a certain value excess h2o2 would react with oh as formula 6 therefore oh concentration decreased and then nb removal efficiency decreased 39 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 40 h o 2 o 3 o h o o 2 41 h 2 o 2 o h h 2 o h o 2 whereas shokri et al 48 showed that the efficiency of the degradation of ot ortho toluidine was raised up to a plateau region with increase in initial dosage of h2o2 in this condition additional amount of hydrogen peroxide had no further effect because recombination of hydroxyl radicals happened with excess amounts of h2o2 the same results were also reported by others 49 50 chueca et al 2015 reported the inactivation of e coli in the peroxone system is led by an indirect pathway given that the combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide accelerates the decomposition of o3by h2o2and therefore favors the production of high energy hydroxyl radicals the presence of hydrogen peroxide is known to promote ozone decomposition to form hydroxyl radicals thus improving ozonation degradation and mineralization efficiency with this phenomenon several authors have reported the biodegradability enhancement of recalcitrant wastewater 49 51 guiju et al 2014 9 the application of o3 h2o2 process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 3 5 o3 electrocoagulation o3 ec the electrocoagulation ec process is defined as the degradation or removal of suspended solids colloidal material dissolved solids and metals from the water and wastewater by introducing the coagulant through electrochemical reactions ec reactor consists of electrolytic cell with one anode and cathode in ec operation when current is applied the electrode plates are sacrificed which are generally fe or al electrode thus increasing the concentration of metals ions in the solution these metals ions act as the destabilizing agent and neutralizes the particle charges thereby removes the pollutants from the wastewater either by coagulation and precipitation that can be removed further by floatation the following reactions takes place during the ec process at the anode 42 m s m a q n n e 43 2 h 2 o l 4 h a q o 2 g 4 e at the catode 44 m a q n n e m s 45 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 2 o h a q metal anode generates highly charged cations that destabilizes the charge of contaminants by the formation of polyvalent polyhdroxide complexes when electricity applied these complexes form the aggregates with the pollutants because of their high adsorption properties in addition when wastewater passed through the electric field contaminants may be removed by ionization hydrolysis electrolysis and free radical formation process 55 this process has been proven to be very effective in removing contaminants from water and is characterized by reduced sludge production no requirement of chemicals and ease of operation there are several parameters which affects the ec process efficiency such as electrode material electrode distance electrode arrangements ph current density reaction time wastewater conductivity temperature and reactor design however the single ec process is not found an effective method for the treatment of complex industrial wastewater coupling ec method with aops such as ozone is a promising technology for the removal of highly toxic organic and inorganic compounds from the wastewater the mechanism of electrocoagulation ozone process can be described by the following equations 46 o 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 47 o 3 h o 2 2 o 2 h o 48 o 3 m 2 m o 2 o 2 49 m o 2 h 2 o m 3 h o h o 50 m o 2 m 2 2 h 2 m 3 h 2 o ozone is a strong oxidant and reacts with the wastewater organics either directly as molecular ozone or indirectly through hydroxyl radical formation in ec ozonation process when ozone applied into the ec system the metal ions catalyzes the ozone decomposition to produce more hydroxyl radicals ozone directly reacts with the m2 to give the intermediate mo2 that further converted to hydroxyl radical in addition the ho2 radical formed during ozone decomposition recombines to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 where fenton or fenton like reaction can also takes place and improves the process efficiency by reacting with fe ii or fe iii species if the iron electrodes were used most studies have focused on the efficiency of a specific pollutant removal manipulating parameters such as conductivity ph current density electrode materials etc duringo3 ec process song et al 2016 reported that the decolorization efficiency clearly increased with the increase of ph from 2 0 10 0 and then dropped to 10 at ph 12 0 fe2 fe3 conversion can explain this result for the iron electrodes at high ph some of the hydroxide ions may be oxidized at the anode reducing the production of iron ions in addition fe oh 6 3 or fe oh 4 ions which lacks the capacity for decolorization 56 may be present at high ph these factors lead to reduced color removal efficiency at high ph whereas at lower ph values the main oxidant remains as molecular ozone rather than hydroxyl radicals formed from ozone decomposition molecular ozone has a lower oxidizing potential and are higher selective than hydroxyl radicals leading to a decolorization decrease 57 additionally the protons in the solution are reduced to h2at the cathode preventing the production of the hydroxide ions fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 which are disadvantageous for colorant precipitation and fe oh 3species may also be present under acidic conditions 56 the combined electrochemical ec er and ozonation treatment of grey wastewater gww has shown reduction in codt by 91 31 toc by 84 59 cods by 90 17 and doc by 82 11 indicating that process promotes sufficient production of coagulant agent and reactive oxygen species and consequently ensures higher removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from gww 58 the applied current density in the ec er cell causes an anodic dissolution of aluminum electrode into wastewater and a cathodic reduction of o2 the coagulant agent al oh 3produced in situ has a large surface area beneficial for a rapid adsorption of organic compounds and trapping of colloidal particles 59 61 furthermore the removal of organic compounds is mainly attributed to the direct and indirect oxidation mechanism h2o2electrochemically generated at the cathode is able to modify and oxidize the structure of non biodegradable organic particles 62 while the ozone contribution can be attributed to the electrophilic nature of the direct attack of o3molecule and the indirect attack via oh radicals generated in the ozonation process 63 current density and effluent concentration are important parameters for controlling the reaction rate in most of the hybrid electrochemical processes the combined effect of current density and effluent cod concentration on cod removal efficiency and power consumption were carried out by assaithambi et al 2016 and they have found that the cod removal efficiency was increased with an increase in current density at any value of effluent cod concentration due to the increased current density a larger amount of fe2 was produced via anodic metal dissolution causing coagulation and formation of more bubbles at the cathode causing flotation 64 the application of o3 ec process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 4 6 catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation process is classified as homogenous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process where ozone decomposition is catalyzed by transition metal ions and solid catalyst respectively which accelerates the ozone decomposition and hydroxyl radical formation 6 1 homogeneous catalytic ozonation the two mechanism are available in the literature for homogenous catalytic ozonation process to decompose ozone by transition metal ions 1 decomposition of ozone by metal ions leading to the generation of free radicals 72 74 2 complexes formation between organic molecule and the catalyst and subsequent oxidation of the complex 75 77 the most common used metal ions in homogenous catalytic ozonation process as an effective catalyst are mn ii fe iii fe ii co ii cu ii zn ii and cr iii 78 80 in general the presence of metals as catalyst exerted positive effect on the efficiency of ozonation process by generation more hydroxyl radicals than o3 alone the reaction mechanism of fe ii catalyzed ozonation process can be expressed as follows 51 o 3 h o 2 h o 2 52 o 3 h o 2 2 o 2 o h 53 f e 2 o 3 f e 3 o 3 54 o 3 h o 2 o h 55 f e 2 o 3 f e o 2 o 2 56 f e o 2 h 2 o f e 3 o h o h 57 f e 3 o 3 h 2 o f e o 2 o h o 2 h 58 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 59 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 60 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h the catalytic activity of fe ii with ozone has been inspected by several researchers to remove the various pollutants from the industrial wastewater table 5 ferrous is considered as the most promising homogenous metal catalyst because of low price leading to the low treatment cost also like fe iii it does not precipitate out as insoluble ferrous hydroxide fe oh 2 at higher ph 4 because of its highly soluble products ksp fe oh 3 3 10 39 ksp fe oh 2 8 10 16 the mineralization of dcp using catalytic ozonation process with mn2 as catalyst was studied where they have used dmpo as spin trap reagent to trap hydroxyl radicals fig 4 the presence of strong dmpo oh bond confirms the more hydroxyl radical formation during catalyzed ozonation process with mn2 and resulted in highest mineralization of dcp 69 also they have proposed the following dcp degradation mechanism using ozone alone and ozone with mn2 to improve the efficiency of ozonation process for bi enhancement of bmdww biomethanated distillery wastewater sameena et al 2019 has applied combination of ozone with fe2 as the addition of fe2 to ozone catalyzes the ozonation process by producing more hydroxyl free radicals leading to the enhanced rate of organic contaminant removal and mineralization where they have observed 3 5 fold increase in the biodegradability index bi of bmdww however further higher fe2 concentration has not resulted in significant increase in the bi values as the excess amount of fe2 starts consuming hydroxyl radicals resulting in the decreased process efficiency also zylan and ince 86 reported that feso4 was found to be more efficient for the degradation of ibp 84 ibp decay due to the formation of h 2 o 2 ho 2 pair as a result of reaction of fe2 with ozone which are distinctively more reactive than o3 despite of high catalytic activity of metal ions during ozonation process removal of metal ions from the treated water becomes mandatory and catalytic activity is limited to low concentration of metal ions up to several mg l table 5 these circumstances of homogenous catalytic ozonation process motivated the researchers to lead their research in the direction of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process which has becomes more popular in the present scenario the application of homogenous catalytic ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 5 6 2 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation metal oxides such as mno2 tio2 al2o3 feooh and ceo2 metals cu ru pt co on supports sio2 al2o3 tio2 ceo2 activated carbon and zeolites modified with metals are the most widely used catalyst in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process there are two possible mechanisms of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process either ozone decomposition on reduced oxidized form of metal deposited on the surface of a solid support or decomposition of ozone on lewis centers of the metal oxides however the efficiency of the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process depends on the several factors like ph of the solution catalyst and its surface properties therefore the mechanism of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process using different catalyst needs to be understand 6 2 1 metal oxides the removal of 2 methylisoborneol mib from drinking water using aluminum oxides γ alooh and γ al2o3 has been studied where 98 4 and 27 5 removal of mib was obtained in catalyzed ozonation by γ alooh and γ al2o3respectively the possible reaction mechanism of catalyzed ozonation by aluminum oxides was proposed and illustrated in fig 5 the adsorbed water molecule on the oxides surface dissociated intooh and h on introduction of hao and rao into the aqueous solution to form surface hydroxyl group the mib was then absorbed by the surface hydroxyl group on hao and hydroxyl radical formation inhibited due to the adsorption process during the catalytic ozone decomposition where the main reaction mechanism was solid surface domination reaction and generation of oh was solely due to the ozone decomposition these ozone and few oh further oxidize mib into co2 and h2o whereas the main reaction mechanism for mib decomposition using rao was hydroxyl radical reaction initially the mib was absorbed by the surface and the pores of rao the ozone decomposition initiated by surface hydroxyl group on rao to generate oh which oxidizes mib non selectively into co2 and h2o the higher removal efficiency of mib using rao during catalytic ozone decomposition is due to the more oh generation 87 in a study the degradation efficiency of cbz carbamazepine in single and catalytic ozonation process using fe3o4 ceo2 mwcnts as efficient catalyst was 50 3 and 64 1 after 4 min reaction this result implied that the production of hydroxyl radicals accelerated the removal rate with addition of catalyst 88 consequently the amount of catalyst played an important role in the catalytic ozonation process which influenced the volume of oh generated author have reported increased cod removal efficiency of tannery wastewater with an increase in the mn cu al2o3catalyst loading during catalytic ozonation process 89 this observation might be the result of increasing the quantity of the catalyst whereby the overall active surface area was enhanced therefore the availability of additional active sites on the catalyst surface led to an increase in the rate of oh production per unit of o3conversion many researchershave also reported that an increase in the catalyst quantity was of benefit for the degradation of organic pollutants 90 93 another point which has to be emphasized is the effect of ph on the activity of metal oxides during ozonation process it can be seen from the results reported by roshani et al 91 that the activity of mn al2o3decreases by the increase of ph from 2 to 7 4 whereas it increases by increasing the ph from 7 4 10 on the other hand cu al2o3experiences a maximum in toc removal by increasing the ph from 2 to 5 6 deionized water the activity of cu al2o3decreases by further increase of ph from 5 6 10 there are a number of factors such as the electronic properties of metal oxides pzc of the catalysts adsorption of btz by products on the surface of the catalyst and the mechanism of the reaction which influence the catalysts activity at different values of ph it is believed that the electronic properties and pzc of the catalysts are the most important parameters affecting toc removal in fact the surface charge of catalysts and the ability of catalysts to transfer electrons to ozone control the rate of toc removal ozone has electrophilic and nucleophilic nature which can interact with the catalyst surface at acidic or basic conditions by exchanging electrons with metal oxides this results in decomposition of ozone and generation of oh radicals necessary for toc removal however not all transition metal oxides are favorable in electron transfer with ozone at acidic or basic condition cu has limited formal oxidation states up to 4 limiting its ability to participate in the catalytic cycle at acidic or basic conditions this makes cu show the highest catalytic activity at ph near the pzc of cu al2o3which leads to the reaction of ozone with sur face hydroxyl groups to decompose ozone 34 on the other hand mn is an exceptional transition metal oxide which can exist at several oxidation state from 2 to 7 this gives an advantage to mn which can be active in a wide range of ph conditions by being able to receive or donate electrons to ozone at acidic and basic ph levels this capability of mn ensures that ozone can be decomposed by interacting with mn at all ph values at neutral ph the surface of mn is covered with stable hydroxyl groups with zero charge which are less effective in decomposition of ozone therefore it can be inferred that the difference in the ability of cu and mn to transfer electrons to ozone under different surface charges different solution ph is likely the main reason of observing different catalytic activity for cu al2o3and mn al2o3 furthermore it is worth considering that a significant catalyst load might initiate a series of issues such as difficulties with the separation and recovery of the catalyst and increased cost of wastewater treatment 6 2 2 metals on supports possible mechanisms of catalytic ozonation in the presence of metals on supports are presented in fig 6 94 ozone or hydroxyl radicals attacked the adsorbed organics on the catalyst surface to form oxidation products which desorb into the bulk solution in the first mechanism whereas ozone and organic molecules adsorb on the catalyst surface in the second mechanism ozone oxidizes the metal on the reduced metal catalyst surface to form oh radicals also the adsorbed organic molecules on the catalyst surface oxidize to give reduced catalyst mreda by an electron transfer reaction with the desorption of organic radical species from the catalyst ho or o3 further oxidizes the desorbed organic radical species in the bulk solution the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation in the presence of metals on support differs from the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation on metal oxides due to the no generation of hydroxyl free radicals instead the reaction takes place on the surface of the catalyst or the formation of complexes results in the catalytic effect 6 2 3 activated carbon the activated carbon acts as the both adsorbent and catalyst during ozonation process the effective decolorization and organic contaminant degradation by anozonation with activated carbon as catalyst has been reported in many studies table 6 although use of activated carbon has many disadvantages such as activated carbon easily get saturated and regeneration or even replacement is required for further effective removal of pollutants the combination of activated carbon with ozone was found to be an attractive method for industrial wastewater treatment activated carbon accelerates the generation of hydroxyl radicals by anozone transformation during catalytic process the hydroxyl radicals formed are free to react with the organic compounds in the aqueous phase and not bound to the surface of activated carbon the efficiency of activated carbon to produce hydroxyl radical by decomposing ozone is mainly dependent on the surface properties of the carbon the basal plane electrons and basic oxygenated surface groups chromene and pyrones acts as the lewis base are responsible for the ozone decomposition the active species oh ions and h2o2 formed during reduction of ozone on the surface of the activated carbon initiates the decomposition of ozone in aqueous phase the lewis base basic lewis sites are located at π electron rich regions chromenes and pyrones reacts with h2o and forms the electron donor acceptor complexes as follows 99 61 c π 2 h 2 o c π h 3 o o h the π electron acts as the catalytic center of reaction and reduces ozone to hydroxyl ion and hydrogen peroxide 62 o 3 h 2 o 2 e o 2 2 o h catalytic decomposition of ozone by activated carbon depends to a great

formed that lowers the catalytic decomposition of ozone however ph 6 hydroxyl radicals are formed as a result of adsorption of ozonide and atomic oxygen on the catalyst surface the catalytic ozonation of heavy oil refining wastewater horw was investigated over activated carbon supported iron oxides fac catalysts using activated carbon ac as the reference 100 accordingly the increased cod removal efficiency in fac ozone system primarily resulted from enhanced catalytic ozonation which indicated that iron oxide can improve surface active sites transform more ozone into secondary oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals certainly surface fe active sites in fac catalyst were increased with iron content increasing on activated carbon however overloaded iron can enhance ac surface area covering which inevitably lead to some loss of non fe surface active sites originally presented in ac 100 apart from activated carbon other forms of carbon such as multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts carbon xerogels and carbon nanofibers cnfs have been shown to have the potential to be effective solutions as a catalyst for the ozonation process for the wastewater treatment the modification of the surface properties of carbon materials have been known to influence their catalytic properties in particular the presence of surface heteroatoms such as oxygen sulfur and nitrogen has been shown to significantly affect the catalytic activity of carbon materials in catalytic ozonation the application of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 6 6 2 4 photo catalyzed ozonation the photocatalytic oxidation has been widely studied for wastewater treatment and many review papers were published 101 102 ozonation in combination with photocatalyst results in a new advanced oxidation method known as photocatalytic ozonation which has a different mechanism of oxidation from ozonation process due to the presence of photocatalyst 102 photocatalytic process is based on the production of photoactivated electron hole pair by exciting the surface of the photocatalyst using uv vis radiationin an aqueous medium simultaneously ozone molecule adsorbs on the photocatalyst surface resulting in the generation of active oxygen radicals which leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals on reaction with water

required for the generation of hydroxyl radical in the presence of oxygen 103 the photo catalyzed ozonation process was reported to be effective for the degradation of monochloroacetic acid and dimethyl 2 2 2 trichloro l hydroxyethylphosphonate dep present in water with smaller effect on phenolic compounds degradation suggested that the photocatalysts are more effective for hydrophilic compounds degradation as compared to aromatic compounds 104 the considerable enhancement in the degradation efficiency of n compounds such as such as alkylamines alkanolamines heterocyclic and aromatic n compounds has been reported using combined photo catalysis and ozonation process as compared to either photo catalysis or ozonation alone 105 the photo catalyzed ozonation process for the degradation of natural organic matter nom in ground water has been studied where the ozonation process catalyzed with tio2resulted in a higher degree of total organic matter content reduction in the course of catalytic ozonation in an acidic medium ozone as an electron donor is coordinated to the acidic sites on the catalyst surface ti4 ozone decomposition at the sites of lewis acid on the metal surface leads to the formation of o radicals which are more reactive than ozone itself and favor nom oxidation by an indirect mechanism via o radical jelena et al 2012 the effect of ph on the o3 tio2 gac process was studied from 3 0 9 0 by ferreiro et al 106 or the treatment of genotoxic aniline wastewater because this range is closely related to the ionic species in solution considering the aniline dissociation pka 80 c 6 h 5 n h 2 a q h 2 o c 6 h 5 n h 3 a q o h a q p k a 4 61 the concentration of anilinium cations is negligible at ph 4 61 consequently the reaction rate is expected to increase under basic conditions which is also enhanced by a parallel increase in hydroxyl radical generation conversely at acidic ph below 4 61 the greater presence of anilinium cations and a positively charged catalyst surface would justify a significant reduction in the degradation rate thus the overall reactivity of aniline towards ozone increases from 5 9 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 1 5 to 1 4 10 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 in a study for photo catalyzed ozonation process negligible toc removal obtained when ozone applied alone whereas the application of tio2 catalyzed ozonation process resulted in 60 toc removal with complete decolorization of textile effluent 107 the application of photo catalyzed ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 6 7 nano catalyzed ozonation in this process nanomaterials are used as catalyst during ozonation process to produce more hydroxyl radicals to degrade the organic contaminant present in the wastewater the materials having particle size 100 nm known as the nanomaterials nanomaterials posses different surface properties compared to their parent molecule as a consequence of increased surface area due to the small particle size several studies have been reported the successful application of nanomaterials such as nanoparticles nano powder and nano membranes for wastewater treatment the high specific surface area to volume mass ratio fast dissolution high reactivity strong sorption supermagenatism quantum confinement effect and localized surface plasmon resonance improves the adsorption property of sorbent materials thereby increasing the process efficiency the studied nanoparticles are mainly fe3o4 mgo nanocomposite made of two or more different materials zero valent iron etc table 8 the use of nanomaterials in combination with ozone is a promising option for wastewater treatment due to its easy application high reactivity and high efficiency gholamreza and maryam 2009 have reported the degradation and biodegradability improvement of reactive red 198 azo dye using catalytic ozonation with mgo nanocrystals they reported increased cod and color removal at alkaline ph which is due to the increased availability of hydroxide ion and enhanced ozone decomposition resulted in the formation of more hydroxyl and mgo hydroxyl radicalsand proposed the following mechanism 81 o 3 m g o s m g o s o 3 82 m g o s o 3 m g o s o o 2 83 m g o s o h 2 o o 3 m g o s o h 3 o h o 2 the suffix s in mgo s denotes the lewis acid site on the surface of mgo where mgo acts as the initiator for radical formation in the aqueous solution and decomposition of ozone takes place on the surface of mgo to form active radicals in the last decade nzvi has been widely used for the degradation of hazardous recalcitrant contaminants present in the groundwater and wastewater due to its high surface area and reactivity the addition of nzvi to the ozonation system improves the efficiency of the oxidation process by producing more hydroxyl radicals as there are two extra electrons per fe atom to form the oh radical that can be explained by the following reactions 108 sameena et al 2019 84 f e 0 2 o 3 2 o 3 f e 2 85 f e 2 o 3 o 3 f e 3 86 o 3 h o 2 o h in a similar study the phenolphthalein degradation using zero valent iron nanoparticles in combination of ozone reported 98 removal of phenolphthalein and and suggested the increased phenolphthalein degradation is because of the addition of nzvi 108 catalytic ozonation treatment of fluoxetine was carried out using different doses of nano γ alumina catalyst increasing dosage of the nano catalyst from 0 0 1 g l 1 enhanced gradually the removal efficiency of fluoxetine the reason is that applying a higher amount of catalyst provides more active sites for physical adsorption of ozone and results in increased ozone decomposition into oh radicals also ratio of hydroxyl radical to molecular ozone concentrations increases whereas at low concentrations of the catalyst efficiency of fluoxetine removal reduces with increased concentration of fluoxetine in water media since the oxidation process is dominated by direct mechanism developed using the existing ozone molecules abbas et al 2018 it has been reported by rahimi et al 109 that increased ph increased the efficiency of dye removal from 61 at ph 4 78 at ph 10 about 16 while the highest efficiency of dye removal in catalytic ozonation process with magnetic carbonaceous nanocomposite as catalyst was achieved at ph 8 95 since the structural properties of the pollutants will change with ph and the effect of ph on the catalytic degradation can be explained as electrostatic interaction between target contaminant and the catalyst surface properties that measured by phzpc ph at zero point charge 110 hence during the oxidation process the ph of solution and the phzpc of catalyst are the important factors that affect the contaminant treatment mechanism 111 in this case the phzpc of catalyst was 7 7 that indicated that the catalyst surface has basic properties and these basic functional groups located on the surface of the catalyst are thought to be responsible for ozone decomposition resulting in the generation of reactive radical species and better oxidation of recalcitrant colored contaminants 112 the application of nanocatalytic ozonation process for industrial wastewater treatment in recent years is depicted in table 7 8 limitations of hybrid processes ozonation used both as a standalone technological process and in combination with other oxidation processes offers a high effectiveness of oxidation of a variety of organic contaminants however ozone is a strong oxidant it can be hazardous to handle moreover leakage corrosion and excess ozone gas treatment which may lead to frequent operation and maintenance of ozone contact tanks and pipping also the treatment costs of ozone and hybrid ozonation technologies were expensive and not feasible the generation of secondary pollutants during treatment of effluents using hybrid process is a big problem these secondary pollutants can be more toxic and hazardous to the further treatment stages as compared to the parent pollutant which indicates the need of monitoring of intermediate compounds and selection of the optimal method for the treatment in nano catalysed ozonation process the nanoparticles used have been produced mainly using chemical methods which have the disadvantage to use expensive and or toxic reagents and to produce undesirable by products 9 benefits of hybrid processes ozone has been successfully used in a vast number of applications ranging from producing drinking water to treating wastewater as well as in many chemical industrial systems such as textile distillery and pulp and paper processing etc unfortunately due to the low degradation efficiency and mass transfer limitation of ozonation process hybrid ozonation processes have been studied and is particularly attractive for wastewater treatment because hybrid ozonation processes can destroy most hazardous organic contaminants such as dyes phenolic compounds pesticides organochlorides pharmaceutical and ammonium compounds a major drawback of ozonation processes is the high operation cost caused by the installation of an expensive ozone generation unit and the cost of electricity application of hybrid ozonation process overcomes this drawback of ozonation process to some extent by the degradation of contaminants present in the wastewater at higher rate with greater efficiency the catalyzed ozonation process using metals such as iron does not lead to the generation of sludge at any ph in the range of 3 7 and this represents another advantage of the hybrid process the application of iron nanoparticles coupled with ozonation improves the mass transfer in the system which results in a faster process able to react in a wide range of ph the easy application high reactivity low solubility in water non toxicity and efficiency of nanoparticles makes it a promising option for the wastewater treatment the recent development of ozone micro nano bubbles technology offers great advantage as it reduces the doses of ozone and reaction time required to degrade the same extent of contaminant due to its longer lifespans as well as high specific areas that apparently can reduce the operational and capital cost of hybrid ozonation process and makes it more feasible and sustainable technology for future application 10 economic aspects of hybrid ozonation processes despite the efficacy of hybrid ozonation process and its synergistic effects on the decomposition of pollutants in water and wastewater economic aspects must also be considered comparing ozonation process which consumes electricity for ozone generation to hybrid ozonation process which requires supplementary electrical energy and chemicals addition at first glance hybrid ozonation systems appear to be more expensive than simple ozonation process and may not be economically admissible however a better cost assessment of these oxidation techniques for wastewater treatment could be determined by evaluating the specific energy consumption for each oxidation system where the energy consumed during the oxidation process is apportioned to the amount of decomposed materials yunho et al 2016 reported that the required energy for the degradation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma present in municipal wastewater was e 0 158 kw h m 3 for the uv h2o2 e 0 095 kw h m 3 for the o3 h2o2 e 0 126 kw h m 3 for the o3 uv and e 0 176 kw h m 3 for the o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 whereas for o3 it was e 0 25 kw h m 3 these combined processes require less energy compared to o3alone at the same micropollutant abatement levels due to the higher energy efficiency of ozonation and the synergism of combined treatment similarly pillai et al 39 have shown that specific energy consumption for the treatment of terephthalic acid wastewater using ozone alone o3 uv assisted ozonation o3 uv h2o2and uv assisted ozonation o3 h2o2 uv and fe2 catalyzed ozonation o3 fe2 was31 3 kw h m 3 58 6 kw h m 3 32 1 kw h m 3 and 21 3 kw h m 3 respectively where the degradation efficiency in terms of cod removal was 43 53 45 and 47 respectively which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of catalyzed ozonation process o3 fe2 likewise in terms of power consumed per amount of treated pollutant aziz et al 65 ascertained that the ozone electrocoagulation system had the highest power consumption in order to achieve 100 cod removal from the distillery effluent but only 18 75 cod removal efficiency was obtained with single ozonation process however azbar et al 40 compared various advanced oxidation processes and chemical treatment methods for cod and color removal from a polyester and acetate fiber dyeing effluent and found that treatment cost for simple ozonation process was 5 28 m 3 compared to 6 38 m 3 for o3 uv process whereas it was lowest of 0 07 m 3 for chemical methods such as feso4 7h2o based upon these studies it appears that depending on parameters such as pollutant properties concentration of ozone and pollutant experimental variables reactor design etc hybrid ozonation can be more cost effective than single ozonation process in the oxidation of some pollutants under optimum operational conditions but this conclusion cannot be generalized for all cases 11 conclusions and recommendations this review has shown principles advantages and limitations as well as the performances and some of the successful applications of hybrid ozonation process in removal of organic and inorganic pollutants decolorization and disinfection in water and wastewater the intense hydroxyl radical generation as a result of combined effect of hybrid process enables effective removal of the pollutants in a wide range of ph and the highly improved ozone utilization related to efficient mass transfer make the technology sustainable though the hybrid methods are not economically viable techniques to degrade large quantum of effluent disposed by the industries therefore it is desirable to use hybrid ozonation process for partial degradation of recalcitrant or biodegradability enhancement of wastewater so that it can be further treated using biological methods and making the process economically feasible these hybrid methods expected to reduce the reactor size and decrease the operating cost however the oxidants added during the pretreatment should be completely eliminated before subjecting to the biological treatment as they may act as inhibitors to the microorganism the existing applications and lab scale research works on the kinetic reaction of the technology illustrate the promising potential applicability of these hybrid processes in industries however there is no published study on the actual amount of energy saved by using hybrid processes over the other conventional treatment methods therefore study considering the additional energy consumption in degrading the pollutants using hybrid processes should be conducted to reach on a perceptible comparison the hybrid ozonation process showed high efficiency in the removal of contaminants from the wastewater but the removal mechanism has not yet been ascertained for most of the pollutants hence the major attention should be devoted in the future on the identification of reaction intermediates development of rate expressions based on established reaction mechanisms identification of scale up parameters and criteria for cost effectiveness although a systematic procedure consisted on using model substances and evaluating toxicity and biodegradability during and after the degradation process the assessment of chemical parameters overall such as cod and more accurate such as chromatography is usually reported it is necessary to carry out the more pilot plant scale experiments with real industrial wastewater from the industrial application point of view more studies on how system characteristics enhance or limit the individual and global efficiencies and eventually the overall treatment cost must be performed furthermore competition for the chemical oxidant by the contaminants and multiple substrate kinetics for the hybrid process must be studied in addition to the experimental and modeling work the aspect most lacking in hybrid process for the treatment of hardly biodegradable specific industrial wastewater is the performance of complete economic studies which could present this innovative technology as a cost competitive one moreover the use of solar energy could improve the treatment efficiency of these technologies and could be a more economic solution for the wastewater treatment and recycle declaration of competing interest the paper presents a detailed review of hybrid ozonation process as a combination of two different techniques to enhance the hydroxyl radical formation thereby increasing the process efficiency an extensive review on the mechanism and application of these hybrid ozonation processes for degradation

micronutrients such as zn cr cu and fe play a vital role in activation of various metabolic pathways of microorganism 1 significant reduction of cod from 66 to 78 66 was observed in treatment of distillery spent wash dsw diluted with sewage wastewater sww 22 after bacterial pretreatment in the mfc the wastewater pw1 was fed into a photobioreactor for microalgae cultivation and simultaneous reduction in pollution load in general microalgae have the potential to consume nutrients and co2 for its growth and thus reduce the pollution load from wastewater t indica removed about 70 42 of nitrate and 78 8 of phosphate respectively in 16 days of cultivation period from pw1 during this period 67 61 of cod and 84 03 of toc were also removed fig 3b the maximum reduction in the

mohan 16 reported removal of 74 cod and 67 of nitrate from pharmaceutical wastewater with microalgae however they used pretreated wastewater in sequential batch reactor for microalgae cultivation in the present study overall reduction of nitrate phosphate toc and cod has been observed as 81 60 94 87 97 05 and 90 29 respectively in first phase of experiment as shown in fig 3d abou shanab et al 23 obtained highest reduction in nitrogen phosphorus and inorganic carbon as 62 28 and 29 by c mexicana in piggery wastewater in the second phase of experiment the raw wastewater from pharmaceutical industry was directly treated with t indica in photobioreactor for removal of pollutants and production of microalgal biomass from pw2 during microalgal treatment of wastewater nitrates are converted to organic nitrogen or reduce to elemental nitrogen and lost as gas 24 the maximum removal of nitrate and phosphate from pw2 were 67 173 and 70 03 respectively in 21 days along with 78 14 of toc reduction fig 3c microalgae assimilate phosphate in orthophosphate h2po4 or hpo4 or inorganic form for its metabolic activities through assimilation process during growth cycle of microalgae various inorganic nitrogen compounds are converted to organic nitrogen containing compounds such as chlorophylls enzymes and proteins carbon and nitrogen play vital role in the microalgal cell growth phosphorus is another important nutrient which is responsible for metabolic activities in the growth of microalgae and leading to the formation of lipid proteins and various intermediates of carbohydrates t indica removed about 66 3 cod from pw2 microalgae can exploit nutrients and carbon source for its growth leading to biological remediation of wastewater maximum reduction of

associated with photosynthesis process in all green plants cl and mn play vital roles in o2 evolution fe is an important element which is responsible for respiratory e transport chain and photosynthetic pathway therefore microalgae consume all these of micronutrients present in wastewater during their metabolic activities at the time of cultivation 25 ji et al 26 obtained 0 197 0 203

myristic acid pentacyclic acid palmitic acid margaric acid oleic acid linoleic acid alpha linolenic acid and eicosanoic acid as shown in fig 5 the presence of palmitic acids and oleic acids shows the high quality of biodiesel in the present study high quality of biodiesel was obtained with the presence of more than 50 palmitic and oleic acid in total fame composition saponification value sv

warming due to the increasing co2 concentration in environment has created an alarming situation in search of sustainable renewable energy sources algal biofuel has been found to be one the of most promising source of clean energy 1 microalgal biomass has significant potential in the field of biodiesel production due to the ability to grow in critical conditions higher lipid productivity in comparison to other oleaginous plants less incubation period less land requirement fast generation time and higher photosynthesis efficiency 2 4 microalgae are well recognized for biological treatment of wastewater and have ability to grow in nutrient rich wastewater consequently leading to reduction in pollution load maintenance of carbon neutrality and environmental sustainability 5 6 microalgal treatment of wastewater is a fast prominence approach due to its capability to uptake the organics and nutrients by heterotrophic mixotrophic mode coupled with higher biomass production park et al

14047,aluminium sulphate is the commonest and most widely used coagulant for water treatment worldwide aluminium is a well known adsorbent for phosphorous p a nutrient highly associated with eutrophication in most water bodies thus this paper provides a review on p adsorption from aqueous media using alum sludge waste material generated by water treatment plants that use aluminium sulphate as sole coagulant a meta analysis of data on characteristics of various alum sludges was done the hindrance factors and adsorption capacities under varying operating conditions are presented including future direction it is evident from literature survey that there is the emerging shift from reuse and recycling of raw alum sludge towards synthesis of value added alum sludge based adsorbents possibilities to improve efficacy as both filter media and adsorbent but at the same time reducing metal leaching are highlighted value added products may also offer an added advantage of acting as source of phosphorous for possible reuse in agricultural soils keywords adsorbent alum sludge phosphorous removal wastewater treatment eutrophication 1 introduction phosphorous is regarded as the key element causing eutrophication in freshwater bodies 1 3 the major sources of phosphorus in surface waterbodies are municipal wastewater industrial discharges and manure from livestock production as well as runoff from agricultural lands 2 4 5 eutrophication is characterized by algal blooms and numerous other problems for example clogging of water treatment process filters bad odour and taste to drinking water animal and human health issues ecological and economic challenges 2 3 effective control of phosphorous additions to waters is thus a fundamental step towards controlling eutrophication and its effects on the environment economy and people biological chemical and physical methods are currently being used to reduce or remove phosphorous from wastewater prior to discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants 6 7 biological methods such as the enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr have wide usage and can achieve almost 100 p removal albeit inconsistently 8 biological methods are also less effective at low influent p concentrations as the metabolism of responsible microorganisms becomes starved biological treatment operations require strict control to ensure optimum aeration and tend to be land and energy intensive 8 chemical treatment is also widely used and includes the use of metal salts such as iron fe calcium ca and aluminium to act as coagulants that precipitate the phosphorous major drawbacks with chemical treatment methods include possible secondary pollution excessive amounts of resultant sludge the need to neutralize ph and high operating costs due to variable dosing 9 physical methods that can be employed include reverse osmosis membrane bioreactors and electrodialysis but these are either too expensive or inefficient 5 membrane bioreactors have smaller ecological footprint and are able to achieve low p discharge limits 10 nevertheless membrane fouling is a critical challenge which reduces the lifespan of the filters and increase energy requirements for sludge recirculation making the whole process inefficient physical adsorption is also another method findings from a review by huang et al 11 indicate that several authors agree that physical methods are more effective than the former this is because of inherent low costs high adsorption capacity or removal efficiency fast adsorption rates especially at low p levels renewability ease of operation and no secondary pollution 11 accordingly p adsorption has been tried for p recovery and reuse as will be shown in this paper however adsorption of p can be hampered by the effect of solution ph as well as the characteristics of the adsorbent among other challenges to be highlighted in the following sections therefore it is important to find optimal and suitable adsorbents that can remove phosphorous from wastewater effectively and efficiently cost effectively and in an environmentally friendly manner aluminium al as an element is well known to possess a strong affinity for phosphorous 12 13 most water treatment plants in the world use aluminium sulphate or just alum al2 so4 3 14h2o for water clarification this is because alum is the cheapest and simplest aluminium based flocculent available 14 alum sludges are the inevitable resultant waste product generated from the water treatment processes that use alum as sole coagulant 15 it follows then that alum sludges are the most widely generated and locally available water treatment waste around the world at low or no cost at all but are normally thrown away 16 18 it is now widely acknowledged that aluminium in alum sludge can be beneficially reused to remove phosphorous from wastewater 16 17 19 20 as a result alum sludges present a big source of aluminium in the form of aluminium hydroxide al oh 3 18 21 22 the reuse of alum sludge is in line with the current research focus in the world on finding low cost alternative adsorbents for pollutant removal in the environment 9 13 18 20 23 historically alum sludges were perceived to be inert waste material with little value for reuse 24 as a result alum sludges have traditionally been discharged into aquatic systems 25 26 later the wastes were deemed toxic to aquatic life owing to the inherent high amounts of aluminium and so lately they have been landfilled or incinerated after drying 16 17 where they are landfilled the related costs are thus factored into the tap water costs and ultimately borne by the consumers such that tap water costs become exorbitant 27 landfilling is also constrained by land use public concerns and more stringent environmental regulations 28 incineration is also expensive produces greenhouse gases and other toxic compounds like dioxins and furans ash tends to be laden with heavy metals while its disposal entails extra costs and generally incineration is poorly acceptable to the public and only works efficiently for sludges with low moisture content 28 measures to deal with alum sludges have been evolving over the years in a review by babatunde and zhao 29 three broad categories of the past and present uses of drinking water treatment sludges were identified as their use in wastewater treatment processes use as building and construction materials and for land application reviews have been done for each of these three possible applications but generalizing on the type of water treatment sludge the reviews have been on all kinds of drinking water treatment sludges including those from water treatment plants that use fe or ca or other forms of coagulants other than aluminium sulphate 19 30 31 the review by ippolito et al 30 looked at phosphate adsorption by various adsorbents that also included alum sludge albeit no specification as to the source of al coagulant dassanayake et al 19 focused on the use of alum sludges for agriculture not for wastewater treatment this present review is focusing specifically on 1 alum sludge but with special emphasis on its capacity as adsorbent for phosphorous removal from aqueous systems such as water and wastewater and 2 on aluminium sulphate coagulant based alum sludges only the other al salts for example polyaluminium chloride pac are not as common as aluminium sulphate it is important to note that the term alum sludge is also loosely used to denote waste from water treatment plants that use al salts other than alum 16 17 32 this review paper uses the term alum sludge referring to aluminium sulphate based drinking water treatment wastes in terms of applications this present review is focused only on the use of aluminium sulphate coagulant based alum sludge in aqueous wastewater systems previous reviews on alum sludges have been looking at applications as adsorbent for phosphorous contained in soil surface runoff and biosolids applied on land for agricultural reasons 19 30 the review by haynes 31 looked at the use of various industrial wastes water treatment sludges included as media and filter bed in constructed wetlands to remove phosphorous and metals babatunde et al 33 and yang et al 18 reviewed the use of dewatered alum sludge in constructed wetlands as substrate and filter and how these kinds of emerging constructed wetlands can be a sustainable move for wastewater treatment babatunde et al 33 was focusing on ireland alone such that the findings do not reflect a global perspective while yang et al 18 also looked at other kinds of substrates besides alum sludge this current review thus focuses on the control of phosphorous p emissions in various aqueous wastewater systems using alum sludge from water treatment plants that use aluminium sulphate as sole coagulant 2 materials and methods the review was conducted by way of literature search from scholarly databases mainly google scholar and sciencedirect in august 2017 finalized and consolidated in august 2018 the study was focusing on alum sludges from water treatment processes that use aluminium sulphate and not some other kinds of al based coagulants such as pac the terms alum sludge drinking water treatment residual alum residuals residues were used repeatedly in combination using boolean and or with a variety of search terms that included phosphorous adsorption phosphate adsorption phosphate phosphorous adsorption mechanism morphology phosphate phosphorous adsorption characteristics phosphate phosphorous desorption regeneration recovery kinetics thermodynamics factors affecting and phosphate phosphorous adsorption applications uses and wastewater treatment the boolean operator and was also used to search for other issues eutrophication repeated using different terms nutrients phosphorous or phosphates activation of alum sludge or residual calcination of alum sludge or residual composite materials and synthesis and phosphate phosphorous adsorption eutrophication is an old and widely researched problem from years back hence there was no restriction to the year of publication especially looking at factors contributing towards its occurrence there was no restriction to the year of publication or geographic location of studies done on reuse of alum sludges to ensure that different kinds of this waste product are evaluated the only critical selection criteria for papers to incorporate were those researches on p adsorption in aqueous solutions using alum sludges generated from water treatment plants that use aluminium sulphate as coagulant about 22 papers specifically on alum sludge as an adsorbent for p in aqueous solutions were accessed however researches looking at aluminium hydroxides were also used to allow for comparison as well as those from other kinds of adsorbents or materials such as ferric sludges activated carbons among others papers that also incorporated alum sludge for adsorbing phosphates but in different media for example soil were also used for comparison or inference up to 195 papers were accessed using the above search terms but around 135 papers were actually used in the development of this review paper 3 characteristics of alum sludges 3 1 physical structure although sludge quality varies from plant to plant the basic constituents are the same 24 34 table 1 gives the general characteristics of alum sludges from various water treatment plants from around the world the wide standard deviations indicate the variations in alum sludges of alum sludges generated by individual water treatment plants thus it would be misleading and difficult to conclude or give typical umbrella figures for such parameters without specifying the water treatment plant being referred to in the same vein the removal efficiencies of different water treatment plant sludges for various pollutants found in the environment will differ it will be equally difficult to recommend universal beneficial reuse applications for water treatment sludges before evaluation of the characteristics and phosphorous adsorption capacity for a specific sludge alum sludges are bulky and gelatinous particularly before dewatering 35 dewatered alum sludge has an amorphous structure and rough surface according to observations using powder x ray diffraction pxrd and scanning electron microscopy techniques 21 25 36 41 oxalate aluminium is a characteristic that represents amorphous structured aluminium hydroxide which is strongly related with phosphorous immobilization 35 42 the average oxalate aluminium and total aluminium values calculated by this research from the three studies that determined oxalate al in addition to total al were almost the same total al 102 8 13 3 vs oxalate al 95 7 4 9 38 39 43 this further confirmed that alum sludges are predominantly amorphous this probably explains why most researchers thereafter have focused on just total al instead of adding the oxalate form since results from the three studies done in 2007 have turned out to be almost the same other studies confirm that the amorphous nature of alum sludges is a result of the inherent non crystalline aluminium hydroxide which gives the alum sludge an increased specific surface area and the subsequent increased chemical affinity for phosphorous 12 46 using the standard nitrogen brunauer emmett teller bet surface area the average of the surface area results in literature gave an average specific surface area of 121 8 95 3 m2 g for alum sludge table 1 a surface area less than 10 m2 g indicates a non porous structure 23 the specific surface area of alum sludge is directly related to the number of hydroxide sites available for adsorption 53 this implies that in order to increase efficacy of alum sludges as an adsorbent it is important to boost its hydroxide sites as one measure to improve specific surface area high specific surface area is a prerequisite for a good adsorbent 54 57 haynes 31 explained that size shape and porosity of particles determine surface area and the larger the surface area the greater the surface for adsorption to take place 31 most alum sludges have been found to be dominated by fine particles 18 27 47 fine particle sizes are good as they render a greater surface area for adsorption but they also present the challenge of possible clogging in practice when used as a filter media given that wastewater will contain a myriad of solids research would be necessary to develop alum sludge based materials that balance between sizes of particles for adsorption and improved hydraulic conductivity that aids in the passage of water and other materials without risk of clogging although alum sludges are comparable to conventional commercial adsorbents such as activated alumina and activated carbon in terms of dominant particle and pore size surface area greater than 10 m2 g and amorphous morphology measured average specific surface area is considerably low 121 1 98 3 m2 g than that of either of the commercial adsorbents activated alumina has a surface area ranging 200 300 g m2 while activated carbons can range from 600 2000 g m2 54 58 59 3 2 chemical properties elemental analysis is widely done using inductively coupled plasma atomic optical emission spectrometer icp aes oes x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds 1 34 60 62 total aluminium in alum sludge accounts for about 16 of the proportion of chemical composition widely distributed across studies and averaging 161 2 120 2 g kg table 1 fig 1 other elements inherent in alum sludge that influence its adsorption of phosphorous include ca sio4 2 fe cl so4 2 and humic acids measured as total organic carbon toc and also exhibit wide variations these organic and inorganic elements are those removed from the raw water as well as contained in the coagulants despite the dominance of al in alum sludges a study by gibbons and gagnon 50 revealed that in comparison to other residuals such as lime or ferric based alum residuals contained the least concentration of the primary element on a molar basis this finding implied that alum residuals may not be the best and efficient residual for use as adsorbent for phosphorous on a commercial basis however it should be emphasized again that aluminium sulphate being the most widely used coagulant in the world for water treatment gives rise to alum residuals which inevitably become the commonest waste product available compared to these other residuals the research focus is now moving towards the synthesis of value added products with superior qualities compared to the parent raw materials 28 60 62 4 characteristics of phosphorous adsorption by alum sludges 4 1 adsorption capacity of alum sludges for phosphorous results in table 2 show that adsorption capacity for phosphorous is noticeably different and wide ranging 2 43 mg p g alum sludge from one treatment plant to another or from one experiment to another other previous reviews also noted this pattern 19 30 most researchers agree that adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of phosphorous by drinking water treatment residuals depends on the chemical and physical characteristics of the adsorbents used as well as external conditions of the experiments 40 63 65 this is also typical of adsorption reactions in general 66 and also explains the differences depicted in table 2 external conditions for actual sludges include the quality of the sludges produced which depend on the raw water quality and properties of the coagulant and coagulant aid used physical and chemical characteristics of the sorbent itself include its particle size surface functional groups specific surface area metal content and stability external or environmental conditions are those that surround the adsorption components and these comprise the solution ph temperature presence of competitors dosage of sorbent and initial phosphorous solution concentration these factors have been shown to affect the phosphorous adsorption capacity or removal efficiency in the studies given in table 2 and others not given phosphate adsorption capacities that have been recorded in literature include 14 49 mg g by iron hydroxide eggshell 67 8 21 mg g for iron oxide tailings 68 6 42 mg g by goethite 69 and 2 15 mg g by natural zeolite 70 in comparison to other low cost adsorbent materials oven dried alum sludges adsorbed about 98 of initial 2 5 mg l synthetic phosphates which was highest comparing to other tested adsorbents such as cement kiln dust bone char blast furnace slag or limestone 71 orthophosphate adsorption by alum sludge in the same study was better than that of a reference coal based granular activated carbon gac of 1 25 mm particle size d60 in contrast a coconut shell based granular activated carbon had the best phosphorous removal capability than alum sludge due to its higher surface area average 1000 m2 g vs 191 m2 g oven dried alum sludge in a study by mohammed and rashid 59 these differences were attributed to variations in the qualities of the alum sludges used in the studies mortula et al 71 did not indicate the surface area of the activated carbon they used whilst mohammed and rashid 59 did not give the d60 particle size of the gac used to allow for a complete evaluation of their findings 4 2 mechanism of phosphorous adsorption the mechanism of p adsorption by alum sludges is best described using sorption kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics the process kinetics for phosphorous adsorption by alum sludge is biphasic being constituted by a fast initial phase followed by a slow phase 1 27 65 this is the same pattern for all forms of phosphates 1 47 the rapid phase is characterized by phosphorous adsorption onto the exterior easily accessible sites such as macropores as well as on surface functional groups in a ligand exchange mechanism 27 40 these surface functional groups include hydroxyl groups oh chlorides cl sulphates so4 acidic organic carbon groups from humic substances cc and co as given by yang et al 40 yang et al 46 babatunde and zhao 72 and liu et al 73 in a study by yang et al 40 the p concentration in solution decreased while the levels of sulphates chlorides and humic substances as tocs increased as ph dropped to 4 3 from 9 these results indicated the replacement of these functional groups from the alum sludge surface hence the ligand exchange mechanism one characteristic feature of p adsorption by hydrous al hydroxides is the release of hydroxyl group into solution 74 these hydroxyl functional groups play a critical role in the ligand exchange mechanism that explains most of the p adsorption onto the surface of alum sludge in the rapid phase 46 in line with these findings studies have found that p adsorption capacity increases with increase in the alum sludge dosage though up to a certain limit 1 27 47 different dosages of alum sludge effecting maximum p adsorption capacity have been established by the studies possibly due to varying al metal content contained in the alum sludges an increase in the al metal content of the alum sludge appeared responsible for the increasing p adsorption capacity in some studies 75 65 aluminium content means more hydroxyl and other functional groups to act as binding sites and for chemical reaction with the phosphate ions yang et al 40 found a simultaneous decrease in the phosphate and alumininum concentrations from solution indicating the occurrence of chemical reactions as other mechanims using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer ems eds dot maps of cross sections of the wtr revealed that p was evenly distributed within the particles which pointed towards intra particle diffusion sorption mechanism 37 a typical adsorption reaction uses up 8 16 kj mol 77 but in the study by babatunde and zhao 72 they found an average adsorption energy of between 17 and 21 kj mol the higher adsorption energy was a further indication towards the presence of chemical adsorption or chemisorption besides the physical surface process of ligand anion exchange and the electrostatic and chemical attractions diffusion into micropores requires great activation energy liu et al 78 also showed that p adsorption was reduced by the accumulation of biofilm of activated sludge on alum sludge pores the biofilm acted to close the pores on the surface of the alum sludge and surface active sites which reduced adsorption by about 40 this finding supports the fact that mechanism of p adsorption is a result of surface active sites and inner pores thus when all surface sites have been occupied by the phosphate anions adsorption process occurs via intra particle diffusion mechanism into meso and micropores precipitation and chemical reactions 21 22 37 47 72 these subsequent mechanisms constitute the slow phase of the adsorption process of phosphates on alum sludges babatunde and zhao 72 further showed that particle diffusion mechanism was active under higher p concentrations higher p concentrations create a concentration gradient that pushes remaining phosphates from the exterior into the interior pores for additional adsorption further supporting the intra particle diffusion mechanism 4 3 adsorption kinetic models reaction kinetics are as important as specific adsorption capacity studies as both the rate of adsorption and the amount adsorbed are important to achieve an acceptable optimum performance 64 besides porosity polarity and high surface area a good adsorbent should possess fast adsorption kinetics 54 56 it is important that maximum amount of adsorbate is removed in the shortest time possible for practical application more than 80 of the studies reviewed that fitted their p adsorption data into sorption kinetic models found the pseudo second order model to give the best fit for alum sludge 1 21 61 65 72 the mechanism of phosphate adsorption on other natural adsorbents such as saw dust rice husks has also been consistent with the pseudo second order model 81 in their review paper on metal hydr oxides li et al 64 also highlighted that kinetic data of phosphate adsorption on most metal hydr oxides adsorbents are usually better represented by the pseudo second order model devi and saroha 28 did a review on sludge based adsorbents for several pollutants and found that adsorption by these kinds of adsorbents also follows the pseudo second order model the second order model points towards the dominance of chemical adsorption also called chemisorption as rate limiting step and hence the governing mechanism occurring through the formation of new compound on the surface of the adsorbent 82 babatunde and zhao 72 also found that the pseudo first order model fitted their data well along with the second order model the intra particle diffusion model was also found to play a part but was not the rate limiting step and was most prevalent under high initial p concentrations 72 chittoo and sutherland 21 also found the diffusion chemisorption kinetic model to fit their data well after the pseudo second order model the assumption behind the pseudo first order kinetic model is that only one adsorbate in this case phosphate po4 2 may occupy one site on the adsorbent surface the diffusion chemisorption model is based on the assumption that both diffusion and chemisorption determine adsorption the implication of chemisorption is that the adsorbed pollutant is almost irreversibly bound or cannot be easily desorbed 28 phosphate adsorbed onto alum sludge has also been shown to be almost permanently attached and that it could remain so for a long time 37 39 thus chemisorption mechanism may be a positive or negative depending on the objectives for the adsorption application for example if the goal is to remove pollutants from wastewater by adsorption or to remove phosphorous from a eutrophic water body then permanent attachment of the phosphate to the alum sludge would be desirable however if the goal is to capture and reuse the phosphorous pollutant then irreversible adsorption would be least preferred the issue with using alum sludge as adsorbent in wastewater is on the disposal of the subsequent sludge thus the trend in literature is to reuse the p containing sludge as a form of slow release fertilizer to offset p deficiency in soils especially in tropical and subtropical regions and limit over use of the natural reserves for this non renewable resource as well as to avert eutrophication 2 83 84 the recovered phosphorous could also be used as a source of raw material in the phosphate industry 2 various equilibration times have been reported in literature albeit under varying test conditions as shown by the findings obtained from selected studies given in table 3 the optimum equilibration time for phosphate adsorption on alum sludge is 24 h the variations in the equilibration times are due to differences in experimental conditions that include alum sludge dose initial phosphate concentration agitation solution ph temperature of reaction particle size of alum sludge 20 22 27 59 it is important to note the importance of shaking in increasing the rate of adsorption from the results presented in table 3 the study by mohammed and rashid 59 is the only one that removed phosphate as low as 50 in 24 h with the rest in 7 days probably due to the absence of shaking the other studies involved shaking albeit at different duration or intensities 4 4 adsorption equilibrium isotherm models adsorption isotherm represents the relationship between adsorbent and adsorbate at a fixed temperature under equilibrium conditions and also represents the effect of initial adsorbate concentration as a function of adsorbent dosage 85 the majority of studies on phosphate adsorption by alum sludges have found the langmuir isotherm model to provide the best fit 20 25 40 72 65 86 followed by the freundlich adsorption isotherm model 71 87 this is also typical of other metal hydroxide adsorbents 64 the temkin model was also good 87 while the langmuir freundlich model the two site langmuir model were a better fit than the langmuir in studies by mohammed and rashid 59 and gao et al 1 respectively the langmuir model assumes that effective adsorption is monolayer in nature 20 4 5 thermodynamics of phosphate adsorption gibb s free energy enthalpy and entropy changes are critical variables when estimating the performance of an adsorption desorption process and predicting the mechanism of this process and hence basic parameters to characterize and optimize an adsorption process 85 to further understand the mechanism of phosphate adsorption on alum sludge these thermodynamic parameters were calculated by gao et al 1 the positive value of the enthalpy change δho kj mol as well as the pattern of increasing adsorption capacity with increase in temperature confirmed the endothermic nature of the process the mechanism of phosphate adsorption on alum sludges also involves diffusion into micropores as mentioned before which requires activation energy as these narrow sized pores present an energy barrier to the adsorption process 37 the positive values of entropy change δso kj mol k were a further indication of disorder caused by the adsorption process taking place as temperature increased the values of the standard gibb s free energy δgo kj mol were negative and decreased with increasing temperature range 8 97 at 288 k to 19 99 at 328 k for all the phosphate species studied that include ortho p hexameta p phytate pyro p glycerol p 1 88 the negative gibbs free energy values indicated that the adsorption process of phosphate on alum sludges is a thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous process 4 6 factors affecting adsorption of phosphates on alum sludge adsorbent 4 6 1 effect of ph almost all adsorption studies on alum sludges that were accessed in literature have found that adsorption is highly dependent on ph of the solution and that highest adsorption capacity mostly happens in the acidic ph range of 4 5 5 1 20 21 25 30 36 40 50 63 71 72 although most of these researches studied ortho p this trend has been found to apply for all forms of phosphates 1 a ph below 4 or above 8 decreases phosphate adsorption on alum sludge 25 this trend is particularly so for orthophosphate p which is an inorganic phosphate species tested in most phosphorous adsorption studies by alum sludge orthophosphate p is the most easily and strongly adsorbed phosphate species from aqueous solution by alum sludge 25 63 71 90 orthophosphates have got a small molecular weight in comparison to the other types of phosphates such that they quickly diffuse into the adsorbent material and get adsorbed fastest aluminium hydroxide dominant in alum sludge is amphoteric in nature which results in acid base dissociation of alum sludges 40 as aluminium dissolves back into solution surface charge of aluminium hydroxide which is mainly responsible for phosphorous adsorption is reduced either forming positive or negative charges depending on the surrounding ph when the ph is low h ions dominate the surface of the alum sludge which triggers a release of oh ions into solution creating free active sites for phosphate adsorption the presence of hydroxyl group oh active sites creates a better chance for phosphate oh ligand ion exchange to take place on the surface of the sorbent providing for increased phosphorous adsorption capacity 64 this ligand exchange mechanism was confirmed by liu et al 91 using column tests and is the main mechanism explaining phosphate adsorption on alum 40 likewise under alkaline conditions ph 7 hydroxyl ions oh become dominant in solution which reduces the release of the oh ions from the alum sludge active sites instead the hydroxyl ions outcompete phosphates po4 3 for the active sites on the surface of the alum sludge by forming a counter ion layer surrounding the aluminium ion that reduces p adsorption 20 40 yang et al 40 also found that the zeta potential of the alum sludge studied changed from 75 8 to 33 7 mv which corresponded to a ph change from 4 3 9 0 a positive zeta potential signifies a positive surface charge which occurs when the ph of the suspension is low indicating presence of unsatisfied surface charge that needs to be neutralized by an anionic adsorbate e g cl so4 2 oh humic acids as toc po4 2 ions thus effective use of alum sludges as adsorbent for wastewater treatment would require ph maintenance within the acidic range of 4 6 to ensure the availability of metal hydroxides and a positive surface charge in order to attract anions besides the stability of the functional groups present on the active sites of the sorbent surface that is the surface potential ph influences the surface charge of the adsorbent 27 64 92 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent surface and the type of active centres on the surface are indicated by a significant factor called the point of zero charge phpzc the ph at the point of zero charge for alum sludge is 7 5 40 in the range of ph 2 12 when solution ph phpzc the phosphate adsorption may be affected by the electrostatic repulsion and increasing competitive effect of oh ions for the active sites on the sorbent when ph phpzc the sorbent surface is positively charged favouring adsorption of the anions adsorption process of anions onto alum sludge is also facilitated by electrostatic and chemical attraction onto the positively charged outer surface of the alum sludge 64 this is the reason why most studies on alum sludge have found the best phosphate adsorption at a ph range of 4 5 5 as this is below the phpzc of alum sludge of 7 5 the solution phosphate chemistry is also influenced by ph and also determines adsorption capacity of alum sludges for the anion 27 64 92 electrostatic repulsion is increased when a phosphate of higher negative charge is dominant in the solution for example as ph increases more negatively charged phosphate ions become dominant in solution increasing the repulsion between the phosphate species in solution and the adsorbent surface which is already predominantly negative under these ph conditions adsorption capacity has been noted to decrease at these alkaline ph ranges the phosphate species dominant at various ph values are h3po4 ph 2 15 h2po4 ph 2 15 7 20 hpo4 2 ph 7 2 12 33 and po4 3 at ph 12 34 93 95 the phosphate species h2po4 requires lower energy for adsorption than hpo4 2 such that the former is more easily adsorbed on the adsorbent surface than the later species 95 besides increased competition between phosphates and hydroxyl groups or counter ion layer formed by hydroxyl groups or electrostatic repulsion higher energy requirements for adsorption of the prevailing forms of phosphate under alkaline conditions may also explain the reduced adsorption capacity of alum sludge for phosphates as ph increases from acidic to alkaline ranges 4 6 2 particle size although particle size ranges used by different studies are different and difficult to compare what is common is that much more phosphorous adsorption is favoured with small fine particle size ranges than with bigger sized particles in both batch and column tests 22 42 59 91 96 yang et al 40 also found that in addition to a significant increase in adsorption of phosphorous equilibrium concentration of phosphorous left in solution was also lowered which also shows the extent of the adsorption process in addition lee et al 22 found that the adsorption rate is also much more rapid with fine particles than with bigger particles it took 7 h size 1 18 mm fine particles 24 h 1 18 mm 4 0 mm and more than 24 h 4 00 mm for alum sludges to remove 2 5 g of phosphorous to detection limit at least 50 of the particle size less than 1 18 mm contained particles of size below 0 30 mm ippolito et al 30 reported that particle size of less than 0 15 mm provides greater surface area compared to sizes greater than 2 36 mm even smaller sizes to the nanoscale have been shown to further increase surface area and adsorption capacity for instance nanosized water treatment residue obtained through high energy ball milling yielded 30 times higher maximum adsorption capacity 50 mg p g than the unmilled residue 1 7 mg p g 97 intraparticle diffusion of phosphorous in micropores has been reported in literature 37 72 it has been noted that the intrapore specific surface area for adsorption is 24 times the average size of the adsorbent particles 37 specific surface area also increased with increase in micropore volume this intra particle diffusion mechanism explains the significant increase in maximum po4 3 p adsorption when the particle size is reduced in all of the abovementioned studies thus fine particles can significantly increase the intra pore specific surface area and provide additional adsorption sites in the form of micropores macropores and mesopores this acts to increase the effective area and or contact between adsorbent and adsorbate for po4 3 p adsorption than coarse particles therefore any change in the particle size and surface area of alum sludge will also translate to variations in phosphorous adsorption the emerging trend in the world right now is the use of nanosized materials with a high surface to volume ratio that is high surface area which is known to increase surface reactivity of the substance among other uses 92 98 there is no doubt that particle size of alum sludge can also be manipulated to increase its efficacy as an adsorbent the only difficulty is the lack of a standard size of particles that give the best adsorption as different sources use different size ranges which makes comparison inappropriate however in column experiments there are issues of impeded hydraulic conductivity and possible clogging of suspended materials which can reduce effectiveness of alum sludge acting as a filter substrate and adsorbent 99 4 6 3 retention time this is also known as the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate in this case the phosphorous containing aqueous solution most researchers have found that increasing the retention time of the adsorption process increases removal or adsorption capacity in batch or in fixed bed column experiments 22 42 59 maximum p adsorptions were achieved within 48 h 42 although equilibrium time is mainly 24 h table 2 makris et al 52 amended poultry litter with different rates of alum sludges and found that contact time was not a significant factor for p adsorption bai et al 13 also found phosphate adsorption to be the same for hydraulic retention time of 2 h and 3 h such that 2 h was adopted for further studies aided with stirring as the most efficient time for the process increases in hydraulic retention time in a column study did not result in improvements in phosphate removal in another study 27 the results from babatunde and zhao 72 indicated that contact time needed to achieve equilibrium might be affected by the initial p concentration with more time being required for higher initial p concentration thus even if there is little phosphorous for adsorption it seems that surface adsorption will still prevail and rapidly for that matter regardless of contact time so long other factors are optimal such as the particle size of the alum sludge the temperature ph agitation and presence of competing substances as a result it appears that contact time may not necessarily be an important determining factor alone but these other surrounding factors 4 6 4 competitive anions anions always occur together in the environment and the same applies for phosphates and its competing anions in wastewater 18 95 being of the same charge phosphates and its competing anions are bound to compete with each other for the same sites on a metal cationic surface these competing substances thus interfere with the adsorption of phosphates by alum sludges normally adsorption will favour the anion with a higher valence such as po4 2 so4 2 and co3 2 compared to single charged ones that include cl f or no3 and the order of interference given was so4 2 and co3 2 f cl no3 64 studies looking specifically on aluminium or alum sludges have given somewhat contrasting results there is consensus that no3 and cl have an insignificant effect on phosphate adsorption 40 100 in contrast to li et al 64 sulphates so4 2 have also been found to have an insignificant effect when it comes to aluminium or alum sludges whilst fluorides and hydroxide monovalent anions have a superior affinity for aluminium or alum sludges 40 100 the study by li et al 64 was a review on phosphate adsorption onto various types and sources of metal hydr oxides this pattern indicated replacement of these functional groups from the alum sludge surface by phosphates the order of decreasing competitive strength or affinity for aluminium reported by diamadopoulos and benedek 100 is oh f po4 2 so4 2 cl no3 humic substances also fall in the same category with cl and no3 in terms of competitive strength 40 69 91 phosphate adsorption from wastewater has also been shown to be hampered by the presence of carbonates but insignificantly affected by chlorides nitrites no2 and nitrates on other adsorbents such as iron modified biochar or mg al ldh functionalized biochar 18 95 carbonates inhibit phosphate adsorption by increasing ph of solution 101 however there is no consensus on the effect of sulphates as explained in section 4 6 1 phosphate adsorption decreases as hydrolysis of aluminium increases with increase in ph to the alkaline range this shows that hydroxyl ions if present have a greater tendency to attract to aluminium than phosphates for aluminium al3 mortula and gagnon 102 found that phosphate removal in aquaculture process water and deionized water spiked with orthophosphates was comparable at ph of 6 48 this finding showed that the presence of competing ions did not affect phosphate adsorption by alum sludges tested but pointed towards the inferior competitive strength of most anions present in the aquaculture wastewater conclusively nitrates and chlorides are weaker competitors whilst carbonates and fluorides are stronger competitors than phosphates for aluminium as given by li et al 95 sulphates have a larger ionic radius than chlorides nitrates or nitrites such that they are strongly associated with the positively charged aluminium ion along with the h2po4 which induces competition fluoride has a strong electronegativity and so it is easily combined with the protonated adsorbent surface than phosphate 95 4 6 5 dosage of adsorbent increasing the dosage of alum sludge can improve p removal capacity 13 63 this is because the quantity of active sites or total surface area for adsorption to take place also increases however this increase in p removal capacity is only up to a certain dosage or limit and variable from one study to another for instance 5 g l 47 10 g l 47 50 g l 59 12 g l 20 the very high limit of 50 g l might have been due to the absence of shaking in the experiments the same study also had the longest equilibration time table 2 shaking increases mobility of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent as well as helps to open up more sites for adsorption to take place 103 after the limit is reached p removal becomes constant and then decreases and this trend applied to all the initial phosphate concentrations in the study by babatunde et al 27 in addition as alum sludge dose increases specific p uptake decreases 47 thus increasing the alum sludge dosage for the same initial phosphate concentration serves to make the whole phosphate adsorption process inefficient per gram of adsorbent 27 the phosphate is only distributed on the available sites and some sites are left unoccupied though overall p removal capacity is increased or high also the gradient of phosphate concentration is lowered around the alum sludge particle surface which results in reduced specific adsorption on per mass of the water treatment sludge 13 47 increasing dosage of alum sludge increased the al ion content which resulted in higher adsorption of phosphates 65 al ion content affects adsorption because of ligand exchange mechanism as more al means more functional groups that can be exchanged for p on the surface according to yang et al 40 hence most studies have found that phosphate adsorption increases as dosage of alum sludge is increased but these upper limit dosages are different probably because of other confounding factors such as particle size of the alum sludge used contact time initial phosphate concentrations shaking duration speed and or intensity among others also this could simply be due to some of the studies not increasing the dosage to a point where further increases do not effect any change in phosphate adsorbed therefore there is need for an optimization study to determine the optimum dosage of alum sludge based adsorbent of a particular optimum particle size al content and form to be used for a measured amount of phosphates to achieve effective and efficient phosphate adsorption from aqueous solution 4 6 6 temperature adsorption capacity increases as temperature rises and this applies to all forms of phosphates 1 22 104 temperature also increases the initial rate of adsorption reaction but after prolonged contact time removal efficiency becomes similar 22 generally temperature also reduces the time required to reach equilibrium in phosphate adsorption by various adsorbents 92 at a temperature of 30 2 c and 40 2 c the maximum adsorption rate for p were 0 685 0 084 and 0 870 0 021 mg p g alum sludge min 22 more temperature levels by lee et al 22 would have allowed for analysis in order to conclude on the results these two data points give a preliminary indication that temperature speeds the initial rate of reaction but over prolonged time the different temperatures give similar results typical of phosphate adsorption reactions all these results point towards the endothermic nature of phosphate adsorption by alum sludges the positive value of the enthalpy change δh kj mol confirmed the endothermic nature of the process 1 as explained by gao et al 1 increasing temperature reduces the viscosity of the solution which then enhances the diffusion of the adsorbate molecules across the boundary layer and into the pores of the adsorbent rendering an increased adsorption capacity devi and saroha 28 also reported that increased temperature causes a swelling effect in the internal structure of the adsorbent which makes it easy for molecules to enter and so increased adsorption capacity however the effect of temperature on adsorption capacity should not be overemphasized because this increase is most probably only dependent on other adsorbent characteristics such as particle size and whether the surface area for adsorption is high or not studies may be needed to really ascertain the effect of temperature on adsorption capacity and the degree of this effect using both fine and coarse particle sizes in practice energy intensive processes may be undesirable due to costs and issues of global warming depending on the source of energy 4 6 7 age storage time of alum sludge fresh alum sludge slurry was collected every 1 2 h from clarifiers constituting about 1 of total sludge volume aged for up to 5 days by storing it at room temperature while mixing at 30 rpm 105 slow mixing was so as to prevent breaking up of sludge particles and to prevent anaerobic conditions and the changes that might accrue as a result the authors found that increasing the age of alum sludge from day 0 to day 5 significantly reduced p sorption capacities especially for orthophosphates 105 other authors also found this same pattern 106 107 contrasting results are also present 46 100 the study by yang et al 46 was long term 0 day up to 18 months using actual dewatered alum sludges air dried and specifically focusing on the effect of ageing on the structure of alum sludge and its p adsorption capacity and found marginal effects there was insignificant change to the structure and properties of the alum sludge and so to its adsorption capacity the studies by galarneau et al 105 georgantas et al 106 and berkowitz et al 107 were done using wet alum sludge sludge before drying maher et al 104 also used wet alum sludge and found that adsorption capacity for soluble reactive phosphorous decreased by 43 by day 43 while total reactive phosphorous showed marginal reductions hence it can be concretely concluded that the age of actual dried alum sludge will not likely affect its p adsorption capacity however a more solid comparative study done under same experimental conditions is necessary to ascertain effect of age on the adsorption of phosphorous under aqueous and dry sludge environment 4 6 8 initial phosphorous concentration the majority of studies on phosphate adsorption by alum sludge agree that maximum p adsorbed by alum sludge increases with increasing initial p concentration 72 104 108 this trend applies to all the different p species that include pyrophosphate orthophosphate and glycerophosphate 109 further there is higher adsorption rate at higher initial p concentrations than at low concentrations babatunde and zhao 72 found the intraparticle rate constants to increase from 0 0075 mg p per gram per min at 5 mg initial p l to 0 1795 mg p per gram per min at 60 mg initial p l intraparticle diffusion mechanism was rate controlling step at high initial concentrations of phosphates 72 hence optimization studies should determine the best possible and efficient combination of phosphate source to be mixed with a pre determined adsorbent dosage of a particular size and form 4 6 9 agitation shaking speed an increase in agitation speed 150 250 rpm was found to increase adsorption capacity rate of adsorption and initial rate of adsorption compared to an increase from 250 350 rpm 21 higher shaking speeds above 350 rpm did not yield further changes to the above parameters in the same study this phenomenon had also been reported by other authors albeit looking at other kinds of adsorbents and adsorbates 103 110 111 these findings indicate that the absence of shaking prolongs the time to reach equilibrium as shown in table 2 whereby the longest time to equilibrium was 6 days in a study by mohammed and rashid 59 it is clear that shaking agitation stirring or mixing impact on the adsorption capacity and its rate of occurrence however different shaking times and speeds are used in studies such that for practical application purposes it is important to recommend optimal shaking conditions factoring in other influencing factors agitation would help in situations when there is high influent flow to a wastewater treatment system for example during high rainfall events when there is high stormwater runoff maximum phosphate adsorption can be reached in the shortest possible time agitation can either be hydraulic or mechanical but care should be taken to avoid flow patterns that cause stratification and thus non uniform mixing and reduced contact between adsorbent and adsorbate baffled basins are some of the most commonly used 5 desorption regeneration and recovery desorption and regeneration of adsorbents are the most difficult and expensive parts of an adsorption technology which can take up at least 70 of the total costs for operation and maintenance of the system 112 the objectives of desorption regeneration exercises are to recover the adsorbent or adsorbate depending on their market demand desorption restore the adsorbent back to its initial properties for effective reuse regeneration and so reduce the overall process cost of the adsorption process desorption can also help in the understanding of the adsorption mechanism 28 the exercises also allow for proper disposal of either constituent researches on p saturated alum sludge desorption regeneration is very scarce of the few studies accessed in literature they were mostly looking at p availability and extraction from agricultural soils or lake sediments amended with water treatment residues and even fewer from alum sludge used as adsorbent in aqueous solutions or substrates alum sludge can be desorbed of bound p by manipulating the ph conditions 39 108 113 an acid base extraction experiment was performed by zhao and zhao 114 for p extraction and found that all the acids tested exhibited the highest desorption efficiencies at increased p concentrations while the bases were effective at low concentrations however there was no significant difference between 0 075 m and 0 01 m concentrations of either base or acid sulphuric acid h2so4 was then chosen as the most efficient agent for p extraction when factoring in issues of cost convenience and safety as well the other acids tested were hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3 and the bases were naoh and koh optimization studies found p extraction efficiency of 98 under alum sludge dose of 5633 8 mg l and h2so4 concentration of 0 063 m 114 other studies on oxyanions desorption from sludge based adsorbents have found the process to favour base extraction or alkaline conditions for example a study by zhou and haynes 115 it appears only one desorption cycle was used to effect above 90 and around 65 p extraction using the acids and bases respectively studies are required to investigate the extent of regeneration for alum sludge to make inference on the cost effectiveness of its use for practical application alum sludges amended or composited with organic matter prior to p adsorption resulted in a significantly greater release of p from the cowshed wastewater amended alum sludge than alum sludge alone yielding concentrations of 31 8 and 0 2 mg soluble reactive p kg solid respectively 108 organic matter probably inhibited the formation of strong binding of phosphates to the adsorption sites making them easily desorbed alum sludges contain large amounts of amorphous al which has been shown to be strongly correlated to high p sorption 27 96 the results in a characterization study on 15 water treatment residuals in south africa showed elevated amounts of amorphous al oxides and also ca 12 the authors concluded that the sorbed p would be retained in forms unavailable for plant uptake the implication of these findings is that phosphorous bound to alum sludges cannot be available again in the environment naturally unless there are changes to the surroundings especially in terms of ph desorption occurred in the presence of sulphuric acid to recover 97 p and 99 al from a dewatered alum sludge cake that was being used as substrate in a constructed wetland the p and al laden leachate that was produced was then precipitated using a base to form alpo4 the alpo4 can be a raw material in the phosphate industry or a fertilizer in agriculture there is need for more research using various alum sludges to ascertain the production efficiency of the alpo4 the optimized conditions for production its purity for use in agriculture and the cost effectiveness if applied at a large scale phosphorous p is a macronutrient essential for all living organisms but it is also a finite resource which can get used up from its main non renewable source raw material phosphate rock coupled with increasing human population growth and no alternative for phosphorous the demand for phosphate rock to provide phosphorous will increase probably even exceeding its supply in addition p use efficiency is low with just between 15 and 20 of applied phosphorous being consumed by the plant or animal life and the rest becoming lost in the waste generated thereof the phosphorous present in these wastes poses a threat to the environment for example as eutrophication hence the capture and slow release of phosphorous by alum sludge based fertilizers may offer a solution to these challenges 6 drawbacks of alum sludge use as adsorbent for phosphate and counteracting measures the specific surface area of alum sludge is considerably low 121 1 98 3m2 g alum sludge when compared to that of commercial conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon for instance 200 300 g m2 activated alumina or 600 2000g m2 activated carbon as mentioned in section 3 1 this also applies to other sludge based adsorbents 28 surface area has been found to increase by activation reducing particle size to nanoscale and purification that is removal of impurities of the precursor sludge 28 58 97 116 although some have found alum sludges as well as other metal oxides or hydroxides to have significantly higher p removal relative to their activated forms for example activated alumina the adsorption reactions tend to be highly ph dependent and limited by adsorbent characteristics 95 117 the bound phosphate ions cannot be easily recovered from alum sludge for other environmentally sustainable uses such as source of phosphorous based fertilizer activation of raw materials has always worked to increase surface area of various adsorbents to more than double or triple the original surface area 28 56 95 117 118 raw alum sludges calcined at 300 c removed organic inorganic matter impurities that are normally agglomerated to raw alum sludges and increased its surface area resulting in a 5 4 8 7 times greater adsorption capacity for arsenate v than unmodified alum sludge 118 however several studies have established that calcination temperature is critical with high temperatures reducing the surface area instead 95 119 jeon et al 118 also found that alum sludge structure changed from being amorphous to crystalline with temperatures above 300 c which reduced its surface area for adsorption this phenomenon was also reported in a review of various sludge based adsorbents by devi and saroha 28 whereby an increase in activation agent to sludge ratio beyond certain optimum levels reduced the surface area due to destruction of microporosity from pore wall damage using thermal sol gel method activated alumina with high purity was produced from raw alum sludge and successfully removed 96 fluoride from aqueous solution and the adsorption capacity was higher than commercial nano alumina 120 however there was no comparison made to the parent unmodified alum sludge adsorption capacity in the study by aghapour et al 120 also the yield of activated alumina from the parent alum sludge was only 38 5 also the yield of activated alumina from the parent alum sludge was only 38 5 thermal sol gel is a chemical activation technique mostly used to produce metal oxides of higher purity and abilities than the parent materials the method uses a chemical agent in a hydrolysis step that yields a solution of the precursor that later becomes a gel a poly condensation stage follows that is normally done using thermal means to improve structural ability and mechanical properties in the study by aghapour et al 120 the process involved alum recovery by sulphuric acid treatment then preparation of al oh 3 gel by addition of naoh solution followed by calcination for 2 h in air at 700 c it has been determined that activated metal oxide product normally has a higher point of zero charge which ensures that adsorption is optimal at a wider ph range 95 jeon et al 118 also found that the adsorption capacity of alum sludge calcined at 300 c did not change markedly across a wider range of ph range than the uncalcined sludge aluminium based materials other than alum sludge have been used as precursor raw material with other materials such as biochar chitosan metal doped mesoporous silica metal impregnated pre formed mesoporous silicas or as stand alone mesoporous metal oxides or hydroxides or sulphates to produce composite 11 95 118 121 122 wang et al 60 and zawrah et al 62 successfully recycled alum sludge for producing nano al oh 3 and iron oxy hydroxide feo oh and layered double hydroxides ldhs the synthesised alum sludge based ldhs have yet to be assessed for application in various uses however al containing ldhs have been combined with biochar and then used for phosphate adsorption 122 123 these al containing ldh biochar composites have been found to reach equilibrium in 50 min to 1 h achieve almost 100 removal efficiency for phosphates reach adsorption capacity of 410 mg p g with higher regeneration and desorption capacity and greater selectivity for phosphate in the presence of competing ions than alum sludge alone 109 117 this high regeneration and desorption capacity implies that the adsorbents can act as capture and release agents for the bound phosphate this feature is being exploited and explored so as to use these composites as a source of phosphate in soils that are p deficient as mentioned earlier however no consensus has been reached yet on the structural stability of the composites under various ph conditions it is highly difficult to separate out a powdered adsorbent from an effluent at large scale to allow for commercial application of most adsorbents alum sludge in constructed wetlands has been studied as a source of low cost substitute substrate to act as a filter media and phosphorous removal agent concerns were on metal leaching natural organic matter release and clogging by suspended solids clogging is an issue because the best adsorption of alum sludge has been achieved using fine particle size fine particle size is one parameter responsible for clogging and reduced hydraulic conductivity resulting in surface ponding and eventually normal operation is disrupted 124 hence there is a need to balance between high adsorption capacity and improved hydraulic conductivity to ensure a longer lifespan of the constructed wetland modification by granulation shows great promise in improving hydraulic conductivity in a filtration system to reduce clogging and to allow for easy recovery of the adsorbents 123 125 128 granulation also reduced bioaccessibility of heavy metals 99 however granulated drinking water treatment residual was shown to have a lower adsorption capacity than the parent powdered form 99 more research is required to explore the usefulness of granulating alum sludge for wastewater treatment 7 summary conclusions and recommendations for future research directions most of the alum sludge adsorption studies were carried out as laboratory based batch studies and few as fixed bed or continuous flow through column experiments mostly using synthetic phosphate solutions and synthetic or actual secondary municipal wastewater these studies have mostly been performed under varying experimental and environmental conditions which makes it difficult to adopt results from one study and use them elsewhere also the quality of the alum sludge from different places is highly variable such that a use that is applicable for a certain sludge may not be feasible for another this scenario makes it difficult to develop a crosscutting alum sludge based solution that can be applied anywhere regardless of the alum sludge used or conditions of application alum sludge is a potentially good adsorbent for phosphates in wastewater adsorption capacity ranges from 2 to 43 mg p g alum sludge the adsorption kinetics follow the pseudo second order model while the langmuir adsorption isotherm had the best fit in more than 80 of the studies accessed equilibrium adsorption is generally reached between 10 min and 24 h with shaking phosphate adsorption by alum sludges occurs by ligand exchange mechanism anion exchange and electrostatic attractions in the rapid phase followed by intraparticle diffusion and chemical precipitation in the slow phase its efficacy for commercial large scale application is limited by several drawbacks specific surface area of raw alum sludge is considerably low 121 1 98 3 m2 g phosphate adsorption by raw alum sludge is affected by several hindering factors especially ph presence of inorganic organic material on its surface particle size sludge dosage in column applications its use is affected by its particle size and form which can cause clogging regeneration has been shown to be low as well as phosphate desorption desorption of bound p can be improved by prior binding of organic matter to alum sludge and ph manipulation otherwise phosphates can remain bound for years at ph range of 5 9 the following areas are recommended for future research to improve the efficacy of alum sludges especially for practical application in the near future there is need to standardize the characteristics of a good adsorbent in general for phosphate removal to allow for benchmarking and future comparisons enhancing adsorption capacity of alum sludge by way of removing impurities concentrating the active ingredients and increasing surface area for adsorption there may also be need to evaluate the water treatment plant processes and chemicals so as to yield an alum sludge with higher potential benefits for later reuse development of alum sludge based materials that balance between size of particles for adsorption and increased hydraulic conductivity to prevent clogging if used as filter media for practical application there is also need for an adsorbent with better characteristics and structural stability under real life conditions but can be produced at reasonable costs with minimal adverse environmental effects efficacy of granulation to prevent metal leakage from alum sludge should also be studied research is needed to come up with either an optimal alum sludge based compound or synthesis method that can be effectively and universally recommended for effective adsorption of phosphates and other pollutants in wastewater for commercial application as a filter media and or adsorbent this would allow easy replication and large scale production anywhere regardless of alum sludge quality the way conventional adsorbents such as activated carbons are used more desorption regeneration studies of alum sludge adsorbents used in wastewater treatment are required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements the authors give tremendous gratitude to some anonymous reviewers for their invaluable input that shaped the structure and scope of this paper 
14047,aluminium sulphate is the commonest and most widely used coagulant for water treatment worldwide aluminium is a well known adsorbent for phosphorous p a nutrient highly associated with eutrophication in most water bodies thus this paper provides a review on p adsorption from aqueous media using alum sludge waste material generated by water treatment plants that use aluminium sulphate as sole coagulant a meta analysis of data on characteristics of various alum sludges was done the hindrance factors and adsorption capacities under varying operating conditions are presented including future direction it is evident from literature survey that there is the emerging shift from reuse and recycling of raw alum sludge towards synthesis of value added alum sludge based adsorbents possibilities to improve efficacy as both filter media and adsorbent but at the same time reducing metal leaching are highlighted value added products may also offer an added advantage of acting as source of phosphorous for possible reuse in agricultural soils keywords adsorbent alum sludge phosphorous removal wastewater treatment eutrophication 1 introduction phosphorous is regarded as the key element causing eutrophication in freshwater bodies 1 3 the major sources of phosphorus in surface waterbodies are municipal wastewater industrial discharges and manure from livestock production as well as runoff from agricultural lands 2 4 5 eutrophication is characterized by algal blooms and numerous other problems for example clogging of water treatment process filters bad odour and taste to drinking water animal and human health issues ecological and economic challenges 2 3 effective control of phosphorous additions to waters is thus a fundamental step towards controlling eutrophication and its effects on the environment economy and people biological chemical and physical methods are currently being used to reduce or remove phosphorous from wastewater prior to discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants 6 7 biological methods such as the enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr have wide usage and can achieve almost 100 p removal albeit inconsistently 8 biological methods are also less effective at low influent p concentrations as the metabolism of responsible microorganisms becomes starved biological treatment operations require strict control to ensure optimum aeration and tend to be land and energy intensive 8 chemical treatment is also widely used and includes the use of metal salts such as iron fe calcium ca and aluminium to act as coagulants that precipitate the phosphorous major drawbacks with chemical treatment methods include possible secondary pollution excessive amounts of resultant sludge the need to neutralize ph and high operating costs due to variable dosing 9 physical methods that can be employed include reverse osmosis membrane bioreactors and electrodialysis but these are either too expensive or inefficient 5 membrane bioreactors have smaller ecological footprint and are able to achieve low p discharge limits 10 nevertheless membrane fouling is a critical challenge which reduces the lifespan of the filters and increase energy requirements for sludge recirculation making the whole process inefficient physical adsorption is also another method findings from a review by huang et al 11 indicate that several authors agree that physical methods are more effective than the former this is because of inherent low costs high adsorption capacity or removal efficiency fast adsorption rates especially at low p levels renewability ease of operation and no secondary pollution 11 accordingly p adsorption has been tried for p recovery and reuse as will be shown in this paper however adsorption of p can be hampered by the effect of solution ph as well as the characteristics of the adsorbent among other challenges to be highlighted in the following sections therefore it is important to find optimal and suitable adsorbents that can remove phosphorous from wastewater effectively and efficiently cost effectively and in an environmentally friendly manner aluminium al as an element is well known to possess a strong affinity for phosphorous 12 13 most water treatment plants in the world use aluminium sulphate or just alum al2 so4 3 14h2o for water clarification this is because alum is the cheapest and simplest aluminium based flocculent available 14 alum sludges are the inevitable resultant waste product generated from the water treatment processes that use alum as sole coagulant 15 it follows then that alum sludges are the most widely generated and locally available water treatment waste around the world at low or no cost at all but are normally thrown away 16 18 it is now widely acknowledged that aluminium in alum sludge can be beneficially reused to remove phosphorous from wastewater 16 17 19 20 as a result alum sludges present a big source of aluminium in the form of aluminium hydroxide al oh 3 18 21 22 the reuse of alum sludge is in line with the current research focus in the world on finding low cost alternative adsorbents for pollutant removal in the environment 9 13 18 20 23 historically alum sludges were perceived to be inert waste material with little value for reuse 24 as a result alum sludges have traditionally been discharged into aquatic systems 25 26 later the wastes were deemed toxic to aquatic life owing to the inherent high amounts of aluminium and so lately they have been landfilled or incinerated after drying 16 17 where they are landfilled the related costs are thus factored into the tap water costs and ultimately borne by the consumers such that tap water costs become exorbitant 27 landfilling is also constrained by land use public concerns and more stringent environmental regulations 28 incineration is also expensive produces greenhouse gases and other toxic compounds like dioxins and furans ash tends to be laden with heavy metals while its disposal entails extra costs and generally incineration is poorly acceptable to the public and only works efficiently for sludges with low moisture content 28 measures to deal with alum sludges have been evolving over the years in a review by babatunde and zhao 29 three broad categories of the past and present uses of drinking water treatment sludges were identified as their use in wastewater treatment processes use as building and construction materials and for land application reviews have been done for each of these three possible applications but generalizing on the type of water treatment sludge the reviews have been on all kinds of drinking water treatment sludges including those from water treatment plants that use fe or ca or other forms of coagulants other than aluminium sulphate 19 30 31 the review by ippolito et al 30 looked at phosphate adsorption by various adsorbents that also included alum sludge albeit no specification as to the source of al coagulant dassanayake et al 19 focused on the use of alum sludges for agriculture not for wastewater treatment this present review is focusing specifically on 1 alum sludge but with special emphasis on its capacity as adsorbent for phosphorous removal from aqueous systems such as water and wastewater and 2 on aluminium sulphate coagulant based alum sludges only the other al salts for example polyaluminium chloride pac are not as common as aluminium sulphate it is important to note that the term alum sludge is also loosely used to denote waste from water treatment plants that use al salts other than alum 16 17 32 this review paper uses the term alum sludge referring to aluminium sulphate based drinking water treatment wastes in terms of applications this present review is focused only on the use of aluminium sulphate coagulant based alum sludge in aqueous wastewater systems previous reviews on alum sludges have been looking at applications as adsorbent for phosphorous contained in soil surface runoff and biosolids applied on land for agricultural reasons 19 30 the review by haynes 31 looked at the use of various industrial wastes water treatment sludges included as media and filter bed in constructed wetlands to remove phosphorous and metals babatunde et al 33 and yang et al 18 reviewed the use of dewatered alum sludge in constructed wetlands as substrate and filter and how these kinds of emerging constructed wetlands can be a sustainable move for wastewater treatment babatunde et al 33 was focusing on ireland alone such that the findings do not reflect a global perspective while yang et al 18 also looked at other kinds of substrates besides alum sludge this current review thus focuses on the control of phosphorous p emissions in various aqueous wastewater systems using alum sludge from water treatment plants that use aluminium sulphate as sole coagulant 2 materials and methods the review was conducted by way of literature search from scholarly databases mainly google scholar and sciencedirect in august 2017 finalized and consolidated in august 2018 the study was focusing on alum sludges from water treatment processes that use aluminium sulphate and not some other kinds of al based coagulants such as pac the terms alum sludge drinking water treatment residual alum residuals residues were used repeatedly in combination using boolean and or with a variety of search terms that included phosphorous adsorption phosphate adsorption phosphate phosphorous adsorption mechanism morphology phosphate phosphorous adsorption characteristics phosphate phosphorous desorption regeneration recovery kinetics thermodynamics factors affecting and phosphate phosphorous adsorption applications uses and wastewater treatment the boolean operator and was also used to search for other issues eutrophication repeated using different terms nutrients phosphorous or phosphates activation of alum sludge or residual calcination of alum sludge or residual composite materials and synthesis and phosphate phosphorous adsorption eutrophication is an old and widely researched problem from years back hence there was no restriction to the year of publication especially looking at factors contributing towards its occurrence there was no restriction to the year of publication or geographic location of studies done on reuse of alum sludges to ensure that different kinds of this waste product are evaluated the only critical selection criteria for papers to incorporate were those researches on p adsorption in aqueous solutions using alum sludges generated from water treatment plants that use aluminium sulphate as coagulant about 22 papers specifically on alum sludge as an adsorbent for p in aqueous solutions were accessed however researches looking at aluminium hydroxides were also used to allow for comparison as well as those from other kinds of adsorbents or materials such as ferric sludges activated carbons among others papers that also incorporated alum sludge for adsorbing phosphates but in different media for example soil were also used for comparison or inference up to 195 papers were accessed using the above search terms but around 135 papers were actually used in the development of this review paper 3 characteristics of alum sludges 3 1 physical structure although sludge quality varies from plant to plant the basic constituents are the same 24 34 table 1 gives the general characteristics of alum sludges from various water treatment plants from around the world the wide standard deviations indicate the variations in alum sludges of alum sludges generated by individual water treatment plants thus it would be misleading and difficult to conclude or give typical umbrella figures for such parameters without specifying the water treatment plant being referred to in the same vein the removal efficiencies of different water treatment plant sludges for various pollutants found in the environment will differ it will be equally difficult to recommend universal beneficial reuse applications for water treatment sludges before evaluation of the characteristics and phosphorous adsorption capacity for a specific sludge alum sludges are bulky and gelatinous particularly before dewatering 35 dewatered alum sludge has an amorphous structure and rough surface according to observations using powder x ray diffraction pxrd and scanning electron microscopy techniques 21 25 36 41 oxalate aluminium is a characteristic that represents amorphous structured aluminium hydroxide which is strongly related with phosphorous immobilization 35 42 the average oxalate aluminium and total aluminium values calculated by this research from the three studies that determined oxalate al in addition to total al were almost the same total al 102 8 13 3 vs oxalate al 95 7 4 9 38 39 43 this further confirmed that alum sludges are predominantly amorphous this probably explains why most researchers thereafter have focused on just total al instead of adding the oxalate form since results from the three studies done in 2007 have turned out to be almost the same other studies confirm that the amorphous nature of alum sludges is a result of the inherent non crystalline aluminium hydroxide which gives the alum sludge an increased specific surface area and the subsequent increased chemical affinity for phosphorous 12 46 using the standard nitrogen brunauer emmett teller bet surface area the average of the surface area results in literature gave an average specific surface area of 121 8 95 3 m2 g for alum sludge table 1 a surface area less than 10 m2 g indicates a non porous structure 23 the specific surface area of alum sludge is directly related to the number of hydroxide sites available for adsorption 53 this implies that in order to increase efficacy of alum sludges as an adsorbent it is important to boost its hydroxide sites as one measure to improve specific surface area high specific surface area is a prerequisite for a good adsorbent 54 57 haynes 31 explained that size shape and porosity of particles determine surface area and the larger the surface area the greater the surface for adsorption to take place 31 most alum sludges have been found to be dominated by fine particles 18 27 47 fine particle sizes are good as they render a greater surface area for adsorption but they also present the challenge of possible clogging in practice when used as a filter media given that wastewater will contain a myriad of solids research would be necessary to develop alum sludge based materials that balance between sizes of particles for adsorption and improved hydraulic conductivity that aids in the passage of water and other materials without risk of clogging although alum sludges are comparable to conventional commercial adsorbents such as activated alumina and activated carbon in terms of dominant particle and pore size surface area greater than 10 m2 g and amorphous morphology measured average specific surface area is considerably low 121 1 98 3 m2 g than that of either of the commercial adsorbents activated alumina has a surface area ranging 200 300 g m2 while activated carbons can range from 600 2000 g m2 54 58 59 3 2 chemical properties elemental analysis is widely done using inductively coupled plasma atomic optical emission spectrometer icp aes oes x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds 1 34 60 62 total aluminium in alum sludge accounts for about 16 of the proportion of chemical composition widely distributed across studies and averaging 161 2 120 2 g kg table 1 fig 1 other elements inherent in alum sludge that influence its adsorption of phosphorous include ca sio4 2 fe cl so4 2 and humic acids measured as total organic carbon toc and also exhibit wide variations these organic and inorganic elements are those removed from the raw water as well as contained in the coagulants despite the dominance of al in alum sludges a study by gibbons and gagnon 50 revealed that in comparison to other residuals such as lime or ferric based alum residuals contained the least concentration of the primary element on a molar basis this finding implied that alum residuals may not be the best and efficient residual for use as adsorbent for phosphorous on a commercial basis however it should be emphasized again that aluminium sulphate being the most widely used coagulant in the world for water treatment gives rise to alum residuals which inevitably become the commonest waste product available compared to these other residuals the research focus is now moving towards the synthesis of value added products with superior qualities compared to the parent raw materials 28 60 62 4 characteristics of phosphorous adsorption by alum sludges 4 1 adsorption capacity of alum sludges for phosphorous results in table 2 show that adsorption capacity for phosphorous is noticeably different and wide ranging 2 43 mg p g alum sludge from one treatment plant to another or from one experiment to another other previous reviews also noted this pattern 19 30 most researchers agree that adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of phosphorous by drinking water treatment residuals depends on the chemical and physical characteristics of the adsorbents used as well as external conditions of the experiments 40 63 65 this is also typical of adsorption reactions in general 66 and also explains the differences depicted in table 2 external conditions for actual sludges include the quality of the sludges produced which depend on the raw water quality and properties of the coagulant and coagulant aid used physical and chemical characteristics of the sorbent itself include its particle size surface functional groups specific surface area metal content and stability external or environmental conditions are those that surround the adsorption components and these comprise the solution ph temperature presence of competitors dosage of sorbent and initial phosphorous solution concentration these factors have been shown to affect the phosphorous adsorption capacity or removal efficiency in the studies given in table 2 and others not given phosphate adsorption capacities that have been recorded in literature include 14 49 mg g by iron hydroxide eggshell 67 8 21 mg g for iron oxide tailings 68 6 42 mg g by goethite 69 and 2 15 mg g by natural zeolite 70 in comparison to other low cost adsorbent materials oven dried alum sludges adsorbed about 98 of initial 2 5 mg l synthetic phosphates which was highest comparing to other tested adsorbents such as cement kiln dust bone char blast furnace slag or limestone 71 orthophosphate adsorption by alum sludge in the same study was better than that of a reference coal based granular activated carbon gac of 1 25 mm particle size d60 in contrast a coconut shell based granular activated carbon had the best phosphorous removal capability than alum sludge due to its higher surface area average 1000 m2 g vs 191 m2 g oven dried alum sludge in a study by mohammed and rashid 59 these differences were attributed to variations in the qualities of the alum sludges used in the studies mortula et al 71 did not indicate the surface area of the activated carbon they used whilst mohammed and rashid 59 did not give the d60 particle size of the gac used to allow for a complete evaluation of their findings 4 2 mechanism of phosphorous adsorption the mechanism of p adsorption by alum sludges is best described using sorption kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics the process kinetics for phosphorous adsorption by alum sludge is biphasic being constituted by a fast initial phase followed by a slow phase 1 27 65 this is the same pattern for all forms of phosphates 1 47 the rapid phase is characterized by phosphorous adsorption onto the exterior easily accessible sites such as macropores as well as on surface functional groups in a ligand exchange mechanism 27 40 these surface functional groups include hydroxyl groups oh chlorides cl sulphates so4 acidic organic carbon groups from humic substances cc and co as given by yang et al 40 yang et al 46 babatunde and zhao 72 and liu et al 73 in a study by yang et al 40 the p concentration in solution decreased while the levels of sulphates chlorides and humic substances as tocs increased as ph dropped to 4 3 from 9 these results indicated the replacement of these functional groups from the alum sludge surface hence the ligand exchange mechanism one characteristic feature of p adsorption by hydrous al hydroxides is the release of hydroxyl group into solution 74 these hydroxyl functional groups play a critical role in the ligand exchange mechanism that explains most of the p adsorption onto the surface of alum sludge in the rapid phase 46 in line with these findings studies have found that p adsorption capacity increases with increase in the alum sludge dosage though up to a certain limit 1 27 47 different dosages of alum sludge effecting maximum p adsorption capacity have been established by the studies possibly due to varying al metal content contained in the alum sludges an increase in the al metal content of the alum sludge appeared responsible for the increasing p adsorption capacity in some studies 75 65 aluminium content means more hydroxyl and other functional groups to act as binding sites and for chemical reaction with the phosphate ions yang et al 40 found a simultaneous decrease in the phosphate and alumininum concentrations from solution indicating the occurrence of chemical reactions as other mechanims using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer ems eds dot maps of cross sections of the wtr revealed that p was evenly distributed within the particles which pointed towards intra particle diffusion sorption mechanism 37 a typical adsorption reaction uses up 8 16 kj mol 77 but in the study by babatunde and zhao 72 they found an average adsorption energy of between 17 and 21 kj mol the higher adsorption energy was a further indication towards the presence of chemical adsorption or chemisorption besides the physical surface process of ligand anion exchange and the electrostatic and chemical attractions diffusion into micropores requires great activation energy liu et al 78 also showed that p adsorption was reduced by the accumulation of biofilm of activated sludge on alum sludge pores the biofilm acted to close the pores on the surface of the alum sludge and surface active sites which reduced adsorption by about 40 this finding supports the fact that mechanism of p adsorption is a result of surface active sites and inner pores thus when all surface sites have been occupied by the phosphate anions adsorption process occurs via intra particle diffusion mechanism into meso and micropores precipitation and chemical reactions 21 22 37 47 72 these subsequent mechanisms constitute the slow phase of the adsorption process of phosphates on alum sludges babatunde and zhao 72 further showed that particle diffusion mechanism was active under higher p concentrations higher p concentrations create a concentration gradient that pushes remaining phosphates from the exterior into the interior pores for additional adsorption further supporting the intra particle diffusion mechanism 4 3 adsorption kinetic models reaction kinetics are as important as specific adsorption capacity studies as both the rate of adsorption and the amount adsorbed are important to achieve an acceptable optimum performance 64 besides porosity polarity and high surface area a good adsorbent should possess fast adsorption kinetics 54 56 it is important that maximum amount of adsorbate is removed in the shortest time possible for practical application more than 80 of the studies reviewed that fitted their p adsorption data into sorption kinetic models found the pseudo second order model to give the best fit for alum sludge 1 21 61 65 72 the mechanism of phosphate adsorption on other natural adsorbents such as saw dust rice husks has also been consistent with the pseudo second order model 81 in their review paper on metal hydr oxides li et al 64 also highlighted that kinetic data of phosphate adsorption on most metal hydr oxides adsorbents are usually better represented by the pseudo second order model devi and saroha 28 did a review on sludge based adsorbents for several pollutants and found that adsorption by these kinds of adsorbents also follows the pseudo second order model the second order model points towards the dominance of chemical adsorption also called chemisorption as rate limiting step and hence the governing mechanism occurring through the formation of new compound on the surface of the adsorbent 82 babatunde and zhao 72 also found that the pseudo first order model fitted their data well along with the second order model the intra particle diffusion model was also found to play a part but was not the rate limiting step and was most prevalent under high initial p concentrations 72 chittoo and sutherland 21 also found the diffusion chemisorption kinetic model to fit their data well after the pseudo second order model the assumption behind the pseudo first order kinetic model is that only one adsorbate in this case phosphate po4 2 may occupy one site on the adsorbent surface the diffusion chemisorption model is based on the assumption that both diffusion and chemisorption determine adsorption the implication of chemisorption is that the adsorbed pollutant is almost irreversibly bound or cannot be easily desorbed 28 phosphate adsorbed onto alum sludge has also been shown to be almost permanently attached and that it could remain so for a long time 37 39 thus chemisorption mechanism may be a positive or negative depending on the objectives for the adsorption application for example if the goal is to remove pollutants from wastewater by adsorption or to remove phosphorous from a eutrophic water body then permanent attachment of the phosphate to the alum sludge would be desirable however if the goal is to capture and reuse the phosphorous pollutant then irreversible adsorption would be least preferred the issue with using alum sludge as adsorbent in wastewater is on the disposal of the subsequent sludge thus the trend in literature is to reuse the p containing sludge as a form of slow release fertilizer to offset p deficiency in soils especially in tropical and subtropical regions and limit over use of the natural reserves for this non renewable resource as well as to avert eutrophication 2 83 84 the recovered phosphorous could also be used as a source of raw material in the phosphate industry 2 various equilibration times have been reported in literature albeit under varying test conditions as shown by the findings obtained from selected studies given in table 3 the optimum equilibration time for phosphate adsorption on alum sludge is 24 h the variations in the equilibration times are due to differences in experimental conditions that include alum sludge dose initial phosphate concentration agitation solution ph temperature of reaction particle size of alum sludge 20 22 27 59 it is important to note the importance of shaking in increasing the rate of adsorption from the results presented in table 3 the study by mohammed and rashid 59 is the only one that removed phosphate as low as 50 in 24 h with the rest in 7 days probably due to the absence of shaking the other studies involved shaking albeit at different duration or intensities 4 4 adsorption equilibrium isotherm models adsorption isotherm represents the relationship between adsorbent and adsorbate at a fixed temperature under equilibrium conditions and also represents the effect of initial adsorbate concentration as a function of adsorbent dosage 85 the majority of studies on phosphate adsorption by alum sludges have found the langmuir isotherm model to provide the best fit 20 25 40 72 65 86 followed by the freundlich adsorption isotherm model 71 87 this is also typical of other metal hydroxide adsorbents 64 the temkin model was also good 87 while the langmuir freundlich model the two site langmuir model were a better fit than the langmuir in studies by mohammed and rashid 59 and gao et al 1 respectively the langmuir model assumes that effective adsorption is monolayer in nature 20 4 5 thermodynamics of phosphate adsorption gibb s free energy enthalpy and entropy changes are critical variables when estimating the performance of an adsorption desorption process and predicting the mechanism of this process and hence basic parameters to characterize and optimize an adsorption process 85 to further understand the mechanism of phosphate adsorption on alum sludge these thermodynamic parameters were calculated by gao et al 1 the positive value of the enthalpy change δho kj mol as well as the pattern of increasing adsorption capacity with increase in temperature confirmed the endothermic nature of the process the mechanism of phosphate adsorption on alum sludges also involves diffusion into micropores as mentioned before which requires activation energy as these narrow sized pores present an energy barrier to the adsorption process 37 the positive values of entropy change δso kj mol k were a further indication of disorder caused by the adsorption process taking place as temperature increased the values of the standard gibb s free energy δgo kj mol were negative and decreased with increasing temperature range 8 97 at 288 k to 19 99 at 328 k for all the phosphate species studied that include ortho p hexameta p phytate pyro p glycerol p 1 88 the negative gibbs free energy values indicated that the adsorption process of phosphate on alum sludges is a thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous process 4 6 factors affecting adsorption of phosphates on alum sludge adsorbent 4 6 1 effect of ph almost all adsorption studies on alum sludges that were accessed in literature have found that adsorption is highly dependent on ph of the solution and that highest adsorption capacity mostly happens in the acidic ph range of 4 5 5 1 20 21 25 30 36 40 50 63 71 72 although most of these researches studied ortho p this trend has been found to apply for all forms of phosphates 1 a ph below 4 or above 8 decreases phosphate adsorption on alum sludge 25 this trend is particularly so for orthophosphate p which is an inorganic phosphate species tested in most phosphorous adsorption studies by alum sludge orthophosphate p is the most easily and strongly adsorbed phosphate species from aqueous solution by alum sludge 25 63 71 90 orthophosphates have got a small molecular weight in comparison to the other types of phosphates such that they quickly diffuse into the adsorbent material and get adsorbed fastest aluminium hydroxide dominant in alum sludge is amphoteric in nature which results in acid base dissociation of alum sludges 40 as aluminium dissolves back into solution surface charge of aluminium hydroxide which is mainly responsible for phosphorous adsorption is reduced either forming positive or negative charges depending on the surrounding ph when the ph is low h ions dominate the surface of the alum sludge which triggers a release of oh ions into solution creating free active sites for phosphate adsorption the presence of hydroxyl group oh active sites creates a better chance for phosphate oh ligand ion exchange to take place on the surface of the sorbent providing for increased phosphorous adsorption capacity 64 this ligand exchange mechanism was confirmed by liu et al 91 using column tests and is the main mechanism explaining phosphate adsorption on alum 40 likewise under alkaline conditions ph 7 hydroxyl ions oh become dominant in solution which reduces the release of the oh ions from the alum sludge active sites instead the hydroxyl ions outcompete phosphates po4 3 for the active sites on the surface of the alum sludge by forming a counter ion layer surrounding the aluminium ion that reduces p adsorption 20 40 yang et al 40 also found that the zeta potential of the alum sludge studied changed from 75 8 to 33 7 mv which corresponded to a ph change from 4 3 9 0 a positive zeta potential signifies a positive surface charge which occurs when the ph of the suspension is low indicating presence of unsatisfied surface charge that needs to be neutralized by an anionic adsorbate e g cl so4 2 oh humic acids as toc po4 2 ions thus effective use of alum sludges as adsorbent for wastewater treatment would require ph maintenance within the acidic range of 4 6 to ensure the availability of metal hydroxides and a positive surface charge in order to attract anions besides the stability of the functional groups present on the active sites of the sorbent surface that is the surface potential ph influences the surface charge of the adsorbent 27 64 92 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent surface and the type of active centres on the surface are indicated by a significant factor called the point of zero charge phpzc the ph at the point of zero charge for alum sludge is 7 5 40 in the range of ph 2 12 when solution ph phpzc the phosphate adsorption may be affected by the electrostatic repulsion and increasing competitive effect of oh ions for the active sites on the sorbent when ph phpzc the sorbent surface is positively charged favouring adsorption of the anions adsorption process of anions onto alum sludge is also facilitated by electrostatic and chemical attraction onto the positively charged outer surface of the alum sludge 64 this is the reason why most studies on alum sludge have found the best phosphate adsorption at a ph range of 4 5 5 as this is below the phpzc of alum sludge of 7 5 the solution phosphate chemistry is also influenced by ph and also determines adsorption capacity of alum sludges for the anion 27 64 92 electrostatic repulsion is increased when a phosphate of higher negative charge is dominant in the solution for example as ph increases more negatively charged phosphate ions become dominant in solution increasing the repulsion between the phosphate species in solution and the adsorbent surface which is already predominantly negative under these ph conditions adsorption capacity has been noted to decrease at these alkaline ph ranges the phosphate species dominant at various ph values are h3po4 ph 2 15 h2po4 ph 2 15 7 20 hpo4 2 ph 7 2 12 33 and po4 3 at ph 12 34 93 95 the phosphate species h2po4 requires lower energy for adsorption than hpo4 2 such that the former is more easily adsorbed on the adsorbent surface than the later species 95 besides increased competition between phosphates and hydroxyl groups or counter ion layer formed by hydroxyl groups or electrostatic repulsion higher energy requirements for adsorption of the prevailing forms of phosphate under alkaline conditions may also explain the reduced adsorption capacity of alum sludge for phosphates as ph increases from acidic to alkaline ranges 4 6 2 particle size although particle size ranges used by different studies are different and difficult to compare what is common is that much more phosphorous adsorption is favoured with small fine particle size ranges than with bigger sized particles in both batch and column tests 22 42 59 91 96 yang et al 40 also found that in addition to a significant increase in adsorption of phosphorous equilibrium concentration of phosphorous left in solution was also lowered which also shows the extent of the adsorption process in addition lee et al 22 found that the adsorption rate is also much more rapid with fine particles than with bigger particles it took 7 h size 1 18 mm fine particles 24 h 1 18 mm 4 0 mm and more than 24 h 4 00 mm for alum sludges to remove 2 5 g of phosphorous to detection limit at least 50 of the particle size less than 1 18 mm contained particles of size below 0 30 mm ippolito et al 30 reported that particle size of less than 0 15 mm provides greater surface area compared to sizes greater than 2 36 mm even smaller sizes to the nanoscale have been shown to further increase surface area and adsorption capacity for instance nanosized water treatment residue obtained through high energy ball milling yielded 30 times higher maximum adsorption capacity 50 mg p g than the unmilled residue 1 7 mg p g 97 intraparticle diffusion of phosphorous in micropores has been reported in literature 37 72 it has been noted that the intrapore specific surface area for adsorption is 24 times the average size of the adsorbent particles 37 specific surface area also increased with increase in micropore volume this intra particle diffusion mechanism explains the significant increase in maximum po4 3 p adsorption when the particle size is reduced in all of the abovementioned studies thus fine particles can significantly increase the intra pore specific surface area and provide additional adsorption sites in the form of micropores macropores and mesopores this acts to increase the effective area and or contact between adsorbent and adsorbate for po4 3 p adsorption than coarse particles therefore any change in the particle size and surface area of alum sludge will also translate to variations in phosphorous adsorption the emerging trend in the world right now is the use of nanosized materials with a high surface to volume ratio that is high surface area which is known to increase surface reactivity of the substance among other uses 92 98 there is no doubt that particle size of alum sludge can also be manipulated to increase its efficacy as an adsorbent the only difficulty is the lack of a standard size of particles that give the best adsorption as different sources use different size ranges which makes comparison inappropriate however in column experiments there are issues of impeded hydraulic conductivity and possible clogging of suspended materials which can reduce effectiveness of alum sludge acting as a filter substrate and adsorbent 99 4 6 3 retention time this is also known as the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate in this case the phosphorous containing aqueous solution most researchers have found that increasing the retention time of the adsorption process increases removal or adsorption capacity in batch or in fixed bed column experiments 22 42 59 maximum p adsorptions were achieved within 48 h 42 although equilibrium time is mainly 24 h table 2 makris et al 52 amended poultry litter with different rates of alum sludges and found that contact time was not a significant factor for p adsorption bai et al 13 also found phosphate adsorption to be the same for hydraulic retention time of 2 h and 3 h such that 2 h was adopted for further studies aided with stirring as the most efficient time for the process increases in hydraulic retention time in a column study did not result in improvements in phosphate removal in another study 27 the results from babatunde and zhao 72 indicated that contact time needed to achieve equilibrium might be affected by the initial p concentration with more time being required for higher initial p concentration thus even if there is little phosphorous for adsorption it seems that surface adsorption will still prevail and rapidly for that matter regardless of contact time so long other factors are optimal such as the particle size of the alum sludge the temperature ph agitation and presence of competing substances as a result it appears that contact time may not necessarily be an important determining factor alone but these other surrounding factors 4 6 4 competitive anions anions always occur together in the environment and the same applies for phosphates and its competing anions in wastewater 18 95 being of the same charge phosphates and its competing anions are bound to compete with each other for the same sites on a metal cationic surface these competing substances thus interfere with the adsorption of phosphates by alum sludges normally adsorption will favour the anion with a higher valence such as po4 2 so4 2 and co3 2 compared to single charged ones that include cl f or no3 and the order of interference given was so4 2 and co3 2 f cl no3 64 studies looking specifically on aluminium or alum sludges have given somewhat contrasting results there is consensus that no3 and cl have an insignificant effect on phosphate adsorption 40 100 in contrast to li et al 64 sulphates so4 2 have also been found to have an insignificant effect when it comes to aluminium or alum sludges whilst fluorides and hydroxide monovalent anions have a superior affinity for aluminium or alum sludges 40 100 the study by li et al 64 was a review on phosphate adsorption onto various types and sources of metal hydr oxides this pattern indicated replacement of these functional groups from the alum sludge surface by phosphates the order of decreasing competitive strength or affinity for aluminium reported by diamadopoulos and benedek 100 is oh f po4 2 so4 2 cl no3 humic substances also fall in the same category with cl and no3 in terms of competitive strength 40 69 91 phosphate adsorption from wastewater has also been shown to be hampered by the presence of carbonates but insignificantly affected by chlorides nitrites no2 and nitrates on other adsorbents such as iron modified biochar or mg al ldh functionalized biochar 18 95 carbonates inhibit phosphate adsorption by increasing ph of solution 101 however there is no consensus on the effect of sulphates as explained in section 4 6 1 phosphate adsorption decreases as hydrolysis of aluminium increases with increase in ph to the alkaline range this shows that hydroxyl ions if present have a greater tendency to attract to aluminium than phosphates for aluminium al3 mortula and gagnon 102 found that phosphate removal in aquaculture process water and deionized water spiked with orthophosphates was comparable at ph of 6 48 this finding showed that the presence of competing ions did not affect phosphate adsorption by alum sludges tested but pointed towards the inferior competitive strength of most anions present in the aquaculture wastewater conclusively nitrates and chlorides are weaker competitors whilst carbonates and fluorides are stronger competitors than phosphates for aluminium as given by li et al 95 sulphates have a larger ionic radius than chlorides nitrates or nitrites such that they are strongly associated with the positively charged aluminium ion along with the h2po4 which induces competition fluoride has a strong electronegativity and so it is easily combined with the protonated adsorbent surface than phosphate 95 4 6 5 dosage of adsorbent increasing the dosage of alum sludge can improve p removal capacity 13 63 this is because the quantity of active sites or total surface area for adsorption to take place also increases however this increase in p removal capacity is only up to a certain dosage or limit and variable from one study to another for instance 5 g l 47 10 g l 47 50 g l 59 12 g l 20 the very high limit of 50 g l might have been due to the absence of shaking in the experiments the same study also had the longest equilibration time table 2 shaking increases mobility of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent as well as helps to open up more sites for adsorption to take place 103 after the limit is reached p removal becomes constant and then decreases and this trend applied to all the initial phosphate concentrations in the study by babatunde et al 27 in addition as alum sludge dose increases specific p uptake decreases 47 thus increasing the alum sludge dosage for the same initial phosphate concentration serves to make the whole phosphate adsorption process inefficient per gram of adsorbent 27 the phosphate is only distributed on the available sites and some sites are left unoccupied though overall p removal capacity is increased or high also the gradient of phosphate concentration is lowered around the alum sludge particle surface which results in reduced specific adsorption on per mass of the water treatment sludge 13 47 increasing dosage of alum sludge increased the al ion content which resulted in higher adsorption of phosphates 65 al ion content affects adsorption because of ligand exchange mechanism as more al means more functional groups that can be exchanged for p on the surface according to yang et al 40 hence most studies have found that phosphate adsorption increases as dosage of alum sludge is increased but these upper limit dosages are different probably because of other confounding factors such as particle size of the alum sludge used contact time initial phosphate concentrations shaking duration speed and or intensity among others also this could simply be due to some of the studies not increasing the dosage to a point where further increases do not effect any change in phosphate adsorbed therefore there is need for an optimization study to determine the optimum dosage of alum sludge based adsorbent of a particular optimum particle size al content and form to be used for a measured amount of phosphates to achieve effective and efficient phosphate adsorption from aqueous solution 4 6 6 temperature adsorption capacity increases as temperature rises and this applies to all forms of phosphates 1 22 104 temperature also increases the initial rate of adsorption reaction but after prolonged contact time removal efficiency becomes similar 22 generally temperature also reduces the time required to reach equilibrium in phosphate adsorption by various adsorbents 92 at a temperature of 30 2 c and 40 2 c the maximum adsorption rate for p were 0 685 0 084 and 0 870 0 021 mg p g alum sludge min 22 more temperature levels by lee et al 22 would have allowed for analysis in order to conclude on the results these two data points give a preliminary indication that temperature speeds the initial rate of reaction but over prolonged time the different temperatures give similar results typical of phosphate adsorption reactions all these results point towards the endothermic nature of phosphate adsorption by alum sludges the positive value of the enthalpy change δh kj mol confirmed the endothermic nature of the process 1 as explained by gao et al 1 increasing temperature reduces the viscosity of the solution which then enhances the diffusion of the adsorbate molecules across the boundary layer and into the pores of the adsorbent rendering an increased adsorption capacity devi and saroha 28 also reported that increased temperature causes a swelling effect in the internal structure of the adsorbent which makes it easy for molecules to enter and so increased adsorption capacity however the effect of temperature on adsorption capacity should not be overemphasized because this increase is most probably only dependent on other adsorbent characteristics such as particle size and whether the surface area for adsorption is high or not studies may be needed to really ascertain the effect of temperature on adsorption capacity and the degree of this effect using both fine and coarse particle sizes in practice energy intensive processes may be undesirable due to costs and issues of global warming depending on the source of energy 4 6 7 age storage time of alum sludge fresh alum sludge slurry was collected every 1 2 h from clarifiers constituting about 1 of total sludge volume aged for up to 5 days by storing it at room temperature while mixing at 30 rpm 105 slow mixing was so as to prevent breaking up of sludge particles and to prevent anaerobic conditions and the changes that might accrue as a result the authors found that increasing the age of alum sludge from day 0 to day 5 significantly reduced p sorption capacities especially for orthophosphates 105 other authors also found this same pattern 106 107 contrasting results are also present 46 100 the study by yang et al 46 was long term 0 day up to 18 months using actual dewatered alum sludges air dried and specifically focusing on the effect of ageing on the structure of alum sludge and its p adsorption capacity and found marginal effects there was insignificant change to the structure and properties of the alum sludge and so to its adsorption capacity the studies by galarneau et al 105 georgantas et al 106 and berkowitz et al 107 were done using wet alum sludge sludge before drying maher et al 104 also used wet alum sludge and found that adsorption capacity for soluble reactive phosphorous decreased by 43 by day 43 while total reactive phosphorous showed marginal reductions hence it can be concretely concluded that the age of actual dried alum sludge will not likely affect its p adsorption capacity however a more solid comparative study done under same experimental conditions is necessary to ascertain effect of age on the adsorption of phosphorous under aqueous and dry sludge environment 4 6 8 initial phosphorous concentration the majority of studies on phosphate adsorption by alum sludge agree that maximum p adsorbed by alum sludge increases with increasing initial p concentration 72 104 108 this trend applies to all the different p species that include pyrophosphate orthophosphate and glycerophosphate 109 further there is higher adsorption rate at higher initial p concentrations than at low concentrations babatunde and zhao 72 found the intraparticle rate constants to increase from 0 0075 mg p per gram per min at 5 mg initial p l to 0 1795 mg p per gram per min at 60 mg initial p l intraparticle diffusion mechanism was rate controlling step at high initial concentrations of phosphates 72 hence optimization studies should determine the best possible and efficient combination of phosphate source to be mixed with a pre determined adsorbent dosage of a particular size and form 4 6 9 agitation shaking speed an increase in agitation speed 150 250 rpm was found to increase adsorption capacity rate of adsorption and initial rate of adsorption compared to an increase from 250 350 rpm 21 higher shaking speeds above 350 rpm did not yield further changes to the above parameters in the same study this phenomenon had also been reported by other authors albeit looking at other kinds of adsorbents and adsorbates 103 110 111 these findings indicate that the absence of shaking prolongs the time to reach equilibrium as shown in table 2 whereby the longest time to equilibrium was 6 days in a study by mohammed and rashid 59 it is clear that shaking agitation stirring or mixing impact on the adsorption capacity and its rate of occurrence however different shaking times and speeds are used in studies such that for practical application purposes it is important to recommend optimal shaking conditions factoring in other influencing factors agitation would help in situations when there is high influent flow to a wastewater treatment system for example during high rainfall events when there is high stormwater runoff maximum phosphate adsorption can be reached in the shortest possible time agitation can either be hydraulic or mechanical but care should be taken to avoid flow patterns that cause stratification and thus non uniform mixing and reduced contact between adsorbent and adsorbate baffled basins are some of the most commonly used 5 desorption regeneration and recovery desorption and regeneration of adsorbents are the most difficult and expensive parts of an adsorption technology which can take up at least 70 of the total costs for operation and maintenance of the system 112 the objectives of desorption regeneration exercises are to recover the adsorbent or adsorbate depending on their market demand desorption restore the adsorbent back to its initial properties for effective reuse regeneration and so reduce the overall process cost of the adsorption process desorption can also help in the understanding of the adsorption mechanism 28 the exercises also allow for proper disposal of either constituent researches on p saturated alum sludge desorption regeneration is very scarce of the few studies accessed in literature they were mostly looking at p availability and extraction from agricultural soils or lake sediments amended with water treatment residues and even fewer from alum sludge used as adsorbent in aqueous solutions or substrates alum sludge can be desorbed of bound p by manipulating the ph conditions 39 108 113 an acid base extraction experiment was performed by zhao and zhao 114 for p extraction and found that all the acids tested exhibited the highest desorption efficiencies at increased p concentrations while the bases were effective at low concentrations however there was no significant difference between 0 075 m and 0 01 m concentrations of either base or acid sulphuric acid h2so4 was then chosen as the most efficient agent for p extraction when factoring in issues of cost convenience and safety as well the other acids tested were hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3 and the bases were naoh and koh optimization studies found p extraction efficiency of 98 under alum sludge dose of 5633 8 mg l and h2so4 concentration of 0 063 m 114 other studies on oxyanions desorption from sludge based adsorbents have found the process to favour base extraction or alkaline conditions for example a study by zhou and haynes 115 it appears only one desorption cycle was used to effect above 90 and around 65 p extraction using the acids and bases respectively studies are required to investigate the extent of regeneration for alum sludge to make inference on the cost effectiveness of its use for practical application alum sludges amended or composited with organic matter prior to p adsorption resulted in a significantly greater release of p from the cowshed wastewater amended alum sludge than alum sludge alone yielding concentrations of 31 8 and 0 2 mg soluble reactive p kg solid respectively 108 organic matter probably inhibited the formation of strong binding of phosphates to the adsorption sites making them easily desorbed alum sludges contain large amounts of amorphous al which has been shown to be strongly correlated to high p sorption 27 96 the results in a characterization study on 15 water treatment residuals in south africa showed elevated amounts of amorphous al oxides and also ca 12 the authors concluded that the sorbed p would be retained in forms unavailable for plant uptake the implication of these findings is that phosphorous bound to alum sludges cannot be available again in the environment naturally unless there are changes to the surroundings especially in terms of ph desorption occurred in the presence of sulphuric acid to recover 97 p and 99 al from a dewatered alum sludge cake that was being used as substrate in a constructed wetland the p and al laden leachate that was produced was then precipitated using a base to form alpo4 the alpo4 can be a raw material in the phosphate industry or a fertilizer in agriculture there is need for more research using various alum sludges to ascertain the production efficiency of the alpo4 the optimized conditions for production its purity for use in agriculture and the cost effectiveness if applied at a large scale phosphorous p is a macronutrient essential for all living organisms but it is also a finite resource which can get used up from its main non renewable source raw material phosphate rock coupled with increasing human population growth and no alternative for phosphorous the demand for phosphate rock to provide phosphorous will increase probably even exceeding its supply in addition p use efficiency is low with just between 15 and 20 of applied phosphorous being consumed by the plant or animal life and the rest becoming lost in the waste generated thereof the phosphorous present in these wastes poses a threat to the environment for example as eutrophication hence the capture and slow release of phosphorous by alum sludge based fertilizers may offer a solution to these challenges 6 drawbacks of alum sludge use as adsorbent for phosphate and counteracting measures the specific surface area of alum sludge is considerably low 121 1 98 3m2 g alum sludge when compared to that of commercial conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon for instance 200 300 g m2 activated alumina or 600 2000g m2 activated carbon as mentioned in section 3 1 this also applies to other sludge based adsorbents 28 surface area has been found to increase by activation reducing particle size to nanoscale and purification that is removal of impurities of the precursor sludge 28 58 97 116 although some have found alum sludges as well as other metal oxides or hydroxides to have significantly higher p removal relative to their activated forms for example activated alumina the adsorption reactions tend to be highly ph dependent and limited by adsorbent characteristics 95 117 the bound phosphate ions cannot be easily recovered from alum sludge for other environmentally sustainable uses such as source of phosphorous based fertilizer activation of raw materials has always worked to increase surface area of various adsorbents to more than double or triple the original surface area 28 56 95 117 118 raw alum sludges calcined at 300 c removed organic inorganic matter impurities that are normally agglomerated to raw alum sludges and increased its surface area resulting in a 5 4 8 7 times greater adsorption capacity for arsenate v than unmodified alum sludge 118 however several studies have established that calcination temperature is critical with high temperatures reducing the surface area instead 95 119 jeon et al 118 also found that alum sludge structure changed from being amorphous to crystalline with temperatures above 300 c which reduced its surface area for adsorption this phenomenon was also reported in a review of various sludge based adsorbents by devi and saroha 28 whereby an increase in activation agent to sludge ratio beyond certain optimum levels reduced the surface area due to destruction of microporosity from pore wall damage using thermal sol gel method activated alumina with high purity was produced from raw alum sludge and successfully removed 96 fluoride from aqueous solution and the adsorption capacity was higher than commercial nano alumina 120 however there was no comparison made to the parent unmodified alum sludge adsorption capacity in the study by aghapour et al 120 also the yield of activated alumina from the parent alum sludge was only 38 5 also the yield of activated alumina from the parent alum sludge was only 38 5 thermal sol gel is a chemical activation technique mostly used to produce metal oxides of higher purity and abilities than the parent materials the method uses a chemical agent in a hydrolysis step that yields a solution of the precursor that later becomes a gel a poly condensation stage follows that is normally done using thermal means to improve structural ability and mechanical properties in the study by aghapour et al 120 the process involved alum recovery by sulphuric acid treatment then preparation of al oh 3 gel by addition of naoh solution followed by calcination for 2 h in air at 700 c it has been determined that activated metal oxide product normally has a higher point of zero charge which ensures that adsorption is optimal at a wider ph range 95 jeon et al 118 also found that the adsorption capacity of alum sludge calcined at 300 c did not change markedly across a wider range of ph range than the uncalcined sludge aluminium based materials other than alum sludge have been used as precursor raw material with other materials such as biochar chitosan metal doped mesoporous silica metal impregnated pre formed mesoporous silicas or as stand alone mesoporous metal oxides or hydroxides or sulphates to produce composite 11 95 118 121 122 wang et al 60 and zawrah et al 62 successfully recycled alum sludge for producing nano al oh 3 and iron oxy hydroxide feo oh and layered double hydroxides ldhs the synthesised alum sludge based ldhs have yet to be assessed for application in various uses however al containing ldhs have been combined with biochar and then used for phosphate adsorption 122 123 these al containing ldh biochar composites have been found to reach equilibrium in 50 min to 1 h achieve almost 100 removal efficiency for phosphates reach adsorption capacity of 410 mg p g with higher regeneration and desorption capacity and greater selectivity for phosphate in the presence of competing ions than alum sludge alone 109 117 this high regeneration and desorption capacity implies that the adsorbents can act as capture and release agents for the bound phosphate this feature is being exploited and explored so as to use these composites as a source of phosphate in soils that are p deficient as mentioned earlier however no consensus has been reached yet on the structural stability of the composites under various ph conditions it is highly difficult to separate out a powdered adsorbent from an effluent at large scale to allow for commercial application of most adsorbents alum sludge in constructed wetlands has been studied as a source of low cost substitute substrate to act as a filter media and phosphorous removal agent concerns were on metal leaching natural organic matter release and clogging by suspended solids clogging is an issue because the best adsorption of alum sludge has been achieved using fine particle size fine particle size is one parameter responsible for clogging and reduced hydraulic conductivity resulting in surface ponding and eventually normal operation is disrupted 124 hence there is a need to balance between high adsorption capacity and improved hydraulic conductivity to ensure a longer lifespan of the constructed wetland modification by granulation shows great promise in improving hydraulic conductivity in a filtration system to reduce clogging and to allow for easy recovery of the adsorbents 123 125 128 granulation also reduced bioaccessibility of heavy metals 99 however granulated drinking water treatment residual was shown to have a lower adsorption capacity than the parent powdered form 99 more research is required to explore the usefulness of granulating alum sludge for wastewater treatment 7 summary conclusions and recommendations for future research directions most of the alum sludge adsorption studies were carried out as laboratory based batch studies and few as fixed bed or continuous flow through column experiments mostly using synthetic phosphate solutions and synthetic or actual secondary municipal wastewater these studies have mostly been performed under varying experimental and environmental conditions which makes it difficult to adopt results from one study and use them elsewhere also the quality of the alum sludge from different places is highly variable such that a use that is applicable for a certain sludge may not be feasible for another this scenario makes it difficult to develop a crosscutting alum sludge based solution that can be applied anywhere regardless of the alum sludge used or conditions of application alum sludge is a potentially good adsorbent for phosphates in wastewater adsorption capacity ranges from 2 to 43 mg p g alum sludge the adsorption kinetics follow the pseudo second order model while the langmuir adsorption isotherm had the best fit in more than 80 of the studies accessed equilibrium adsorption is generally reached between 10 min and 24 h with shaking phosphate adsorption by alum sludges occurs by ligand exchange mechanism anion exchange and electrostatic attractions in the rapid phase followed by intraparticle diffusion and chemical precipitation in the slow phase its efficacy for commercial large scale application is limited by several drawbacks specific surface area of raw alum sludge is considerably low 121 1 98 3 m2 g phosphate adsorption by raw alum sludge is affected by several hindering factors especially ph presence of inorganic organic material on its surface particle size sludge dosage in column applications its use is affected by its particle size and form which can cause clogging regeneration has been shown to be low as well as phosphate desorption desorption of bound p can be improved by prior binding of organic matter to alum sludge and ph manipulation otherwise phosphates can remain bound for years at ph range of 5 9 the following areas are recommended for future research to improve the efficacy of alum sludges especially for practical application in the near future there is need to standardize the characteristics of a good adsorbent in general for phosphate removal to allow for benchmarking and future comparisons enhancing adsorption capacity of alum sludge by way of removing impurities concentrating the active ingredients and increasing surface area for adsorption there may also be need to evaluate the water treatment plant processes and chemicals so as to yield an alum sludge with higher potential benefits for later reuse development of alum sludge based materials that balance between size of particles for adsorption and increased hydraulic conductivity to prevent clogging if used as filter media for practical application there is also need for an adsorbent with better characteristics and structural stability under real life conditions but can be produced at reasonable costs with minimal adverse environmental effects efficacy of granulation to prevent metal leakage from alum sludge should also be studied research is needed to come up with either an optimal alum sludge based compound or synthesis method that can be effectively and universally recommended for effective adsorption of phosphates and other pollutants in wastewater for commercial application as a filter media and or adsorbent this would allow easy replication and large scale production anywhere regardless of alum sludge quality the way conventional adsorbents such as activated carbons are used more desorption regeneration studies of alum sludge adsorbents used in wastewater treatment are required declaration of competing interest the authors

limits the photoactivity to the ultraviolet uv region 2 5 11 efforts have been devoted to extend the optical response of tio2 from uv into the visible light in various strategies such as doping with

supports for catalysts conductive linkers and photosensitizer 19 24 carbon nitrides in particular have become one of the most intensively researched materials because photocatalytic activity has been described under visible light illumination 20 25 26 carbon nitrides are a large family of materials with variable composition and structure ranging from amorphous carbon materials a c3n4 that are lightly n doped to fully crystalline graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 27 28 these materials are generally found to have high thermal stability are resistant to oxidation and hydrolysis and are biocompatible photocatalytic properties have been described for a number of phases and compositions with various sites proposed for catalytic activity colors range from brown to light yellow with measured band gaps typically about 2 7 ev which could absorb visible light up to 460 nm 29 however the photocatalytic efficiency of all carbon nitride materials is limited due to the high recombination probability of photogenerated electron hole pairs and their activity under uv is much less than tio2 30 31 in order to improve photocatalytic activity one strategy is to use a composite of two or more semiconductor photocatalysts that absorb different regions of the solar spectrum 32 composite semiconductors can also improve electron hole separation due to band off sets and charge transfer across interfaces examples are known incorporating coupling carbon nitrides such as g c3n4 with other semiconductor materials that increase the charge separation efficiency 33 35 including composites of g c3n4 and tio2 36 40 li et al reported the preparation of g c3n4 tio2 using melamine and a sol gel method followed by calcination leading to good photoactivities for the degradation of

workers reported the synthesis of carbon nitride sub microspheres using microwave irradiation shows that time and energy consumption can be reduced over 30 times using microwave as compared with solvothermal method 41 and yu et al has reported the carbon nitride formation from rapid microwave irradiation of melamine and carbon fibre as raw materials provided large surface area few stacking layers large aspect ratio and an enlarged bandgap 42 many researches have reported on c3n4 tio2 due to its ability to improve photocatalytic performance however all reported composites between c3n4 with tio2 use graphitic g c3n4 and no work is reported on the synthesis and study of amorphous carbon nitride a c3n4 with tio2 for photocatalytic improvement a c3n4 structurally has short range order but long range disorder giving it distinct mechanical optical electronic and magnetic properties kang et al has reported an a c3n4 material with lower bandgap energy 1 9 ev as compared to g c3n4 2 7 ev suggesting potential as a visible light active photocatalyst 43 therefore in this work we report a direct microwave heating method to synthesize a c3n4 using urea hybridize with tio2 for the photocatalytic degradation of rr4 using the direct coupling of urea and microwaves at 2 45 ghz allows preparation of the composite in a single step no additional calcination step or processing is required the composites are shown to exhibit visible light photocatalytic degradation of reactive red 4 rr4 dye which is improved by broad band illumination incorporating uv light 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods p25 tio2 was obtained from degussa urea from fluka and reactive red rr4 dye also known as cibacron brilliant red colour index number 18105 λ max 517 nm from sigma aldrich ultra pure water was used to prepare all solutions microwave reactions were undertaken using a domestic microwave oven samsung me711 k 800 w 2 45 ghz chemicals were used as received and reactions were performed under air 2 2 synthesis of a c3n4 tio2 composite the a c3n4 tio2 was synthesized by using microwave irradiation method 8 the appropriate amount of tio2 7 g 87 5 mmol and urea 3 g 50 mmol was undergoes mechanical mixing using ball mill for 5 min the mixed powder was placed into a conical flask in a semi closed reactor and heated under microwave at 800 w for 30 min under air and then allowed to cool to room temperature the final light yellow powder sample was collected without further treatment 2 3 materials characterization methods pxrd data was acquired using a rigaku miniflex ii desktop x ray diffractometer nitrogen adsorption desorption porosimetry was used to calculate the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area uv druvs was acquired on a perkin elmer spectrophotometer model lambda 35 equipped with diffuse reflectance attachment over the wavelength range 200 800 nm ft ir was recorded on ftir spectrometer perkin elmer frontier from 4000 to 600 cm 1 c and n content were determined by elemental analysis xps analysis was undertaken using an omicron nanotechnology els5000 system using al kα radiation at a base pressure below 5 5 10 9 torr curve fitting was performed using casaxps software version 2 3 16 and energy calibrated to the carbon 1 s peak at 284 6 ev photoluminescent pl analysis model joblin yvon hr800 uv with 346 nm of excitation wavelength was carried out for the electron hole recombination detection scanning electron microscopy sem using leo supla 50 v p and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem under fei tecnai 20 tem were used to examine morphology and microstructure respectively 2 4 photocatalysis the photocatalytic performance of a c3n4 tio2 and pristine tio2 were compared for the degradation of rr4 dye under visible light irradiation photodegradation activity fig 1 was carried out by suspending 0 03 g of photocatalyst in 25 ml of an aqueous 0 3 mm solution of rr4 dye this suspension was then poured into a glass cell of dimension 50 mm width 10 depth 80 high and irradiated with a 20 w white color led lamp of irradiance 237 w m 2 with the wavelength is between 200 380 nm an aquarium pump model ns 7200 was used as an aeration source for the supply of oxygen during each photocatalytic experiment the decolorization of rr4 was determined at specific time intervals until a steady state or complete decolorization was achieved the absorbance was measured using an hach dr 1900 spectrophotometer at 517 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst synthesis and characterization direct microwave heating requires coupling of the microwave electric field with at least one component of a reaction mixture and the coupling is temperature dependent at room temperature a mixture of urea and tio2 will only result in heating of the urea component because coupling of tio2 only occurs at temperatures in excess of ca 600 c 44 the size of the load is also important so that sufficient volumetric heating occurs and therefore reactions were performed on a gram scale to induce sufficient heating carbon nitride formation is most commonly achieved in open vessels via polymerisation of urea precursor which is associated with loss of by products and some urea 45 on exposure of the urea tio2 mixture to microwaves the reaction rapidly heats and was exposed continually for 30 min to obtain a pale yellow solid typical of carbon nitride materials 46 elemental analysis was carried out in order to determine the quantity the c and n elements in the photocatalyst as the result shows that a c3n4 tio2 was found to be 1 05 and 1 60 wt for c and n respectively table 1 this result was confirmed that the existence of a c3n4 incorporated with the tio2 xps analysis was undertaken to provide additional information on the oxidation state and speciation of c and n moieties a survey spectrum fig 2 a shows peaks at 285 1 403 6 and 531 1 ev attributable to c n and o respectively the c 1s spectrum fig 2b shows three peaks centered at 284 6 286 7 and 288 5 ev which are consistent with those observed for other carbon nitrides 47 50 the peak located at 284 6 ev can be assigned to the cc or adventitious carbon and the peak at 288 5 ev to an ncn group the peak at 286 7 ev has several interpretations including cn co species e g hnco due to incomplete polymerization or interaction with the metal oxide support 45 the n 1s spectrum fig 2c shows significant peaks at 400 2 and 404 8 ev the peak at 400 2 ev is commonly attributed to n3c in carbon nitride materials although binding energies above 400 ev are also commonly assigned as interstitial n o species in doped tio2 51 55 the peak at 404 8 ev is not commonly observed in carbon nitrides and is often attributed to nitrogen species bound to various surface oxygen site such as no no2 or nox 56 again perhaps indicative of interaction between a carbon nitride species and the tio2 substrate powder x ray diffraction pxrd data were compared for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 fig 3 a which are essentially identical all peaks for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 were assigned to anatase and rutile phases indicating that no phase transformation was observed of tio2 on microwave heating the phase transformation of non metal doped tio2 was observed by zhang et al 57 to occur above 800 c while p25 tio2 has a reported transition temperature of anatase to rutile of 600 800 c indicates an upper limit on the reaction temperature of ca 600 c 58 fourier transformed infrared ft ir spectroscopy fig 4 of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 show additional signals for a c3n4 tio2 which are consistent with known carbon nitride materials peaks attributable to cn heterocycle and cn stretching vibration mode are observed in the region 1449 cm 1 and 1642 cm 1 respectively 40 it should be noted that a peak at 1638 cm 1 is also attributable to the ti o bonding structure 59 and that there is overlap with crystalline urea fig 3 suggesting co moieties may still be present furthermore there is no clear signal at ca 810 cm 1 that is usually characteristic of a s triazine breathing mode observed in condensed carbon nitride polymers such as g c3n4 and there are clearly nh signals observed at 3360 and 3227 cm 1 60 therefore collectively the elemental analysis xps and ir indicate that the carbon nitride material is best described as an incompletely condensed amorphous material with an overall ratio of c3n4 but containing significant co and nh functionality surface area of p 25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 table 1 was determined by n2 adsorption which shows a decrease from ca 49 to 42 m2 g 1 respectively which is likely due to some sintering and occlusion of micropores between tio2 nanoparticles by carbon nitride material the uv druvs of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 fig 5 a show the absorption edge of p25 tio2 is at ca 400 nm whereas for a c3n4 tio2 the edge is red shifted to ca 430 nm condensed carbon nitrides are typically reported to have onset of absorption at ca 460 nm giving a band gap of 2 7 ev again indicating that incomplete condensation has occurred for a c3n4 tio2 according to tauc and menth 61 the absorption coefficient can be described as a function of incident photon energy stated in eq 1 1 αhν 2 a hν eg where α is the absorption coefficient cm 1 a is a constant hν ev the energy of excitation and eg the bandgap energy the bandgap energy was determined from a tauc plot fig 5b by extrapolation to the photon energy axis to give a bandgap energy table 1 for p25 tio2 of 3 02 ev and for a c3n4 tio2 of 2 9 ev the observed optical spectra for a c3n4 tio2 could simply be a superposition of tio2 and a carbon nitride based material however the observed spectrum is also consistent with some n surface doping 62 63 which is partially supported by the xps n 1s peak at 404 ev the surface morphology structure is important and can modify the photocatalytic performances of photocatalyst fig 6 a d show the images of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 at different magnifications it looks like the particles are in spherical shape for both samples the hrtem of a c3n4 tio2 in fig 6e and 6f show a ca 2 4 nm coating that is not observed for p25 tio2 the lack of lattice fringes is consistent with an amorphous material according to nawi et al too thick a carbon coat on tio2 reduces the photocatalytic activity due to less light adsorption whereas 2 4 nm will allow light penetration 64 fig 7 compares the photoluminescence pl spectra of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 photoluminescence is greatest for p25 tio2 indicating that emission is suppressed for a c3n4 tio2 which is consistent with charge separation limiting recombination photoluminescence is the result of electron hole recombination emission the high photoluminescence spectra might be in resulting the high of electron hole recombination occurred in the photocatalyst as can see in fig 7 the lower pl intensity was observed of a c3n4 tio2 sample as compared with p25 tio2 with the maximum peaks intensity were 510 and 1100 respectively instead of normal comparing pl intensity by the highest maximum peak of each spectrum used by other workers we proposed more utilized pl spectrum in both samples we suggested a total peak area may the best way of calculation prediction the electron hole recombination rate as calculated based on eq 2 2 a 0 a b 100 where a0 and ab is total peak area of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 respectively table 1 shows the peak area values for both samples based on the calculation the amount of electrons hole recombination of a c3n4 tio2 was reduced 5 1 times as compared to p25 tio2 sample this means that the excited electron has able to be inhibited by amorphous carbon nitride hence the free and active hole h is able to react with water forming hydroxyl radical for oxidation hence a c3n4 with low bandgap energy 2 9 ev does not only acted as electron injector for tio2 under visible light region and though it becomes electron hole recombination inhibitor for a c3n4 tio2 sample 3 2 photocatalytic studies the photocatalytic activity was investigated for the degradation of rr4 dye using p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 irradiated using a white led lamp as light source 400 nm wavelength fig 8 a shows the percentage of rr4 remaining under 15 min interval led lamp radiation it was observed that essentially complete decolourization of rr4 occurs over 60 min for a c3n4 tio2 this supports absorption of visible light as shown by the druvs data where the bandgap energy reduced towards the visible light response about 61 8 of rr4 remaining occurred at 30 min of p25 tio2 was confirmed due to the rr4 absorbed p25 tio2 surface as where it shows the same pattern from adsorption study on fig 8b however the percentage remaining was slightly reduced to 50 after 60 min irradiation time this could be due to the high bandgap energy 3 2 ev with less visible light irradiation adsorbed on p25 tio2 meanwhile the photodegradation of a c3n4 tio2 was also compared with a c3n4 which prepared under same condition without present of tio2 fig s1 with 78 photodegradation of rr4 photodegradation rate for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 is shown in fig 8c was calculated based on pseudo first order rate constant equation 3 where from the photocatalytic degradation rate k calculation it shows that photodegradation rate for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 samples were 0 0785 and 0 0149 min 1 respectively meaning that photodegradation rate of a c3n4 tio2 is 5 3 times faster than p25 tio2 this comparison seems almost the same with the comparison rate calculated from electron hole recombination discussed earlier hence strongly supported that the presence of amorphous carbon nitride in a c3n4 tio2 is acted as the electron hole inhibitor obviously it seems that amorphous carbon nitride is really worked as dual functions which are electron hole recombination inhibitor and also as electron injector this eventually increased the hydroxyl radical by allowing an active h to be reacted with h2o the hydroxyl radical then reacted with rr4 dye and degraded this organic molecule to become decolorized as well observed in fig 8a the effect of initial concentration of rr4 was conducted using 0 05 0 1 0 3 and 0 6 mm and the results are shown in fig s2a as expected the photocatalytic activity of rr4 dye decreased after increasing the concentration rr4 dye this probably due to the intense color at high concentration caused the light screening effect that retarded the penetration of light into the surface of the photocatalyst and this eventually decreased the efficiency of the photocatalyst and thereby reduced the formation of oh and o2 radicals the effect of catalyst loading for the photodegradation of rr4 was carried out in the range of loading between 0 01 0 09 g at constant condition of 0 3 mm solution of rr4 dye as shown in fig s2b the optimum catalyst loading was consumed by 0 03 g further addition of photocatalyst seemed to reduce the photodegradation of rr4 the excessive loading probably produces greater turbidity in the system which reducing light penetration and inhibited the reaction process the ph potential at zero charge phpzc was conducted in order to explained the behavior of amphoteric of a c3n4 tio2 as depicted in fig s3a the phpzc for a c3n4 tio2 was obtained 4 5 which indicate that the surface a c3n4 tio2 is positively charged in acidic ph ph 4 5 and negatively charged in alkaline ph ph 4 5 as a consequence of tio2 surface at ph 4 5 and above is negatively charged hence repulsive force dominates between negative tio2 surface and rr4 anions noticeably the highest the photodegradation of rr4 for a c3n4 tio2 was obtained at ph 2 as can be observed in fig s3b which in line with the value of phpzc the degree of mineralization during photodegradation of rr4 was investigated using total organic carbon toc and biological oxygen demand bod5 as can be seen in fig 9 it was observed that the level of toc and bod5 drastically reduced to 92 17 and 84 76 respectively after undergoes 60 min of photodegradation under led lamp irradiation the result demonstrated that this photocatalytic system probably can convert rr4 dye from non biodegradable organics into biodegradable forms 65 4 conclusions microwave irradiation has been used to prepare a photocatalyst that is active for visible light degradation of organic dye the composition of the photocatalyst is complex and based on ftir xps pxrd and elemental analysis is best described as tio2 supporting an amorphous layer of c3n4 which contains carbonyl and amino functionality the thin amorphous carbon nitride is coated on the tio2 particle with 2 5 3 9 nm thicknesses a low bandgap energy 2 9 ev as well as less electron hole recombination for a c3n4 tio2 makes this composit photocatalysts has excellent photoactivity under low intensity visible light irradiation 273 w m 2 notwithstanding the complexity of the carbon nitride like material the synthetic process is simple occurring in one step and photocatalytic activity is improved in comparison to p25 tio2 under visible light demonstrating that microwave synthesis is a promising simple and cost effective method for application to the development of new photocatalysts declaration of competing interest the authors

allowed to cool to room temperature the final light yellow powder sample was collected without further treatment 2 3 materials characterization methods pxrd data was acquired using a rigaku miniflex

was carried out for the electron hole recombination detection scanning electron microscopy sem using leo supla 50 v p and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem under fei tecnai 20 tem were used to examine morphology and microstructure respectively 2 4 photocatalysis the photocatalytic performance of a c3n4 tio2 and pristine tio2 were compared for the degradation of rr4 dye under visible light irradiation photodegradation activity fig 1 was carried out by suspending 0 03 g of photocatalyst in 25 ml of an aqueous 0 3 mm solution of rr4 dye this suspension was then poured into a glass cell of dimension 50 mm width 10 depth 80 high and irradiated with a 20 w white color led lamp of irradiance 237 w m 2 with the wavelength is between 200 380 nm an aquarium pump model ns 7200 was used as an aeration source for the supply of oxygen during each photocatalytic experiment the decolorization of rr4 was determined at specific time intervals until a steady state or complete decolorization was achieved the absorbance was measured using an hach dr 1900 spectrophotometer at 517 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst synthesis and characterization direct microwave heating requires coupling of the microwave electric field with at least one component of a reaction mixture and the coupling is temperature dependent at room temperature a mixture of urea and tio2 will only result in heating of the urea component because coupling of tio2 only occurs at temperatures in excess of ca 600 c 44 the size of the load is also important so that sufficient volumetric heating occurs and therefore reactions were performed on a gram scale to induce sufficient heating carbon nitride formation is most commonly achieved in open vessels via polymerisation of urea precursor which is associated with loss of by products and some urea 45 on exposure of the urea tio2 mixture to microwaves the reaction rapidly heats and was exposed continually for 30 min to obtain a pale yellow solid typical of carbon nitride materials 46 elemental analysis was carried out in order to determine the quantity the c and n elements in the photocatalyst as the result shows that a c3n4 tio2 was found to be 1 05 and 1 60 wt for c and n respectively table 1 this result was confirmed that the existence of a c3n4 incorporated with the tio2 xps analysis was undertaken to provide additional information on the oxidation state and speciation of c and n moieties a survey spectrum fig 2 a shows peaks at 285 1 403 6 and 531 1 ev attributable to c n and o respectively the c 1s spectrum fig 2b shows three peaks centered at 284 6 286 7 and 288 5 ev which are consistent with those observed for other carbon nitrides 47 50 the peak located at 284 6 ev can be assigned to the cc or adventitious carbon and the peak at 288 5 ev to an ncn group the peak at 286 7 ev has several interpretations including cn co species e g hnco due to incomplete polymerization or interaction with the metal oxide support 45 the n 1s spectrum fig 2c shows significant peaks at 400 2 and 404 8 ev the peak at 400 2 ev is commonly attributed to n3c in carbon nitride materials although binding energies above 400 ev are also commonly assigned as interstitial n o species in doped tio2 51 55 the peak at 404 8 ev is not commonly observed in carbon nitrides and is often attributed to nitrogen species bound to various surface oxygen site such as no no2 or nox 56 again perhaps indicative of interaction between a carbon nitride species and the tio2 substrate powder x ray diffraction pxrd data were compared for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 fig 3 a which are essentially identical all peaks for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 were assigned to anatase and rutile phases indicating that no phase transformation was observed of tio2 on microwave heating the phase transformation of non metal doped tio2 was observed by zhang et al 57 to occur above 800 c while p25 tio2 has a reported transition temperature of anatase to rutile of 600 800 c indicates an upper limit on the reaction temperature of ca 600 c 58 fourier transformed infrared ft ir spectroscopy fig 4 of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 show additional signals for a c3n4 tio2 which are consistent with known carbon nitride materials peaks attributable to cn heterocycle and cn stretching vibration mode are observed in the region 1449 cm 1 and 1642 cm 1 respectively 40 it should be noted that a peak at 1638 cm 1 is also attributable to the ti o bonding structure 59 and that there is overlap with crystalline urea fig 3 suggesting co moieties may still be present furthermore there is no clear signal at ca 810 cm 1 that is usually characteristic of a s triazine breathing mode observed in condensed carbon nitride polymers such as g c3n4 and there are clearly nh signals observed at 3360 and 3227 cm 1 60 therefore collectively the elemental analysis xps and ir indicate that the carbon nitride material is best described as an incompletely condensed amorphous material with an overall ratio of c3n4 but containing significant co and nh functionality surface area of p 25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 table 1 was determined by n2 adsorption which shows a decrease from ca 49 to 42 m2 g 1 respectively which is likely due to some sintering and occlusion of micropores between tio2 nanoparticles by carbon nitride material the uv druvs of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 fig 5 a show the absorption edge of p25 tio2 is at ca 400 nm whereas for a c3n4 tio2 the edge is red shifted to ca 430 nm condensed carbon nitrides are typically reported to have onset of absorption at ca 460 nm giving a band gap of 2 7 ev again indicating that incomplete condensation has occurred for a c3n4 tio2 according to tauc and menth 61 the absorption coefficient can be described as a function of incident photon energy stated in eq 1 1 αhν 2 a hν eg where α is the absorption coefficient cm 1 a is a constant hν ev the energy of excitation and eg the bandgap energy the bandgap energy was determined from a tauc plot fig 5b by extrapolation to the photon energy axis to give a bandgap energy table 1 for p25 tio2 of 3 02 ev and for a c3n4 tio2 of 2 9 ev the observed optical spectra for a c3n4 tio2 could simply be a superposition of tio2 and a carbon nitride based material however the observed spectrum is also consistent with some n surface doping 62 63 which is partially supported by the xps n 1s peak at 404 ev the surface morphology structure is important and can modify the photocatalytic performances of photocatalyst fig 6 a d show the images of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 at different magnifications it looks like the particles are in spherical shape for both samples the hrtem of a c3n4 tio2 in fig 6e and 6f show a ca 2 4 nm coating that is not observed for p25 tio2 the lack of lattice fringes is consistent with an amorphous material according to nawi et al too thick a carbon coat on tio2 reduces the photocatalytic activity due to less light adsorption whereas 2 4 nm will allow light penetration 64 fig 7 compares the photoluminescence pl spectra of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 photoluminescence is greatest for p25 tio2 indicating that emission is suppressed for a c3n4 tio2 which is consistent with charge separation limiting recombination photoluminescence is the result of electron hole recombination emission the high photoluminescence spectra might be in resulting the high of electron hole recombination occurred in the photocatalyst as can see in fig 7 the lower pl intensity was observed of a c3n4 tio2 sample as compared with p25 tio2 with the maximum peaks intensity were 510 and 1100 respectively instead of normal comparing pl intensity by the highest maximum peak of each spectrum used by other workers we proposed more utilized pl spectrum in both samples we suggested a total peak area may the best way of calculation prediction the electron hole recombination rate as calculated based on eq 2 2 a 0 a b 100 where a0 and ab is total peak area of p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 respectively table 1 shows the peak area values for both samples based on the calculation the amount of electrons hole recombination of a c3n4 tio2 was reduced 5 1 times as compared to p25 tio2 sample this means that the excited electron has able to be inhibited by amorphous carbon nitride hence the free and active hole h is able to react with water forming hydroxyl radical for oxidation hence a c3n4 with low bandgap energy 2 9 ev does not only acted as electron injector for tio2 under visible light region and though it becomes electron hole recombination inhibitor for a c3n4 tio2 sample 3 2 photocatalytic studies the photocatalytic activity was investigated for the degradation of rr4 dye using p25 tio2 and a c3n4 tio2 irradiated using a white led lamp as light source 400 nm wavelength fig 8 a shows the percentage of rr4 remaining under 15 min interval led lamp radiation it was observed that essentially complete decolourization of rr4 occurs over 60 min for a c3n4 tio2 this supports absorption of visible light as shown by the druvs data where the bandgap energy reduced towards the visible light response about 61 8 of rr4 remaining occurred at 30 min of p25 tio2 was confirmed due to the rr4 absorbed p25 tio2 surface as where it shows the same pattern from adsorption study on fig 8b however the percentage remaining was slightly reduced to 50 after 60 min irradiation time this could be due to the high bandgap energy 3 2 ev with less visible light irradiation adsorbed on p25 tio2 meanwhile the photodegradation of a c3n4 tio2 was also compared with a c3n4 which prepared under same condition without present of tio2 fig s1 with 78 photodegradation of rr4 photodegradation rate for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 is shown in fig 8c was calculated based on pseudo first order rate constant equation 3 where from the photocatalytic degradation rate k calculation it shows that photodegradation rate for a c3n4 tio2 and p25 tio2 samples were 0 0785 and 0 0149 min 1 respectively meaning that photodegradation rate of a c3n4 tio2 is 5 3 times faster than p25 tio2 this comparison seems almost the same with the comparison rate calculated from electron hole recombination discussed earlier hence strongly supported that the presence of amorphous carbon nitride in a c3n4 tio2 is acted as the electron hole inhibitor obviously it seems that amorphous carbon nitride is really worked as dual functions which are electron hole recombination inhibitor and also as electron injector this eventually increased the hydroxyl radical by allowing an active h to be reacted with h2o the hydroxyl radical then reacted with rr4 dye and degraded this organic molecule to become decolorized as well observed in fig 8a the effect of initial concentration of rr4 was conducted using 0 05 0 1 0 3 and 0 6 mm and the results are shown in fig s2a as expected the photocatalytic activity of rr4 dye decreased after increasing the concentration rr4 dye this probably due to the intense color at high concentration caused the light screening effect that retarded the penetration of light into the surface of the photocatalyst and this eventually decreased the efficiency of the photocatalyst and thereby reduced the formation of oh and o2 radicals the effect of catalyst loading for the photodegradation of rr4 was carried out in the range of loading between 0 01 0 09 g at constant condition of 0 3 mm solution of rr4 dye as shown in fig s2b the optimum catalyst loading was consumed by 0 03 g further addition of photocatalyst seemed to reduce the photodegradation of rr4 the excessive loading probably produces greater turbidity in the system which reducing light penetration and inhibited the reaction process the ph potential at zero charge phpzc was conducted in order to explained the behavior of amphoteric of a c3n4 tio2 as depicted in fig s3a the phpzc for a c3n4 tio2 was obtained 4 5 which indicate that the surface a c3n4 tio2 is positively charged in acidic ph ph 4 5 and negatively charged in alkaline ph ph 4 5 as a consequence of tio2 surface at ph 4 5 and above is negatively charged hence repulsive force dominates between negative tio2 surface and rr4 anions noticeably the highest the photodegradation of rr4 for a c3n4 tio2 was obtained at ph 2 as can be observed in fig s3b which in line with the value of phpzc the degree of mineralization during photodegradation of rr4 was investigated using total organic carbon toc and biological oxygen demand bod5 as can be seen in fig 9 it was observed that the level of toc and bod5 drastically reduced to 92 17 and 84 76 respectively after undergoes 60 min of photodegradation under led lamp irradiation the result demonstrated that this photocatalytic system probably can convert rr4 dye from non biodegradable organics into biodegradable forms 65 4 conclusions microwave irradiation has been used to prepare a photocatalyst that is active for visible light degradation of organic dye the composition of the photocatalyst is complex and based on ftir xps pxrd and elemental analysis is best described as tio2 supporting an amorphous layer of c3n4 which contains carbonyl and amino functionality the thin amorphous carbon nitride is coated on the tio2 particle with 2 5 3 9 nm thicknesses a low bandgap energy 2 9 ev as well as less electron hole recombination for a c3n4 tio2 makes this composit photocatalysts has excellent photoactivity under low intensity visible light irradiation 273 w m 2 notwithstanding the complexity of the carbon nitride like material the synthetic process is simple occurring in one step and photocatalytic activity is improved in comparison to p25 tio2 under visible light demonstrating that microwave synthesis is a promising simple and cost effective method for application to the development of new photocatalysts declaration of competing interest the authors

14049,palm oil mill effluent pome contains a substantial amount of nutrients and a significant amount of indigenous microorganisms that consume the nutrients for their growth in this study we demonstrated that cultivation of microalgae in pome was able to reduce its carbon and nutrient contents three native microalgae isolates namely coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were cultured in sterilized and unsterilized anaerobic pome to evaluate the microalgae bacteria interactions for phycoremediation of pome the results showed higher cod removal in unsterilized pome than in sterilized pome due to microalgae bacteria consortia interaction of the three microalgae isolates the interaction of scenedesmus sp ukm9 with bacteria showed the highest cod and po4 3 removal percentages for nh4 removal all three isolates showed removal of more than 80 in both sterilized and unsterilized pome quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the quantities of bacteria were constant after the treatment while the quantities of microalgae changed metagenomics analysis showed that the community of bacteria shifted after microalgae cultivation in pome with actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and proteobacteria being the major phyla keywords palm oil mill effluent cod removal coelastrella sp chlamydomonas sp scenedesmus sp microalgae bacteria interaction 1 introduction agricultural wastewater is defined as the wastewater generated during the processing of agricultural products such as palm oil rubber and sago palm oil mill effluent pome is the wastewater generated from the production of palm oil approximately 5 7 5 tonnes of water are required to produce one tonne of crude palm oil cpo and approximately half the volume of the water used during this process ends up as wastewater 1 due to the environmental hazard posed by pome only treated wastewater that complies with environmental standards can be discharged to the environment especially to water bodies the current practice uses anaerobic and aerobic ponding systems for pome treatment and indigenous bacteria act as the major bioremediation agent the disadvantages of using ponding systems are the large area requirements long hydraulic retention times hrts 2 and greenhouse gas emissions 3 4 however some palm oil mills have already converted anaerobic treatment ponds into anaerobic digesters this conversion enables the millers to capture biogas and use it for power generation for the mill itself a cost effective approach microalgae are present as one of the many types of microorganisms in the pome along with bacteria and fungi microalgae especially green microalgae chlorophyta have the ability to undergo photosynthesis because they have chloroplasts a membrane bound organelle which cyanobacteria lacks similar to those of terrestrial plants photosynthesis mechanism of terrestrial plants can be categorized into c3 c4 or cam mechanism depending on plants the mechanism of photosynthetic actions in microalgae is similar to that of c3 plants 5 where carbon dioxide co2 reacts with ribulose bisphosphate forming two molecules of a 3 carbon acid however in mixotrophic or heterotrophic modes the microalgae are also able to assimilate organic carbon as a carbon source if the conditions permit in addition to carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are the two elements that play a major role in microalgae growth 6 these three elements are the key elements that are essential for the efficacious growth of microalgae various research studies have been conducted globally to identify and utilize microalgae in environmental applications such as wastewater treatments 7 10 microalgae are favourable for treating wastewater owing to their ability to take up nutrients and convert them into biomass 11 microalgae have been previously studied in the treatment of pome 8 9 rubber mill effluent 12 and sago starch effluent 13 the robustness of microalgae ensures their survival in unfavourable conditions which is an advantageous characteristic when applying them to wastewater treatment 14 15 in addition a study performed by mohd et al 16 showed that pome contains the macronutrients and micronutrients required for the growth of microalgae locally growing bacteria that are readily available in pome might help in the bioremediation process moreover cultivation of microalgae in pome is expected to create some forms of bacteria microalgae interactions to enhance and speed up the treatment process numerous research studies have reported on the treatment of pome by microalgae alone 8 9 or treatment of pome using bacteria in anaerobic digesters 17 but almost none have investigated microalgae bacteria interaction during pome treatment undoubtedly a handful of studies on the treatment of wastewater have discussed the interactions between microalgae and bacteria but not in pome 18 19 not all interactions between microalgae and bacteria are fully understood but one type of interaction that has been widely discussed is the symbiotic relationship between microalgae and bacteria this interaction might have a significant influence on pome phycoremediation therefore this study was to evaluate the interactions between microalgae and bacteria biomass in the pome treatment through the cultivation of microalgae in sterilized and unsterilized anaerobic pome the growth rate of coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in sterilized and unsterilized anaerobic pome were determined in order to evaluate the effect of sterilization of pome on microalgal growth the reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients ammonium nh4 phosphate po4 3 were also evaluated moreover the diversity of bacterial communities and populations were analysed through qrt pcr and metagenomics analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of pome pome that is discharged by an anaerobic pond anaerobic pome was collected from a palm oil mill that is located in bestari jaya selangor malaysia for unsterilized pome the pome was pre treated by centrifugation at 6800 g for 10 min to remove suspended solids and was stored at 4 c prior to use for the sterilized pome an additional step was taken the pome was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min to prepare the sterilized pome table 1 shows the characteristics of anaerobic pome before and after pre treatment after the pre treatment step the pome was divided into sterilized and unsterilized pome prior to use 2 2 local microalgae strains and culture conditions three native microalgae isolates were used as a culture in this study coelastrella sp ukm 4 ncbi number kp691597 and chlamydomonas sp ukm 6 ncbi number kp898730 were isolated from pome while scenedesmus sp ukm 9 ncbi number ku170547 was isolated from rubber wastewater approximately 10 v v 20 v v and 30 v v microalgae culture at the exponential phase dry cell weight 400 mg l were independently inoculated into 2 l flasks containing unsterilized and sterilized pome respectively the cultures were then incubated at room temperature with continuous light supply at 10 000 lx and aeration at 0 25 vvm the cultures setup were prepared in triplicates in order to ensure the re producibility and stability of the data sampling was performed every two days for the total period of 30 days of cultivation 2 3 microalgal growth rate microalgal growth of ukm4 ukm6 and ukm9 was measured through microalgal biomass concentration as dry weight approximately 10 ml of sample was collected from each flask every two days the samples were centrifuged and washed twice with distilled water before filtering using 1 2 μm whatmann glass microfibres grade gf c ge healthcare life sciences usa the filtered biomass was dried at 105 c overnight the maximum specific growth rate μmax of those microalgae grown in sterilized and unsterilized pome were determined using a modified logistic model with eq 1 described by rao et al 20 1 x x m a x 1 e 2 μ m a x λ t where x g l 1 refers to the biomass concentration μmax day 1 refers to the maximum specific growth rate and λ day refers to the lag time in growth the evaluation of μmax was carried out using the matlab program version r2013a usa 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 analysis of cod nh4 and po4 3 samples collected from pome bioremediated with microalgae were subjected to analysis of cod po4 3 and nh4 samples were collected at day 0 and day 30 where day 0 represented the pome before the bioremediation process and day 30 represented the pome after bioremediation with microalgae samples were collected for both experiments using unsterilized and sterilized pome as comparison sterilization process destroyed the microorganisms present in the pome this is to evaluate the removal efficiencies of microalgae where no interaction whether symbiotic parasitic or competitions occurred on the other hand the unsterilized pome contains a myriad of other microorganisms which were expected to interact with the microalgal strains chemical oxygen demand cod was measured in both sterilized and unsterilized cultivated pome using a high range hach cod reagent by digesting the mixture sample and cod reagent in a hach dbr2000 cod reactor prior to measurement using a hach dr3900 spectrophotometer hach usa the concentrations of nh4 and po4 3 before and after bioremediation with microalgae were measured and calculated using ion chromatography 882 compact ic plus metrohm switzerland the column for cation analysis nh4 was metrosep c4 100 4 0 where the eluent composition was a mixture of 4 0 mmol l 1 tartaric acid and 0 75 mmol l 1 dipicolinic acid with a flow rate of 0 9 ml min 1 the column used for anion analysis po4 3 was a metrosep a supp 5 100 4 0 column with an eluent composition of 3 2 mmol l na2co3 and 1 0 mmol l 1 nahco3 with a flow rate of 0 7 ml min 1 the above procedures were repeated for every sample taken over the cultivation period the removal efficiencies r s were calculated according to eq 2 2 r s c 0 c 30 c 0 100 where r s represents the cod po4 3 or nh4 c0 is the concentration at day 0 and c30 is the concentration at day 30 2 4 2 statistical analysis for cod and nutrient removals statistical analysis were performed using statistical packages for the social sciences spss software version 21 0 spss inc chicago il and minitab version 19 0 minitab llc pennsylvania from spss software the data were then assessed using multivariate analysis by using general linear model and post hoc analysis was performed to determine the significant difference where applicable then principal component analysis pca was performed using minitab 19 2 5 microalgae bacteria quantification 2 5 1 dna extraction and qrt pcr fresh anaerobic pome day 0 and pome treated with microalgae day 30 were used for the quantification of bacterial and microalgal dna the analysis was only performed for the unsterilized pome experimental setup since there were no bacteria present in the sterilized pome bacterial and microalgal dna were extracted using the wizard genomic dna purification promega usa kit following the manufacturer s protocol dna samples were then stored at 20 c prior to use the concentration of dna was determined using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen qubit it dsdna hs assay kit quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr was performed using the stepone real time pcr system applied biosystems the primers and probes used to target bacteria and algae are listed in table 2 briefly 2 μl of 40 ng dna template was mixed with 10 μl of taqman fast advanced mastermix 2x 0 72 μl of 25 μm forward primer 0 72 μl of 25 μm reverse primer and 0 34 μl of 11 8 μm taqman probe in a 20 μl total reaction mixture each dna sample was analysed in triplicate the pcr amplification included ung incubation at 50 c for 2 min followed by polymerase activation at 25 c for 20 s the 40 cycles of annealing and extension were performed at 95 c for 1 s and 60 c for 20 s respectively the standard curve for universal bacteria was constructed using escherichia coli bw25113 from the yale coli genetic stock center usa while the standard curve for microalgae was constructed using chlorella sp ukm2 that was isolated in a previous study 21 the slope and intercept values for the universal bacteria primers and fungi primers were calculated by plotting ct cycle threshold values against the logarithm of the template dna copy number the dna copy number was calculated using eq 3 3 dna copy 6 02 x 1 0 23 dna g dna length bp 660 da g mol bp where 6 02 1023 is avogadro s number and 660 da represents the average molecular weight of the double stranded dna the equations derived from the standard curves of e coli bw25113 and chlorella sp ukm2 are shown in eq 4 and eq 5 respectively 4 y 3 7111x 54 731 5 y 3 2318x 57 701 where y is the ct values and x is the log copy number 2 5 2 high throughput 16s rrna sequencing fresh anaerobic pome day 0 and pome treated with microalgae day 30 were used for sequencing of bacterial dna the analysis was only performed for the unsterilized pome experimental setup since there were no bacteria present in the sterilized pome dna extractions of bacterial samples were performed using the wizard genomic dna purification promega usa kit following the manufacturer protocol the extracted dna was subjected to sample preparation prior to high throughput sequencing analysis the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene was used as a target for pcr amplification the forward and reverse primers were 515 f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 respectively the reaction mixture and amplification conditions for pcr were performed as described by mustapha et al 22 the amplicons generated were processed using a nextera xt dna library preparation kit according to illumina s protocol the dna template was simultaneously fragmented and tagmented using the nextera transposome followed by the tagging process using a unique barcode sequence of dual adapter index amplicons were purified and normalized using ampure xp beads to obtain a uniform representative library in pooled samples the pooled samples were loaded onto the 500 cycle miseq v3 reagent cartridge illumina which was then loaded into the miseq instrument along with a flow cell sequencing was performed at 251 8 8 and 251 cycles for forward index 1 index 2 and reverse reads respectively the raw sequence data were deposited into the sequence reads archive database accession number srp132026 data generated from miseq analysis were in the form of phyla class order family genus and species 2 5 3 processing high throughput data lotus pipeline was used to process the demultiplexed raw paired end reads sequencing data 23 certain parameters were used during the processing stage to produce high quality reads which includes average sequence quality 27 sequence length 170 bp no ambiguous bases and homopolymer run 8 bp chimera checking and clustering of reads into operational taxonomic units otus at the cut off of 97 identity was further performed using uparse 24 the reads were further classified and taxonomically assigned using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier with the greengenes database v13 8 25 with 80 of confidence threshold the β diversity index of microbial communities were calculated using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 9 0 26 where the bacterial community structures between fresh anaerobic pome and pome treated with microalgae were analysed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa the α diversity including shannon simpson evenness and chao 1 indices were calculated using the past 3 paleontological statistics software 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgae growth in sterilized and unsterilized pome microalgae growth were evaluated in sterilized and unsterilized pome their growth were measured using filters with large pores size to ensure that only microalgal biomass were filtered instead of the combination biomass of microalgae and other microorganisms it was expected that the indigenous microorganisms in the pome will have interaction with the microalgae fig 1 a shows the dry cell weight of coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 that were cultured in unsterilized pome while fig 1 b shows the dry cell weight of those three microalgae strains cultured in sterilized pome coelastrella sp ukm4 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 showed increased growth in unsterilized pome compared to sterilized pome chlamydomonas sp ukm6 on the other hand showed nearly the same growth pattern in both pome conditions among the three microalgae species only chlamydomonas sp ukm6 has flagella that enable the cells to move towards light this ability contributed to the similarity of growth in both pome conditions it was reported that chlorophytes showed enhanced growth when bacteria were also present in the media 28 29 in addition the maximum specific growth rates μmax of microalgae in the unsterilized pome were higher than the μmax values in sterilized pome as tabulated in table 3 indicating that the bacteria in the pome might have some growth promoting effect towards the microalgae strains introduced during the treatment process the highest growth rate was found at 20 inoculum while at 10 and 30 inoculum the growth rates were approximately the same among the three inoculum sizes the 20 inoculum size seems to be the best for culturing microalgae in the unsterilized pome the reason behind this is probably because this inoculum size provides optimum survival of microalgae in an unfavourable environment with ample nutrients for growth this observation shows that by increasing the inoculum size resulted higher growth of microalgae moreover the growth of microalgae decreased at the maximum inoculum size due to self shading effect by the high amount of microalgae cells at 30 compared to the 10 and 20 30 as opposed to the growth of microalgae in the unsterilized pome 30 inoculum size provided the highest μmax of all three microalgae strains in the sterilized pome during inoculation of microalgae into sterilized pome aseptic technique was used to ensure no contamination of bacteria or other microorganisms since microalgae were the sole microorganism present in the sterilized pome no competition between different types of microorganisms occurred in the pome the only competition was between the same isolates for food and space given that the nutrients and space were sufficient the 30 inoculum size was the most favourable condition for microalgae growth in sterilized conditions however the initial ph during inoculation of microalgae in sterilized pome also a contributing factor of low microalgae growth in sterilized pome with the exception of chlamydomonas sp ukm6 which showed a comparable growth in both pome conditions the other two microalgae strains showed significantly low growth in sterilized pome due to no ph adjustment was made in order to maintain the sterility of pome 3 2 carbon and nutrient removal in unsterilized and sterilized pome the ability of coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedemus sp ukm9 to act as bioremediation agents for pome treatment was determined by measuring po4 3 nh4 and cod removal in terms of po4 3 removal the highest removal was observed at the 10 inoculum size for all three strains in the unsterilized pome fig 2 in the sterilized pome the 10 inoculum size showed the highest removal as well but only for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 no po4 3 removal was performed by coelastrella sp ukm4 in the sterilized pome scenedesmus sp ukm9 gave the highest po4 3 removal of all the microalgae species since the biomass of scenedesmus sp ukm9 does not defer much than coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 one of the possibility was that the po4 3 molecules were precipitated out from the effluent hence the higher removal efficiencies on the other hand in terms of nh4 removal the 30 coelastrella sp ukm4 inoculum size 10 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 inoculum size and 20 scenedesmus sp ukm9 inoculum size showed the highest removals of nh4 in the unsterilized pome fig 3 in the sterilized pome the 10 coelastrella sp ukm4 inoculum size and 20 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 inoculum sizes showed the highest reduction in nh4 ions nonetheless the removal of nh4 was similar between the inoculum sizes and different microalgae strains the ratio of nutrients in wastewater plays a vital role in their removal from the system the redfield ratio for c n p which is 106 16 1 applies more to marine microalgae than to freshwater microalgae as freshwater microalgae rely more on the n p ratio between 8 1and 45 1 6 the ratio however differs among different species of microalgae 31 and the ecological circumstances of the wastewater 32 a study by beukles et al 33 showed that the removal of nitrogen was not affected by the concentration of phosphorus but that the removal of phosphorus was dependent on the concentration of nitrogen that is one factor to consider since the removal of phosphate in this study is substantially lower than the removal of nh4 the nh4 concentrations before treatment using microalgae were already low in terms of the n p ratio which was 2 1 and therefore might have affected the removal of phosphate from the system nevertheless scenedesmus sp ukm9 still showed high removal of phosphate cod removal was higher in the unsterilized pome than in the sterilized pome fig 4 the highest removal was performed by scenedesmus sp ukm9 followed by chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and coelastrella sp ukm4 there was only a slight difference in cod removal at 10 and 30 inoculum sizes for scenedesmus sp ukm9 in the unsterilized pome higher microalgae inoculum size increased the cod removal percentages in the sterilized pome for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 no improvement in the removal of cod was observed in the sterilized pome as the inoculum was increased from 20 to 30 while in the unsterilized pome the highest removal by this strain was observed in 20 inoculum for coelastrella sp ukm4 the removal trend in the unsterilized pome was similar to that of scenedesmus sp ukm9 but with a much lower percentage overall the cod removal showed a significant difference at difference type of pome and microalgae strain as shown in fig 4 the cod removal was higher in unsterilized pome than in sterilized pome the reason behind these findings is probably because in the unsterilized pome naturally occurring bacteria present inside the anaerobic pome especially heterotrophic bacteria supported microalgae growth by degrading the existing complex organic carbon in the wastewater this is reflected by the strain scenedesmus sp ukm9 which demonstrated higher cod removal as compared to the other two strains reinoculation of coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 that were previously isolated from pome showed lower removal activities it is speculated that these two strains prefer carbon sources in the form of co2 and their main role in pome treatment is to provide o2 to aerobic bacteria since their assimilation capacity for organic carbon was lower than that of scenedesmus sp ukm9 on the other hand in the sterilized pome higher inoculum size was required to increase the cod removal in pome except with chlamydomonas sp ukm6 this is because the presence of only microalgae as the bioremediation agent in the sterilized pome affects the reduction performance a statistical analysis was performed using multivariate with the general linear model in spss and the results are tabulated in table 4 comparing the performance of these three strains in the sterilized and the unsterilized pome reveals significant differences p 0 05 in cod and po4 3 removal among the strains of microalgae used in the bioremediation process however there was no significant difference in nh4 removal different inoculum sizes did not have a significant effect on the removal of all three nutrients p 0 05 this finding shows that the removal process takes place regardless of the concentration of microalgae from the interaction of factors affecting nutrient removal only the interaction between the type of pome sterilized and unsterilized and the microalgae strain showed significant differences but this was only true for the removal of cod and po4 3 the obvious difference in cod removal between sterilized and unsterilized pome showed that without the presence of heterotrophic bacteria for carbohydrate degradation the removal of cod was much lower on the other hand the removal of nh4 was high under all conditions regardless of inoculum size microalgae strain or type of pome these findings also showed that the bacteria present in pome did have some role in supporting the removal of nutrients from pome and that different strains of microalgae have different abilities to remove nutrients post hoc analysis revealed significant differences p 0 05 in the removal of cod between scenedesmus sp ukm9 and coelastrella sp ukm4 and between scenedesmus sp ukm9 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 for po4 3 removal of the three microalgae strains used in this study scenedesmus sp ukm9 showed the highest removal of nutrients and carbon however there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the removal of nutrients cod nh4 and po4 3 performed by coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 the reinoculation of these two strains into pome from which were previously isolated did not perform better in terms of bioremediation than the introduction of scenedesmus sp ukm9 isolated from rubber wastewater into pome scenedesmus sp ukm9 has the lowest maximum growth rate μmax table 3 but has higher removals of carbon and nutrients these findings show that the ability to grow better in contaminated environments does not mean that a strain is a good bioremediation agent ding et al 34 reported that chlorella sp grew in 20 times diluted dairy farm wastewater showed the lowest growth rate compared to 5 and 10 times dilution but resulted the highest cod removal another study by wang et al 35 using chlorella sp cultivated in different types of municipal wastewater showed a higher n and p removal by low growth microalgae species on the other hand lower growth possibly indicates that the interactions between scenedesmus sp ukm9 and indigenous bacteria supported the reductions in nutrient content since it is not economically feasible to use sterilized wastewater for treatment the results in this study showed that using unsterilized wastewater gave higher carbon and nutrient removal efficiencies therefore there was no increase in the cost of treatment to summarize the nutrient removal performance of the microalgae scenedesmus sp ukm9 showed the highest removal in cod nh4 and po4 3 and hence is the best candidate as a bioremediation agent for the treatment of unsterilized pome as shown in fig 5 pca were determined in order to clearly understand the correlation between factors and removal of cod and nutrients nh4 and po4 3 the cod nh4 and po4 3 were the three responses plotted in a loading plot as shown in fig 5 a for the first component of the loading plot pc1 the responses were widely distributed along the horizontal direction but cod and po4 3 were closer to each compared to nh4 for the second component of the loading plot pc2 all three responses were widely distributed from each other score plot in fig 5 b displayed the types of pome sterilized and unsterilized according to the main pca components unsterilized pome were positioned near the three responses unlike the sterilized pome indicating that the pollutants of cod nh4 and po4 3 were effectively removed in unsterilized pome for the factor of strain types score plot shows that scenedesmus sp ukm9 positioned near the three responses whereas coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 were grouped near to each other fig 5c however as shown in fig 5 d the score plot of inoculum sizes were dispersed over a large area hence insignificant behaviour effect of inoculum sizes on the cod nh4 and po4 3 removals over the years scenedesmus sp has gained much attention as a bioremediation agent 36 39 for the production of lipids with the aim of using them as biofuel 40 41 or for the production of secondary metabolites 42 43 undoubtedly scenedesmus sp is a well known bioremediation agent among microalgae species in addition various research studies have reported the use of chlamydomonas sp in treating agricultural wastewater including the treatment of pome 44 45 and olive mill effluent 46 various studies have been conducted on chlamydomonas sp because of their unique properties in hydrogen production 47 48 meanwhile few publications were found about coelastrella sp as a bioremediation agent and none reported the removal of cod using a coelastrella sp strain however one study reported that a locally isolated coelastrella sp was used in the treatment of swine wastewater and found that the removal of total nitrogen and total phosphorus ranged from 90 to 100 49 3 3 microalgae bacteria quantification and community analysis fig 6 shows the quantitative analysis of bacterial and microalgal populations on day 0 fresh anaerobic pome without the addition of microalgae and day 30 unsterilized pome bioremediated with microalgae using a qrt pcr assay the number of bacteria cells was slightly higher in the anaerobic pome 1 21 1010 cellsml 1 after bioremediation of pome with different volumes of microalgae the number of bacteria cells decreased especially in pome bioremediated with chlamydomonas sp ukm6 where the concentrations ranged from 2 37 109 to 3 59 1010 cells ml 1 fig 6 shows that the number of microalgae cells in fresh pome was obviously much lower compared to that in pome after bioremediation with microalgae after 30 days of treatment the number of microalgae cells increased drastically especially for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 at 20 and 30 inoculum size in this study the microalgae cell number was higher than reported in literature due to the effect of longer retention time 30 days compared to previous study lee et al 50 reported that the microalgal cell numbers was in between 105 to 107 at a retention time less than 10 days bacterial dna templates extracted from fresh anaerobic pome and bioremediated pome with different microalgae strains were also subjected for community diversity analysis simpson shannon evenness and chao 1 indices were used to calculate α diversity table 5 increased in bacterial population densities in bioremediated pome with microalgae compared to bacterial population density in fresh anaerobic pome were observed through both simpson and shannon indices the same observation was seen in evenness index where the values were much higher in bioremediated pome with microalgae in addition chao 1 index showed an increment as well as in bacterial richness in bioremediated pome with microalgae the bacterial dna templates of fresh anaerobic pome and bacterial dna templates from bioremediated pome with microalgae were compared in terms of similarity and dynamics of bacterial community principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to evaluate the similarity between samples using otus based on weighted unifrac the bacterial communities in the fresh anaerobic pome that showed horizontal dissimilarity with the bacterial communities after bioremediation with microalgae fig 7 the bacterial communities in the bioremediated pome with microalgae were close to each other indicating widely dispersion even though that the bacterial communities present in the bioremediated pome had vertical similarity based on fig 8 the dissimilarity between inoculum sizes of coelastrella sp ukm4 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were not widely dispersed unlike inoculum sizes of chlamydomonas sp ukm6 inoculum size of 10 showed a more diverse community than the inoculum size of 20 and 30 for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 most probably because the microalgae cells were present in a higher cell count in inoculum sizes of 20 and 30 fig 6 from the miseq analysis a total of 44 phyla were generated where twelve phyla were found to be dominant and out of 99 classes 21 classes were found to be dominant fig 8 the most dominant phyla include actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes firmicutes and proteobacteria it is desirable to understand the ecological roles of these bacteria and particularly their interactions with coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 species actinobacteria and bacteroidetes are both environmental bacteria and were often present in pome bioremediated with coelstrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 or scenedesmus sp ukm9 initially a low percentage of actinobacteria was present in anaerobic pome but the percentage increased dramatically in pome that was bioremediated with microalgae bacteroidetes and firmicutes were found at a high abundance percentage in raw pome high concentrations of both phyla during the anaerobic digestion process have been reported by various research studies 51 52 according to ziganshin et al 53 phylum firmicutes consists of members of clostridiales which are active players in hydrogen production since anaerobic processes in anaerobic digesters produce biogas and hydrogen is one of the gases produced a high abundance of clostridiales was expected in raw anaerobic pome members of this order are obligate anaerobes and the reduction in abundance in pome that is bioremediated with microalgae was predicted as the environment shifted from anaerobic to aerobic anaerobic the proteobacteria phylum contributed the largest percentage of bacteria present in pome that was bioremediated with microalgae and was initially present at a low percentage in raw pome in this phylum alphaproteobacteria were found to be dominant in pome bioremediated with the three microalgae fig 8 alphaproteobacteria comprise a large variety of members with diverse geographical locations metabolic performances and genome sizes 54 betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were also present in a smaller percentage than alphaproteobacteria while the percentage of gammaproteobacteria was quite high in 30 scenedesmus sp ukm9 and 20 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were reported to be associated with microalgae isolated from different aquatic environments 29 the pvc superphylum consists of seven members 55 but the name refers to the core three members of this superphylum planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and chlamydiae 56 two members of the pvc superphylum planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia were also present in pome bioremediated with microalgae members of this superphylum are classified as bacteria but possess some of the physiognomies of archaea and eukarya 57 members of this superphylum have a large genome and some were found to co exist with macroalgae 58 our findings indicated that both planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia percentages increased after bioremediation with different microalgae strains studies performed by pizzetti et al 59 showed that members of the phylum planctomycetes were found to be correlated with algal blooms as they were able to reduce the algae degradation products the dominant classes of planctomycetes were planctomycetia and phycisphaerae in which the former is further dominated by the orders planctomycetales and pirellulales pirellulales was reported to be widespread in oceans along with sponges 60 among the function of this bacteria in marine ecosystem is ammonia oxidation 61 their presence in wastewater could potentially open a new debate on their role in wastewater treatment the phylum spirochaetes was present at a high percentage in raw pome but the percentage deteriorated after pome was bioremediated with microalgae leaving only 1 at the most members of this phylum were found abundantly in anaerobic digesters but a lack of understanding of the importance of this phylum in anaerobic processes was one of the reasons why only a handful of studies were performed on spirochaetes 62 conversely chloroflexi was present at a low percentage in raw pome 2 5 but the percentage increased slightly as pome was bioremediated with microalgae 4 7 11 fig 8 this phylum is composed of filamentous bacteria with various metabolism types and ecological functions 63 two major orders from class anaerolineae anaerolinales and caldilineales data not shown were found to be dominant members of class anaerolineae have been identified as core populations in anaerobic digesters 64 hence their decrease after bioremediation with microalgae the phylum thermi or deincoccus thermus are extremophiles 65 that are resistant to environmental hazards in this study the family trueperaceae was found to be dominant from the class deinococcales members of this family were not present in raw pome but their relative abundance escalated during the bioremediation of pome with microalgae especially when chlamydomonas sp ukm6 or scenedesmus sp ukm9 was added however its relative abundance decreased with the increase in microalgae inoculum size members of trueperaceae are chemoorganotrophic slightly thermophilic and aerobic 66 which contributed to their absence in fresh anaerobic pome 3 4 mechanism of microalgae bacteria interaction in nutrient removal microalgae and bacteria have been living together since the early periods of evolution and synergistically they have transformed many aspects of life on earth 67 various studies done previously showed that bacteria were able to act as growth promoters for microalgae 29 68 69 the preferred source of carbon for microalgae is co2 as microalgae especially green microalgae chlorophyta are equipped with photosynthesis features however some microalgae are also able to take up organic carbon available in aquatic environments especially in heterotrophic mode organic acids such as acetate 70 and organic sugars such as glucose 71 sometimes become the source of carbon for the microalgae this however depends on the environmental conditions and microalgae strains 72 some microalgae strains do not have transport proteins to assist in the active transport of organic sugar molecules into microalgae cells while others lack the enzymes required by the krebs cycle 73 from this study in raw pome a large portion of bacteria contributes to the degradation of carbohydrates and the fermentation of various sugars such as porphyromonadaceae from bacteroidetes and clostridia from phylum firmicutes fig 8 members of the latter class are obligate anaerobes 74 which explains their abundance as the anaerobic digestion process had just been completed in anaerobic digesters the former on the other hand were only found in a smaller percentage 1 3 in the pome that was bioremediated with microalgae fig 8 this might be because simpler molecules of organic carbon are readily available from the fermentation of pome during the anaerobic digestion process or because of the shift in bacterial strains as the environment shifts from anaerobic to aerobic these sugars and acids from the anaerobic process were taken up by the microalgae causing the reduction in the cod values of the pome however since the removal of cod was lower in the sterilized pome than in the unsterilized pome microalgae alone cannot be held accountable for the reduction in cod values interactions between bacteria and introduced microalgae must have taken place as higher removal percentages were observed when bacteria were present in the wastewater a small percentage of acetobacteraceae from alphaproteobacteria was present in the pome that was bioaugmented with microalgae data not shown bacteria from this family were responsible for the production of acetic acid 75 moreover a tremendous increase in actinomycetales from the phylum actinomycetes was also observed in the pome bioaugmented with microalgae these bacteria are known producers of hydrolytic enzymes for the utilization of starch cellulose and hemicellulose 76 and was found abundant in wastewater treatment some microalgae strains have the ability to assimilate these types of organic carbon if conditions permit among the three microalgae strains used in this study scenedesmus sp ukm9 seems to have a higher ability to take up organic carbon than coestrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 based on the reduction in cod values fig 4 for the removal of nitrogen sources especially nh4 in wastewater the proposed mechanism is the actions of microalgae and bacteria in this study members of planctomycetes were found in pome bioremediated with microalgae with percentages ranging from 4 to 17 fig 8 on the other hand members of nitrosomonadaceae which are responsible for the nitrification process as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 77 were also found at a much smaller percentage ranging from 1 to 3 in the pome bioremediated with microalgae fig 8 the small percentage of nitrifying bacteria and higher percentage of planctomycetes found showed that most of the ammonia were being assimilated by the microalgae itself aside from the oxidation process a study on the effect of adding microalgae into media containing nitrifying bacteria showed that the nitrification rate reduced despite the amount of ammonia that was almost completely removed from the system 78 hence proposing that the microalgae were responsible for the removal of ammonia from this study it can be seen that the total oxidation of ammonia via aerobic processes by bacteria occurs at approximately 5 20 therefore a large portion of the ammonia removal during this treatment was done by microalgae microalgae are able assimilate nitrogen in the form of ammonia nitrate and nitrite nevertheless nitrogen in the form of ammonia is the form preferred by microalgae since less energy is required for its assimilation compared to the other two nitrogen types nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 79 in microalgae phosphates are taken up for growth and are also responsible for carbohydrate metabolism 80 however microalgae are also able to assimilate excess phosphate known as luxury uptake where excess phosphate more than the requirement for growth is taken up and stored 81 in bacteria phosphate accumulation by phosphate accumulating organisms pao can only occur in aerobic environments because anaerobic environments are stressful to these paos 82 among the phosphate accumulation bacteria found in aerobic environments were deviosa sp and bdellovibrio sp 83 deviosa sp was also found in the pome bioremediated with microalgae however less than 1 of deviosa sp were found in all samples after the bioremediation process fig 8 interestingly one strain of deviosa sp was recently isolated from the rhizosphere of oil palm hence the name deviosa elaeis sp 84 since the percentage of bacterial pao is relatively small it can be concluded that a large portion of the removed phosphate from the system was taken up by the microalgae in summary microalgae and bacteria have positive interactions in removing carbon and nutrients from wastewater as illustrated in fig 9 the total amount of nutrients removed from pome occurs by the combination of microalgae and bacteria through nutrient assimilation biological processes such as nitrification and physicochemical reactions such as ammonia stripping and phosphate precipitation conversely another factor that might contribute to removing the ammonia from the pome is a stripping phenomenon 85 stripping phenomena occur especially during aerobic stages where air is provided mechanically 86 a review by kinidi et al 87 revealed that in wastewater treatments where ammonia stripping was being used for the removal of ammonia the ph during those treatment processes was above ph 10 5 however since the ph of unsterilized and sterilized pome after bioremediation with microalgae did not increase to more than 10 1 the assumption is that a large fraction of the ammonia and phosphate in the pome were removed through assimilation by microalgae 4 conclusion the results of this study showed that the specific growth rate μmax of all three microalgae in unsterilized pome were higher at the 20 inoculum size analysis of cod removal from the pome showed that scenedesmus sp ukm9 performed better than coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 for ammonium removal all three strains showed removal of more than 80 in both pome conditions while higher removal of phosphate was observed in pome that was bioremediated with scenedesmus sp ukm9 the qrt pcr analysis showed that the cell number of the bacterial population remained constant throughout the study but varied for microalgae from the metagenomics studies environmental bacteria dominated the pome after bioremediation with microalgae and actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and proteobacteria were the major phyla nutrient removals from pome involve interactions between microalgae and bacteria through nutrient assimilation a lesser portion through biological processes and smaller fractions through ammonia stripping and phosphate precipitation at high ph values declaration of

14049,palm oil mill effluent pome contains a substantial amount of nutrients and a significant amount of indigenous microorganisms that consume the nutrients for their growth in this study we demonstrated that cultivation of microalgae in pome was able to reduce its carbon and nutrient contents three native microalgae isolates namely coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were cultured in sterilized and unsterilized anaerobic pome to evaluate the microalgae bacteria interactions for phycoremediation of pome the results showed higher cod removal in unsterilized pome than in sterilized pome due to microalgae bacteria consortia interaction of the three microalgae isolates the interaction of scenedesmus sp ukm9 with bacteria showed the highest cod and po4 3 removal percentages for nh4 removal all three isolates showed removal of more than 80 in both sterilized and unsterilized pome quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the quantities of bacteria were constant after the treatment while the quantities of microalgae changed metagenomics analysis showed that the community of bacteria shifted after microalgae cultivation in pome with actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and proteobacteria being the major phyla keywords palm oil mill effluent cod removal coelastrella sp chlamydomonas sp scenedesmus sp microalgae bacteria interaction 1 introduction agricultural wastewater is defined as the wastewater generated during the processing of agricultural products such as palm oil rubber and sago palm oil mill effluent pome is the wastewater generated from the production of palm oil approximately 5 7 5 tonnes of water are required to produce one tonne of crude palm oil cpo and approximately half the volume of the water used during this process ends up as wastewater 1 due to the environmental hazard posed by pome only treated wastewater that complies with environmental standards can be discharged to the environment especially to water bodies the current practice uses anaerobic and aerobic ponding systems for pome treatment and indigenous bacteria act as the major bioremediation agent the disadvantages of using ponding systems are the large area requirements long hydraulic retention times hrts 2 and greenhouse gas emissions 3 4 however some palm oil mills have already converted anaerobic treatment ponds into anaerobic digesters this conversion enables the millers to capture biogas and use it for power generation for the mill itself a cost effective approach microalgae are present as one of the many types of microorganisms in the pome along with bacteria and fungi microalgae especially green microalgae chlorophyta have the ability to undergo photosynthesis because they have chloroplasts a membrane bound organelle which cyanobacteria lacks similar to those of terrestrial plants photosynthesis mechanism of terrestrial plants can be categorized into c3 c4 or cam mechanism depending on plants the mechanism of photosynthetic actions in microalgae is similar to that of c3 plants 5 where carbon dioxide co2 reacts with ribulose bisphosphate forming two molecules of a 3 carbon acid however in mixotrophic or heterotrophic modes the microalgae are also able to assimilate organic carbon as a carbon source if the conditions permit in addition to carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are the two elements that play a major role in microalgae growth 6 these three elements are the key elements that are essential for the efficacious growth of microalgae various research studies have been conducted globally to identify and utilize microalgae in environmental applications such as wastewater treatments 7 10 microalgae are favourable for treating wastewater owing to their ability to take up nutrients and convert them into biomass 11 microalgae have been previously studied in the treatment of pome 8 9 rubber mill effluent 12 and sago starch effluent 13 the robustness of microalgae ensures their survival in unfavourable conditions which is an advantageous characteristic when applying them to wastewater treatment 14 15 in addition a study performed by mohd et al 16 showed that pome contains the macronutrients and micronutrients required for the growth of microalgae locally growing bacteria that are readily available in pome might help in the bioremediation process moreover cultivation of microalgae in pome is expected to create some forms of bacteria microalgae interactions to enhance and speed up the treatment process numerous research studies have reported on the treatment of pome by microalgae alone 8 9 or treatment of pome using bacteria in anaerobic digesters 17 but almost none have investigated microalgae bacteria interaction during pome treatment undoubtedly a handful of studies on the treatment of wastewater have discussed the interactions between microalgae and bacteria but not in pome 18 19 not all interactions between microalgae and bacteria are fully understood but one type of interaction that has been widely discussed is the symbiotic relationship between microalgae and bacteria this interaction might have a significant influence on pome phycoremediation therefore this study was to evaluate the interactions between microalgae and bacteria biomass in the pome treatment through the cultivation of microalgae in sterilized and unsterilized anaerobic pome the growth rate of coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in sterilized and unsterilized anaerobic pome were determined in order to evaluate the effect of sterilization of pome on microalgal growth the reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients ammonium nh4 phosphate po4 3 were also evaluated moreover the diversity of bacterial communities and populations were analysed through qrt pcr and metagenomics analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of pome pome that is discharged by an anaerobic pond anaerobic pome was collected from a palm oil mill that is located in bestari jaya selangor malaysia for unsterilized pome the pome was pre treated by centrifugation at 6800 g for 10 min to remove suspended solids and was stored at 4 c prior to use for the sterilized pome an additional step was taken the pome was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min to prepare the sterilized pome table 1 shows the characteristics of anaerobic pome before and after pre treatment after the pre treatment step the pome was divided into sterilized and unsterilized pome prior to use 2 2 local microalgae strains and culture conditions three native microalgae isolates were used as a culture in this study coelastrella sp ukm 4 ncbi number kp691597 and chlamydomonas sp ukm 6 ncbi number kp898730 were isolated from pome while scenedesmus sp ukm 9 ncbi number ku170547 was isolated from rubber wastewater approximately 10 v v 20 v v and 30 v v microalgae culture at the exponential phase dry cell weight 400 mg l were independently inoculated into 2 l flasks containing unsterilized and sterilized pome respectively the cultures were then incubated at room temperature with continuous light supply at 10 000 lx and aeration at 0 25 vvm the cultures setup were prepared in triplicates in order to ensure the re producibility and stability of the data sampling was performed every two days for the total period of 30 days of cultivation 2 3 microalgal growth rate microalgal growth of ukm4 ukm6 and ukm9 was measured through microalgal biomass concentration as dry weight approximately 10 ml of sample was collected from each flask every two days the samples were centrifuged and washed twice with distilled water before filtering using 1 2 μm whatmann glass microfibres grade gf c ge healthcare life sciences usa the filtered biomass was dried at 105 c overnight the maximum specific growth rate μmax of those microalgae grown in sterilized and unsterilized pome were determined using a modified logistic model with eq 1 described by rao et al 20 1 x x m a x 1 e 2 μ m a x λ t where x g l 1 refers to the biomass concentration μmax day 1 refers to the maximum specific growth rate and λ day refers to the lag time in growth the evaluation of μmax was carried out using the matlab program version r2013a usa 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 analysis of cod nh4 and po4 3 samples collected from pome bioremediated with microalgae were subjected to analysis of cod po4 3 and nh4 samples were collected at day 0 and day 30 where day 0 represented the pome before the bioremediation process and day 30 represented the pome after bioremediation with microalgae samples were collected for both experiments using unsterilized and sterilized pome as comparison sterilization process destroyed the microorganisms present in the pome this is to evaluate the removal efficiencies of microalgae where no interaction whether symbiotic parasitic or competitions occurred on the other hand the unsterilized pome contains a myriad of other microorganisms which were expected to interact with the microalgal strains chemical oxygen demand cod was measured in both sterilized and unsterilized cultivated pome using a high range hach cod reagent by digesting the mixture sample and cod reagent in a hach dbr2000 cod reactor prior to measurement using a hach dr3900 spectrophotometer hach usa the concentrations of nh4 and po4 3 before and after bioremediation with microalgae were measured and calculated using ion chromatography 882 compact ic plus metrohm switzerland the column for cation analysis nh4 was metrosep c4 100 4 0 where the eluent composition was a mixture of 4 0 mmol l 1 tartaric acid and 0 75 mmol l 1 dipicolinic acid with a flow rate of 0 9 ml min 1 the column used for anion analysis po4 3 was a metrosep a supp 5 100 4 0 column with an eluent composition of 3 2 mmol l na2co3 and 1 0 mmol l 1 nahco3 with a flow rate of 0 7 ml min 1 the above procedures were repeated for every sample taken over the cultivation period the removal efficiencies r s were calculated according to eq 2 2 r s c 0 c 30 c 0 100 where r s represents the cod po4

microalgae bacteria quantification 2 5 1 dna extraction and qrt pcr fresh anaerobic pome day 0 and pome treated with microalgae day 30 were used for the quantification of bacterial and microalgal dna the analysis was only performed for the unsterilized pome experimental setup since there were no bacteria present in the sterilized pome bacterial and microalgal dna were extracted using the wizard

v13 8 25 with 80 of confidence threshold the β diversity index of microbial communities were calculated using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 9 0 26 where the bacterial community structures between fresh anaerobic pome and pome treated with microalgae were analysed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa the α diversity including shannon simpson evenness and chao 1 indices were calculated using the past 3 paleontological statistics software 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgae growth in sterilized and unsterilized pome microalgae growth were evaluated in sterilized and unsterilized pome their growth were measured using filters with large pores size to ensure that only microalgal biomass were filtered instead of the combination biomass of microalgae and other microorganisms it was expected that the indigenous microorganisms in the pome will have interaction with the microalgae fig 1 a shows the dry cell weight of coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 that were cultured in unsterilized pome while fig 1 b shows the dry cell weight of those three microalgae strains cultured in sterilized pome coelastrella sp ukm4 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 showed increased growth in unsterilized pome compared to sterilized pome chlamydomonas sp ukm6 on the other hand showed nearly the same growth pattern in both pome conditions among the three microalgae species only chlamydomonas sp ukm6 has flagella that enable the cells to move towards light this ability contributed to the similarity of growth in both pome conditions it was reported that chlorophytes showed enhanced growth when bacteria were also present in the media 28 29 in addition the maximum specific growth rates μmax of microalgae in the unsterilized pome were higher than the μmax values in sterilized pome as tabulated in table 3 indicating that the bacteria in the pome might have some growth promoting effect towards the microalgae strains introduced during the treatment process the highest growth rate was found at 20 inoculum while at 10 and 30 inoculum the growth rates were approximately the same among the three inoculum sizes the 20 inoculum size seems to be the best for culturing microalgae in the unsterilized pome the reason behind this is probably because this inoculum size provides optimum survival of microalgae in an unfavourable environment with ample nutrients for growth this observation shows that by increasing the inoculum size resulted higher growth of microalgae moreover the growth of microalgae decreased at the maximum inoculum size due to self shading effect by the high amount of microalgae cells at 30 compared to the 10 and 20 30 as opposed to the growth of microalgae in the unsterilized pome 30 inoculum size provided the highest μmax of all three microalgae strains in the sterilized pome during inoculation of microalgae into sterilized pome aseptic technique was used to ensure no contamination of bacteria or other microorganisms since microalgae were the sole microorganism present in the sterilized pome no competition between different types of microorganisms occurred in the pome the only competition was between the same isolates for food and space given that the nutrients and space were sufficient the 30 inoculum size was the most favourable condition for microalgae growth in sterilized conditions however the initial ph during inoculation of microalgae in sterilized pome also a contributing factor of low microalgae growth in sterilized pome with the exception of chlamydomonas sp ukm6 which showed a comparable growth in both pome conditions the other two microalgae strains showed significantly low growth in sterilized pome due to no ph adjustment was made in order to maintain the sterility of pome 3 2 carbon and nutrient removal in unsterilized and sterilized pome the ability of coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedemus sp ukm9 to act as bioremediation agents for pome treatment was determined by measuring po4 3 nh4 and cod removal in terms of po4 3 removal the highest removal was observed at the 10 inoculum size for all three strains in the unsterilized pome fig 2 in the sterilized pome the 10 inoculum size showed the highest removal as well but only for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 no po4 3 removal was performed by coelastrella sp ukm4 in the sterilized pome scenedesmus sp ukm9 gave the highest po4 3 removal of all the microalgae species since the biomass of scenedesmus sp ukm9 does not defer much than coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 one of the possibility was that the po4 3 molecules were precipitated out from the effluent hence the higher removal efficiencies on the other hand in terms of nh4 removal the 30 coelastrella sp ukm4 inoculum size 10 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 inoculum size and 20 scenedesmus sp ukm9 inoculum size showed the highest removals of nh4 in the unsterilized pome fig 3 in the sterilized pome the 10 coelastrella sp ukm4 inoculum size and 20 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 inoculum sizes showed the highest reduction in nh4 ions nonetheless the removal of nh4 was similar between the inoculum sizes and different microalgae strains the ratio of nutrients in wastewater plays a vital role in their removal from the system the redfield ratio for c n p which is 106 16 1 applies more to marine microalgae than to freshwater microalgae as freshwater microalgae rely more on the n p ratio between 8 1and 45 1 6 the ratio however differs among different species of microalgae 31 and the ecological circumstances of the wastewater 32 a study by beukles et al 33 showed that the removal of nitrogen was not affected by the concentration of phosphorus but that the removal of phosphorus was dependent on the concentration of nitrogen that is one factor to consider since the removal of phosphate in this study is substantially lower than the removal of nh4 the nh4 concentrations before treatment using microalgae were already low in terms of the n p ratio which was 2 1 and therefore might have affected the removal of phosphate from the system nevertheless scenedesmus sp ukm9 still showed high removal of phosphate cod removal was higher in the unsterilized pome than in the sterilized pome fig 4 the highest removal was performed by scenedesmus sp ukm9 followed by chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and coelastrella sp ukm4 there was only a slight difference in cod removal at 10 and 30 inoculum sizes for scenedesmus sp ukm9 in the unsterilized pome higher microalgae inoculum size increased the cod removal percentages in the sterilized pome for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 no improvement in the removal of cod was observed in the sterilized pome as the inoculum was increased from 20 to 30 while in the unsterilized pome the highest removal by this strain was observed in 20 inoculum for coelastrella sp ukm4 the removal trend in the unsterilized pome was similar to that of scenedesmus sp ukm9 but with a much lower percentage overall the cod removal showed a significant difference at difference type of pome and microalgae strain as shown in fig 4 the cod removal was higher in unsterilized pome than in sterilized pome the reason behind these findings is probably because in the unsterilized pome naturally occurring bacteria present inside the anaerobic pome especially heterotrophic bacteria supported microalgae growth by degrading the existing complex organic carbon in the wastewater this is reflected by the strain scenedesmus sp ukm9 which demonstrated higher cod removal as compared to the other two strains reinoculation of coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 that were previously isolated from pome showed lower removal activities it is speculated that these two strains prefer carbon sources in the form of co2 and their main role in pome treatment is to provide o2 to aerobic bacteria since their assimilation capacity for organic carbon was lower than that of scenedesmus sp ukm9 on the other hand in the sterilized pome higher inoculum size was required to increase the cod removal in pome except with chlamydomonas sp ukm6 this is because the presence of only microalgae as the bioremediation agent in the sterilized pome affects the reduction performance a statistical analysis was performed using multivariate with the general linear model in spss and the results are tabulated in table 4 comparing the performance of these three strains in the sterilized and the unsterilized pome reveals significant differences p 0 05 in cod and po4 3 removal among the strains of microalgae used in the bioremediation process however there was no significant difference in nh4 removal different inoculum sizes did not have a significant effect on the removal of all three nutrients p 0 05 this finding shows that the removal process takes place regardless of the concentration of microalgae from the interaction of factors affecting nutrient removal only the interaction between the type of pome sterilized and unsterilized and the microalgae strain showed significant differences but this was only true for the removal of cod and po4 3 the obvious difference in cod removal between sterilized and unsterilized pome showed that without the presence of heterotrophic bacteria for carbohydrate degradation the removal of cod was much lower on the other hand the removal of nh4 was high under all conditions regardless of inoculum size microalgae strain or type of pome these findings also showed that the bacteria present in pome did have some role in supporting the removal of nutrients from pome and that different strains of microalgae have different abilities to remove nutrients post hoc analysis revealed significant differences p 0 05 in the removal of cod between scenedesmus sp ukm9 and coelastrella sp ukm4 and between scenedesmus sp ukm9 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 for po4 3 removal of the three microalgae strains used in this study scenedesmus sp ukm9 showed the highest removal of nutrients and carbon however there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the removal of nutrients cod nh4 and po4 3 performed by coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 the reinoculation of these two strains into pome from which were previously isolated did not perform better in terms of bioremediation than the introduction of scenedesmus sp ukm9 isolated from rubber wastewater into pome scenedesmus sp ukm9 has the lowest maximum growth rate μmax table 3 but has higher removals of carbon and nutrients these findings show that the ability to grow better in contaminated environments does not mean that a strain is a good bioremediation agent ding et al 34 reported that chlorella sp grew in 20 times diluted dairy farm wastewater showed the lowest growth rate compared to 5 and 10 times dilution but resulted the highest cod removal another study by wang et al 35 using chlorella sp cultivated in different types of municipal wastewater showed a higher n and p removal by low growth microalgae species on the other hand lower growth possibly indicates that the interactions between scenedesmus sp ukm9 and indigenous bacteria supported the reductions in nutrient content since it is not economically feasible to use sterilized wastewater for treatment the results in this study showed that using unsterilized wastewater gave higher carbon and nutrient removal efficiencies therefore there was no increase in the cost of treatment to summarize the nutrient removal performance of the microalgae scenedesmus sp ukm9 showed the highest removal in cod nh4 and po4 3 and hence is the best candidate as a bioremediation agent for the treatment of unsterilized pome as shown in fig 5 pca were determined in order to clearly understand the correlation between factors and removal of cod and nutrients nh4 and po4 3 the cod nh4 and po4 3 were the three responses plotted in a loading plot as shown in fig 5 a for the first component of the loading plot pc1 the responses were widely distributed along the horizontal direction but cod and po4 3 were closer to each compared to nh4 for the second component of the loading plot pc2 all three responses were widely distributed from each other score plot in fig 5 b displayed the types of pome sterilized and unsterilized according to the main pca components unsterilized pome were positioned near the three responses unlike the sterilized pome indicating that the pollutants of cod nh4 and po4 3 were effectively removed in unsterilized pome for the factor of strain types score plot shows that scenedesmus sp ukm9 positioned near the three responses whereas coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 were grouped near to each other fig 5c however as shown in fig 5 d the score plot of inoculum sizes were dispersed over a large area hence insignificant behaviour effect of inoculum sizes on the cod nh4 and po4 3 removals over the years scenedesmus sp has gained much attention as a bioremediation agent 36 39 for the production of lipids with the aim of using them as biofuel 40 41 or for the production of secondary metabolites 42 43 undoubtedly scenedesmus sp is a well known bioremediation agent among microalgae species in addition various research studies have reported the use of chlamydomonas sp in treating agricultural wastewater including the treatment of pome 44 45 and olive mill effluent 46 various studies have been conducted on chlamydomonas sp because of their unique properties in hydrogen production 47 48 meanwhile few publications were found about coelastrella sp as a bioremediation agent and none reported the removal of cod using a coelastrella sp strain however one study reported that a locally isolated coelastrella sp was used in the treatment of swine wastewater and found that the removal of total nitrogen and total phosphorus ranged from 90 to 100 49 3 3 microalgae bacteria quantification and community analysis fig 6 shows the quantitative analysis of bacterial and microalgal populations on day 0 fresh anaerobic pome without the addition of microalgae and day 30 unsterilized pome bioremediated with microalgae using a qrt pcr assay the number of bacteria cells was slightly higher in the anaerobic pome 1 21 1010 cellsml 1 after bioremediation of pome with different volumes of microalgae the number of bacteria cells decreased especially in pome bioremediated with chlamydomonas sp ukm6 where the concentrations ranged from 2 37 109 to 3 59 1010 cells ml 1 fig 6 shows that the number of microalgae cells in fresh pome was obviously much lower compared to that in pome after bioremediation with microalgae after 30 days of treatment the number of microalgae cells increased drastically especially for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 at 20 and 30 inoculum size in this study the microalgae cell number was higher than reported in literature due to the effect of longer retention time 30 days compared to previous study lee et al 50 reported that the microalgal cell numbers was in between 105 to 107 at a retention time less than 10 days bacterial dna templates extracted from fresh anaerobic pome and bioremediated pome with different microalgae strains were also subjected for community diversity analysis simpson shannon evenness and chao 1 indices were used to calculate α diversity table 5 increased in bacterial population densities in bioremediated pome with microalgae compared to bacterial population density in fresh anaerobic pome were observed through both simpson and shannon indices the same observation was seen in evenness index where the values were much higher in bioremediated pome with microalgae in addition chao 1 index showed an increment as well as in bacterial richness in bioremediated pome with microalgae the bacterial dna templates of fresh anaerobic pome and bacterial dna templates from bioremediated pome with microalgae were compared in terms of similarity and dynamics of bacterial community principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to evaluate the similarity between samples using otus based on weighted unifrac the bacterial communities in the fresh anaerobic pome that showed horizontal dissimilarity with the bacterial communities after bioremediation with microalgae fig 7 the bacterial communities in the bioremediated pome with microalgae were close to each other indicating widely dispersion even though that the bacterial communities present in the bioremediated pome had vertical similarity based on fig 8 the dissimilarity between inoculum sizes of coelastrella sp ukm4 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were not widely dispersed unlike inoculum sizes of chlamydomonas sp ukm6 inoculum size of 10 showed a more diverse community than the inoculum size of 20 and 30 for chlamydomonas sp ukm6 most probably because the microalgae cells were present in a higher cell count in inoculum sizes of 20 and 30 fig 6 from the miseq analysis a total of 44 phyla were generated where twelve phyla were found to be dominant and out of 99 classes 21 classes were found to be dominant fig 8 the most dominant phyla include actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes firmicutes and proteobacteria it is desirable to understand the ecological roles of these bacteria and particularly their interactions with coelastrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 species actinobacteria and bacteroidetes are both environmental bacteria and were often present in pome bioremediated with coelstrella sp ukm4 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 or scenedesmus sp ukm9 initially a low percentage of actinobacteria was present in anaerobic pome but the percentage increased dramatically in pome that was bioremediated with microalgae bacteroidetes and firmicutes were found at a high abundance percentage in raw pome high concentrations of both phyla during the anaerobic digestion process have been reported by various research studies 51 52 according to ziganshin et al 53 phylum firmicutes consists of members of clostridiales which are active players in hydrogen production since anaerobic processes in anaerobic digesters produce biogas and hydrogen is one of the gases produced a high abundance of clostridiales was expected in raw anaerobic pome members of this order are obligate anaerobes and the reduction in abundance in pome that is bioremediated with microalgae was predicted as the environment shifted from anaerobic to aerobic anaerobic the proteobacteria phylum contributed the largest percentage of bacteria present in pome that was bioremediated with microalgae and was initially present at a low percentage in raw pome in this phylum alphaproteobacteria were found to be dominant in pome bioremediated with the three microalgae fig 8 alphaproteobacteria comprise a large variety of members with diverse geographical locations metabolic performances and genome sizes 54 betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were also present in a smaller percentage than alphaproteobacteria while the percentage of gammaproteobacteria was quite high in 30 scenedesmus sp ukm9 and 20 chlamydomonas sp ukm6 bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were reported to be associated with microalgae isolated from different aquatic environments 29 the pvc superphylum consists of seven members 55 but the name refers to the core three members of this superphylum planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and chlamydiae 56 two members of the pvc superphylum planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia were also present in pome bioremediated with microalgae members of this superphylum are classified as bacteria but possess some of the physiognomies of archaea and eukarya 57 members of this superphylum have a large genome and some were found to co exist with macroalgae 58 our findings indicated that both planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia percentages increased after bioremediation with different microalgae strains studies performed by pizzetti et al 59 showed that members of the phylum planctomycetes were found to be correlated with algal blooms as they were able to reduce the algae degradation products the dominant classes of planctomycetes were planctomycetia and phycisphaerae in which the former is further dominated by the orders planctomycetales and pirellulales pirellulales was reported to be widespread in oceans along with sponges 60 among the function of this bacteria in marine ecosystem is ammonia oxidation 61 their presence in wastewater could potentially open a new debate on their role in wastewater treatment the phylum spirochaetes was present at a high percentage in raw pome but the percentage deteriorated after pome was bioremediated with microalgae leaving only 1 at the most members of this phylum were found abundantly in anaerobic digesters but a lack of understanding of the importance of this phylum in anaerobic processes was one of the reasons why only a handful of studies were performed on spirochaetes 62 conversely chloroflexi was present at a low percentage in raw pome 2 5 but the percentage increased slightly as pome was bioremediated with microalgae 4 7 11 fig 8 this phylum is composed of filamentous bacteria with various metabolism types and ecological functions 63 two major orders from class anaerolineae anaerolinales and caldilineales data not shown were found to be dominant members of class anaerolineae have been identified as core populations in anaerobic digesters 64 hence their decrease after bioremediation with microalgae the phylum thermi or deincoccus thermus are extremophiles 65 that are resistant to environmental hazards in this study the family trueperaceae was found to be dominant from the class deinococcales members of this family were not present in raw pome but their relative abundance escalated during the bioremediation of pome with microalgae especially when chlamydomonas sp ukm6 or scenedesmus sp ukm9 was added however its relative abundance decreased with the increase in microalgae inoculum size members of trueperaceae are chemoorganotrophic slightly thermophilic and aerobic 66 which contributed to their absence in fresh anaerobic pome 3 4 mechanism of microalgae bacteria interaction in nutrient removal microalgae and bacteria have been living together since the early periods of evolution and synergistically they have transformed many aspects of life on earth 67 various studies done previously showed that bacteria were able to act as growth promoters for microalgae 29 68 69 the preferred source of carbon for microalgae is co2 as microalgae especially green microalgae chlorophyta are equipped with photosynthesis features however some microalgae are also able to take up organic carbon available in aquatic environments especially in heterotrophic mode organic acids such as acetate 70 and organic sugars such as glucose 71 sometimes become the source of carbon for the microalgae this however depends on the environmental conditions and microalgae strains 72 some microalgae strains do not have transport proteins to assist in the active transport of organic sugar molecules into microalgae cells while others lack the enzymes required by the krebs cycle 73 from this study in raw pome a large portion of bacteria contributes to the degradation of carbohydrates and the fermentation of various sugars such as porphyromonadaceae from bacteroidetes and clostridia from phylum firmicutes fig 8 members of the latter class are obligate anaerobes 74 which explains their abundance as the anaerobic digestion process had just been completed in anaerobic digesters the former on the other hand were only found in a smaller percentage 1 3 in the pome that was bioremediated with microalgae fig 8 this might be because simpler molecules of organic carbon are readily available from the fermentation of pome during the anaerobic digestion process or because of the shift in bacterial strains as the environment shifts from anaerobic to aerobic these sugars and acids from the anaerobic process were taken up by the microalgae causing the reduction in the cod values of the pome however since the removal of cod was lower in the sterilized pome than in the unsterilized pome microalgae alone cannot be held accountable for the reduction in cod values interactions between bacteria and introduced microalgae must have taken place as higher removal percentages were observed when bacteria were present in the wastewater a small percentage of acetobacteraceae from alphaproteobacteria was present in the pome that was bioaugmented with microalgae data not shown bacteria from this family were responsible for the production of acetic acid 75 moreover a tremendous increase in actinomycetales from the phylum actinomycetes was also observed in the pome bioaugmented with microalgae these bacteria are known producers of hydrolytic enzymes for the utilization of starch cellulose and hemicellulose 76 and was found abundant in wastewater treatment some microalgae strains have the ability to assimilate these types of organic carbon if conditions permit among the three microalgae strains used in this study scenedesmus sp ukm9 seems to have a higher ability to take up organic carbon than coestrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 based on the reduction in cod values fig 4 for the removal of nitrogen sources especially nh4 in wastewater the proposed mechanism is the actions of microalgae and bacteria in this study members of planctomycetes were found in pome bioremediated with microalgae with percentages ranging from 4 to 17 fig 8 on the other hand members of nitrosomonadaceae which are responsible for the nitrification process as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 77 were also found at a much smaller percentage ranging from 1 to 3 in the pome bioremediated with microalgae fig 8 the small percentage of nitrifying bacteria and higher percentage of planctomycetes found showed that most of the ammonia were being assimilated by the microalgae itself aside from the oxidation process a study on the effect of adding microalgae into media containing nitrifying bacteria showed that the nitrification rate reduced despite the amount of ammonia that was almost completely removed from the system 78 hence proposing that the microalgae were responsible for the removal of ammonia from this study it can be seen that the total oxidation of ammonia via aerobic processes by bacteria occurs at approximately 5 20 therefore a large portion of the ammonia removal during this treatment was done by microalgae microalgae are able assimilate nitrogen in the form of ammonia nitrate and nitrite nevertheless nitrogen in the form of ammonia is the form preferred by microalgae since less energy is required for its assimilation compared to the other two nitrogen types nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 79 in microalgae phosphates are taken up for growth and are also responsible for carbohydrate metabolism 80 however microalgae are also able to assimilate excess phosphate known as luxury uptake where excess phosphate more than the requirement for growth is taken up and stored 81 in bacteria phosphate accumulation by phosphate accumulating organisms pao can only occur in aerobic environments because anaerobic environments are stressful to these paos 82 among the phosphate accumulation bacteria found in aerobic environments were deviosa sp and bdellovibrio sp 83 deviosa sp was also found in the pome bioremediated with microalgae however less than 1 of deviosa sp were found in all samples after the bioremediation process fig 8 interestingly one strain of deviosa sp was recently isolated from the rhizosphere of oil palm hence the name deviosa elaeis sp 84 since the percentage of bacterial pao is relatively small it can be concluded that a large portion of the removed phosphate from the system was taken up by the microalgae in summary microalgae and bacteria have positive interactions in removing carbon and nutrients from wastewater as illustrated in fig 9 the total amount of nutrients removed from pome occurs by the combination of microalgae and bacteria through nutrient assimilation biological processes such as nitrification and physicochemical reactions such as ammonia stripping and phosphate precipitation conversely another factor that might contribute to removing the ammonia from the pome is a stripping phenomenon 85 stripping phenomena occur especially during aerobic stages where air is provided mechanically 86 a review by kinidi et al 87 revealed that in wastewater treatments where ammonia stripping was being used for the removal of ammonia the ph during those treatment processes was above ph 10 5 however since the ph of unsterilized and sterilized pome after bioremediation with microalgae did not increase to more than 10 1 the assumption is that a large fraction of the ammonia and phosphate in the pome were removed through assimilation by microalgae 4 conclusion the results of this study showed that the specific growth rate μmax of all three microalgae in unsterilized pome were higher at the 20 inoculum size analysis of cod removal from the pome showed that scenedesmus sp ukm9 performed better than coelastrella sp ukm4 and chlamydomonas sp ukm6 for ammonium removal all three strains showed removal of more than 80 in both pome conditions while higher removal of phosphate was observed in pome that was bioremediated with scenedesmus sp ukm9 the qrt pcr analysis showed that the cell number of the bacterial population remained constant throughout the study but varied for microalgae from the metagenomics studies environmental bacteria dominated the pome after bioremediation with microalgae and actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and proteobacteria were the major phyla nutrient removals from pome involve interactions between microalgae and bacteria through nutrient assimilation a lesser portion through biological processes and smaller fractions through ammonia stripping and phosphate precipitation at high ph values declaration of
