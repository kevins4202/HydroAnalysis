16380,the application of membrane technology for water treatment and reuse is hampered by the development of a microbial biofilm biofilm growth in micro and ultrafiltration mf uf membrane modules on both the membrane surface and feed spacer can form a secondary membrane and exert resistance to permeation and crossflow increasing energy demand and decreasing permeate quantity and quality in recent years exhaustive efforts were made to understand the chemical structural and hydraulic characteristics of membrane biofilms in this review we critically assess which specific structural features of membrane biofilms exert resistance to forced water passage in mf uf membranes systems applied to water and wastewater treatment and how biofilm physical structure can be engineered by process operation to impose less hydraulic resistance below the pain threshold counter intuitively biofilms with greater thickness do not always cause a higher hydraulic resistance than thinner biofilms dense biofilms however had consistently higher hydraulic resistances compared to less dense biofilms the mechanism by which density exerts hydraulic resistance is reported in the literature to be dependant on the biofilms internal packing structure and eps chemical composition e g porosity polymer concentration current reports of internal porosity in membrane biofilms are not supported by adequate experimental evidence or by a reliable methodology limiting a unified understanding of biofilm internal structure identifying the dependency of hydraulic resistance on biofilm density invites efforts to control the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by engineering internal biofilm structure regulation of biofilm internal structure is possible by alteration of key determinants such as feed water nutrient composition concentration hydraulic shear stress and resistance and can engineer biofilm structural development to decrease density and therein hydraulic resistance future efforts should seek to determine the extent to which the concept of biofilm engineering can be extended to other biofilm parameters such as mechanical stability and the implication for biofilm control removal

here membrane biofilm gives rise to a secondary barrier of biological nature and thus can cause a decline in membrane process performance especially if biofilm permeability is lower than intrinsic

less consequence for nanofiltration and reverse osmosis nf ro membranes due higher intrinsic membrane resistance of the latter dreszer et al 2013 i e orders of magnitude greater than the hydraulic resistance of the membrane biofilm ro biofilm development presents a greater problem for crossflow resistance biofilm on spacers and concentration polarisation bucs et al 2015 herzberg and elimelech 2007 siebdrath et al 2019 the core of this review will deal with the biofilm effects on the hydraulic resistance of mf uf membranes biofilm development in mf uf necessitates increasing the feed pressure to maintain water production and the need to apply chemical cleanings and in ultimate cases untimely membrane replacement membrane cleaning and frequent membrane replacement represents a significant portion of operating expenditure opex and should be reduced to allow economic operation jafari et al 2020 vrouwenvelder et al 1998 decades of research focussing on biofilm inactivation or biofilm dispersion by non specific reagents e g enzymes surfactants inorganic salts ph shifts did not succeed in controlling microbial biofouling and reducing biofilm hydraulic resistance on a long term nguyen et al 2012 in principle all membrane systems in water treatment carry biofilms but not all of them suffer from biofouling caused by the presence of a biofilm gravity driven membrane gdm filtration even benefits from the biofilm presence due to stable flux production and laboratory experiments reporting improvements in permeate quality chomiak et al 2015 even for gdm filtration the permeate flux is rather low whether a system exhibits biofouling depends upon the extent of the contribution of biofilms to flux decline this observation lead to the concept of the threshold of interference a k a pain threshold above which biofilm effects meet arbitrary operational and biofouling is diagnosed while below this threshold no biofouling is recorded flemming 2020 fig 1 the realisation that membrane filters could maintain a reasonable hydraulic permeability without complete removal of the biofilm under continuous dead end conditions therein keeping biofilms below the pain threshold griebe and flemming 1998 prompted fundamental investigations into factors determining the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms peter varbanets et al 2010 peter varbanets et al 2011

desmond et al 2018a desmond et al 2018c jafari et al 2018 the identification of biofilm physical structures which imposed low hydraulic resistance during membrane filtration made plausible the possibility of engineering biofilms with a morphology below the threshold of interference for long term operation without membrane cleaning jafari et al 2018 javier et al 2020a advancement was made in

hydraulic resistance to the physical structure of membrane biofilms total filtration resistance during mf uf is defined by the resistance in series ris model foley 2013 the ris model is widely employed to uncouple parameters influencing flux decline such that j δ p μ r m r pb r f where j is flux through the membrane l m2 h p is the transmembrane pressure bar µ is the dynamic viscosity pa s rm is the membrane hydraulic resistance rpb is the pore blockage resistance and rf is the fouling biofilm cake resistance all resistance are in m 1 distinguishing to what extent one or more parameter rm rpb rf governs overall filtration resistance is possible by comparing initial clean water flux and physical removal of the fouled membrane desmond et al 2018a fortunato et al 2016 studies reporting autopsy by physical scraping of the uf biofilms formed under various feedwater and process operational conditions consistently evidenced the biofilm layer contributes ca 60 80 to overall filtration resistance desmond et al 2018a fortunato et al 2016 fortunato et al 2017 peter varbanets et al 2010 any irreversible increase in hydraulic resistance above the intrinsic resistance of the membrane after physical removal by scraping of the biofilm from the membrane surface is attributed to pore blockage rpb 20 40 fortunato et al 2016 fortunato et al 2017 jermann et al 2007 pore blocking may arise from adsorption of low molecular weight natural organic matter or biofilm by products e g surfactants biomass associated products bap into the membrane s pores the lesser contribution of rbp compared to rf in uf membranes treating surface water may arise from the biofilm layer functioning as a secondary filtration barrier which can help reduce membrane adsorption and pore blockage during filtration of natural organic matter nom of polymeric and lmw acid range as indicated for removal of viral particles heistad et al 2009 filtration resistance is additionally postulated to arise from adsorption rad of nom to the membrane surface and is considered as a recalcitrant fouling layer persisting after hydraulic removal of a gel layer however in recent years direct visualisation of the membrane surface revealed retention of a biofilm gel residual layer of several micrometres that can resists hydraulic shear stress desmond et al 2018b jafari et al 2019 section 2 2 thus the historical consideration of rad may in fact be an indication of a residual biofilm layer reflecting stratification in its cohesion and should be approached with caution in the absence of direct visualisation the dominant contribution of the surface biofilm rf to overall filtration resistance supports the basis for dedicated efforts to engineer biofilms below the threshold of interference and is thus the focus of this review 2 1 hydraulics of biofilm layers according to darcy s law j κ η dp dz j κ η dp dz the flux of permeate j i e volume passed per area filtration layer per time m3 m2 s or l m2 h is proportional with the pressure gradient dp dz across the layer and the medium permeability κ and inversely proportional with the passing fluid viscosity η seader et al 1998 when the layer of thickness l is hydraulically homogeneous one can express darcy s law also in terms of the specific resistance r l κ 1 m of that layer as j δ p η r when applied to a clean membrane this becomes j p f p p η r m with driving force being the pressure difference between the feed pf and the permeate pp sides of the membrane fig 2 a with a biofilm fouling layer on the membrane surface the biofilm resistance rf adds in series with that of the membrane so that the decreased flux is j p f p p η r m r f if the same pressure difference is maintained conversely if operating at constant flux j then the pressure difference must be proportionally increased to compensate the additional resistance so that the transmembrane pressure now p m p p fig 2b remains the same in general both the membrane and the biofilm can comprise several sub layers with different hydraulic properties so that j p f p p η r i if one layer has a hydraulic resistance much larger than the others that may determine the overall flux for example in ro the membrane resistance rm 1016 1017 1 m radu et al 2010 dominates the biofilm resistance rf 1012 1 m jafari et al 2018 by orders of magnitude but in mf uf rm 1011 1012 1 m martin et al 2014 which makes the biofilm contribution very significant noticeably not only the layer thickness lf determines the characteristic resistance but also its permeability κf which implies that a thin but rather impermeable biofilm layer can reduce more the permeate flux or requires increased pressure p f p p to drive the same flux than a thick but permeable layer fig 2c d several expressions for the hydraulic resistance of porous media have been derived with the best known being hagen poiseuille r f 32 d p 2 ε l f assuming laminar flow through straight pores kozeny carman r f 180 τ d p 2 ε 3 1 ε 2 l f with inclined pores of tortuosity τ and ergun r f 150 d p 2 ε 3 1 ε 2 l f assuming packed spheres seader et al 1998 all these relations acknowledge that the hydraulic resistance increases proportionally with an increase in the layer thickness lf and pore tortuosity factor τ which is the increase in effective hydraulic path compared with straight pores and with the decrease of porosity ε but strongly increases quadratically with a smaller pore diameter dp fig 3 thus larger and more pores can significantly increase the flux and decrease the hydraulic resistance compared to biofilm thickness alone furthermore in dynamic operation conditions i e with changing transmembrane pressure tmp or permeate flux the biofilms properties lf ε dp τ can all be variable water permeation through the biofilm layer causes a structural rearrangement casey 2007 with biofilm compression derlon et al 2016 desmond et al 2018c which decreases the porosity and increases the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2014 valladares linares et al 2015 as described by the mathematical model developed in jafari et al 2018 the extent of biofilm compression and subsequent hydraulic resistance increase results from the balance between forces due to permeate flow i e pore pressure and permeate drag and structural forces opposing deformation i e biofilm viscoelasticity and plasticity gradients of porosity can develop within the biofilm layer jafari et al 2019 along with gradients of mechanical strength which make compressed biofilms more difficult to be removed during the cleaning these properties can be evaluated numerically with poroelasticity tools coussy 2004 by coupling the fluid flow models through porous media i e darcy brinkman etc with various solid mechanics models for the biofouling layer i e elastic elastoplastic viscoelastic etc when the numerical models are used in conjunction with microscopic e g optical coherence tomography oct measurements values of the hydraulic parameters can be estimated not only in simpler one dimensional models of uniform thickness and homogeneous biofilm layer jafari et al 2019 but also taking into account the effects irregular layer geometries i e surface roughness and heterogeneous or multiple layers jafari et al 2019 an example of simulation results showing the dependency of flux on hydraulic and mechanical properties of heterogeneous biofilm layers is presented in fig 4 2 2 factors affecting biofouling layer hydraulic resistance 2 2 1 biofilm thickness for particle filtration one commonly measures the particle mass deposited on the membrane surface m f a m kg m2 because it is related to the average cake layer thickness lf and therefore it determines the filtration resistance an increased mass per area is supposed to increase the passage length due to a thicker cake leading to increased resistance when the particle volume fraction ϕs and density of solid particles ρ s are constant and related by m f a m ϕ s ρ s l f foley 2013 and makes the broad assumption that the fouling layer is homogeneously distributed across the membrane surface unlike a layer of inert particles membrane biofilms are dynamic systems deviating from the expectation that mass accumulation is proportional to average thickness and thereof hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 used the relation between the measured mass accumulation and hydraulic resistance to determine an average biofilm thickness when operating at a fixed permeate flux value of 20 l m2 h resulting biofilms were thicker and with a higher permeability than biofilms formed under a permeate flux of 100 l m2 h this suggested that thickness of the biofilm layer is not necessarily proportional to permeate flux or hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 concluded that the higher hydraulic resistance of the biofilm grown at 100 l m2 h was the effect of a higher density a key limitation in the thickness calculation of dreszer et al 2013 is that the concentration of biofilm biomass is homogeneously distribution over the membrane surface this however is not always the case and biofilm surface coverage is largely heterogeneously distributed across the membrane characterised by thick biomass mounds and valleys of thin biofilm derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018a later analyised biofilm structural morphology and average thickness by optical coherence tomography oct and proposed that average biofilm thickness thus the liquid passage length can influence hydraulic resistance only in biofilms with a comparable morphology e g biomass density porosity and heterogeneity expressing the level of variability of these properties in space on the other hand significantly thicker biofilms ca 800 µm with heterogenous morphology and lower density had lower hydraulic resistance compared to thinner biofilms ca 200 µm with homogeneous morphology and higher density it was determined that correlating hydraulic resistance to mean biofilm thickness was not accurate for heterogeneous biofilm structures and that other measures such as surface roughness i e the heterogeneity of the biofilm thickness in addition to density and pore fraction may play a significant role the use of oct to measure average biofilm thickness is considered appropriate due to the high penetration depth allow high level of visualisation of both the biofilm liquid interface and the biofilm membrane interface oct is not restricted by incomplete biofilm liquid interface visualisation due to potential for unstained constituents marring the use of fluorescence methods wagner and horn 2017 while shadowing effects may occur this is more so problematic for deriving internal biofilm architecture such as internal porosity but biofilm thickness derlon et al 2012 2 2 2 biofilm surface roughness biofilm surface roughness is defined as the smoothness of the biofilm surface liquid boundary layer as it relates to the variation in biofilm thickness wagner and horn 2017 wagner et al 2010 derlon et al 2012 proposed the hydraulic resistance was influenced by biofilm surface roughness when comparing biofilm morphology and hydraulic resistance in gravity driven ultrafiltration systems with and without predation by higher organisms the hydraulic resistance of thick mounds of biofilm interspersed by valleys of thin biofilm across the membrane surface was postulated to be higher than biofilm adjacent to the membrane due to increased passage length derlon et al 2012 following a line of least resistance water was postulated to pass through the membrane where an absent or only a very thin biofilm is present derlon et al 2012 martin et al 2014 provided a simulation based description of the observations of derlon et al 2012 biofilm layers with a high surface roughness i e an irregular geometry had lower hydraulic resistances compared to flat or compact fouling layers with a comparable thickness martin et al 2014 for a given mean fouling layer thickness an increase in spatial heterogeneity could increase the permeate flux by over an order of magnitude the model results were dependant on several other factors such as the membrane resistance the fouling layer permeability and eps and cellular biomass spatial distribution later fortunato et al 2017 studied the formation of surface roughness and the change of permeate flux during biofilm maturation contrary to the physical reality that the main flow should be directed through areas of low hydraulic resistance their interpretation of computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations was that rough surface appendages exhibited higher flux than the thinner structures biofilm cavities due to the presence of liquid vortices in the biofilm valleys which could lower the pressure gradient thus decreasing permeation these results were contested by jafari et al 2019 who indicated that the small axial velocities would only lead to a negligible pressure drop compared to the trans membrane pressure gradient and that simulation results from fortunato et al 2017 were merely wrongly interpreted both jafari et al 2019 see fig 4 and other cfd simulations with mass transfer radu et al 2010 radu et al 2012 have also clearly shown how the higher flux water passage occurs through areas of thinner biofilm however desmond et al 2018b later demonstrated erosion of the rough biofilm surface layer comprising ca 60 80 overall biofilm thickness in biofilms formed on real and synthetic surface water by incremental increases in hydraulic shear stress had a negligible impact on hydraulic resistance this is comparable to observations in pilot and full scale cross flow ultrafiltration systems which report poor cleaning efficacy with hydraulic cleaning alone jafari et al 2020 this also lends evidence to the suggestion that previously considered fouling mechanisms such as pore blocking and adsorption may be attributed to a retained biofouling layer with high adhesion to the membrane morphological observations by oct revealed retention of a residual densified biofilm ca 50 100 µm with low surface roughness adjacent to the membrane termed biofilm base layer physical removal of the base layer led to a reduction hydraulic resistance within 20 of the intrinsic resistance of the membrane with the remaining hydraulic resistance accounted for by the intrinsic resistance ca 5 of the membrane and pore blockage ca 15 fig 5 desmond et al 2018b it was concluded the biofilm hydraulic resistance was governed by the biofilms base layer the presence of a base layer was indicated by the stabilisation in biofilm thickness under increasing shear stress up to 3 pa observable at multiple positions along the flow cell length x y coordinates and is considered representative and valid structural feature of membrane biofilms when compared to the conceptual model presented by derlon et al 2012 one could consider the mounds of biofilm to represent rough surface layer which exerts a lower hydraulic resistance compared to adjacent area of thin biofilm however stratification in biofilm hydraulic resistance and physical structure was not investigated by derlon et al 2012 instead authors broadly assumed the thickness exerted most amount of resistance as opposed to other structural parameters e g density porosity later numerical modelling by jafari et al 2019 demonstrated stratification in the hydraulic structural and mechanical properties of membrane biofilms grown on similar feedwater i e river water to derlon et al 2012 this brought computational substantiation of the observations of stratification in hydraulic resistance reported by desmond et al 2018b 2 2 3 biofilm density the density of the fouling layer proved to be a critical determinant of hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018a valladares linares et al 2015 the density of membrane biofilms ρf biofilm mass as kg total organic carbon toc per m3 biofilm is empirically derived by the simple expression ρ f m f a m l f where mf is the biofilm mass kg toc am is membrane surface area m2 and lf is the average biofilm thickness m desmond et al 2018a more recently fortunato et al 2020 proposed biofilm density can be determined optically using oct imaging by recording the ratio between the biomass pixels intensity and the background pixels intensity of a membrane biofilm however optical measurements were not validated by conventional density measurements thereby limiting critical comparison to previous work moreover quantitative analysis of internal biofilm structure using oct imaging is oversimplified influent complexity e g both soluble non soluble organic substrate bulk suspended biomass and biofilm structure can reduce the certainty of whether visualized areas of low absent intensity are in fact areas of absent biomass or result from compositional i e refractive index heterogeneity shadowing of overlying biomass and or accumulated non soluble substrate conclusions should not ultimately be drawn from quantified images without experimental controls that consider the role of experimental artefacts e g particulate loading shadowing from suspended biomass which falsely present as areas of lower density and or absent biomass desmond et al 2018a compared the hydraulic resistance of biofilms with similar average thickness but different densities of calculated mass of extracellular polymeric substances and membrane area thin ca 100 µm dense biofilms had a greater hydraulic resistance than thicker ca 800 µm biofilms with lower eps densities despite being several hundred micrometres thinner eps constitutes 90 of the biofilm s overall biomass concentration with a low fraction attributed to bacterial cell concentration desmond et al 2018a dreszer et al 2013 eps density of membrane biofilms can be considered representative of the biofilm overall density it was concluded that the eps density and internal molecular packing density could impose greater resistance than biofilm thickness compacted biofilms i e grown at a low pressure flux then exposed to higher pressures fluxes had an irreversible increase in hydraulic resistance valladares linares et al 2015 related the irreversible increase in hydraulic resistance to a corresponding increase in density fig 6 namely the same amount of biomass occupied a smaller microscale volume due to the reorganization of the biofilm increasing the eps concentration desmond et al 2018c calculated the biofilm density in gravity driven membrane systems and noted an increase upon compaction proportional to the observed increase in hydraulic resistance this observation was supported by reversible compression and relaxation experiments on homogeneous biofilm structures further reversible compression relaxation cycles caused a decrease in density and thus a reduction in hydraulic resistance thus the changes in the eps density and not biofilm thickness were suggested as the critical determinant for hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018a dreszer et al 2013 valladares linares et al 2015 biofilm density is also influenced by physical interactions e g electrostatic within the eps mayer et al 1999 pfaff et al 2021 recently pfaff et al 2021 found that by increasing the feedwater ca2 concentration the density of alginate fouling layer as well as its hydraulic resistance increased and correlated to flux decline in membrane filtration in their experiments the alginate layer density reached a plateau around 8 mm ca2 indicating saturation of anionic binding sides it was hypothesised addition of ca2 created a salt bridge between two negatively charged residues via hydrogen bond formation 10 30 kj mol to form an array of repeating polymeric blocks termed an egg box configuration giraudier et al 2004 such interactions can form uniform packing structures with reduced volume between neighbouring strands of eps leading to the formation of homogeneous biofilm physical structures the hydraulic response of the alginate layer mirrored the hydraulic behaviour of polysaccharide fouling layers observed by herzberg et al 2009 albeit in reverse osmosis membrane systems herzberg et al 2009 indicated calcium increases the adsorption of polysaccharides and dna by 2 and 3 fold respectively the increased adsorption of eps onto the membrane resulted in a significant decrease in permeate water flux however the physical structure of the fouling layer was not quantified limiting any link between a structural parameter and hydraulic resistance the impact of eps composition on biofilm physical structure and hydraulic resistance was later assessed by desmond et al 2018a who substantiated the link between secretion of anionic eps polysaccharides and edna increased density of actual biofilms and not surrogate compounds formed on ultrafiltration membranes under phosphorus limiting condition the study of desmond et al 2018a however made use of biofilms formed under synthetic raw water which lacked inclusion of complex nature organic matter and complex microbial community thus the fidelity of biofilms formed under synthetic influent conditions and also with surrogate compounds compared to membrane biofilms is highly dubious simplified experimental models do not consider the complexity of natural organic matter microecology and spatiotemporal variations present in more complex biofilm systems cultivated under environmental conditions jafari et al 2020 this may account for the bias in literature towards reporting the detection and function of anionic as opposed to cationic and or non ionic polymers which may be preferentially selected in a simplified experimental system despite the short comings of typical experimental systems employed to study the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms regardless of the specific system the biofilm or surrogate layer with greater biopolymer density consistently exhibited a higher hydraulic resistance compared to less dense biofilms the mechanism by which density affects hydraulic resistance is intuitively linked to the internal packing structure e g porosity and polymer concentration per µm3 which can be influenced by both mechanical stress and steric interaction between neighbouring polymeric strands however as discussed in the following section the relationship between biofilm density and internal packing structure is difficult to delineate with no formalized conceptual model or adequate methodological repertoire for examining the biofilm internal structure 2 2 4 biofilm porosity the prevailing vista in biofilm literature is that biofilms exhibit discrete internal pore structures in between construction material made of biopolymers fortunato et al 2017 melo 2005 the underlying assumption of this conceptual model is that the biofilm is a discontinuous structural matrix akin to swiss cheese i e with holes fig 7 a melo 2005 postulated biofilms exhibit a dual pore structure containing large macro pores water channels interspersed by polymer aggregates and micro pores inside these aggregates as in models defining tortuosity for solute mass transfer in the macro pores mass transfer of both water and solute could occur by both diffusion and convection in smaller pores water convection would face a high resistance due to greater packing density of eps molecules and solute diffusion would prevail melo 2005 later application of oct and clsm with corresponding image analysis suggested initial evidence of pore like structures at the biofilms meso 5 µm and micro scale 0 2 µm respectively fortunato et al 2017 peter varbanets et al 2010 fortunato et al 2017 reported a decrease in porosity from quantified oct images from 0 20 at day 5 to almost zero where 0 is non porous corresponded with an increase in hydraulic resistance despite a near zero porosity reading water still permeated through the biofilm indicating potential culverts below the axial resolution of the oct ca 3 µm while oct has superior penetration depth compared to clsm shadowing effects during oct imaging might occur this is problematic for reliable quantification of internal porosity from oct images pore like structures visualised using oct are quantified as the number of void voxels in the biofilm layer analysis is performed on binarized data whereas the pixels were classified in empty 0 and filled 1 wagner et al 2010 the descriptor is the ratio of void space under the biofilm layer and the total biofilm area however it is not possible to differentiate between areas of absent biomass and areas of low signal intensity arising from shadowing wagner and horn 2017 similar with the determination of biofilm density by oct fortunato et al 2017 correct experimental controls and or complementary computation analysis is required when evaluating the biofilm porosity computational analysis by jafari et al 2018 indicated that hydraulic resistance is plausibly dependant on pore particle reorganization but only at a scale lower than 3 5 µm whereby when foulant layer deformation occurs below the detectable threshold 3 µm biofilm hydraulic resistance would increase by 110 the computational work of jafari et al 2018 substantiated the earlier postulation from peter varbanets et al 2010 who reported the formation of microscale pore like structures in biofilm layers in gravity driven ultrafiltration membranes using clsm and an aquatic fluorescent aquatic tracer peter varbanets et al 2010 observed biofouling layer thickness increased over time ca 200 µm while the hydraulic resistance remained constant it was assumed an increase of the channel s diameter or number fig 3 counteracted the effect of increased passage length due to increased biofouling layer accumulation as the maximum axial resolution of clsm is about 0 8 µm the reported microscale channels must be greater than 0 8 µm and less than 3 5 µm channels not observable under oct however direct and convincing visualisation of the aquatic tracer within the reported microchannel was not possible due to poor light penetration over the biofilms depth a key limitation of clsm in complex biofilm systems an alternative view is that the internal structure of a membrane biofilm is a continuous polymeric matrix with embedded cells with structural heterogeneity only in eps composition and concentration as in the conceptual model of vrouwenvelder et al 2017 described as the hair in sink effect therein forced water passage occurs through a continuous network of entangled eps chains fig 8 b permeation of water occurs through a continuous eps mesh and exhibits preferential flow through areas of decreased polymer concentration as opposed to assuming the total absence of biomass as in the micro mesoscale channel models melo 2005 hydraulic resistance is in this model imposed by areas of increased volumetric polymer concentration i e decreased volume between eps molecules and or passage length defined by the tortuosity within the network of entangled eps chains casey 2007 vrouwenvelder et al 2017 fig 3 7b in such a model the eps entanglement is analogous to the polymeric matrix constituting the active layer of reverse osmosis membranes zhang et al 2009 as opposed to the porous membranes for mf uf mass transport theory in reverse osmosis membranes assumes the active layer is a non porous structure i e does not contain distinct pores foley 2013 in which solute and solvent molecules are dissolved and diffuse through the three dimensional polymeric mesh cahill et al 2008 foley 2013 libotean et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 future modelling efforts should seek to develop biofilm hydraulic models also based on the approaches describing permeate flux in reverse osmosis membranes i e based on partition coefficients between eps and the transported molecules water salts and molecular diffusion one could first assume that the partitioning coefficients are constant and uniformly distributed but this may not be the case given eps are charged compounds capable of electrostatic interactions and with different hygroscopic character desmond et al 2018a sun et al 2020 especially the hygroscopic properties of the eps may be of interest to be determined and incorporated into future models we propose both hypothetical models from melo 2005 and the hair in sink model from vrouwenvelder et al 2017 reflects the stratification observed in the physical structure of membrane biofilms therein the rough surface layer is representative of an aggregated biofilm structure with macro pores while the dense homogeneous base layer close to the membrane surface is comparable to a continuous biofilm gel jafari et al 2018 3 can we engineer biofilms below the pain threshold using membrane pre treatment and process operational controls the dependency of hydraulic resistance on biofilm density and its internal architecture invites efforts to reduce the hydraulic resistance by engineering internal biofilm structure reducing the packing density could in principle decrease the hydraulic resistance and improve filtration performance desmond et al 2018c jafari et al 2018 if feasible operator intervention could focus on finding the conditions to engineer biofilm structures that allow remaining biofilms below the pain threshold low density and hydraulic resistance through manipulation of feed water composition and concentration and tailoring process operation e g crossflow rather than trying to prevent biofilm formation by imposing harsh environmental conditions membrane pre treatment and the operational crossflow velocities are design parameters that help reduce fouling and flux decline in membrane filtration systems akhondi et al 2015 howe and clark 2006 huck et al 2009 existing membrane process design focuses on reducing biofilm accumulation by restricting particle nutrient loading and or application of antimicrobials in hope of inhibiting bacterial growth beyer et al 2017 lee et al 2016 woo et al 2015 multiple studies and extensive industrial experience showed that biofilm mitigation is ineffective on a long term due to the biofilm adaptation to new environments in fact biofilm mitigation strategies could exacerbate the development of slow growing and highly resilient membrane biofilms vitzilaiou et al 2019 the following section evaluates membrane pre treatment and process operational strategies and presents parameters tailored to help engineer the formation of low density biofilms remaining below the pain threshold that hampers hydraulic performance 3 1 feedwater quality nutrient concentration and in general raw water quality can be altered by membrane pre treatment to lower the accumulation of in organic matter onto the surface of the membrane and restrict microbial growth griebe and flemming 1998 maartens et al 2000 vedavyasan 2007 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 pre treatment focuses on removing small suspended particles insoluble salts and more recently nutrients e g phosphorus reduction vedavyasan 2007 recent studies examining biofilm development on the surface of membrane filters with and without physical or chemical pre treatment have shown that differences in influent composition can affect the biofilm structural development and hydraulic resistance javier et al 2020a tang et al 2018 wang et al 2008 contrary to abiotic foulants microorganisms can grow in the system even if their concentration has been minimized entering the system microorganisms multiply on the expense of biodegradable substances which may thus constitute the limiting factors for biofilm growth therefore anything which can support microbial growth belongs to the targets to minimize when limiting biofouling 3 1 1 particle removal through fine sieving micro sieving has been proposed to reduce the accumulation of large particles on the membrane surface aiding performance of the gravity driven filtration gdf however in gdf chomiak et al 2014 demonstrated that fine particles in feed water kaolin induced the formation of a compact and homogeneous biofilm structure after 30 days of operation larger particles diatomite helped counterbalance the effect of fine particles due to the formation of a more heterogeneous and permeable biofilm structure the hydraulic resistance of biofilms formed in the presence of fine particles was significantly higher than the resistance of biofilms formed in the absence of any inorganic particles or the presence of the mixed particle population this indicates the application of conventional micro sieving which permits fine particle passage and large particle exclusion could lead to the formation of a dense homogeneous biofilm structure with high hydraulic resistance whether improvements in flux were attributed solely to biofilm structural development or reduction in small particles forming a filter cake at the biofilm membrane interface was not investigated however the overall hydraulic resistance of biofouling layers in spiral wound mf uf would not be likely to be reduced by the presence of larger particulate matter in the feed water 3 1 2 nutrient restriction and enrichment 3 2 2 1 natural organic matter and biopolymer accumulation pre treatment by granular activated carbon or slow sand filtration can reduce loading of natural organic matter nom onto the membrane surface vedavyasan 2007 the conventional understanding of engineers is that restriction of nom loading onto the surface of the membrane will lower adsorption of foulants onto the membrane surface and limit hydraulic resistance howe and clark 2006 huck et al 2009 maartens et al 2000 however recent evaluation by zhang et al 2021 evidenced the presence of a conditioning film of biopolymers on the membrane surface can drive microbial selection and engineered the formation of a thick heterogeneous biofilm with a low density zhang et al 2021 it was concluded that the initial available biopolymers altered the conditions for bacterial recruitment and adhesion and in turn influenced biofilm composition physical structure and filtration performance this points to the importance of cultivating initial conditioning films as a means to engineer biofilms below the threshold of interface which are otherwise removed by conventional pre treatment strategies however the selection of a pre treatment strategy e g gac ssf must balance the transmission of beneficial compounds for low density biofilm development against unwanted foulants which may lead to unwanted pore block and increased filtration resistance e g humic acids 3 2 2 2 dissolved organic nutrients pre treatment strategies are additionally used to lower the loading of dissolved organic nutrients in influent water through the membrane by applying adsorbents e g granular activated carbon or sand filters flemming et al 1996 griebe and flemming 1998 it is generally anticipated lower nutrient load onto the surface of a membrane filter will lower the rate of microbial growth and biofilm establishment in extensively pre treated water phosphate p limitation was proposed by vrouwenvelder et al 2010 as a method to control biofouling of spiral wound ro membranes the ro installation was characterized by a low feed channel pressure drop increase and low biomass concentrations in membrane elements this installation contrasted with installations fed with less extensively pre treated feed water i e higher phosphate concentrations and experienced a high pressure drop increase and high biomass concentrations in first stage membranes membrane fouling simulator mfs studies by vrouwenvelder et al 2010 showed that low phosphate concentrations 0 3 μg p l in the feed water restricted the pressure drop increase and biomass accumulation even at high substrate organic carbon concentrations contrary reports were later provided by desmond et al 2018a albeit in gravity driven ultrafiltration membranes demonstrating membrane biofilms cultivated by excluding p addition in synthetic surface waters exhibited increased eps production and hydraulic resistance compared to biofilms cultivated with a balanced nutrient ratio the increase in eps production consisted of anionic extracellular polymeric substances which formed dense physical structures and thereof elevated hydraulic resistance javier et al 2020a later demonstrated that biofouling control in reverse osmosis membrane systems by phosphorus limitation strongly depends on the assimilable organic carbon concentration aoc p restriction under non limiting concentrations led to similar increased eps production as described by desmond et al 2018a despite being observed in different membrane types ro vs ultrafiltration membranes under different modes of operation crossflow vs dead end and likely different microbial communities resulting biofilms demonstrated a conserved metabolic response to the imposed nutrient regime it can be concluded that engineering heterogeneous biofilm structures with low density and hydraulic conditions is thus favoured with low concentrations of aoc and in conjunction with p limitation in both ro and uf membrane systems with and without application of hydraulic crossflow 3 1 3 microbial enrichment through eukaryote cultivation derlon et al 2012 demonstrated that the presence of eukaryotic organisms in gravity driven ultrafiltration gdf systems resulted in the gradual formation of spatially heterogeneous biofilm structures with a lower hydraulic resistance the absence of predation by metazoan organisms resulted in flat and compact biofilm structures derlon et al 2013 a practical strategy to supplement the presence of higher organism biofilm predators on the membrane surface was not provided tang et al 2018 later investigated the influence of an integrated granular activated carbon gac membrane hybrid system to serve as eukaryotic pre incubator inclusion of gac before gdf systems increased concentration of higher organisms within the membrane biofilm improved eukaryotic predation and speculatively helped engineer more permeable and heterogeneous biofilm physical structures tang et al 2018 experimental controls were however not provided to uncouple the effects of decreased nutrient loading due to physical sorption biological removal from effects of predation on biofilm development the findings of tang et al 2018 demonstrate the early potential of a nature based solution for the cultivation of biofilm predators to engineer the physical structure of membrane biofilms if so the conventional application of antimicrobials for mitigating microbial growth would have catastrophic effects on the survival of eukaryotic organisms required for maintaining spatially heterogeneous structures with a lower hydraulic resistance avoiding application of antimicrobials to maintain favourable conditions for eukaryotic predation must be balanced with the need to limit biofilm overgrowth the following section discusses how membrane process operation conditions such transmembrane pressure and shear stress can be applied to change the eps composition and physical structure to help maintain biofilm growth below the pain threshold and sustain a low hydraulic resistance 3 2 membrane process operation 3 2 1 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux during filtration at constant permeate flux as the biofilm accumulates on the surface of the membrane and or as pore blockage occurs the transmembrane pressure must increase relative to the increase in hydraulic resistance in order to maintain contain permeate flux valladares linares et al 2015 dreszer et al 2014 demonstrated an increase in permeate flux due to increased tmp caused a decrease in biofilm thickness and an increase in biofilm resistance indicating biofilm compaction after elevated flux operation the biofilm thickness was reduced to 75 and the hydraulic resistance increased to 116 of the original values oct imaging of the biofilm with increased permeate flux revealed that the biofilm became compacted dreszer et al 2014 biofilm compression following an increase in permeate flux in response to sudden changes in tmp was also confirmed by the experiments of desmond et al 2018c in the context of engineering biofilm structure by regulation of permeate flux consideration must be given to limiting flux field et al 2011 limiting is defined as the maximum stationary permeation flux which can be reached when increasing trans membrane pressure limiting flux theory was largely developed for filtration of inert particle suspensions limiting flux is also observed in systems operating with membrane biofilms during gravity driven filtration stepwise increases in transmembrane pressure leads to the onset of limiting flux but is non ideal due to irreversible compression of the membrane biofilm desmond et al 2018c operation below the limiting flux avoids over compaction of the biofilm and engineers biofilm with a low hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 indicate the selection of a lower initial flux limited compaction of the biofilm allowing the hydraulic resistance remained low and stable over time meanwhile long term operation at an elevated transmembrane pressure permeate flux led to reduced permeability that was attributed to a compacted biofilm the elevated hydraulic resistance could not be attributed to increased foulant accumulation alone and strong correlation was made to the internal structure of the biofilm thus operating filtration systems below the limiting flux offers a valid strategy to engineer biofilms with low density and thereof hydraulic resistance in submersed membrane bioreactors tmp relaxation was evaluated as a strategy to detach the membrane biofilm and allow permeate water recovery shi et al 2020 however recent investigations demonstrated poor efficacy in decreasing hydraulic resistance by tmp relaxation fortunato et al 2020 shi et al 2020 fortunato et al 2020 monitored the impact of tmp relaxation in gdf systems on the physical structure of membrane biofilm it was demonstrated that relaxation led to an increase in thickness and a decrease in the biomass specific hydraulic resistance obviously the biofilm responded like a compressible sponge no enhancement in membrane performance was reported these results are comparable to shi et al 2020 who demonstrated tmp relaxation allows partial decompression of the membrane and partial detachment from the membrane the biofilm however remained anchored at discrete locations across the surface of the membrane decompression of the biofilm can reduce specific hydraulic resistance and density but not enough to improve membrane performance due to the irreversible biofilm compression mechanical properties of membrane biofilms thus include not only an elastic reversible component but also a plastic irreversible element jafari et al 2018 thus to fully avoid compression of membrane biofilms and avoid the irreversible formation of dense biofilm structures membrane modules must be operated at low and constant tmp permeate flux to help maintain low density biofilms with high permeability 3 2 2 shear stress crossflow and air scouring shear stress is used in membrane filtration systems applied during drinking water treatment to limit biofilm accumulation and aid the detachment of organic and inorganic material from the surface of the membrane and is cited as a biofilm mitigation strategy nguyen et al 2012 however long term application of shear stress to control biofilm development in membrane filtration seems to be unsuccessful dreszer et al 2014 this could largely be due to the fact the microorganisms unlike inert particles can adapt their physiology to thrive in harsh hydromechanical environments and can develop resilience to imposed shear stress by increase production of highly adhesive eps park et al 2011 recent investigations into the impact of hydraulic shear stress induced by crossflow on biofilm development in membrane fouling simulators in drinking water applications indicate that the shear stress can actively influence the composition and physical structure of the biofilms with consequences for hydraulic resistance and filtration performance dreszer et al 2014 tang et al 2016 dreszer et al 2014 investigated the influence of hydraulic regimes and concluded that operation at high crossflow velocities increased biomass accumulation and secretion of polysaccharide rich eps yielding dense biofilm structures biomass accumulation was related to the nutrient load which is the result of both nutrient concentration and linear flow velocity it was demonstrated that reducing the nutrient concentration in the feed water enabled the application of higher crossflow velocities without overproduction of polysaccharide based eps thus lowering the propensity to form dense homogeneous structures dreszer et al 2014 this indicates the utility of combining different process control strategies e g pre treatment particle reduction crossflow velocity to engineer the chemical composition of the biopolymers with an impact on biofilm structural development and hydraulic resistances the formation of dense physical structures with high hydraulic resistance under shear induced by increased crossflow velocities is comparable to the development of biofilm structures under shear induced by air scouring ding et al 2016 demonstrated that the thickness of the membrane biofilms formed in gravity driven ultrafiltration membrane bioreactors operated with air scouring was lower than the thickness resulted in reactors operated without air scouring ca 129 vs 344 µm biofilms exposed to frequent air scouring were reported to be thinner denser and have a higher hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2014 also found that the dense biofilms contained substantially higher concentration of polysaccharides compared to biofilms formed without aeration shear thus operating at lower shear stress can help develop a biofilm with lower density and lower hydraulic resistance through manipulation of eps composition an architectonic determinant of microbial biofilms from these studies it can be concluded that variable levels of shear stress induced by hydraulic crossflow and or air scouring can be used as a process operation tool to bias formation of certain biofilm structures although in the short term the high shear removes part of the biofilm operating a low shear stress i e low crossflow rate could help on the longer term to engineer global biofilm structural and hydraulic properties with lower densities and less hydraulic resistance by avoiding compaction via tangential flow and reducing concentration of polysaccharide based eps compared to biofilms formed under high shear stress crossflow environments application of low shear stress would first have to consider operational practicalities such as particulate concentration and required pre treatment strategy for their reduction decreased shear stress increases risk of particulate accumulation which would otherwise cause membrane clogging in the lumen of hollow fibre membranes or feed spacer fouling in spiral wound membrane configurations 4 future research directions 4 1 biofilm porosity and magnetic resonance techniques we suggest here that the quantitative reports of internal porosity in membrane biofilms are currently not supported by adequate experimental evidence nor by a reliable methodology this is due to the recognised technical limitations of gold standard biofilm visualisation methods such oct and clsm relating to internal shadowing oct compositionally dependant refractive index oct and selective staining clsm wagner and horn 2017 wagner et al 2010 future efforts should focus on incorporating established methods applied in clinical and biomedical sciences to visualise organic cellular based structures and local fluid flow pattern an example would be the wider use of magnetic resonance imaging mri and related techniques to date such techniques have largely been used to simply identify the location of biofilm accumulation in a variety of support structures relying on differences in nmr relaxation properties or self diffusivity to realise the required image contrast between biofilm and surrounding free fluid future work should focus on more quantitative imaging of biofilms such that local water concentrations and thus biofilm structural heterogeneity can be determined whilst the resolution of such imaging is comparatively limited at present mri measurements can be complemented by spatially unresolved nmr measurements of self diffusivity which can be interpreted to determine domains of free water within the biofilm structure at the micron length scale however mri is limited by a low resolution between 30 and 50 µm and the likely occurrence of visual artefacts e g shadowing which may reduce its utility for visualising biofilm pore structures reported in numerical models by jafari et al 2019 to be lower than 5 µm in diameter in terms of convective transport through biofilm structures similar nmr techniques can be used to determine displacement probability distributions known as propagators inside biofilm structures and how these evolve with observation time manz et al 2003 vogt et al 2013 this evolution is directly related to the heterogeneity of the biofilm structure and presents a uniquely powerful technique to interrogate water permeability in such structures 4 2 how does eps chemical composition influence hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms different eps components can interact with inorganic ions influencing the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by biofilm structuration through intermolecular interaction desmond et al 2018a pfaff et al 2021 biofilms with high concentrations of anionic eps such as certain classes of polysaccharides e g alginate like exopolysaccharide and edna can form dense biofilm structures with high hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018a however whether alginate layers are a suitable surrogate system to mirror complex physiology of polymicrobial biofilms e g spatiotemporal variation in local composition and hydraulics is subject to critical debate and requires clarification observations made in alginate gel layers must be validated in polymicrobial biofilm systems to determine the relevance of experimental observations furthermore the influence of local physico chemical characteristics such as local ph on the eps material properties e g viscoelasticity and plasticity and consequently on permeability is less known it is anticipated the physicochemical characteristics of eps can determine the biofilms overall hygroscopic character and influence the partitioning coefficient between external water and that present in the biofilm structure it has been claimed that hydrophilic eps would decrease the partitioning coefficient between water and eps increasing the permeability by decreasing biofilm hydraulic resistance sun et al 2020 conversely hydrophobic components of eps would increase the partitioning coefficient of water into the biofilm therein increasing over all hydraulic resistance recent developments in situ biofilm analysis have opened the possibility to link local flow velocities within an intact biofilm structure to local eps compositions over the biofilm depth the combined use of computational fluid dynamics and mri nmr to determine local flow distribution pintelon et al 2009 and 2 3d confocal raman microscopy to determine local chemical compositions of eps desmond et al 2018a may assist in co localisation of permeability values with specific compositions of eps in biofilm structures this would improve understanding of how variation in local eps compositions can influence local and overall hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms 4 3 why are membrane biofilms stratified membrane biofilms with a stratified structure were reported by jafari et al 2018 and jafari et al 2019 on gravity driven ultrafiltration membranes the stratified biofilm exhibited a rough surface layer above a dense base layer which had high hydraulic resistance and adhesion to the membrane surface how and why stratified biofilm structures occur is the subject of debate with several hypotheses put forward one hypothesis suggests that the formation of a dense base layer is due to the nutrient limitation possibly both electron donor and acceptor at the membrane surface in co diffusional biofilms alpkvist et al 2006 in biofilms formed on membranes not only co diffusion of electron acceptor and donor takes place but also convection through the permeate flux aiding rapid assimilation of nutrient as such the permeate of gdf systems have a low concentration of assimilable organic carbon aoc that can restrict microbial growth 80 µg aoc l chomiak et al 2015 low nutrient limiting conditions at the biofilm membrane interface may lead to activation of the bacterial stringent stress response local starvation which triggers local secretion of extracellular polymeric substrates eps at the biofilms base increasing local density and therein hydraulic resistance alpkvist et al 2006 jafari et al 2018 picioreanu et al 2000 alternatively the base layer may be constituted by the accumulation of dead cell mass that could be not researched by nutrient diffusion however whether the low nutrient concentrations at the biofilm membrane interface are sufficient to increase eps secretion and lead to the formation of a stratified biofilm structure is not known and requires detailed investigation 5 conclusions when investigated under different experimental conditions e g compression feedwater variation hydraulic resistance depends more on biofilm density than on any other biofilm structure parameter e g thickness surface roughness or resistance parameter pore blocking membrane resistance we conclude efforts to reduce overall filtration resistance should focus on reducing the density of membrane biofilms reducing the density of membrane biofilms can be achieved by modulating biofilm growth via pre treatment and operational processes such as i feed water nutrient composition concentration ii transmembrane pressure tmp and iii cross flow velocity cfv alone or in tandem consideration must be given to whether laboratory studies linking pre treatment and process operational conditions to low density biofilm formation are scalable to application and whether the concept of biofilm engineering can be extended to other biofilm parameters such as mechanical stability to enable better management of recalcitrant biofilms in water engineering systems e g pipelines and or cooling towers 1 hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms deviates from assumptions derived from classic particle based filtration theory as biofilms being made by living organisms unlike inert particle layers can adjust their physical and chemical properties in adaptation to operationally defined environmental conditions this invites greater opportunity for regulation of biofilm hydraulic resistance by manipulation of growth conditions by pre treatment or process operation 2 hydraulic resistance has greater dependency on the density of biofilm eps eps density and thereof biofilm density is governed by intermolecular interactions and local hydromechanical forces high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna serve as ligands for divalent cations which by decreasing the volume between eps strands lead to biofilm structures with low permeability however greater consideration must be given to experimental systems for biofilm development to ensure fidelity to real life conditions and avoid system based artefacts e g narrow selection of eps low microbial diversity 3 pre treatment of membrane influent can help engineer biofilms with low density and hydraulic resistance through manipulation of biopolymer loading and nutrient ratio of dissolved organic nutrient feedwater with low assimilable organic carbon concentration combined with phosphorus limitation in membrane filtration systems help forming biofilms with lower concentrations of polysaccharide and edna and lower propensity to self assemble into dense structures with high hydraulic resistance promotion of eukaryotic predation on the membrane surface can assist formation of more permeable biofilm structures 4 operating mf uf membrane modules with low shear stress induced by hydraulic flow or gas sparging helps reducing mechanical compression of the biofilm structure thus lowering the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm the friction force exerted by the viscous permeate flow compresses the biofilm material thereby reducing the pore size and limiting the water passage declaration of competing interest

16380,the application of membrane technology for water treatment and reuse is hampered by the development of a microbial biofilm biofilm growth in micro and ultrafiltration mf uf membrane modules on both the membrane surface and feed spacer can form a secondary membrane and exert resistance to permeation and crossflow increasing energy demand and decreasing permeate quantity and quality in recent years exhaustive efforts were made to understand the chemical structural and hydraulic characteristics of membrane biofilms in this review we critically assess which specific structural features of membrane biofilms exert resistance to forced water passage in mf uf membranes systems applied to water and wastewater treatment and how biofilm physical structure can be engineered by process operation to impose less hydraulic resistance below the pain threshold counter intuitively biofilms with greater thickness do not always cause a higher hydraulic resistance than thinner biofilms dense biofilms however had consistently higher hydraulic resistances compared to less dense biofilms the mechanism by which density exerts hydraulic resistance is reported in the literature to be dependant on the biofilms internal packing structure and eps chemical composition e g porosity polymer concentration current reports of internal porosity in membrane biofilms are not supported by adequate experimental evidence or by a reliable methodology limiting a unified understanding of biofilm internal structure identifying the dependency of hydraulic resistance on biofilm density invites efforts to control the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by engineering internal biofilm structure regulation of biofilm internal structure is possible by alteration of key determinants such as feed water nutrient composition concentration hydraulic shear stress and resistance and can engineer biofilm structural development to decrease density and therein hydraulic resistance future efforts should seek to determine the extent to which the concept of biofilm engineering can be extended to other biofilm parameters such as mechanical stability and the implication for biofilm control removal

either the mass of accumulated eps or embedded microbial cells ding et al 2016 dreszer et al 2013 the usual chronological order of biofilm affected membrane performance indicators are first the feed channel pressure drop increase followed by a permeate flux decline and at a later stage a salt passage increase siebdrath et al 2019 the development of a biofilm on the membrane and feed spacer called here membrane biofilm gives rise to a secondary barrier of biological nature and thus can cause a decline in membrane process performance especially if biofilm permeability is lower than intrinsic

less consequence for nanofiltration and reverse osmosis nf ro membranes due higher intrinsic membrane resistance of the latter dreszer et al 2013 i e orders of magnitude greater than the hydraulic resistance of the membrane biofilm ro biofilm development presents a greater problem for crossflow resistance biofilm on spacers and concentration polarisation bucs et al 2015 herzberg and elimelech 2007 siebdrath et al 2019 the core of this review will deal with the biofilm effects on the hydraulic resistance of mf uf membranes biofilm development in mf uf necessitates increasing the feed pressure to maintain water production and the need to apply chemical cleanings and in ultimate cases untimely membrane replacement membrane cleaning and frequent membrane replacement represents a significant portion of operating expenditure opex and should be reduced to allow economic operation jafari et al 2020 vrouwenvelder et al 1998 decades of research focussing on biofilm inactivation or biofilm dispersion by non specific reagents e g enzymes surfactants inorganic salts ph shifts did not succeed in controlling microbial biofouling and reducing biofilm hydraulic resistance on a long term nguyen et al 2012 in principle all membrane systems in water treatment carry biofilms but not all of them suffer from biofouling caused by the presence of a biofilm gravity driven membrane gdm filtration even benefits from the biofilm presence due to stable flux production and laboratory experiments reporting improvements in permeate quality chomiak et al 2015 even for gdm filtration the permeate flux is rather low whether a system exhibits biofouling depends upon the extent of the contribution of biofilms to flux decline this observation lead to the concept of the threshold of interference a k a pain threshold above which biofilm effects meet arbitrary operational and biofouling is diagnosed while below this threshold no biofouling is recorded flemming 2020 fig 1 the realisation that membrane filters could maintain a reasonable hydraulic permeability without complete removal of the biofilm under continuous dead end conditions therein keeping biofilms below the

hydraulic resistance to the physical structure of membrane biofilms total filtration resistance during mf uf is defined by the resistance in series ris model foley 2013 the ris model is widely employed to uncouple parameters influencing flux decline such that j δ p μ r m r pb r f where j is flux through the membrane l m2 h p is the transmembrane pressure bar µ is the dynamic viscosity pa s rm is the membrane hydraulic resistance rpb is the pore blockage resistance and rf is the fouling biofilm cake resistance all resistance are in m 1 distinguishing to what extent one or more parameter rm rpb rf governs overall filtration resistance is possible by comparing initial clean water flux and physical removal of the fouled membrane desmond et al 2018a fortunato et al 2016 studies reporting autopsy by physical scraping of the uf biofilms formed under various feedwater and process operational conditions consistently evidenced the biofilm layer contributes ca 60 80 to overall filtration resistance desmond et al 2018a fortunato et al 2016 fortunato et al 2017 peter varbanets et al 2010 any irreversible increase in hydraulic resistance above the intrinsic resistance of the membrane after physical removal by scraping of the biofilm from the membrane surface is attributed to pore blockage rpb 20 40 fortunato et al 2016 fortunato et al 2017 jermann et al 2007 pore blocking may arise from adsorption of low molecular weight natural organic matter or biofilm by products e g surfactants biomass associated products bap into the membrane s pores the lesser contribution of rbp compared to rf in uf membranes treating surface water may arise from the biofilm layer functioning as a secondary filtration barrier which can help reduce membrane adsorption and pore blockage during filtration of natural organic matter nom of polymeric and lmw acid range as indicated for removal of viral particles heistad et al 2009 filtration resistance is additionally postulated to arise from adsorption rad of nom to the membrane surface and is considered as a recalcitrant fouling layer persisting after hydraulic removal of a gel layer however in recent years direct visualisation of the membrane surface revealed retention of a biofilm gel residual layer of several micrometres that can resists hydraulic shear stress desmond et al 2018b jafari et al 2019 section 2 2 thus the historical consideration of rad may in fact be an indication of a residual biofilm layer reflecting stratification in its cohesion and should be approached with caution in the absence of direct visualisation the dominant contribution of the surface biofilm rf to overall filtration resistance supports the basis for dedicated efforts to engineer biofilms below the threshold of interference and is thus the focus of this review 2 1 hydraulics of biofilm layers according to darcy s law j κ η dp dz j κ η dp dz the flux of permeate j i e volume passed per area filtration layer per time m3 m2 s or l m2 h is proportional with the pressure gradient dp dz across the layer and the medium permeability κ and inversely proportional with the passing fluid viscosity η seader et al 1998 when the layer of thickness l is hydraulically homogeneous one can express darcy s law also in terms of the specific resistance r l κ 1 m of that layer as j δ p η r when applied to a clean membrane this becomes j p f p p η r m with driving force being the pressure difference between the feed pf and the permeate pp sides of the membrane fig 2 a with a biofilm fouling layer on the membrane surface the biofilm resistance rf adds in series with that of the membrane so that the decreased flux is j p f p p η r m r f if the same pressure difference is maintained conversely if operating at constant flux j then the pressure difference must be proportionally increased to compensate the additional resistance so that the transmembrane pressure now p m p p fig 2b remains the same in general both the membrane and the biofilm can comprise several sub layers with different hydraulic properties so that j p f p p η r i if one layer has a hydraulic resistance much larger than the others that may determine the overall flux for example in ro the membrane resistance rm 1016 1017 1 m radu et al 2010 dominates the biofilm resistance rf 1012 1 m jafari et al 2018 by orders of magnitude but in mf uf rm 1011 1012 1 m martin et al 2014 which makes the biofilm contribution very significant noticeably not only the layer thickness lf determines the characteristic resistance but also its permeability κf which implies that a thin but rather impermeable biofilm layer can reduce more the permeate flux or requires increased pressure p f p p to drive the same flux than a thick but permeable layer fig 2c d several expressions for the hydraulic resistance of porous media have been derived with the best known being hagen poiseuille r f 32 d p 2 ε l f assuming laminar flow through straight pores kozeny carman r f 180 τ d p 2 ε 3 1 ε 2 l f with inclined pores of tortuosity τ and ergun r f 150 d p 2 ε 3 1 ε 2 l f assuming packed spheres seader et al 1998 all these relations acknowledge that the hydraulic resistance increases proportionally with an increase in the layer thickness lf and pore tortuosity factor τ which is the increase in effective hydraulic path compared with straight pores and with the decrease of porosity ε but strongly increases quadratically with a smaller pore diameter dp fig 3 thus larger and more pores can significantly increase the flux and decrease the hydraulic resistance compared to biofilm thickness alone furthermore in dynamic operation conditions i e with changing transmembrane pressure tmp or permeate flux the biofilms properties lf ε dp τ can all be variable water permeation through the biofilm layer causes a structural rearrangement casey 2007 with biofilm compression derlon et al 2016 desmond et al 2018c which decreases the porosity and increases the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2014 valladares linares et al 2015 as described by the mathematical model developed in jafari et al 2018 the extent of biofilm compression and subsequent hydraulic resistance increase results from the balance between forces due to permeate flow i e pore pressure and permeate drag and structural forces opposing deformation i e biofilm viscoelasticity and plasticity gradients of porosity can develop within the biofilm layer jafari et al 2019 along with gradients of mechanical strength which make compressed biofilms more difficult to be removed during the cleaning these properties can be evaluated numerically with poroelasticity tools coussy 2004 by coupling the fluid flow models through porous media i e darcy brinkman etc with various solid mechanics models for the biofouling layer i e elastic elastoplastic viscoelastic etc when the numerical models are used in conjunction with microscopic e g optical coherence tomography oct measurements values of the hydraulic parameters can be estimated not only in simpler one dimensional models of uniform thickness and homogeneous biofilm layer jafari et al 2019 but also taking into account the effects irregular layer geometries i e surface roughness and heterogeneous or multiple layers jafari et al 2019 an example of simulation results showing the dependency of flux on hydraulic and mechanical properties of heterogeneous biofilm layers is presented in fig 4 2 2 factors affecting biofouling layer hydraulic resistance 2 2 1 biofilm thickness for particle filtration one commonly measures the particle mass deposited on the membrane surface m f a m kg m2 because it is related to the average cake layer thickness lf and therefore it determines the filtration resistance an increased mass per area is supposed to increase the passage length due to a thicker cake leading to increased resistance when the particle volume fraction ϕs and density of solid particles ρ s are constant and related by m f a m ϕ s ρ s l f foley 2013 and makes the broad assumption that the fouling layer is homogeneously distributed across the membrane surface unlike a layer of inert particles membrane biofilms are dynamic systems deviating from the expectation that mass accumulation is proportional to average thickness and thereof hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 used the relation between the measured mass accumulation and hydraulic resistance to determine an average biofilm thickness when operating at a fixed permeate flux value of 20 l m2 h resulting biofilms were thicker and with a higher permeability than biofilms formed under a permeate flux of 100 l m2 h this suggested that thickness of the biofilm layer is not necessarily proportional to permeate flux or hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 concluded that the higher hydraulic resistance of the biofilm grown at 100 l m2 h was the effect of a higher density a key limitation in the thickness calculation of dreszer et al 2013 is that the concentration of biofilm biomass is homogeneously distribution over the membrane surface this however is not always the case and biofilm surface coverage is largely heterogeneously distributed across the membrane characterised by thick biomass mounds and valleys of thin biofilm derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018a later analyised biofilm structural morphology and average thickness by optical coherence tomography oct and proposed that average biofilm thickness thus the liquid passage length can influence hydraulic resistance only in biofilms with a comparable morphology e g biomass density porosity and heterogeneity expressing the level of variability of these properties in space on the other hand significantly thicker biofilms ca 800 µm with heterogenous morphology and lower density had lower hydraulic resistance compared to thinner biofilms ca 200 µm with homogeneous morphology and higher density it was determined that correlating hydraulic resistance to mean biofilm thickness was not accurate for heterogeneous biofilm structures and that other measures such as surface roughness i e the heterogeneity of the biofilm thickness in addition to density and pore fraction may play a significant role the use of oct to measure average biofilm thickness is considered appropriate due to the high penetration depth allow high level of visualisation of both the biofilm liquid interface and the biofilm membrane interface oct is not restricted by incomplete biofilm liquid interface visualisation due to potential for unstained constituents marring the use of fluorescence methods wagner and horn 2017 while shadowing effects may occur this is more so problematic for deriving internal biofilm architecture such as internal porosity but biofilm thickness derlon et al 2012 2 2 2 biofilm surface roughness biofilm surface roughness is defined as the smoothness of the biofilm surface liquid boundary layer as it relates to the variation in biofilm thickness wagner and horn 2017 wagner et al 2010 derlon et al 2012 proposed the hydraulic resistance was influenced by biofilm surface roughness when comparing biofilm morphology and hydraulic resistance in gravity driven ultrafiltration systems with and without predation by higher organisms the hydraulic resistance of thick mounds of biofilm interspersed by valleys of thin biofilm across the membrane surface was postulated to be higher than biofilm adjacent to the membrane due to increased passage length derlon et al 2012 following a line of least resistance water was postulated to pass through the membrane where an absent or only a very thin biofilm is present derlon et al 2012 martin et al 2014 provided a simulation based description of the observations of derlon et al 2012 biofilm layers with a high surface roughness i e an irregular geometry had lower hydraulic resistances compared to flat or compact fouling layers with a comparable thickness martin et al 2014 for a given mean fouling layer thickness an increase in spatial heterogeneity could increase the permeate flux by over an order of magnitude the model results were dependant on several other factors such as the membrane resistance the fouling layer permeability and eps and cellular biomass spatial distribution later fortunato et al 2017 studied the formation of surface roughness and the change of permeate flux during biofilm maturation contrary to the physical reality that the main flow should be directed through areas of low hydraulic resistance their interpretation of computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations was that rough surface appendages exhibited higher flux than the thinner structures biofilm cavities due to the presence of liquid vortices in the biofilm valleys which could lower the pressure gradient thus decreasing permeation these results were contested by jafari et al 2019 who indicated that the small axial velocities would only lead to a negligible pressure drop compared to the trans membrane pressure gradient and that simulation results from fortunato et al 2017 were merely wrongly interpreted both jafari et al 2019 see fig 4 and other cfd simulations with mass transfer radu et al 2010 radu et al 2012 have also clearly shown how the higher flux water passage occurs through areas of thinner biofilm however desmond et al 2018b later demonstrated erosion of the rough biofilm surface layer comprising ca 60 80 overall biofilm thickness in biofilms formed on real and synthetic surface water by incremental increases in hydraulic shear stress had a negligible impact on hydraulic resistance this is comparable to observations in pilot and full scale cross flow ultrafiltration systems which report poor cleaning efficacy with hydraulic cleaning alone jafari et al 2020 this also lends evidence to the suggestion that previously considered fouling mechanisms such as pore blocking and adsorption may be attributed to a retained biofouling layer with high adhesion to the membrane morphological observations by oct revealed retention of a residual densified biofilm ca 50 100 µm with low surface roughness adjacent to the membrane termed biofilm base layer physical removal of the base layer led to a reduction hydraulic resistance within 20 of the intrinsic resistance of the membrane with the remaining hydraulic resistance accounted for by the intrinsic resistance ca 5 of the membrane and pore blockage ca 15 fig 5 desmond et al 2018b it was concluded the biofilm hydraulic resistance was governed by the biofilms base layer the presence of a base layer was indicated by the stabilisation in biofilm thickness under increasing shear stress up to 3 pa observable at multiple positions along the flow cell length x y coordinates and is considered representative and valid structural feature of membrane biofilms when compared to the conceptual model presented by derlon et al 2012 one could consider the mounds of biofilm to represent rough surface layer which exerts a lower hydraulic resistance compared to adjacent area of thin biofilm however stratification in biofilm hydraulic resistance and physical structure was not investigated by derlon et al 2012 instead authors broadly assumed the thickness exerted most amount of resistance as opposed to other structural parameters e g density porosity later numerical modelling by jafari et al 2019 demonstrated stratification in the hydraulic structural and mechanical properties of membrane biofilms grown on similar feedwater i e river water to derlon et al 2012 this brought computational substantiation of the observations of stratification in hydraulic resistance reported by desmond et al 2018b 2 2 3 biofilm density the density of the fouling layer proved to be a critical determinant of hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018a valladares linares et al 2015 the density of membrane biofilms ρf biofilm mass as kg total organic carbon toc per m3 biofilm is empirically derived by the simple expression ρ f m f a m l f where mf is the biofilm mass kg toc am is membrane surface area m2 and lf is the average biofilm thickness m desmond et al 2018a more recently fortunato et al 2020 proposed biofilm density can be determined optically using oct imaging by recording the ratio between the biomass pixels intensity and the background pixels intensity of a membrane biofilm however optical measurements were not validated by conventional density measurements thereby limiting critical comparison to previous work moreover quantitative analysis of internal biofilm structure using oct imaging is oversimplified influent complexity e g both soluble non soluble organic substrate bulk suspended biomass and biofilm structure can reduce the certainty of whether visualized areas of low absent intensity are in fact areas of absent biomass or result from compositional i e refractive index heterogeneity shadowing of overlying biomass and or accumulated non soluble substrate conclusions should not ultimately be drawn from quantified images without experimental controls that consider the role of experimental artefacts e g particulate loading shadowing from suspended biomass which falsely present as areas of lower density and or absent biomass desmond et al 2018a compared the hydraulic resistance of biofilms with similar average thickness but different densities of calculated mass of extracellular polymeric substances and membrane area thin ca 100 µm dense biofilms had a greater hydraulic resistance than thicker ca 800 µm biofilms with lower eps densities despite being several hundred micrometres thinner eps constitutes 90 of the biofilm s overall biomass concentration with a low fraction attributed to bacterial cell concentration desmond et al 2018a dreszer et al 2013 eps density of membrane biofilms can be considered representative of the biofilm overall density it was concluded that the eps density and internal molecular packing density could impose greater resistance than biofilm thickness compacted biofilms i e grown at a low pressure flux then exposed to higher pressures fluxes had an irreversible increase in hydraulic resistance valladares linares et al 2015 related the irreversible increase in hydraulic resistance to a corresponding increase in density fig 6 namely the same amount of biomass occupied a smaller microscale volume due to the reorganization of the biofilm increasing the eps concentration desmond et al 2018c calculated the biofilm density in gravity driven membrane systems and noted an increase upon compaction proportional to the observed increase in hydraulic resistance this observation was supported by reversible compression and relaxation experiments on homogeneous biofilm structures further reversible compression relaxation cycles caused a decrease in density and thus a reduction in hydraulic resistance thus the changes in the eps density and not biofilm thickness were suggested as the critical determinant for hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018a dreszer et al 2013 valladares linares et al 2015 biofilm density is also influenced by physical interactions e g electrostatic within the eps mayer et al 1999 pfaff et al 2021 recently pfaff et al 2021 found that by increasing the feedwater ca2 concentration the density of alginate fouling layer as well as its hydraulic resistance increased and correlated to flux decline in membrane filtration in their experiments the alginate layer density reached a plateau around 8 mm ca2 indicating saturation of anionic binding sides it was hypothesised addition of ca2 created a salt bridge between two negatively charged residues via hydrogen bond formation 10 30 kj mol to form an array of repeating polymeric blocks termed an egg box configuration giraudier et al 2004 such interactions can form uniform packing structures with reduced volume between neighbouring strands of eps leading to the formation of homogeneous biofilm physical structures the hydraulic response of the alginate layer mirrored the hydraulic behaviour of polysaccharide fouling layers observed by herzberg et al 2009 albeit in reverse osmosis membrane systems herzberg et al 2009 indicated calcium increases the adsorption of polysaccharides and dna by 2 and 3 fold respectively the increased adsorption of eps onto the membrane resulted in a significant decrease in permeate water flux however the physical structure of the fouling layer was not quantified limiting any link between a structural parameter and hydraulic resistance the impact of eps composition on biofilm physical structure and hydraulic resistance was later assessed by desmond et al 2018a who substantiated the link between secretion of anionic eps polysaccharides and edna increased density of actual biofilms and not surrogate compounds formed on ultrafiltration membranes under phosphorus limiting condition the study of desmond et al 2018a however made use of biofilms formed under synthetic raw water which lacked inclusion of complex nature organic matter and complex microbial community thus the fidelity of biofilms formed under synthetic influent conditions and also with surrogate compounds compared to membrane biofilms is highly dubious simplified experimental models do not consider the complexity of natural organic matter microecology and spatiotemporal variations present in more complex biofilm systems cultivated under environmental conditions jafari et al 2020 this may account for the bias in literature towards reporting the detection and function of anionic as opposed to cationic and or non ionic polymers which may be preferentially selected in a simplified experimental system despite the short comings of typical experimental systems employed to study the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms regardless of the specific system the biofilm or surrogate layer with greater biopolymer density consistently exhibited a higher hydraulic resistance compared to less dense biofilms the mechanism by which density affects hydraulic resistance is intuitively linked to the internal packing structure e g porosity and polymer concentration per µm3 which can be influenced by both mechanical stress and steric interaction between neighbouring polymeric strands however as discussed in the following section the relationship between biofilm density and internal packing structure is difficult to delineate with no formalized conceptual model or adequate methodological repertoire for examining the biofilm internal structure 2 2 4 biofilm porosity the prevailing vista in biofilm literature is that biofilms exhibit discrete internal pore structures in between construction material made of biopolymers fortunato et al 2017 melo 2005 the underlying assumption of this conceptual model is that the biofilm is a discontinuous structural matrix akin to swiss cheese i e with holes fig 7 a melo 2005 postulated biofilms exhibit a dual pore structure containing large macro pores water channels interspersed by polymer aggregates and micro pores inside these aggregates as in models defining tortuosity for solute mass transfer in the macro pores mass transfer of both water and solute could occur by both diffusion and convection in smaller pores water convection would face a high resistance due to greater packing density of eps molecules and solute diffusion would prevail melo 2005 later application of oct and clsm with corresponding image analysis suggested initial evidence of pore like structures at the biofilms meso 5 µm and micro scale 0 2 µm respectively fortunato et al 2017 peter varbanets et al 2010 fortunato et al 2017 reported a decrease in porosity from quantified oct images from 0 20 at day 5 to almost zero where 0 is non porous corresponded with an increase in hydraulic resistance despite a near zero porosity reading water still permeated through the biofilm indicating potential culverts below the axial resolution of the oct ca 3 µm while oct has superior penetration depth compared to clsm shadowing effects during oct imaging might occur this is problematic for reliable quantification of internal porosity from oct images pore like structures visualised using oct are quantified as the number of void voxels in the biofilm layer analysis is performed on binarized data whereas the pixels were classified in empty 0 and filled 1 wagner et al 2010 the descriptor is the ratio of void space under the biofilm layer and the total biofilm area however it is not possible to differentiate between areas of absent biomass and areas of low signal intensity arising from shadowing wagner and horn 2017 similar with the determination of biofilm density by oct fortunato et al 2017 correct experimental controls and or complementary computation analysis is required when evaluating the biofilm porosity computational analysis by jafari et al 2018 indicated that hydraulic resistance is plausibly dependant on pore particle reorganization but only at a scale lower than 3 5 µm whereby when foulant layer deformation occurs below the detectable threshold 3 µm biofilm hydraulic resistance would increase by 110 the computational work of jafari et al 2018 substantiated the earlier postulation from peter varbanets et al 2010 who reported the formation of microscale pore like structures in biofilm layers in gravity driven ultrafiltration membranes using clsm and an aquatic fluorescent aquatic tracer peter varbanets et al 2010 observed biofouling layer thickness increased over time ca 200 µm while the hydraulic resistance remained constant it was assumed an increase of the channel s diameter or number fig 3 counteracted the effect of increased passage length due to increased biofouling layer accumulation as the maximum axial resolution of clsm is about 0 8 µm the reported microscale channels must be greater than 0 8 µm and less than 3 5 µm channels not observable under oct however direct and convincing visualisation of the aquatic tracer within the reported microchannel was not possible due to poor light penetration over the biofilms depth a key limitation of clsm in complex biofilm systems an alternative view is that the internal structure of a membrane biofilm is a continuous polymeric matrix with embedded cells with structural heterogeneity only in eps composition and concentration as in the conceptual model of vrouwenvelder et al 2017 described as the hair in sink effect therein forced water passage occurs through a continuous network of entangled eps chains fig 8 b permeation of water occurs through a continuous eps mesh and exhibits preferential flow through areas of decreased polymer concentration as opposed to assuming the total absence of biomass as in the micro mesoscale channel models melo 2005 hydraulic resistance is in this model imposed by areas of increased volumetric polymer concentration i e decreased volume between eps molecules and or passage length defined by the tortuosity within the network of entangled eps chains casey 2007 vrouwenvelder et al 2017 fig 3 7b in such a model the eps entanglement is analogous to the polymeric matrix constituting the active layer of reverse osmosis membranes zhang et al 2009 as opposed to the porous membranes for mf uf mass transport theory in reverse osmosis membranes assumes the active layer is a non porous structure i e does not contain distinct pores foley 2013 in which solute and solvent molecules are dissolved and diffuse through the three dimensional polymeric mesh cahill et al 2008 foley 2013 libotean et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 future modelling efforts should seek to develop biofilm hydraulic models also based on the approaches describing permeate flux in reverse osmosis membranes i e based on partition coefficients between eps and the transported molecules water salts and molecular diffusion one could first assume that the partitioning coefficients are constant and uniformly distributed but this may not be the case given eps are charged compounds capable of electrostatic interactions and with different hygroscopic character desmond et al 2018a sun et al 2020 especially the hygroscopic properties of the eps may be of interest to be determined and incorporated into future models we propose both hypothetical models from melo 2005 and the hair in sink model from vrouwenvelder et al 2017 reflects the stratification observed in the physical structure of membrane biofilms therein the rough surface layer is representative of an aggregated biofilm structure with macro pores while the dense homogeneous base layer close to the membrane surface is comparable to a continuous biofilm gel jafari et al 2018 3 can we engineer biofilms below the pain threshold using membrane pre treatment and process operational controls the dependency of hydraulic resistance on biofilm density and its internal architecture invites efforts to reduce the hydraulic resistance by engineering internal biofilm structure reducing the packing density could in principle decrease the hydraulic resistance and improve filtration performance desmond et al 2018c jafari et al 2018 if feasible operator intervention could focus on finding the conditions to engineer biofilm structures that allow remaining biofilms below the pain threshold low density and hydraulic resistance through manipulation of feed water composition and concentration and tailoring process operation e g crossflow rather than trying to prevent biofilm formation by imposing harsh environmental conditions membrane pre treatment and the operational crossflow velocities are design parameters that help reduce fouling and flux decline in membrane filtration systems akhondi et al 2015 howe and clark 2006 huck et al 2009 existing membrane process design focuses on reducing biofilm accumulation by restricting particle nutrient loading and or application of antimicrobials in hope of inhibiting bacterial growth beyer et al 2017 lee et al 2016 woo et al 2015 multiple studies and extensive industrial experience showed that biofilm mitigation is ineffective on a long term due to the biofilm adaptation to new environments in fact biofilm mitigation strategies could exacerbate the development of slow growing and highly resilient membrane biofilms vitzilaiou et al 2019 the following section evaluates membrane pre treatment and process operational strategies and presents parameters tailored to help engineer the formation of low density biofilms remaining below the pain threshold that hampers hydraulic performance 3 1 feedwater quality nutrient concentration and in general raw water quality can be altered by membrane pre treatment to lower the accumulation of in organic matter onto the surface of the membrane and restrict microbial growth griebe and flemming 1998 maartens et al 2000 vedavyasan 2007 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 pre treatment focuses on removing small suspended particles insoluble salts and more recently nutrients e g phosphorus reduction vedavyasan 2007 recent studies examining biofilm development on the surface of membrane filters with and without physical or chemical pre treatment have shown that differences in influent composition can affect the biofilm structural development and hydraulic resistance javier et al 2020a tang et al 2018 wang et al 2008 contrary to abiotic foulants microorganisms can grow in the system even if their concentration has been minimized entering the system microorganisms multiply on the expense of biodegradable substances which may thus constitute the limiting factors for biofilm growth therefore anything which can support microbial growth belongs to the targets to minimize when limiting biofouling 3 1 1 particle removal through fine sieving micro sieving has been proposed to reduce the accumulation of large particles on the membrane surface aiding performance of the gravity driven filtration gdf however in gdf chomiak et al 2014 demonstrated that fine particles in feed water kaolin induced the formation of a compact and homogeneous biofilm structure after 30 days of operation larger particles diatomite helped counterbalance the effect of fine particles due to the formation of a more heterogeneous and permeable biofilm structure the hydraulic resistance of biofilms formed in the presence of fine particles was significantly higher than the resistance of biofilms formed in the absence of any inorganic particles or the presence of the mixed particle population this indicates the application of conventional micro sieving which permits fine particle passage and large particle exclusion could lead to the formation of a dense homogeneous biofilm structure with high hydraulic resistance whether improvements in flux were attributed solely to biofilm structural development or reduction in small particles forming a filter cake at the biofilm membrane interface was not investigated however the overall hydraulic resistance of biofouling layers in spiral wound mf uf would not be likely to be reduced by the presence of larger particulate matter in the feed water 3 1 2 nutrient restriction and enrichment 3 2 2 1 natural organic matter and biopolymer accumulation pre treatment by granular activated carbon or slow sand filtration can reduce loading of natural organic matter nom onto the membrane surface vedavyasan 2007 the conventional understanding of engineers is that restriction of nom loading onto the surface of the membrane will lower adsorption of foulants onto the membrane surface and limit hydraulic resistance howe and clark 2006 huck et al 2009 maartens et al 2000 however recent evaluation by zhang et al 2021 evidenced the presence of a conditioning film of biopolymers on the membrane surface can drive microbial selection and engineered the formation of a thick heterogeneous biofilm with a low density zhang et al 2021 it was concluded that the initial available biopolymers altered the conditions for bacterial recruitment and adhesion and in turn influenced biofilm composition physical structure and filtration performance this points to the importance of cultivating initial conditioning films as a means to engineer biofilms below the threshold of interface which are otherwise removed by conventional pre treatment strategies however the selection of a pre treatment strategy e g gac ssf must balance the transmission of beneficial compounds for low density biofilm development against unwanted foulants which may lead to unwanted pore block and increased filtration resistance e g humic acids 3 2 2 2 dissolved organic nutrients pre treatment strategies are additionally used to lower the loading of dissolved organic nutrients in influent water through the membrane by applying adsorbents e g granular activated carbon or sand filters flemming et al 1996 griebe and flemming 1998 it is generally anticipated lower nutrient load onto the surface of a membrane filter will lower the rate of microbial growth and biofilm establishment in extensively pre treated water phosphate p limitation was proposed by vrouwenvelder et al 2010 as a method to control biofouling of spiral wound ro membranes the ro installation was characterized by a low feed channel pressure drop increase and low biomass concentrations in membrane elements this installation contrasted with installations fed with less extensively pre treated feed water i e higher phosphate concentrations and experienced a high pressure drop increase and high biomass concentrations in first stage membranes membrane fouling simulator mfs studies by vrouwenvelder et al 2010 showed that low phosphate concentrations 0 3 μg p l in the feed water restricted the pressure drop increase and biomass accumulation even at high substrate organic carbon concentrations contrary reports were later provided by desmond et al 2018a albeit in gravity driven ultrafiltration membranes demonstrating membrane biofilms cultivated by excluding p addition in synthetic surface waters exhibited increased eps production and hydraulic resistance compared to biofilms cultivated with a balanced nutrient ratio the increase in eps production consisted of anionic extracellular polymeric substances which formed dense physical structures and thereof elevated hydraulic resistance javier et al 2020a later demonstrated that biofouling control in reverse osmosis membrane systems by phosphorus limitation strongly depends on the assimilable organic carbon concentration aoc p restriction under non limiting concentrations led to similar increased eps production as described by desmond et al 2018a despite being observed in different membrane types ro vs ultrafiltration membranes under different modes of operation crossflow vs dead end and likely different microbial communities resulting biofilms demonstrated a conserved metabolic response to the imposed nutrient regime it can be concluded that engineering heterogeneous biofilm structures with low density and hydraulic conditions is thus favoured with low concentrations of aoc and in conjunction with p limitation in both ro and uf membrane systems with and without application of hydraulic crossflow 3 1 3 microbial enrichment through eukaryote cultivation derlon et al 2012 demonstrated that the presence of eukaryotic organisms in gravity driven ultrafiltration gdf systems resulted in the gradual formation of spatially heterogeneous biofilm structures with a lower hydraulic resistance the absence of predation by metazoan organisms resulted in flat and compact biofilm structures derlon et al 2013 a practical strategy to supplement the presence of higher organism biofilm predators on the membrane surface was not provided tang et al 2018 later investigated the influence of an integrated granular activated carbon gac membrane hybrid system to serve as eukaryotic pre incubator inclusion of gac before gdf systems increased concentration of higher organisms within the membrane biofilm improved eukaryotic predation and speculatively helped engineer more permeable and heterogeneous biofilm physical structures tang et al 2018 experimental controls were however not provided to uncouple the effects of decreased nutrient loading due to physical sorption biological removal from effects of predation on biofilm development the findings of tang et al 2018 demonstrate the early potential of a nature based solution for the cultivation of biofilm predators to engineer the physical structure of membrane biofilms if so the conventional application of antimicrobials for mitigating microbial growth would have catastrophic effects on the survival of eukaryotic organisms required for maintaining spatially heterogeneous structures with a lower hydraulic resistance avoiding application of antimicrobials to maintain favourable conditions for eukaryotic predation must be balanced with the need to limit biofilm overgrowth the following section discusses how membrane process operation conditions such transmembrane pressure and shear stress can be applied to change the eps composition and physical structure to help maintain biofilm growth below the pain threshold and sustain a low hydraulic resistance 3 2 membrane process operation 3 2 1 transmembrane pressure and permeate flux during filtration at constant permeate flux as the biofilm accumulates on the surface of the membrane and or as pore blockage occurs the transmembrane pressure must increase relative to the increase in hydraulic resistance in order to maintain contain permeate flux valladares linares et al 2015 dreszer et al 2014 demonstrated an increase in permeate flux due to increased tmp caused a decrease in biofilm thickness and an increase in biofilm resistance indicating biofilm compaction after elevated flux operation the biofilm thickness was reduced to 75 and the hydraulic resistance increased to 116 of the original values oct imaging of the biofilm with increased permeate flux revealed that the biofilm became compacted dreszer et al 2014 biofilm compression following an increase in permeate flux in response to sudden changes in tmp was also confirmed by the experiments of desmond et al 2018c in the context of engineering biofilm structure by regulation of permeate flux consideration must be given to limiting flux field et al 2011 limiting is defined as the maximum stationary permeation flux which can be reached when increasing trans membrane pressure limiting flux theory was largely developed for filtration of inert particle suspensions limiting flux is also observed in systems operating with membrane biofilms during gravity driven filtration stepwise increases in transmembrane pressure leads to the onset of limiting flux but is non ideal due to irreversible compression of the membrane biofilm desmond et al 2018c operation below the limiting flux avoids over compaction of the biofilm and engineers biofilm with a low hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 indicate the selection of a lower initial flux limited compaction of the biofilm allowing the hydraulic resistance remained low and stable over time meanwhile long term operation at an elevated transmembrane pressure permeate flux led to reduced permeability that was attributed to a compacted biofilm the elevated hydraulic resistance could not be attributed to increased foulant accumulation alone and strong correlation was made to the internal structure of the biofilm thus operating filtration systems below the limiting flux offers a valid strategy to engineer biofilms with low density and thereof hydraulic resistance in submersed membrane bioreactors tmp relaxation was evaluated as a strategy to detach the membrane biofilm and allow permeate water recovery shi et al 2020 however recent investigations demonstrated poor efficacy in decreasing hydraulic resistance by tmp relaxation fortunato et al 2020 shi et al 2020 fortunato et al 2020 monitored the impact of tmp relaxation in gdf systems on the physical structure of membrane biofilm it was demonstrated that relaxation led to an increase in thickness and a decrease in the biomass specific hydraulic resistance obviously the biofilm responded like a compressible sponge no enhancement in membrane performance was reported these results are comparable to shi et al 2020 who demonstrated tmp relaxation allows partial decompression of the membrane and partial detachment from the membrane the biofilm however remained anchored at discrete locations across the surface of the membrane decompression of the biofilm can reduce specific hydraulic resistance and density but not enough to improve membrane performance due to the irreversible biofilm compression mechanical properties of membrane biofilms thus include not only an elastic reversible component but also a plastic irreversible element jafari et al 2018 thus to fully avoid compression of membrane biofilms and avoid the irreversible formation of dense biofilm structures membrane modules must be operated at low and constant tmp permeate flux to help maintain low density biofilms with high permeability 3 2 2 shear stress crossflow and air scouring shear stress is used in membrane filtration systems applied during drinking water treatment to limit biofilm accumulation and aid the detachment of organic and inorganic material from the surface of the membrane and is cited as a biofilm mitigation strategy nguyen et al 2012 however long term application of shear stress to control biofilm development in membrane filtration seems to be unsuccessful dreszer et al 2014 this could largely be due to the fact the microorganisms unlike inert particles can adapt their physiology to thrive in harsh hydromechanical environments and can develop resilience to imposed shear stress by increase production of highly adhesive eps park et al 2011 recent investigations into the impact of hydraulic shear stress induced by crossflow on biofilm development in membrane fouling simulators in drinking water applications indicate that the shear stress can actively influence the composition and physical structure of the biofilms with consequences for hydraulic resistance and filtration performance dreszer et al 2014 tang et al 2016 dreszer et al 2014 investigated the influence of hydraulic regimes and concluded that operation at high crossflow velocities increased biomass accumulation and secretion of polysaccharide rich eps yielding dense biofilm structures biomass accumulation was related to the nutrient load which is the result of both nutrient concentration and linear flow velocity it was demonstrated that reducing the nutrient concentration in the feed water enabled the application of higher crossflow velocities without overproduction of polysaccharide based eps thus lowering the propensity to form dense homogeneous structures dreszer et al 2014 this indicates the utility of combining different process control strategies e g pre treatment particle reduction crossflow velocity to engineer the chemical composition of the biopolymers with an impact on biofilm structural development and hydraulic resistances the formation of dense physical structures with high hydraulic resistance under shear induced by increased crossflow velocities is comparable to the development of biofilm structures under shear induced by air scouring ding et al 2016 demonstrated that the thickness of the membrane biofilms formed in gravity driven ultrafiltration membrane bioreactors operated with air scouring was lower than the thickness resulted in reactors operated without air scouring ca 129 vs 344 µm biofilms exposed to frequent air scouring were reported to be thinner denser and have a higher hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2014 also found that the dense biofilms contained substantially higher concentration of polysaccharides compared to biofilms formed without aeration shear thus operating at lower shear stress can help develop a biofilm with lower density and lower hydraulic resistance through manipulation of eps composition an architectonic determinant of microbial biofilms from these studies it can be concluded that variable levels of shear stress induced by hydraulic crossflow and or air scouring can be used as a process operation tool to bias formation of certain biofilm structures although in the short term the high shear removes part of the biofilm operating a low shear stress i e low crossflow rate could help on the longer term to engineer global biofilm structural and hydraulic properties with lower densities and less hydraulic resistance by avoiding compaction via tangential flow and reducing concentration of polysaccharide based eps compared to biofilms formed under high shear stress crossflow environments application of low shear stress would first have to consider operational practicalities such as particulate concentration and required pre treatment strategy for their reduction decreased shear stress increases risk of particulate accumulation which would otherwise cause membrane clogging in the lumen of hollow fibre membranes or feed spacer fouling in spiral wound membrane configurations 4 future research directions 4 1 biofilm porosity and magnetic resonance techniques we suggest here that the quantitative reports of internal porosity in membrane biofilms are currently not supported by adequate experimental evidence nor by a reliable methodology this is due to the recognised technical limitations of gold standard biofilm visualisation methods such oct and clsm relating to internal shadowing oct compositionally dependant refractive index oct and selective staining clsm wagner and horn 2017 wagner et al 2010 future efforts should focus on incorporating established methods applied in clinical and biomedical sciences to visualise organic cellular based structures and local fluid flow pattern an example would be the wider use of magnetic resonance imaging mri and related techniques to date such techniques have largely been used to simply identify the location of biofilm accumulation in a variety of support structures relying on differences in nmr relaxation properties or self diffusivity to realise the required image contrast between biofilm and surrounding free fluid future work should focus on more quantitative imaging of biofilms such that local water concentrations and thus biofilm structural heterogeneity can be determined whilst the resolution of such imaging is comparatively limited at present mri measurements can be complemented by spatially unresolved nmr measurements of self diffusivity which can be interpreted to determine domains of free water within the biofilm structure at the micron length scale however mri is limited by a low resolution between 30 and 50 µm and the likely occurrence of visual artefacts e g shadowing which may reduce its utility for visualising biofilm pore structures reported in numerical models by jafari et al 2019 to be lower than 5 µm in diameter in terms of convective transport through biofilm structures similar nmr techniques can be used to determine displacement probability distributions known as propagators inside biofilm structures and how these evolve with observation time manz et al 2003 vogt et al 2013 this evolution is directly related to the heterogeneity of the biofilm structure and presents a uniquely powerful technique to interrogate water permeability in such structures 4 2 how does eps chemical composition influence hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms different eps components can interact with inorganic ions influencing the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by biofilm structuration through intermolecular interaction desmond et al 2018a pfaff et al 2021 biofilms with high concentrations of anionic eps such as certain classes of polysaccharides e g alginate like exopolysaccharide and edna can form dense biofilm structures with high hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018a however whether alginate layers are a suitable surrogate system to mirror complex physiology of polymicrobial biofilms e g spatiotemporal variation in local composition and hydraulics is subject to critical debate and requires clarification observations made in alginate gel layers must be validated in polymicrobial biofilm systems to determine the relevance of experimental observations furthermore the influence of local physico chemical characteristics such as local ph on the eps material properties e g viscoelasticity and plasticity and consequently on permeability is less known it is anticipated the physicochemical characteristics of eps can determine the biofilms overall hygroscopic character and influence the partitioning coefficient between external water and that present in the biofilm structure it has been claimed that hydrophilic eps would decrease the partitioning coefficient between water and eps increasing the permeability by decreasing biofilm hydraulic resistance sun et al 2020 conversely hydrophobic components of eps would increase the partitioning coefficient of water into the biofilm therein increasing over all hydraulic resistance recent developments in situ biofilm analysis have opened the possibility to link local flow velocities within an intact biofilm structure to local eps compositions over the biofilm depth the combined use of computational fluid dynamics and mri nmr to determine local flow distribution pintelon et al 2009 and 2 3d confocal raman microscopy to determine local chemical compositions of eps desmond et al 2018a may assist in co localisation of permeability values with specific compositions of eps in biofilm structures this would improve understanding of how variation in local eps compositions can influence local and overall hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms 4 3 why are membrane biofilms stratified membrane biofilms with a stratified structure were reported by jafari et al 2018 and jafari et al 2019 on gravity driven ultrafiltration membranes the stratified biofilm exhibited a rough surface layer above a dense base layer which had high hydraulic resistance and adhesion to the membrane surface how and why stratified biofilm structures occur is the subject of debate with several hypotheses put forward one hypothesis suggests that the formation of a dense base layer is due to the nutrient limitation possibly both electron donor and acceptor at the membrane surface in co diffusional biofilms alpkvist et al 2006 in biofilms formed on membranes not only co diffusion of electron acceptor and donor takes place but also convection through the permeate flux aiding rapid assimilation of nutrient as such the permeate of gdf systems have a low concentration of assimilable organic carbon aoc that can restrict microbial growth 80 µg aoc l chomiak et al 2015 low nutrient limiting conditions at the biofilm membrane interface may lead to activation of the bacterial stringent stress response local starvation which triggers local secretion of extracellular polymeric substrates eps at the biofilms base increasing local density and therein hydraulic resistance alpkvist et al 2006 jafari et al 2018 picioreanu et al 2000 alternatively the base layer may be constituted by the accumulation of dead cell mass that could be not researched by nutrient diffusion however whether the low nutrient concentrations at the biofilm membrane interface are sufficient to increase eps secretion and lead to the formation of a stratified biofilm structure is not known and requires detailed investigation 5 conclusions when investigated under different experimental conditions e g compression feedwater variation hydraulic resistance depends more on biofilm density than on any other biofilm structure parameter e g thickness surface roughness or resistance parameter pore blocking membrane resistance we conclude efforts to reduce overall filtration resistance should focus on reducing the density of membrane biofilms reducing the density of membrane biofilms can be achieved by modulating biofilm growth via pre treatment and operational processes such as i feed water nutrient composition concentration ii transmembrane pressure tmp and iii cross flow velocity cfv alone or in tandem consideration must be given to whether laboratory studies linking pre treatment and process operational conditions to low density biofilm formation are scalable to application and whether the concept of biofilm engineering can be extended to other biofilm parameters such as mechanical stability to enable better management of recalcitrant biofilms in water engineering systems e g pipelines and or cooling towers 1 hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms deviates from assumptions derived from classic particle based filtration theory as biofilms being made by living organisms unlike inert particle layers can adjust their physical and chemical properties in adaptation to operationally defined environmental conditions this invites greater opportunity for regulation of biofilm hydraulic resistance by manipulation of growth conditions by pre treatment or process operation 2 hydraulic resistance has greater dependency on the density of biofilm eps eps density and thereof biofilm density is governed by intermolecular interactions and local hydromechanical forces high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna serve as ligands for divalent cations which by decreasing the volume between eps strands lead to biofilm structures with low permeability however greater consideration must be given to experimental systems for biofilm development to ensure fidelity to real life conditions and avoid system based artefacts e g narrow selection of eps low microbial diversity 3 pre treatment of membrane influent can help engineer biofilms with low density and hydraulic resistance through manipulation of biopolymer loading and nutrient ratio of dissolved organic nutrient feedwater with low assimilable organic carbon concentration combined with phosphorus limitation in membrane filtration systems help forming biofilms with lower concentrations of polysaccharide and edna and lower propensity to self assemble into dense structures with high hydraulic resistance promotion of eukaryotic predation on the membrane surface can assist formation of more permeable biofilm structures 4 operating mf uf membrane modules with low shear stress induced by hydraulic flow or gas sparging helps reducing mechanical compression of the biofilm structure thus lowering the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm the friction force exerted by the viscous permeate flow compresses the biofilm material thereby reducing the pore size and limiting the water passage declaration of competing interest

16381,microplastics as emerging contaminants have been detected from peaks to poles high concerns on the risks of microplastic pollution to humans and ecosystems have therefore been raised in the past decade while a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the environmental levels and toxicity of microplastics the information generated to support risk assessment is fragmented and the coherence between different types of study is largely lacking here we introduced the aggregate exposure pathway aep a conceptual framework originally proposed for chemical exposure assessment to facilitate organization visualization and evaluation of existing information generated from microplastic research and to efficiently identify future knowledge and regulatory needs a putative microplastic aep network mpaep was developed to demonstrate the concept and model development strategies two mpaep case studies with polyethylene pe as a prototype were then presented based on existing environmental exposure data collected from the changjiang estuary and the east china sea case i and the oslo fjord case ii respectively weight of evidence woe assessment of the mpaeps were performed for evaluating the essentiality theoretical plausibility empirical evidence and quantitative understanding of the evidence and relationships in the aeps both cases showed moderate high woe to support the strength of the models whereas also displayed clear knowledge gaps thus providing guidance for future investigations and regulations the mpaep framework introduced herein presents a novel strategy for organizing fragmented information from diverse types of microplastic research enhancing mechanistic understanding of causal relationships and facilitating the development of quantitative prediction models for research and regulation in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aggregate exposure pathway aep weight of evidence exposure modeling next generation risk assessment 1 introduction plastics mark the start of a new geological epoch the plastic age by its deposition in fossil records brandon et al 2019 an estimated 710 million metric tons of plastic debris have ended up in the terrestrial and aquatic environments by 2016 lau et al 2020 once entering the environment plastics can be fragmented into tiny pieces by physical chemical and biological processes thompson et al 2004 van sebille et al 2020 zettler et al 2013 the small plastic fragments and fibers less than 5 mm in size are referred to as microplastics they are considered contaminants of emerging concern due to their ubiquitous distribution and persistency in the environment accumulating evidence in recent years has shown considerable levels of microplastics in various environmental compartments including water soil and atmosphere hale et al 2020 hurley et al 2018 lusher 2015 rillig and lehmann 2020 although a large number of studies have been conducted in the past decade to investigate the environmental fate and risks of microplastics the knowledge generated was fragmented and several remaining issues have not been fully resolved first information related to environmental levels of microplastics is fragmented the reported sizes of microplastics in the environment range from micro and nanometre to 5 mm spanning more than 6 orders of magnitude there is normally no size specification associated with the reported abundance of microplastics making the data incomparable across different studies second there are no clear causal linkages of size and abundance data reported for sources environmental media and biota integrated study on point and diffuse sources where microplastics are released into the environment is lacking microplastics with various shapes density and polymer types behave differently in the environment and its pathway into biota are different from that into various environmental media garcia et al 2021 third there are large discrepancies between the measured exposure levels of microplastics in biota and the levels of microplastics used for eco toxicity testing gouin et al 2019 phuong et al 2016 making the hazard assessment of microplastics unreliable these issues call for more holistic and mechanism based approaches for organizing disjointed streams of knowledge into a coherent information framework with critical knowledge gaps clearly visualized such new approaches are key for next generation nexgen risk assessment of microplastic pollution as one of the new approaches to integrate organize visualize and evaluate existing exposure information the aggregate exposure pathway aep framework has been gradually gaining momentum in human and ecological risk assessment teeguarden et al 2016 an aep links a cascade of causally related key exposure states kess such as source exposure medium external exposure internal exposure and target site exposure tse of a chemical by their key transitional relationships ktrs into a pathway or pathway network fig 1 a thereby providing mechanistic information on how a chemical reaches an organism and mediates adverse effects of regulatory concern a well developed aep can integrate exposure information from multiple types of studies and guide laboratory eco toxicity assessment the aep framework was proposed to mirror adverse outcome pathway aop a conceptual framework to organize eco toxicological information relevant for hazard and risk assessment ankley et al 2010 compared to the aop framework the aep framework is still in its infancy and has only been demonstrated by a few cases clewell et al 2020 hines et al 2019 2018 tan et al 2018 teeguarden et al 2016 nevertheless it has great potential to improve the current microplastic research by offering a new way of organizing exposure data and identifying coherence between information generated from different studies the present study aims to 1 critically review the existing knowledge and develop an aep framework for microplastics mpaeps to improve mechanistic and quantitative understanding of microplastic exposure 2 assess weight of evidence of the aeps to identify critical knowledge gaps 3 demonstrate the usefulness of the mpaeps by case studies 4 propose potential applications of the mpaep framework in microplastic research and regulation 2 mpaep assembly and assessment a conceptual mpaep network was assembled first to provide a general overview on the knowledge status and to illustrate the aep development strategies fig 1b this putative aep network links point and diffuse sources to immune cells as the tse via 8 kess that have been frequently reported as key exposure states of microplastics in the environment and biota the selection and assessment of major nodes in this aep network will be discussed in detail in the following sections 2 1 stressor this putative mpaep network is considered to cover all types of plastic particles at the micrometer scale 1 μm 5 mm engineered nanoparticles 100 nm enps or large plastic particles 5 mm are not applicable to this mpaep network due to their relatively lower environmental relevance hüffer et al 2017 xu et al 2020 in contrast synthetic and cellulosic microplastic fibers are included due to their prevalence in the composition of microplastics athey et al 2020 as transport and fate of microplastics may differ by polymer type size and shape additional information on key characteristics size shape sampling strategies and locations from published studies were also considered important information to support this aep network 2 2 key exposure states a key exposure state kes is an essential element of an aep a kes refers to the level of a stressor at a critical state relevant for exposure teeguarden et al 2016 tan et al 2018 such as source exposure medium external exposure internal exposure and target site exposure 2 2 1 source source refers to the levels and rates of release of a pollutant at the site of its origin tan et al 2018 the starting points could be the initial creation of the substance or it could be based on an arbitrary point that is convenient for measurement and control both point and diffuse sources are considered major sources of microplastics in this aep network although the sources of microplastics are not as clearly defined as other chemical pollutants an increasing number of studies have started to investigate the sources of microplastics such as atmospheric transport wastewater treatment plants wwtp dust and food habib et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b 2020c 2 2 2 exposure medium exposure medium refers to the level of a pollutant in a key environmental compartment that is directly associated with the exposure of biota such as water air or soil clewell et al 2020 in the proposed aep network air water and soil are considered the main exposure media while most reports on microplastics levels focus on the marine environment some studies showed significantly higher levels of microplastics in the freshwater environment especially in the vicinity of populated urban areas wang et al 2017 moreover atmospheric and terrestrial transport of microplastics has recently been recognized allen et al 2019 rillig and lehmann 2020 for microplastic abundance the reported units can be n l 1 n m 3 and n km 2 for water samples and n kg 1 wet weight or n kg 1 dry weight for sediment samples due to different sampling strategies 2 2 3 external exposure external exposure refers to the level of a pollutant adsorbed inhaled or ingested by an organism e g dermal exposure in the putative aep network the amount of microplastics particles individual 1 or g 1 wet weight in digestive tracts and gills are therefore considered as external exposure levels based on the reported data 2 2 4 internal exposure internal exposure refers to the body burden internal level of a pollutant absorbed in an organism key processes such as adsorption distribution metabolism and elimination adme or toxicokinetics of pollutants are considered driving factors determining the internal exposure level compared to organic chemicals large particles such as microplastics are considered to have much simpler toxicokinetics in organisms the frequently reported internal exposure level of a pollutant is normally the measured concentration in tissue organ or body fluid e g blood or haemolymph microplastics are normally not considered readily absorbed by organisms due to large sizes and difficulties in penetrating biological membranes 2 2 5 target site exposure target site exposure tse refers to the level of a pollutant at its biological site of toxic action such as a specific type of cell e g immune cell or macromolecules e g dna protein lipid tse is tightly coupled with the molecular initiating event mie of an aop which refers to the initial biochemical interaction that leads to an adverse outcome the suspected target sites of microplastics include lysosome cells enterocyte hepatopancreas and phagocyte brennecke et al 2015 frydkjær et al 2017 gambino et al 2020 jeong et al 2016 park et al 2020 sucharitakul et al 2020 von moos et al 2012 xu et al 2020 the immune system in aquatic organisms is regarded as a sensitive target for effects induced by particulate pollutant at nano scales barmo et al 2013 therefore immune cells are determined as tse in the conceptual mpaep 2 3 key transitional relationships a key transitional relationship ktr describes the relationship between two adjacent kess aeps have two types of ktrs which are movement and conversion of stressors between kess tan et al 2018 in the conceptual mpaep network fig 1b the ktrs are proposed based on the theoretical plausibility suggested by relevant literature for particulate microplastics movement ktrs are dominant albeit conversion ktrs are possible due to abrasion or loss of microplastics by agglomeration and sedimentation however the selection of sources for mpaeps indicates that conversion ktrs may be less important e g wwtps in the case studies microplastics are known to be discharged into the air water and sediments from both point and diffuse sources water is an import medium for microplastic precipitation from the air deposition into the sediment and exposure of aquatic organisms such as zooplankton fish and bivalves the frequently documented target organs of exposure are gill and gut very few studies have reported the exact molecular cellular targets of microplastics there is however limited evidence showing that the immune cells might be the initial target of exposure in these organisms park et al 2020 2 4 weight of evidence assessment weight of evidence woe indicates the strength of scientific evidence supporting an aep as there are currently no woe assessment criteria developed for the aep framework clewell et al 2020 we have adapted a set of criteria table 1 based on oecd s guidance on aop development and assessment oecd 2018 the criteria include 1 essentiality of the kes 2 theoretical plausibility of the ktr 3 empirical support for the ktr and 4 quantitative understanding of the ktr the confidence level is scored as high moderate or low according to the quality of evidence support in a formal aep document similar as aops the aep developers are expected to not only provide final woe scores but also provide detailed justifications underlying the scores and point out critical data gap and knowledge needs it consists of data gap where knowledge is well defined but empirical data hasn t been reported in literature and a data gap where there it is not clear if there is a transition a model description or data indicating two kess are connected 3 demonstrative cases we will then use two practical case studies to demonstrate the development and assessment of aeps for microplastics two distinct types of aquatic environments in china case i changjiang yangtze estuary east china sea and norway case ii oslo fjord were selected because considerable amount of data in the study areas was available to support the development and assessment of the aeps both cases focus on polyethylene pe microplastics as a prototype as pe is the most produced polymer in the world plastics europe 2020 and ubiquitously identified in the aquatic environment the pe polymer has a density range of 0 91 0 94 g cm 3 low density polyethylene ldpe or 0 93 0 97 g cm 3 high density polyethylene hdpe in the two case studies only investigations that successfully identified pe using chemical techniques fourier transform infrared spectrometry raman spectroscopy or mass spectrometry were considered valid in addition the reported microplastic concentrations displayed for the two cases were the total concentrations of all types of polymers in different environmental compartments 3 1 case i discharge of microplastics from wastewater treatment plants leading to fish exposure in china 3 1 1 overview of the study region the changjiang river is the largest river in china with a basin area of 1 8 106 km2 gao and wang 2008 located in a monsoon climate the freshwater discharge to the east china sea forms a strong changjiang river plume with sediment concentration of 0 005 kg m 3 that reaches 200 km from the estuary wu et al 2011 being the largest estuary in china the changjiang estuary ce has active material exchange and huge material fluxes which forms the largest fishing ground in china the zhoushan fishing ground gao and wang 2008 shanghai the economic center and the world s largest port is situated in the changjiang estuary with a population over 24 million posing pressure to the coastal environments we have therefore developed an aep for assessing microplastic exposure in this region with special focus on how pe microplastics discharged from urban wastewater can lead to exposure of marine fish fig 2 3 1 2 general description of the aep twenty peer reviewed publications were selected to develop a location specific aep for pe microplastic in the changjiang estuary and the east china sea si table s1 the literature was selected by searching keywords including microplastic changjiang estuary yangtze river estuary and east china sea using google scholar scholar google com for publications in english and baidu scholar xueshu baidu com for publications in chinese only environmental data on the aqueous phases was included as the target exposure organ in this case study is gills of fish quantification methods for kes 1 4 require spectroscopic methods with detection limit down to 20 μm i e micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or micro raman spectroscopy an aep with six kess was assembled to describe the movement pathways of pe in the changjiang estuary east china sea region fig 2 the source kes 1 was considered to be the wwtp on the east coast of shanghai where pe microplastic was discharged into the south passage of the changjiang estuary bai et al 2018 jia et al 2019 surface water in the estuary kes 2 exposure medium 1 was considered to be the initial exposure medium kes 2 as supported by multiple studies reporting the microplastic abundance in the changjiang estuary in 2017 and 2018 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the surface water in the east china sea was considered as the secondary exposure medium kes 3 as evidenced by five studies reporting measured pe concentrations li et al 2020 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 the external exposure level kes 4 was estimated based on the whole body concentrations measured in wild fish whereas the internal exposure kes 5 was supported by the measured levels of pe in fish gills and microplastic fibers can pass through branchial chamber of fish gills su et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 in this case immune cells in fish were considered the target site of exposure kes 6 because quantification method using imaging flow cytometry proved phagocytosis of microplastics by fish immune cells park et al 2020 it should be noted that there are also several other biological targets of pe e g liver muscle barboza et al 2020 collard et al 2017 however we will only focus on the immune cells as the tse for this aep as relatively more evidence support could be obtained 3 1 3 essentiality of the kes essentiality evaluates whether the occurrence of a downstream event is dependent on an upstream event the essentiality of kes 1 source wwtp is considered moderate with some supporting evidence showing massive and direct discharge of microplastic from the wwtps in shanghai to the changjiang estuary resulting in high concentrations of microplastics in the changjiang estuary peng et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the essentiality of kes 2 external exposure medium estuary is considered moderate as the estuary is the main geophysical and hydrological feature in the study region studies on seasonal variations of microplastic concentration in the changjiang estuary and the east china sea ce and ecs also showed consistent relationship of microplastic levels between ce and ecs zhao et al 2019 reduced discharge from ce also leads to a decrease in microplastic concentration in ecs the essentiality of kes 3 external exposure medium sea surface water is considered low due to a lack of evidence to support that a change in microplastic concentration in surface water leads to a change in microplastic concentration in fish kes 4 external exposure fish is considered to have a moderate essentiality as the importance of fishery in the ecs has led to abundant investigation on food chain composition and higher level fish species are found to be sentinels for indicating microplastic pollution zhang et al 2019 these facts collectively support that fish is a critical node in the aep of pe microplastic kes 5 internal exposure gill per se was supported by the measured concentrations of microplastics suggesting bioaccumulation of pe in these organs su et al 2019 albeit quantification methods for small microplastics 50 μm have not been widely applied to field studies however there is no study reporting the correlation between kes 5 and kes 6 target site exposure immune cells therefore the essentiality of kes 5 is considered low 3 1 4 theoretical plausibility of the ktr physicochemical processes account for most factors affecting the behavior of microplastics in the aquatic environments table 1 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 1 wwtp to estuary is considered high fig 2 as an in depth literature review has shown consistent relationships between wwtps removal of microplastics and adjacent waters iyare et al 2020 kay et al 2018 woodward et al 2021 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 2 ce to ecs is considered high with several evidence showing riverine plastic discharge influenced by the development index of coastal countries including the outflow from the ce to the ocean mai et al 2020 physicochemical plausibility of ktr 3 sea surface to fish is considered moderate as this causal relationship has only been partially established for microplastic particles the theoretical plausibility of ktr 4 fish to gill is considered high as such causality has been widely recognized with a well understood mechanism for gill epithelium functioning as the forefront for external pollutants evans 1987 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 5 is considered moderate as immune cells have been considered the primary targets of xenobiotics in fish gills alzaidan 2013 hayton and barron 1990 tort et al 2003 albeit not much work has been done to elucidate how exactly microplastics affect immune cells 3 1 5 empirical support for the ktr empirical support evaluates the evidence related relationships of the two events including time space and quantity concentration etc the empirical support for ktr 1 is considered high fig 2 with multiple publications consistently reporting the causal relationships between the pe levels at the wwtps and in the downstream estuary bai et al 2018 jia et al 2019 sun et al 2019 ktr 2 also has a moderate empirical support with strong evidence from field investigations indicating that the concentration of microplastics in the ce and the ecs causally fluctuated across seasons xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the empirical support for ktr 3 is considered moderate with a study reporting more microplastic accumulation in higher trophic level fish species that may function as sentinel species for microplastic pollution zhang et al 2019a the empirical support for ktr 4 is also moderate with only one study reporting the distribution of microplastics in fish organs with gills and gut being the ones with the highest pe levels su et al 2019 currently there is no empirical evidence directly supporting the relationships of pe levels between gills to immune cells therefore the empirical support for ktr 5 is considered low 3 1 6 quantitative understanding there is currently no literature providing quantitative understanding of the ktrs in this aep therefore we have attempted to de novo build the quantitative relationships based on available data from various sources in order to demonstrate how basic quantitative understanding can be established based on limited empirical data log normal distribution was assumed for all microplastic abundance data as suggested by beiras and schönemann 2020 and monte carlo simulation was conducted for 100 000 runs for uncertainty analysis results showed that given a hypothetical level of 50 000 20 000 n m 3 microplastics at the source wwtp the resulting cumulative exposure to fish in ce was estimated to be 0 49 1 85 range 0 07 3 50 with 95 confidence interval n m 3 the most uncertainty comes from the processes of uptake from water to gill and gut fig 3 pointing out a need for more investigations on this part of the aep it should also be noted that due to a lack of valid data and sufficient knowledge of the underlying mechanisms the quantitative understanding of the aep described herein is preliminary with a high level of uncertainty in summary the quantitative understanding of ktr 1 is considered moderate whereas that of the ktr 2 5 in this aep are considered low 3 1 7 critical knowledge gaps and uncertainties the woe assessment of the aep pointed out critical knowledge gaps that may hamper mechanistic and quantitative understanding of the microplastic exposure pathways even in an area where a high number of investigations have been conducted there have been few studies reporting trophic levels of the studied organism and microplastic transfer in the natural environments goswami et al 2020 and mpaep doesn t follow the same principle as biomagnification of chemical pollutants the parameterization of mpaep should therefore be based on the feeding strategy for particles rather than trophic levels birnstiel et al 2019 as shown by case i the microplastic pe abundance in the sea surface has the most evidence support whereas an apparent lack of data to support the external and internal exposure of microplastics possibly due to immature quantification methods with biological samples stanton et al 2019 the strength of the causal relationships in general decreases when walking down the aep from the fate of microplastics in the environment to biota suggesting strong needs for measuring both environmental and biological levels of microplastics in the same investigation i e same spatial and temporal scales and same analytical conditions the current data collected from the published reports could not provide sufficient data to construct a reliable quantitative aep qaep model as the empirical relationships in the aep were not able to be parameterized in an appropriate manner albeit the model construction approach presented herein can still be applied in the future when more data accumulates note that the exposure pathway external and internal are intentionally simplified and more efforts on the external exposure pathways through water filtration targeting gill and food intake through food web targeting gut should be made in summary case i has displayed a good example to illustrate how an mpaep could efficiently organize existing data and identify critical knowledge gaps in the microplastic research on the changjiang estuary and east china sea regions a trial quantitative assessment has also revealed uncertainties of the empirical evidence supporting this aep and highlighted research needs for better assessment of microplastics in biota and simultaneous measurement of at least two key exposure states in the same study 3 2 case ii discharge of microplastics from wastewater treatment plants leading to mussel gill exposure in norway 3 2 1 overview of the study region the norwegian coastlines are characterized by deep silled fjords especially in the western norway where low salinity norwegian coastal current overlaps heavier water with atlantic origin and flows northward under the influence of coastal wind erga and heimdal 1984 contributing to microplastic pollution in the arctic ross et al 2021 oslo the capital of norway with a population of ca 0 7 million is located in the inner oslo fjord the aker river akerselva in norwegian with a drainage area of 250 km2 runs through the city of oslo and reaches inner oslo fjord the study area is under eutrophication since the population growth in the 1900s with industrial development and the establishment of wwtps and improvement of sewage treatment e g bekkelaget in 1963 located to the southeast of oslo significantly affects cultural eutrophication in the oslo fjord dale et al 1999 although both case i and case ii focus on microplastic pollution from urban wastewater to coastal environments there are fundamental differences between the two cases in terms of hydrographic features case i estuary versus case ii fjord 3 2 2 general description of the aep for literature review we searched google scholar using the keywords microplastic norway a total of 21 published literature including peer reviewed research articles master theses and technical reports were used for case ii si table s2 of which six publications directly reported the levels of pe in different environmental compartments investigation on microplastic pollution in norway mainly focused on the oslo fjord and its vicinity but most data failed to report spatiotemporal variation of microplastic concentrations in a specific area but random sampling efforts at some spots a lack of causality of empirical data made it unlikely to construct an mpaep in the region even though considerable efforts have been dedicated to microplastic research sundt 2014 summarized sources of microplastics pe being the dominant type in norwegian waters including consumer products production spill abrasion ship paint laundry wear and tear dust road paint tire dust and waste shredding recycling landfill that enters the environment through runoff drain air sludge soil sea and water two sources were identified considering the geographic location bekkelaget is a wwtp kes 7 that discharges wastewater into the inner oslo fjord but no data on its microplastic removal efficiency or discharge rate has been collected fig 4 a report investigated only microplastics in sludge from bekkelaget and a master thesis investigated microplastic concentration in wwtps in telemark county but no chemical analysis was performed to identify pe lusher et al 2017 lage 2019 another source is the aker river kes 8 that flows into the inner oslo fjord without water exchange with the wwtp a project funded by the norwegian environment agency investigated three rivers in oslo in 2019 with pe detected in two rivers lorenz et al 2020 olsen et al 2020 investigated microplastic in surface water kes 9 in the outflow of the aker river and near wwtp sewage two studies investigated microplastic exposure in blue mussels kes 10 bråte et al 2018 no study investigated internal exposure kes 11 and target site e g immune cells kes 12 of microplastic accumulation in mussels from this region avio et al 2015 3 2 3 essentiality of the kes no studies have investigated the relationships between upstream kess and the downstream kess suggesting the essentiality of all the kes 7 12 in the aep are low 3 2 4 theoretical plausibility of the ktr the theoretical plausibility of ktr 6 wwtp to sea surface and ktr 7 river to sea surface is considered high as many reviews and reports suggested that wwtps and rivers are the major input sources of microplastic in the marine environment iyare et al 2020 lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 8 sea surface to mussel is considered moderate with a review suggesting accumulation of microplastics in mussels living in coastal waters li et al 2019 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 9 mussel to gill and ktr 10 gill immune cells is considered moderate although there are reviews on immune responses exposed to nanoparticles in bivalves barmo et al 2013 canesi et al 2012 park et al 2020 nanoplastics are not all included in the current assessment 3 2 5 empirical support for the ktr the empirical support for ktr 6 10 is scored as low as no study has directly investigated the causal relationships between any of the adjacent kess in this aep 3 2 6 quantitative understanding blue mussels used in this case study are common in temperate seas all around the globe and they are widely used both as seafood and as sentinel organisms in monitoring of anthropogenic pollution in coastal environment the uptake and depuration mechanism of a blue mussel is well described for chemical pollutants björk and gilek 1997 endicott et al 1998 however this model needs to be parameterized for microplastic bioaccumulation microplastics as particles behave differently compared to other chemical pollutants and polymer types with varying densities should be taken into consideration when developing an mpaep wang et al 2016 following the same method as defined in case ⅰ results showed that given a hypothetical wwtp source which contains 1000 500 n m 3 plastic particles the resulting cumulative exposure to mussels living in the oslo fjord was estimated to be 0 45 2 46 n m 3 range 0 07 5 1 with 95 confidence interval the most uncertainty comes from the data collected from the biota suggesting the importance of collecting relevant data to establish the quantitative links between microplastic exposure in the environmental and biological compartments in this region as the aep proposed for this case is simplified due to lack of data future studies should make more efforts on the external exposure pathways through water filtration and link the information to the levels in biota in summary the quantitative understanding of ktr 6 10 is considered low 3 2 7 critical knowledge gaps and uncertainties in case ⅱ the woe assessment pointed out insufficient data for establishing confident causal relationships of pe microplastics from the source to target site of exposure fig 4 a lack of causality in study design directly hampers the understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of pe microplastics and its pathway into target sites in biota in the study region and impedes the development of quantitative prediction models while concentrations in rivers have been frequently reported information on wwtps sea surface water and biota external and internal exposure are scarce although the proposed aep is supported by good theoretical plausibility empirical and quantitative understanding are lacking in summary lack of causality in exposure data from source to tse in oslo fjord are still in great demand from each environmental and biological compartment to generate an mpaep for regulatory needs 4 potential applications of the mpaep framework the mpaep framework can facilitate the unification of the microplastic data reporting and repository systems since the majority of the current microplastic data are fragmented a highly structured data framework such as aep can help better organize existing information in an expert curated common format allowing direct comparison of data across different studies and reuse of information for more comprehensive analysis e g meta analysis at a later stage the mpaep framework forms the basis for future construction of an exposure database for microplastics the mpaep framework can also promote the development of standard operation protocols sops and improve the data quality assurance criteria in microplastic research a well developed aep normally contains a description of methods for measuring the kess si table s1 and s2 thereby demanding highly standardized and repeatable operation protocols data quality is a critical factor influencing the weight of evidence assessment and quantitative understanding of the aeps this issue is not covered by the present study but has been discussed in detail elsewhere isobe et al 2019 van mourik et al 2021 organization of existing knowledge in a structured and coherent manner such as aep can aid to efficient identification of critical knowledge gaps and research needs as illustrated by our case studies the lack of sufficient empirical data for propagating different exposure states of microplastics was clearly visualized by organizing information into mpaeps the woe assessment of the aeps further revealed a lack of coherence between the supporting data emphasizing on the importance of measuring and correlating at least two adjacent exposure states in the same investigation to establish a causal relationship in addition to empirical support the aeps also showed the need for better mechanistic understanding of the behavior of microplastics in both environment and organisms when developing the mechanistic relationships of the mpaep potential quantitative models should be adjusted accordingly recognizing unique features of microplastics due to the difference in bioaccumulation biomagnification polymer types and internal transport pathways compared to chemical pollutants aggregate exposure pathway in combination with aop forms a source to outcome pathway framework as part of the next generation risk assessment suite for organizing exposure and toxicological information hines et al 2019 such holistic approach is particularly important for microplastics not only to re unify fragmented efforts in the current microplastic research but also to increase the cost efficiency of microplastic risk assessment a high number of eco toxicological studies have been performed to assess the hazards of microplastics in various organisms several aops have even emerged to describe the effects of microplastic across levels of biological organization hu and palić 2020 jeong and choi 2020 however the majority of the toxicological studies were not associated with environmentally relevant exposure levels botterell et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the mpaep framework can assemble and evaluate exposure data extrapolate to different types of microplastics and species groups thus providing useful guidance for aop development and associated eco toxicity tests as well as ensuring environmental relevancy a well developed mpaep aop framework with high quality supporting data can aid to the development of quantitative models for predicting the risk of microplastics based on the source information thereby greatly reduce the tedious work in conventional risk assessment as well as laboratory animal tests for regulatory purposes the aeps can efficiently identify critical monitoring and controlling points to stop reduce microplastic pollution providing an effective tool for translating scientific data into comprehensible languages for policy makers during life cycle analysis of plastic waste and microplastics designed for decision makers the mpaep framework can be effectively leveraged in the collection of scientific evidence needed for risk assessment and targeted remediation measures across environmental compartments 5 conclusion by adapting the novel concept of aggregate exposure pathway as a holistic approach for exposure assessment this study has critically reviewed the current knowledge on microplastic exposure in the aquatic environment and assembled available information into the world s first microplastic aep models by conducting two practical case studies in china and norway the capabilities of aeps for efficient organization of fragmented information and identification of critical knowledge gaps have been successfully

the environmental monitoring data and biological exposure information in future investigations furthermore new weight of evidence assessment criteria for aeps have been proposed not only to advance the development this conceptual framework but also to emphasize on the importance of establishing causalities between data collected from different environment compartments in future microplastic

16381,microplastics as emerging contaminants have been detected from peaks to poles high concerns on the risks of microplastic pollution to humans and ecosystems have therefore been raised in the past decade while a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the environmental levels and toxicity of microplastics the information generated to support risk assessment is fragmented and the coherence between different types of study is largely lacking here we introduced the aggregate exposure pathway aep a conceptual framework originally proposed for chemical exposure assessment to facilitate organization visualization and evaluation of existing information generated from microplastic research and to efficiently identify future knowledge and regulatory needs a putative microplastic aep network mpaep was developed to demonstrate the concept and model development strategies two mpaep case studies with polyethylene pe as a prototype were then presented based on existing environmental exposure data collected from the changjiang estuary and the east china sea case i and the oslo fjord case ii respectively weight of evidence woe assessment of the mpaeps were performed for evaluating the essentiality theoretical plausibility empirical evidence and quantitative understanding of the evidence and relationships in the aeps both cases showed moderate high woe to support the strength of the models whereas also displayed clear knowledge gaps thus providing guidance for future investigations and regulations the mpaep framework introduced herein presents a novel strategy for organizing fragmented information from diverse types of microplastic research enhancing mechanistic understanding of causal relationships and facilitating the development of quantitative prediction models for research and regulation in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aggregate exposure pathway aep weight of evidence exposure modeling next generation risk assessment 1 introduction plastics mark the start of a new geological epoch the plastic age by its deposition in fossil records brandon et al 2019 an estimated 710 million metric tons of plastic debris have ended up in the terrestrial and aquatic environments by 2016 lau et al 2020 once entering the environment plastics can be fragmented into tiny pieces by physical chemical and biological processes thompson et al 2004 van sebille et al 2020 zettler et al 2013 the small plastic fragments and fibers less than 5 mm in size are referred to as microplastics they are considered contaminants of emerging concern due to their ubiquitous distribution and persistency in the environment accumulating evidence in recent years has shown considerable levels of microplastics in various environmental compartments including water soil and atmosphere hale et al 2020 hurley et al 2018 lusher 2015 rillig and lehmann 2020 although a large number of studies have been conducted in the past decade to investigate the environmental fate and risks of microplastics the knowledge generated was fragmented and several remaining issues have not been fully resolved first information related to environmental levels of microplastics is fragmented the reported sizes of microplastics in the environment range from micro and nanometre to 5 mm spanning more than 6 orders of magnitude there is normally no size specification associated with the reported abundance of microplastics making the data incomparable across different studies second there are no clear causal linkages of size and abundance data reported for sources environmental media and biota integrated study on point and diffuse sources where microplastics are released into the environment is lacking microplastics with various shapes density and polymer types behave differently in the environment and its pathway into biota are different from that into various environmental media garcia et al 2021 third there are large discrepancies between the measured exposure levels of microplastics in biota and the levels of microplastics used for eco toxicity testing gouin et al 2019 phuong et al 2016 making the hazard assessment of microplastics unreliable these issues call for more holistic and mechanism based approaches for organizing disjointed streams of knowledge into a coherent information framework with critical knowledge gaps clearly visualized such new approaches are key for next generation nexgen risk assessment of microplastic pollution as one of the new approaches to integrate organize visualize and evaluate existing exposure information the aggregate exposure pathway aep framework has been gradually gaining momentum in human and ecological risk assessment teeguarden et al 2016 an aep links a cascade of causally related key exposure states kess such as source exposure medium external exposure internal exposure and target site exposure tse of a chemical by their key transitional relationships ktrs into a pathway or pathway network fig 1 a thereby providing mechanistic information on how a chemical reaches an organism and mediates adverse effects of regulatory concern a well developed aep can integrate exposure information from multiple types of studies and guide laboratory eco toxicity assessment the aep framework was proposed to mirror adverse outcome pathway aop a conceptual framework to organize eco toxicological information relevant for hazard and risk assessment ankley et al 2010 compared to the aop framework the aep framework is still in its infancy and has only been demonstrated by a few cases clewell et al 2020 hines et al 2019 2018 tan et al 2018 teeguarden et al 2016 nevertheless it has great potential to improve the current microplastic research by offering a new way of organizing exposure data and identifying coherence between information generated from different studies the present study aims to 1 critically review the existing knowledge and develop an aep framework for microplastics mpaeps to improve mechanistic and quantitative understanding of microplastic exposure 2 assess weight of evidence of the aeps to identify critical knowledge gaps 3 demonstrate the usefulness of the mpaeps by case studies 4 propose potential applications of the mpaep framework in microplastic research and regulation 2 mpaep assembly and assessment a conceptual mpaep network was assembled first to provide a general overview on the knowledge status and to illustrate the aep development strategies fig 1b this putative aep network links point and diffuse sources to immune cells as the tse via 8 kess that have been frequently reported as key exposure states of microplastics in the environment and biota the selection and assessment of major nodes in this aep network will be discussed in detail in the following sections 2 1 stressor this putative mpaep network is considered to cover all types of plastic particles at the micrometer scale 1 μm 5 mm engineered nanoparticles 100 nm enps or large plastic particles 5 mm are not applicable to this mpaep network due to their relatively lower environmental relevance hüffer et al 2017 xu et al 2020 in contrast synthetic and cellulosic microplastic fibers are included due to their prevalence in the composition of microplastics athey et al 2020 as transport and fate of microplastics may differ by polymer type size and shape additional information on key characteristics size shape sampling strategies and locations from published studies were also considered important information to support this aep network 2 2 key exposure states a key exposure state kes is an essential element of an aep a kes refers to the level of a stressor at a critical state relevant for exposure teeguarden et al 2016 tan et al 2018 such as source exposure medium external exposure internal exposure and target site exposure 2 2 1 source source refers to the levels and rates of release of a pollutant at the site of its origin tan et al 2018 the starting points could be the initial creation of the substance or it could be based on an arbitrary point that is convenient for measurement and control both point and diffuse sources are considered major sources of microplastics in this aep network although the sources of microplastics are not as clearly defined as other chemical pollutants an increasing number of studies have started to investigate the sources of microplastics such as atmospheric transport wastewater treatment plants wwtp dust and food habib et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b 2020c 2 2 2 exposure medium exposure medium refers to the level of a pollutant in a key environmental compartment that is directly associated with the exposure of biota such as water air or soil clewell et al 2020 in the proposed aep network air water and soil are considered the main exposure media while most reports on microplastics levels focus on the marine environment some studies showed significantly higher levels of microplastics in the freshwater environment especially in the vicinity of populated urban areas wang et al 2017 moreover atmospheric and terrestrial transport of microplastics has recently been recognized allen et al 2019 rillig and lehmann 2020 for microplastic abundance the reported units can be n l 1 n m 3 and n km 2 for water samples and n kg 1 wet weight or n kg 1 dry weight for sediment samples due to different sampling strategies 2 2 3 external exposure external exposure refers to the level of a pollutant adsorbed inhaled or ingested by an organism e g dermal exposure in the putative aep network the amount of microplastics particles individual 1 or g 1 wet weight in digestive tracts and gills are therefore considered as external exposure levels based on the reported data 2 2 4 internal exposure internal exposure refers to the body burden internal level of a pollutant absorbed in an organism key processes such as adsorption distribution metabolism and elimination adme or toxicokinetics of pollutants are considered driving factors determining the internal exposure level compared to organic chemicals large particles such as microplastics are considered to have much simpler toxicokinetics in organisms the frequently reported internal exposure level of a pollutant is normally the measured concentration in tissue organ or body fluid e g blood or haemolymph microplastics are normally not considered readily absorbed by organisms due to large sizes and difficulties in penetrating biological membranes 2 2 5 target site exposure target site exposure tse refers to the level of a pollutant at its biological site of toxic action such as a specific type of cell e g immune cell or macromolecules e g dna protein lipid tse is tightly coupled with the molecular initiating event mie of an aop which refers to the initial biochemical interaction that leads to an adverse outcome the suspected target sites of microplastics include lysosome cells enterocyte hepatopancreas and phagocyte brennecke et al 2015 frydkjær et al 2017 gambino et al 2020 jeong et al 2016 park et al 2020 sucharitakul et al 2020 von moos et al 2012 xu et al 2020 the immune system in aquatic organisms is regarded as a sensitive target for effects induced by particulate pollutant at nano scales barmo et al 2013 therefore immune cells are determined as tse in the conceptual mpaep 2 3 key transitional relationships a key transitional relationship ktr describes the relationship between two adjacent kess aeps have two types of ktrs which are movement and conversion of stressors between kess tan et al 2018 in the conceptual mpaep network fig 1b the ktrs are proposed based on the theoretical plausibility suggested by relevant literature for particulate microplastics movement ktrs are dominant albeit conversion ktrs are possible due to abrasion or loss of microplastics by agglomeration and sedimentation however the selection of sources for mpaeps indicates that conversion ktrs may be less important e g wwtps in the case studies microplastics are known to be discharged into the air water and sediments from both point and diffuse sources water is an import medium for microplastic precipitation from the air deposition into the sediment and exposure of aquatic organisms such as zooplankton fish and bivalves the frequently documented target organs of exposure are gill and gut very few studies have reported the exact molecular cellular targets of microplastics there is however limited evidence showing that the immune cells might be the initial target of exposure in these organisms park et al 2020 2 4 weight of evidence assessment weight of evidence woe indicates the strength of scientific evidence supporting an aep as there are currently no woe assessment criteria developed for the aep framework clewell et al 2020 we have adapted a set of criteria table 1 based on oecd s guidance on aop development and assessment oecd 2018 the criteria include 1 essentiality of the kes 2 theoretical plausibility of the ktr 3 empirical support for the ktr and 4 quantitative understanding of the ktr the confidence level is scored as high moderate or low according to the quality of evidence support in a formal aep document similar as aops the aep developers are expected to not only provide final woe scores but also provide detailed justifications underlying the scores and point out critical data gap and knowledge needs it consists of data gap where knowledge is well defined but empirical data hasn t been reported in literature and a data gap where there it is not clear if there is a transition a model description or data indicating two kess are connected 3 demonstrative cases we will then use two practical case studies to demonstrate the development and assessment of aeps for microplastics two distinct types of aquatic environments in china case i changjiang yangtze estuary east china sea and norway case ii oslo fjord were selected because considerable amount of data in the study areas was available to support the development and assessment of the aeps both cases focus on polyethylene pe microplastics as a prototype as pe is the most produced polymer in the world plastics europe 2020 and ubiquitously identified in the aquatic environment the pe polymer has a density range of 0 91 0 94 g cm 3 low density polyethylene ldpe or 0 93 0 97 g cm 3 high density polyethylene hdpe in the two case studies only investigations that successfully identified pe using chemical techniques fourier transform infrared spectrometry raman spectroscopy or mass spectrometry were considered valid in addition the reported microplastic concentrations displayed for the two cases were the total concentrations of all types of polymers in different environmental compartments 3 1 case i discharge of microplastics from wastewater treatment plants leading to fish exposure in china 3 1 1 overview of the study region the changjiang river is the largest river in china with a basin area of 1 8 106 km2 gao and wang 2008 located in a monsoon climate the freshwater discharge to the east china sea forms a strong changjiang river plume with sediment concentration of 0 005 kg m 3 that reaches 200 km from the estuary wu et al 2011 being the largest estuary in china the changjiang estuary ce has active material exchange and huge material fluxes which forms the largest fishing ground in china the zhoushan fishing ground gao and wang 2008 shanghai the economic center and the world s largest port is situated in the changjiang estuary with a population over 24 million posing pressure to the coastal environments we have therefore developed an aep for assessing microplastic exposure in this region with special focus on how pe microplastics discharged from urban wastewater can lead to exposure of marine fish fig 2 3 1 2 general description of the aep twenty peer reviewed publications were selected to develop a location specific aep for pe microplastic in the changjiang estuary and the east china sea si table s1 the literature was selected by searching keywords including microplastic changjiang estuary yangtze river estuary and east china sea using google scholar scholar google com for publications in english and baidu scholar xueshu baidu com for publications in chinese only environmental data on the aqueous phases was included as the target exposure organ in this case study is gills of fish quantification methods for kes 1 4 require spectroscopic methods with detection limit down to 20 μm i e micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or micro raman spectroscopy an aep with six kess was assembled to describe the movement pathways of pe in the changjiang estuary east china sea region fig 2 the source kes 1 was considered to be the wwtp on the east coast of shanghai where pe microplastic was discharged into the south passage of the changjiang estuary bai et al 2018 jia et al 2019 surface water in the estuary kes 2 exposure medium 1 was considered to be the initial exposure medium kes 2 as supported by multiple studies reporting the microplastic abundance in the changjiang estuary in 2017 and 2018 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the surface water in the east china sea was considered as the secondary exposure medium kes 3 as evidenced by five studies reporting measured pe concentrations li et al 2020 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 the external exposure level kes 4 was estimated based on the whole body concentrations measured in wild fish whereas the internal exposure kes 5 was supported by the measured levels of pe in fish gills and microplastic fibers can pass through branchial chamber of fish gills su et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 in this case immune cells in fish were considered the target site of exposure kes 6 because quantification method using imaging flow cytometry proved phagocytosis of microplastics by fish immune cells park et al 2020 it should be noted that there are also several other biological targets of pe e g liver muscle barboza et al 2020 collard et al 2017 however we will only focus on the immune cells as the tse for this aep as relatively more evidence support could be obtained 3 1 3 essentiality of the kes essentiality evaluates whether the occurrence of a downstream event is dependent on an upstream event the essentiality of kes 1 source wwtp is considered moderate with some supporting evidence showing massive and direct discharge of microplastic from the wwtps in shanghai to the changjiang estuary resulting in high concentrations of microplastics in the changjiang estuary peng et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the essentiality of kes 2 external exposure medium estuary is considered moderate as the estuary is the main geophysical and hydrological feature in the study region studies on seasonal variations of microplastic concentration in the changjiang estuary and the east china sea ce and ecs also showed consistent relationship of microplastic levels between ce and ecs zhao et al 2019 reduced discharge from ce also leads to a decrease in microplastic concentration in ecs the essentiality of kes 3 external exposure medium sea surface water is considered low due to a lack of evidence to support that a change in microplastic concentration in surface water leads to a change in microplastic concentration in fish kes 4 external exposure fish is considered to have a moderate essentiality as the importance of fishery in the ecs has led to abundant investigation on food chain composition and higher level fish species are found to be sentinels for indicating microplastic pollution zhang et al 2019 these facts collectively support that fish is a critical node in the aep of pe microplastic kes 5 internal exposure gill per se was supported by the measured concentrations of microplastics suggesting bioaccumulation of pe in these organs su et al 2019 albeit quantification methods for small microplastics 50 μm have not been widely applied to field studies however there is no study reporting the correlation between kes 5 and kes 6 target site exposure immune cells therefore the essentiality of kes 5 is considered low 3 1 4 theoretical plausibility of the ktr physicochemical processes account for most factors affecting the behavior of microplastics in the aquatic environments table 1 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 1 wwtp to estuary is considered high fig 2 as an in depth literature review has shown consistent relationships between wwtps removal of microplastics and adjacent waters iyare et al 2020 kay et al 2018 woodward et al 2021 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 2 ce to ecs is considered high with several evidence showing riverine plastic discharge influenced by the development index of coastal countries including the outflow from the ce to the ocean mai et al 2020 physicochemical plausibility of ktr 3 sea surface to fish is considered moderate as this causal relationship has only been partially established for microplastic particles the theoretical plausibility of ktr 4 fish to gill is considered high as such causality has been widely recognized with a well understood mechanism for gill epithelium functioning as the forefront for external pollutants evans 1987 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 5 is considered moderate as immune cells have been considered the primary targets of xenobiotics in fish gills alzaidan 2013 hayton and barron 1990 tort et al 2003 albeit not much work has been done to elucidate how exactly microplastics affect immune cells 3 1 5 empirical support for the ktr empirical support evaluates the evidence related relationships of the two events including time space and quantity concentration etc the empirical support for ktr 1 is considered high fig 2 with multiple publications consistently reporting the causal relationships between the pe levels at the wwtps and in the downstream estuary bai et al 2018 jia et al 2019 sun et al 2019 ktr 2 also has a moderate empirical support with strong evidence from field investigations indicating that the concentration of microplastics in the ce and the ecs causally fluctuated across seasons xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the empirical support for ktr 3 is considered moderate with a study reporting more microplastic accumulation in higher trophic level fish species that may function as sentinel species for microplastic pollution zhang et al 2019a the empirical support for ktr 4 is also moderate with only one study reporting the distribution of microplastics in fish organs with gills and gut being the ones with the highest pe levels su et al 2019 currently there is no empirical evidence directly supporting the relationships of pe levels between gills to immune cells therefore the empirical support for ktr 5 is considered low 3 1 6 quantitative understanding there is currently no literature providing quantitative understanding of the ktrs in this aep therefore we have attempted to de novo build the quantitative relationships based on available data from various sources in order to demonstrate how basic quantitative understanding can be established based on limited empirical data log normal distribution was assumed for all microplastic abundance data as suggested by beiras and schönemann 2020 and monte carlo simulation was conducted for 100 000 runs for uncertainty analysis results showed that given a hypothetical level of 50 000 20 000 n m 3 microplastics at the source wwtp the resulting cumulative exposure to fish in ce was estimated to be 0 49 1 85 range 0 07 3 50 with 95 confidence interval n m 3 the most uncertainty comes from the processes of uptake from water to gill and gut fig 3 pointing out a need for more investigations on this part of the aep it should also be noted that due to a lack of valid data and sufficient knowledge of the underlying mechanisms the quantitative understanding of the aep described herein is preliminary with a high level of uncertainty in summary the quantitative understanding of ktr 1 is considered moderate whereas that of the ktr 2 5 in this aep are considered low 3 1 7 critical knowledge gaps and uncertainties the woe assessment of the aep pointed out critical knowledge gaps that may hamper mechanistic and quantitative understanding of the microplastic exposure pathways even in an area where a high number of investigations have been conducted there have been few studies reporting trophic levels of the studied organism and microplastic transfer in the natural environments goswami et al 2020 and mpaep doesn t follow the same principle as biomagnification of chemical pollutants the parameterization of mpaep should therefore be based on the feeding strategy for particles rather than trophic levels birnstiel et al 2019 as shown by case i the microplastic pe abundance in the sea surface has the most evidence support whereas an apparent lack of data to support the external and internal exposure of microplastics possibly due to immature quantification methods with biological samples stanton et al 2019 the strength of the causal relationships in general decreases when walking down the aep from the fate of microplastics in the environment to biota suggesting strong needs for measuring both environmental and biological levels of microplastics in the same investigation i e same spatial and temporal scales and same analytical conditions the current data collected from the published reports could not provide sufficient data to construct a reliable quantitative aep qaep model as the empirical relationships in the aep were not able to be parameterized in an appropriate manner albeit the model construction approach presented herein can still be applied in the future when more data accumulates note that the exposure pathway external and internal are intentionally simplified and more efforts on the external exposure pathways through water filtration targeting gill and food intake through food web targeting gut should be made in summary case i has displayed a good example to illustrate how an mpaep could efficiently organize existing data and identify critical knowledge gaps in the microplastic research on the changjiang estuary and east china sea regions a trial quantitative assessment has also revealed uncertainties of the empirical evidence supporting this aep and highlighted research needs for better assessment of microplastics in biota and simultaneous measurement of at least two key exposure states in the same study 3 2 case ii discharge of microplastics from wastewater treatment plants leading to mussel gill exposure in norway 3 2 1 overview of the study region the norwegian coastlines are characterized by deep silled fjords especially in the western norway where low salinity norwegian coastal current overlaps heavier water with atlantic origin and flows northward under the influence of coastal wind erga and heimdal 1984 contributing to microplastic pollution in the arctic ross et al 2021 oslo the capital of norway with a population of ca 0 7 million is located in the inner oslo fjord the aker river akerselva in norwegian with a drainage area of 250 km2 runs through the city of oslo and reaches inner oslo fjord the study area is under eutrophication since the population growth in the 1900s with industrial development and the establishment of wwtps and improvement of sewage treatment e g bekkelaget in 1963 located to the southeast of oslo significantly affects cultural eutrophication in the oslo fjord dale et al 1999 although both case i and case ii focus on microplastic pollution from urban wastewater to coastal environments there are fundamental differences between the two cases in terms of hydrographic features case i estuary versus case ii fjord 3 2 2 general description of the aep for literature review we searched google scholar using the keywords microplastic norway a total of 21 published literature including peer reviewed research articles master theses and technical reports were used for case ii si table s2 of which six publications directly reported the levels of pe in different environmental compartments investigation on microplastic pollution in norway mainly focused on the oslo fjord and its vicinity but most data failed to report spatiotemporal variation of microplastic concentrations in a specific area but random sampling efforts at some spots a lack of causality of empirical data made it unlikely to construct an mpaep in the region even though considerable efforts have been dedicated to microplastic research sundt 2014 summarized sources of microplastics pe being the dominant type in norwegian waters including consumer products production spill abrasion ship paint laundry wear and tear dust road paint tire dust and waste shredding recycling landfill that enters the environment through runoff drain air sludge soil sea and water two sources were identified considering the geographic location bekkelaget is a wwtp kes 7 that discharges wastewater into the inner oslo fjord but no data on its microplastic removal efficiency or discharge rate has been collected fig 4 a report investigated only microplastics in sludge from bekkelaget and a master thesis investigated microplastic concentration in wwtps in telemark county but no chemical analysis was performed to identify pe lusher et al 2017 lage 2019 another source is the aker river kes 8 that flows into the inner oslo fjord without water exchange with the wwtp a project funded by the norwegian environment agency investigated three rivers in oslo in 2019 with pe detected in two rivers lorenz et al 2020 olsen et al 2020 investigated microplastic in surface water kes 9 in the outflow of the aker river and near wwtp sewage two studies investigated microplastic exposure in blue mussels kes 10 bråte et al 2018 no study investigated internal exposure kes 11 and target site e g immune cells kes 12 of microplastic accumulation in mussels from this region avio et al 2015 3 2 3 essentiality of the kes no studies have investigated the relationships between upstream kess and the downstream kess suggesting the essentiality of all the kes 7 12 in the aep are low 3 2 4 theoretical plausibility of the ktr the theoretical plausibility of ktr 6 wwtp to sea surface and ktr 7 river to sea surface is considered high as many reviews and reports suggested that wwtps and rivers are the major input sources of microplastic in the marine environment iyare et al 2020 lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 8 sea surface to mussel is considered moderate with a review suggesting accumulation of microplastics in mussels living in coastal waters li et al 2019 the theoretical plausibility of ktr 9 mussel to gill and ktr 10 gill immune cells is considered moderate although there are reviews on immune responses exposed to nanoparticles in bivalves barmo et al 2013 canesi et al 2012 park et al 2020 nanoplastics are not all included in the current assessment 3 2 5 empirical support for the ktr the empirical support for ktr 6 10 is scored as low as no study has directly investigated the causal relationships between any of the adjacent kess in this aep 3 2 6 quantitative understanding blue mussels used in this case study are common in temperate seas all around the globe and they are widely used both as seafood and as sentinel organisms in monitoring of anthropogenic pollution in coastal environment the uptake and depuration mechanism of a blue mussel is well described for chemical pollutants björk and gilek 1997 endicott et al 1998 however this model needs to be parameterized for microplastic bioaccumulation microplastics as particles behave differently compared to other chemical pollutants and polymer types with varying densities should be taken into consideration when developing an mpaep wang et al 2016 following the same method as defined in case ⅰ results showed that given a hypothetical wwtp source which contains 1000 500 n m 3 plastic particles the resulting cumulative exposure to mussels living in the oslo fjord was estimated to be 0 45 2 46 n m 3 range 0 07 5 1 with 95 confidence interval the most uncertainty comes from the data collected from the biota suggesting the importance of collecting relevant data to establish the quantitative links between microplastic exposure in the environmental and biological compartments in this region as the aep proposed for this case is simplified due to lack of data future studies should make more efforts on the external exposure pathways through water filtration and link the information to the levels in biota in summary the quantitative understanding of ktr 6 10 is considered low 3 2 7 critical knowledge gaps and uncertainties in case ⅱ the woe assessment pointed out insufficient data for establishing confident causal relationships of pe microplastics from the source to target site of exposure fig 4 a lack of causality in study design directly hampers the understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of pe microplastics and its pathway into target sites in biota in the study region and impedes the development of quantitative prediction models while concentrations in rivers have been frequently reported information on wwtps sea surface water and biota external and internal exposure are scarce although the proposed aep is supported by good theoretical plausibility empirical and quantitative understanding are lacking in summary lack of causality in exposure data from source to tse in oslo fjord are still in great demand from each environmental and biological compartment to generate an mpaep for regulatory needs 4 potential applications of the mpaep framework the mpaep framework can facilitate the unification of the microplastic data reporting and repository systems since the majority of the current microplastic data are fragmented a highly structured data framework such as aep can help better organize existing information in an expert curated common format allowing direct comparison of data across different studies and reuse of information for more comprehensive analysis e g meta analysis at a later stage the mpaep framework forms the basis for future construction of an exposure database for microplastics the mpaep framework can also promote the development of standard operation protocols sops and improve the data quality assurance criteria in microplastic research a well developed aep normally contains a description of methods for measuring the kess si table s1 and s2 thereby demanding highly standardized and repeatable operation protocols data quality is a critical factor influencing the weight of evidence assessment and quantitative understanding of the aeps this issue is not covered by the present study but has been discussed in detail elsewhere isobe et al 2019 van mourik et al 2021 organization of existing knowledge in a structured and coherent manner such as aep can aid to efficient identification of critical knowledge gaps and research needs as illustrated by our case studies the lack of sufficient empirical data for propagating different exposure states of microplastics was clearly visualized by organizing information into mpaeps the woe assessment of the aeps further revealed a lack of coherence between the supporting data emphasizing on the importance of measuring and correlating at least two adjacent exposure states in the same investigation to establish a causal relationship in addition to empirical support the aeps also showed the need for better mechanistic understanding of the behavior of microplastics in both environment and organisms when developing the mechanistic relationships of the mpaep potential quantitative models should be adjusted accordingly recognizing unique features of microplastics due to the difference in bioaccumulation biomagnification polymer types and internal transport pathways compared to chemical pollutants aggregate exposure pathway in combination with aop forms a source to outcome pathway framework as part of the next generation risk assessment suite for organizing exposure and toxicological information hines et al 2019 such holistic approach is particularly important for microplastics not only to re unify fragmented efforts in the current microplastic research but also to increase the cost efficiency of microplastic risk assessment a high number of eco toxicological studies have been performed to assess the hazards of microplastics in various organisms several aops have even emerged to describe the effects of microplastic across levels of biological organization hu and palić 2020 jeong and choi 2020 however the majority of the toxicological studies were not associated with environmentally relevant exposure levels botterell et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the mpaep framework can assemble and evaluate exposure data extrapolate to different types of microplastics and species groups thus providing useful guidance for aop development and associated eco toxicity tests as well as ensuring environmental relevancy a well developed mpaep aop framework with high quality supporting data can aid to the development of quantitative models for predicting the risk of microplastics based on the source information thereby greatly reduce the tedious work in conventional risk assessment as well as laboratory animal tests for regulatory purposes the aeps can efficiently identify critical monitoring and controlling points to stop reduce microplastic pollution providing an effective tool for translating scientific data into comprehensible languages for policy makers during life cycle

16382,phosphorus p is an essential element for the growth and reproduction of organisms unfortunately the natural p cycle has been broken by the overexploitation of p ores and the associated discharge of p into water bodies which may trigger the eutrophication of water bodies in the short term and possible p shortage soon consequently technologies emerged to recover p from wastewater to mitigate pollution and exploit secondary p resources electrochemically induced phosphate precipitation has the merit of achieving p recovery without dosing additional chemicals via creating a localized high ph environment near the cathode we critically reviewed the development of electrochemically induced precipitation systems toward p removal and recovery over the past ten years we summarized and discussed the effects of ph current density electrode configuration and water matrix on the performance of electrochemical systems next to ortho p we identified the potential and illustrated the mechanism of electrochemical p removal and recovery from non ortho p compounds by combined anodic or anode mediated oxidation and cathodic reduction precipitation furthermore we assessed the economic feasibility of electrochemical methods and concluded that they are more suitable for treating acidic p rich waste streams despite promising potentials and significant progress in recent years the application of electrochemical systems toward p recovery at a larger scale requires further research and development future work should focus on evaluating the system s performance under long term operation

cornel and schaum 2009 schaum 2018 besides it governs biological activities by participating in biochemical reactions as atp desmidt et al 2015 notably plants take up p from the soil while animals and humans supplement p through diet karunanithi et al 2015 in the natural cycle p originated from lithosphere and atmosphere would travel through biosphere and hydrosphere and eventually returns to the soil in the form of organic fertilizer establishing a closed cycle as illustrated in the green lines of fig 1 cornel and schaum 2009 yuan et al 2018 however with the growth of the global food demand intensive agricultural activities are required which unidirectionally amplifies p flow from soil to crops wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 the p depletion in soil is compensated by p fertilizer in addition the need for other p containing products such as detergents flame retardants and fireworks is also increasing with the expanding population chen and graedel 2016 the drastic increase of p demand accelerates the exploitation of phosphate rock which amplifies the p cycle as emphasized in the red line of fig 1 unfortunately phosphate rock is a non renewable resource whose consumption pace has gone far beyond regeneration and the p ores are regionally imbalanced cordell et al 2009 if no actions are taken the phosphate crisis might occur in the near future jasinski 2020 notably the regional p balances in latin america and the caribbean south asia central and west europe and oceania may lead to a shortage in 2022 according to the world fertilizer outlook 2022 from food and nations 2019 apart from scarcity at source a more urgent problem is the p enrichment in downstream water bodies the p fertilized in farmlands would leach and or run off into water bodies with rainfall chen and graedel 2016 liu et al 2020a meanwhile p produced and consumed by human society eventually enters and accumulates in water bodies through urban sewage systems mayer et al 2016 because of the lack of p recycling the p will find its destiny in water bodies surplus p in water bodies triggers eutrophication causes oxygen depletion in water bodies and further the hypoxia of aquatic organisms karunanithi et al 2015 even though eutrophication may appear as a natural process today the frequent occurrence of algae blooms is attributed to human activities especially the discharge of under treated wastewater overloaded with p because p used to be the critical limiting nutrient in these water bodies technologies have been developed to treat excess p in wastewater one of the most widely accepted methods is chemical precipitation during precipitation reagents such as iron aluminum magnesium and calcium salts are dosed to form less soluble or insoluble p minerals nancharaiah et al 2016 ye et al 2017 adsorption is another common physicochemical method for p removal adsorption is easy to operate but requirements for adsorbents are strict such as high stability reusability and p affinity crini et al 2019 commercial processes based on physicochemical methods have been applied to remove p and other nutrients from wastewaters ghosh et al 2019 jupp et al 2021 li et al 2019 melia et al 2017 ye et al 2017 moreover enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr could concentrate p from the liquid stream and is flexible to combine with other post p recovery technologies egle et al 2016 perera et al 2019 overall there is room for improvements in current p removal and recovery technologies such as reducing chemical input minimizing sludge processing simplifying operation steps and saving the organics consumed in ebpr process for energy production i e biogas in recent years electrochemical technologies ets have received increasing attention in wastewater treatment garcia segura et al 2018 modin and gustavsson 2014 muddemann et al 2019 srivastava et al 2020 likewise there is an increasing interest in applying electrochemically mediated precipitation emp as a strategy to remove and recover p from waste streams cusick and logan 2012 foroughi et al 2019 kappel et al 2013 lei et al 2017 wang et al 2020 compared to conventional methods for p recovery including chemical phosphate removal cpr adsorption and ebpr emp possesses the merits of simple operation moreover chemical additions are not required in emp because electrochemical reactions can lead to a high ph environment near the cathode to induce p deposition lei et al 2017 takabe et al 2020 more importantly emp recovers bioavailable p in one process and requires no or little post treatment therefore emp may help establish and maintain a new and sustainable p cycle by utilizing the p accumulated in waste streams as an alternative for mined p rocks several review articles have illustrated the application of ets in wastewater treatment including p removal by traditional electrochemical process i e electrocoagulation feng et al 2016 guedes et al 2014 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b muddemann et al 2019 nancharaiah et al 2016 perera et al 2019 tabassum et al 2021 emp is different from electrochemical coagulation the latter process applies sacrificial electrodes to release cations i e fe2 mg2 to remove phosphate which would produce a large amount of sludge and the electrodes need to be replaced regularly during long term operation by contrast condensed p minerals would be produced in emp process and the solids can be directly collected from the cathode surface besides emp usually employs inert electrodes which are not consumed during the reaction other ets such as electrodialysis often only concentrate p in the wastewater therefore a post treatment is required for electrodialysis concentrate to remove p from the solution and recover p as an applicable product zhang et al 2013 in comparison emp achieves p removal and recovery in one system with one step and without dosing chemicals however to the best of our knowledge there is no review article focusing on p removal and recovery using emp therefore this review article aims to fill in this knowledge gap by providing an overview of emp developments for p removal and recovery first we critically reviewed the mechanisms and influencing factors of emp in p removal and recovery second we emphasized the potential of emp in treating non ortho p compounds next we evaluated the economic feasibility of emp in recovering p from the perspective of electricity consumption finally we discussed the potential challenges toward the commercialization of emp in p removal and recovery from wastewaters and proposed possible directions for future research 2 the working principle of electrochemically mediated precipitation a typical electrochemical system consists of an anode a cathode and an external power supply as presented in fig 2 a emp of p minerals is achieved through ph elevation at the cathode surface while phosphate ions do not directly participate in the electrochemical reactions at the cathode water molecules are reduced into h2 and oh leading to the elevation of local ph eq 1 meanwhile cations i e ca2 would move towards and accumulate near the cathode due to electric migration as a result the saturation index si of p minerals would increase driving the formation and precipitation of p minerals on the cathode as shown in eq 2 fig 2b presents the si of possible calcium phosphate ca p in response to the rise of local ph it is apparent that the rise of local ph increases the si moreover the high local ph near the cathode would reduce the solubility of p minerals i e ca p further boosting the precipitation of p minerals in this way the precipitates can be directly collected from the cathode requiring no extra solid liquid separation process which is required in conventional methods at the anode oxidation of water generates h neutralizing the oh produced on the cathode eq 3 therefore while the local ph at the cathode would increase the bulk solution ph is not expected to change significantly in the electrochemical systems moreover the presence of buffer ions such as bi carbonate would also stabilize the ph of the bulk solution cid et al 2018 lei et al 2018b besides the organic compounds in the solution would be oxidized and even mineralized to some extent at the anode 1 cathode 4h2o 4e 4oh 2h2 2 5ca2 3hpo4 2 4oh ca5 po4 3oh 3h2o 3 anode 2h2o 4h o2 4e struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o and ca p are the two common products in emp system the struvite process possesses the advantage of simultaneously recovering nitrogen n and p karunanithi et al 2015 electrochemical struvite recovery has been studied for different waste streams huang et al 2016 hug and udert 2013 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2019c however the direct formation of struvite at the cathode is challenging because the high local ph would favor the shift of n species from nh4 to nh3 belarbi et al 2020 li et al 2021b besides a high ph environment may lead to the formation of mg oh 2 instead of struvite therefore the current density which regulates the production of oh needs to be controlled wang et al 2022 reported that the percentage of struvite that deposits on the cathode decreased from 91 to 18 when the current density is increased from 5 8 to 17 3 a m2 moreover extra mg2 is usually required to achieve efficient struvite recovery when targeted wastewater is low in n and mg2 content it is more suitable to recover p as ca p eq 2 shaddel et al 2019 as ca2 widely exists in wastewater typically 20 120 mg l in domestic wastewater there is no requirement for ca2 dosing in emp of ca p especially in calcium enriched wastewaters such as effluent from dairy industries around 2200 mg l ca2 lei et al 2018a lei et al 2021a moreover ca p recovered by emp is similar in composition to rock phosphate and therefore a suitable alternative p source for industrial p fertilizer production without process modifications melia et al 2017 in some emp systems ion exchange membranes iems are applied to prevent the neutralization of the anolyte low ph with the catholyte high ph kappel et al 2013 perera et al 2020 with iems the p recovery efficiency is projected to increase because the ph change in the media expands further away from the electrodes meanwhile the low ph environment in the anode chamber can eliminate bi carbonate which can significantly improve the purity of recovered solids lei et al 2019b 2 1 the role of ph the ph is a decisive factor that affects the precipitation of p minerals to differentiate we will discuss local ph which is the ph at the cathode surface and bulk ph which is the solution ph in general in this section phosphate presents in various forms under different ph conditions as shown in fig 3a for example h2po4 is the main form when ph is below 7 2 while hpo4 2 becomes the predominating form when ph exceeds 7 2 sø 2011 a high ph condition provides a higher thermodynamic driving force for phosphate to precipitate lei et al 2017 firstly the si of typical p precipitates i e hap would elevate along with increasing ph value because phosphate would be deprotonated and more oh the components of hydroxyapatite hap would be available under high ph secondly the solubility of p precipitates is lower under high ph conditions which benefits the deposition of p minerals lei et al 2017 showed that 20 of 0 6 mm p was removed at an initial bulk ph of 10 0 even under open circuit conditions in the presence of 1 0 mm ca while no apparent p removal was observed at bulk ph 4 0 or 8 4 however in the electrochemical system the bulk ph is less critical than local ph because the reduction of water molecules at the cathode raises the local ph and promotes the nucleation and growth of p crystals in the same experimental setup but a closed electrical circuit 3 8 a m2 the p removal increased to over 48 in all three bulk ph conditions 4 0 8 4 and 10 0 lei et al 2017 other studies also supported the argument that bulk ph is not crucial in emp lu et al 2005 deliberately controlled the bulk ph at 5 1 where ca p cannot be formed but ca p was collected from the cathode furthermore ca p was successfully recovered in an electrochemical system treating acidic cheese wastewater bulk ph 5 lei et al 2021a lei et al 2019b also investigated emp of p minerals in domestic wastewater as a function of acidification they found that even with a dramatic change of bulk ph from 7 5 to 3 8 the p removal efficiency was not much affected decreased slightly from 55 to 49 compared with the bulk ph the local ph is more affecting the electrochemical precipitation according to lei et al 2017 the local ph near the cathode surface can reach as high as 13 2 significantly higher than the bulk ph nonetheless the bulk ph still plays a role it could indirectly affect p precipitation by influencing the speciation and even the bi carbonate concentration in wastewater if the wastewater is acidified low ph the bi carbonate concentration will decrease which means less carbonate will compete for ca2 with phosphate in this way wastewater with low bulk ph could mitigate the adverse effect of bi carbonate on p precipitation the bulk ph is expected to remain stable in emp process attributing to the buffering ions in water and the neutralization of h generated on the anode with oh generated on the cathode perera et al 2020 however lei et al 2017 reported a severe decrease in bulk ph in emp of ca p with synthetical solutions this is because oh produced at the cathode is consumed by precipitation reactions while there are no extra h consuming reactions in the system also precipitation reactions remove buffer species from the water at high current densities a m2 the generated h exceeded the buffer capacity of the bulk solution resulting in a decrease of the bulk ph perera et al 2020 lei et al 2019b showed that the change of bulk ph is linked to the initial bulk ph of treated domestic wastewater the bulk ph of wastewater decreased after treatment when the initial bulk ph was acidified below 6 0 while it increased when the initial bulk ph was above 6 0 this is likely related to the loss of bi carbonate buffer ions by pre acidification and the depletion of oh by co2 mg2 and nh4 notably it was also reported that the bulk ph increased after electrochemical treatment with the presence of bi carbonate which would consume the h generated on the anode and left the oh accumulated in the bulk solution lei et al 2019b lei et al 2018b 2 2 impact of current density in electrochemical systems the applied current density directly determines the formation rate of oh at the cathode regulating the precipitation of p minerals the p removal percentage increases with elevating current density because high current density would promote oh production at the cathode aiding p precipitation as shown in fig 4 a lei et al 2019b lei et al 2021a lei et al 2021b perera et al 2020 takabe et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however when the current density exceeds a certain value the p removal percentage would maintain stable as in the case of lei et al 2021a and zhang et al 2021 the reason could be that there was too little p in the solution to be deposited as the p removal percentage was over 90 after the current density reached 40 a cm2 another reason could be that the precipitation layer formed on the cathode hindered the p diffusion towards the cathode surface interestingly a porous structure fig 6c which is created by h2 generated on the cathode was observed on the precipitation layer and may assist p diffusion towards the cathode surface in the study of takabe et al 2020 the p removal percentage slightly decreased after the current density surpassed a certain level fig 4a the limiting factor was the strong electrostatic repulsion between the cathode and phosphate at a very high current density moreover the ortho p removal in the study of takabe et al 2020 was significantly lower than the other studies indicating high current density over 80 a m2 could hinder the precipitation of p minerals therefore a low current density condition is favored during p recovery for both p removal and energy consumption additionally the initial p removal rate would be affected by the applied current density cid et al 2018 found that the p removal rate was increased from 0 05 to 0 13 mg l s when the current density was increased from 26 to 150 a m2 batch operation 18 6 mg l p the applied current density could also affect the size and composition of precipitates perera et al 2020 found the size of precipitated particles decreased with increasing current density from 3 8 to 50 4 a m2 as presented in fig 4b this is explained by the increased ph and si of p minerals with increased current density which results in preferred nucleation over growth for the crystallization process lu et al 2005 nielsen 1969 however small size precipitate would hinder the separation process and lead to low p recovery as shown in fig 4a supporting the argument that a low current density condition favors the p recovery moreover lei et al 2018b observed that amorphous calcium phosphate acp was formed under 1 9 a m2 while hap was found under 18 9 a m2 batch operation 18 6 mg l p unfortunately the relative abundance ra of ca p in recovered solids decreased with the increasing current density when electrochemical p recovery was performed at a low current density of 0 2 a m2 almost none mg oh 2 and only limited caco3 were formed lei et al 2020a reported that a current density as low as 0 04 a m2 could trigger ca p precipitation at the cathode therefore from the perspective of both removal efficiency and product purity a very high current density is not desirable although with high current density the removal kinetics can be enhanced and the treatment time can be shortened the purity of recovered products regarding p content may be reduced and the specific energy consumption may be increased 2 3 impact of cell configuration 2 3 1 exploration of bioanode in abiotic electrochemical systems p precipitation is driven by external current which generally results in high energy consumption to reduce energy consumption bioanodes could be applied in a typical bioelectrochemical system bes exoelectrogenic microbes grow as firm biofilms on the anode which oxidize soluble organic compounds in the bulk solution and release electrons to the anode logan et al 2008 logan et al 2006 thus organic compounds act as electron donors in the bes instead of water as in abiotic electrochemical systems the electrons are then transferred to the cathode through an external circuit to support the reduction reactions at the cathode either oxygen is reduced to water oxygen reduction reaction orr in a microbial fuel cell mfc or h water are reduced to h2 gas hydrogen evolution reaction her in a microbial electrolysis cell mec elevating the local ph cusick et al 2010 fig 5 a is an example of a single chamber bioelectrochemical reactor an external power supply is required to drive the nonspontaneous reactions i e her at the cathode the energy demand for bioelectrochemical mediated p precipitation was significantly reduced compared to that of abiotic electrochemical precipitation ichihashi and hirooka 2012 yuan and kim 2017 moreover bes can effectively avoid the formation of chlorinated organic compounds which are highly toxic to living organisms lei et al 2019a researchers have explored the possibility of bes in recovering p fischer et al 2011 demonstrated that mfc could enable p recovery from digested sewage sludge however in their concept the mfc was only used to dissolve and release phosphate from iron phosphate extra chemicals magnesium and ammonium salts and additional ph adjustments were still required to achieve p recovery eventually later ichihashi and hirooka 2012 and hirooka and ichihashi 2013 investigated the potential of a single chamber air cathode mfc on p removal and recovery in the study of ichihashi and hirooka 2012 swine wastewater was flowing through two mfcs in a fed batch mode the results suggested that around 70 82 p was removed in each mfc in the study of hirooka and ichihashi 2013 p in artificial wastewater was removed at the range of 19 55 as struvite depending on the concentrations of lattice ions mg2 and nh4 the two studies proved the achievability of p removal and recovery in bes in mec the p removal effectiveness and the p precipitation rate increased with current density blatter et al 2019 cusick and logan 2012 lei et al 2019a wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 pepè sciarria et al 2019 compared the p recovery effectiveness in a digestate by mec and mfc respectively it was observed that mfc resulted in 10 15 higher removal of p than mec a fixed voltage of 1 07 v was applied in typical domestic wastewater the amount of readily biodegradable organic carbon is inadequate for microbes to provide sufficient electric current and a high enough coulombic efficiency for a complete p recovery yuan and kim 2017 therefore supplementary organic compounds are usually spiked in bioelectrochemical reactors when treating actual wastewater cusick and logan 2012 hirooka and ichihashi 2013 the p recovery would increase with elevating organic compounds almatouq and babatunde 2016 lei et al 2019a however adding organic compounds is a challenge for application because it increases the overall cost substantially and could cause unexpected interactions in the water matrix membranes are used in bio electrochemical systems to separate the anodic and the cathodic chamber which could effectively improve p removal effectiveness fischer et al 2011 tao et al 2014 ye et al 2019a obtained a p recovery from 24 4 to 83 2 in a cem contained mec similarly wang et al 2020 applied three types of membranes bipolar membrane aem and cem in a mec and recovered over 80 of p 5 mm in the form of ca p notably ye et al 2019b tested three types of membranes cem forward osmosis membrane and nonwoven membrane and found that mfc with cem had the best p removal effectiveness 95 however the use of membranes could trigger problems such as membrane fouling and high internal resistance of the reactor which could lower energy efficiency and increase the cost blatter et al 2020 cusick et al 2014 happe et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 marassi et al 2020 2 3 2 design of cathode in membrane less emp the cathode is where the precipitation of p minerals occurs therefore the cathode design plays an important role in the removal and recovery of p firstly the surface area of the cathode would affect p removal efficiency as well as the purity of the recovered product cusick and logan 2012 reported that the p recovery as struvite with stainless steel mesh ssm 19 cm2 and stainless steel foil ssf 7 cm2 was similar when the applied voltage ranged from 0 75 to 0 90 v in this voltage range the output current may be the limiting factor instead of the electrode area however when the voltage was increased from 0 90 to 1 05 v ssm gave higher p recovery 40 than ssf 26 due to its larger surface area in contrast yuan and kim 2017 argued that ssf would perform better when there was a large amount of p to recover they tested the performance of single ssm multiple ssm and ssf as the cathode in mec and found that the p recovery was lower with ssm cathode although the p removal was not affected the possible reason is that the size of struvite crystals was too small to be collected from the open spaces in ssm besides lei et al 2018a tested titanium plate cathode with three different surface areas 4 16 and 36 cm2 under the same current supply they observed that the formation of ca p significantly increased with the cathode area a larger surface area favors the formation of ca p because the generation of both mg oh 2 and caco3 can be limited under low current density lei et al 2020a notably when a large specific surface area is required carbon based materials i e graphite felt are better alternatives than traditional titanium plates lei et al 2020a fig 6 shows the images of the precipitation of p minerals on different types of cathode apart from the surface area and the material the gap between electrodes also matters lei et al 2019d studied p removal at different anode and cathode distances 0 5 3 0 and 6 0 cm while the p removal efficiency was not affected by the anode and cathode distance under a constant current mode a smaller gap could significantly reduce the cell potential from 4 6 v to 3 4 v so as the energy consumption besides li et al 2021a stated that cell potential plays a more important role in p recovery than electrode distance moreover the electrode gap would influence the recombination of cathode produced oh with anode produced h affecting the utilization rate of oh for precipitation lei et al 2019c proposed a simple yet efficient way to deal with the acid base neutralization issue in electrochemical systems by introducing caco3 particles into the electrochemical cell to fill up the space between the anode and the cathode as presented in fig 7 a lei et al 2019c when h is produced at the anode it would firstly react with caco3 instead of neutralizing with oh leading to an accumulation of oh even in the bulk solution and releasing ca2 for the precipitation of ca p eq 4 consequently ca p would precipitate on the cathode and on the surface of caco3 particles and even in the solution similarly siderite feco3 magnesite mgco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 were packed in the electrochemical cell to assist the precipitation of ferric phosphate struvite and other p containing products respectively chen et al 2021 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b 4 caco3 2h ca2 co2 h2o automatic product collection could be achieved through intelligent cathode design p precipitates could be redissolved and detached from the cathode by temporarily reversing the polarity of the platinized titanium anode and cathode perera et al 2020 takabe et al 2020 perera et al 2020 and takabe et al 2020 reported that 3 min polarity reversal was enough to detach the whole p precipitates from the new anode the h generated at the new anode former cathode would dissolve part of the precipitates and reduce the adhesion of crystals to the new anode besides oxygen produced on the new anode may help the detachment and sedimentation of deposits other cell designs could also benefit the collection of precipitates varigala et al 2021 adjusted the reactor into a hopper shape coupled with a suction pipe collecting sediments without interrupting operation as shown in fig 7c notably lei et al 2021b designed a scalable column shaped electrochemical reactor that consists of a tubular stainless steel cathode as presented in fig 7b although the anode and cathode were placed vertically against each other the precipitates did not fall off from the cathode surface over 173 days of continuous operation 2 4 impact of water matrix given the complexity of actual wastewater it is crucial to test the performance of emp system for p recovery in both synthetic solutions and real wastewater to understand the uncertainty of wastewater characteristics and eventually predict how the water matrix would affect p precipitation in the electrochemical system 2 4 1 phosphate concentration the initial phosphate concentration in wastewater is crucial for applying emp in recovering p lei et al 2019d lei et al 2020b lei et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 li et al 2021a and chen et al 2021 observed that the p recovery rate increased with initial p concentration on the contrary yuan and kim 2017 illustrated that p recovery dropped with increasing phosphate concentration which may be related to the cathode structure ssm that cannot hold a large number of struvite crystals from this perspective a different cathode type should be used or precipitates produced in the system should be collected regularly to maintain a high p recovery wang et al 2020 investigated p removal as a function of phosphate concentration 61 9 to 464 6 mg l in a mec system after 8 hours reaction they observed that p recovery exceeded 80 with 61 9 mg l phosphate while p recovery was around 50 with 154 9 mg l phosphate and below 50 with 309 7 and 64 6 mg l phosphate it is worth mentioning that a high concentration of h2po4 may lower the local ph via its buffering capacity likewise lei et al 2021b reported that the p removal efficiency increased with dilution in electrochemical p recovery from cheese wastewater which has a p concentration as high as 789 mg l however the p removal rate decreased dramatically from 1194 to 207 mg p day 2 4 2 interaction with coexisting substances the purity of recovered p minerals mostly depends on phosphate concentration lei et al 2019a demonstrated that an increase of phosphate concentration from 0 23 to 0 76 mm results in increased ra of ca p from 21wt to 66wt however in typical domestic wastewater the bi carbonate concentration is significantly higher than phosphate the bi carbonate concentration in wastewater would affect p removal efficiency and the quality of recovered p products co3 2 would compete for ca2 to form caco3 and carbonate substituted hap cid et al 2018 lei et al 2017 takabe et al 2020 observed that about 34 ca2 was removed in the form of caco3 lei et al 2018b showed a reduced p removal from 51 9 to 24 6 when bi carbonate concentration was increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mm ph is around 8 0 however if the bi carbonate concentration is low 1 0 or 3 0 mm the p removal efficiency was promoted by 7 1 and 7 6 respectively this is because a low bi carbonate concentration is beneficial to establish a high local ph environment near the cathode while not reducing free ca2 significantly the bi carbonate speciation is highly ph dependent fig 3 therefore the adverse influence of bi carbonate may be reduced by adjusting ph lei et al 2019b showed that when adjusting wastewater ph from 7 5 to 3 8 the calcium carbonate formation significantly decreased but the p removal remained around 50 magnesium mg in water can form multiple precipitates such as brucite mg oh 2 dolomite and struvite in the presence of ammonium and phosphate lei et al 2019b takabe et al 2020 in electrochemical systems mg2 moves to the cathode due to mass diffusion and electromigration forming mg oh 2 the governing magnesium species in the recovered precipitates lei et al 2019b moreover mg2 can substitute ca2 incorporating into ca p structure or being adsorbed onto hap crystals cao and harris 2008 furthermore the presence of mg2 may influence the growth rate and the solubility of hap cid et al 2018 lowering the amount of mg precipitates is possible through ph adjustment and current density control lei et al 2019b natural organic matter nom such as humic acid and fulvic acid is ubiquitous in water bodies and soil lei et al 2018c studied the influence of three types of nom suwannee river nom nordic lake nom and pony lake nom on p removal during electrochemical treatment overall nom improved ca p precipitation on the cathode surface to some extent mainly via physical co precipitation with ca p after balancing its negative effect on free ca2 availability in the bulk solution in addition the studies of kappel et al 2013 and lei et al 2018c indicated that nom could slow down the formation of crystalline ca p lei et al 2018c also found that the co precipitation of nom with ca p alters the color of recovered solids the color intensity increases with the increase of nom concentration 3 non ortho phosphorus next to ortho phosphate electrochemical systems can also remove and recover p from non ortho p compounds including phosphonates organic phosphorus and hypophosphite fig 8 non ortho p is widely found in aquatic ecosystems as one of the leading p fractions brooker et al 2018 in water bodies non ortho p can be photochemically or microbiologically decomposed and transformed into more active ortho phosphate contributing to the eutrophication of water bodies zhang et al 2019b however technologies mainly focus on the removal and recovery of ortho phosphate only a few studies have investigated the potential of recovering p from non ortho p biological processes ozonation advanced oxidation process and ion exchange resins have been applied to remove and to a less extent recover p from non ortho p chemical processes have been developed to enhance the removal of non ortho p pocostales et al 2010 successfully degraded organic p with ozone besides microwave activated peroxide generating hydroxyl radicals was applied to convert organic p into ortho phosphate which can be concentrated and recovered through post treatment gifford et al 2015 pocostales et al 2010 in addition uv technology has been developed to convert organic p into ortho phosphate through either direct photolysis or indirect photodegradation by reactive oxygen species rott et al 2017 sindelar et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b based on previous studies it can be concluded that p recovery from non ortho p compounds is a two step process firstly non ortho p needs to be converted into ortho phosphate and then the converted ortho phosphate is removed or recovered through approaches developed for ortho phosphate lei et al 2020b recovered ca p from synthetic wastewater loaded with organic p nitrilotris see fig 8a using a single cell electrochemical system with pt anode and ti cathode as shown in fig 9a organic p was converted to ortho phosphate by anode or anode mediated oxidation subsequently the converted ortho phosphate precipitated with calcium ions on the cathode surface where a high ph environment was established by water reduction additionally lei et al 2020b found that the recovery performance was better in actual wastewater than in model solutions this is because chloride ions in real waste streams result in the formation of reactive chlorine species i e clo which can facilitate the oxidization of organic p subsequently zhang et al 2021 again proved the possibility of one step p recovering from phosphonates edtmp fig 8b in an electrochemical cell with synthetic wastewater furthermore marassi et al 2020 investigated the continuous flow treatment of dairy wastewater in a 2 8 l air cathode mfc the mfc cell realized 90 removal of organic p during the long term operation period 105 days the ortho phosphate concentration increased initially in the effluent indicating the transformation of organic p into ortho phosphate which is likely due to microbial degradation nancharaiah et al 2016 later the ortho phosphate concentration decreased in the effluent probably due to emp of p minerals as crystals were observed on the cathode surface zhang et al 2019a designed a single compartment photoelectrocatalytic cell pec with tio2 ni sb sno2 tna nss bifunctional photoanode and activated carbon fiber acf cathode to treat hypophosphite loaded see fig 8c wastewater as illustrated in fig 9b at the anode photoelectrocatalytic reactions generate fe3 from fe2 active oxidants i e hydroxyl radical and ozone and electrons the active oxidants convert hypophosphite into ortho phosphate which would form insoluble iron phosphate with fe3 moreover h2o2 can be produced at the cathode enhancing the oxidation of hypophosphite in the tested pec 1 0 mm hypophosphite was entirely oxidized at 3 0 v with 3 0 mm fe2 addition zhang et al 2019a the authors assessed the efficiency and the economic aspect of the pec system for treating hypophosphite enriched real electroless nickel plating effluents they concluded that p could be effectively recovered in the form of fepo4 at a lower cost compared to the conventional fenton process even though this system removes non ortho p in a single step treatment the product cannot be used directly as fertilizer because of the low p bioavailability of iron phosphate several factors affect the performance of emp in removing and recovering non ortho p firstly the anode material determines the transformation effectiveness of non ortho p into ortho phosphate lei et al 2020b compared three types of anode materials and elucidated that the oxidation efficiencies are in the order of ru ir pt ir pt similarly tna nss generate ho a powerful oxidant near the anode improving the evolution of ortho phosphate zhang et al 2019a secondly coexisting ions and substances in wastewater affect the system efficiency lei et al 2020b elucidated that chloride ion has a positive effect on non ortho p conversion due to the formation of chlorine in the photoelectrochemical system designed by zhang et al 2019b nitrate and nom enhanced non ortho p removal because they are photo sensitizers and could promote the formation of ho in contrast bi carbonate shows a negative impact because it scavenges ho lastly the solution ph may influence the anodic reactions a better p recovery was observed under acidic conditions because it is beneficial to ho generation zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b 4 economic assessment table 1 presents an economic comparison of different electrochemical systems towards p removal and recovery regarding specific electricity consumption in theory the electricity consumption of recovering ortho phosphate can be as low as 0 3 kg in the electrochemical system while 0 22 kg in the bes assuming the electricity price is 0 1 kwh kappel et al 2013 wang et al 2020 if taking the cost of chemicals into consideration ca2 addition the total cost of electricity and chemical in the study of wang et al 2020 0 91 kg p is still comparable with mined phosphate rock which is around 0 80 kg p excluding transportation costs kappel et al 2013 additionally the energy cost of electrochemical p recovery is comparable to cpr 2 6 10 4 kg p daneshgar et al 2019 these preliminary comparisons indicate that emp possesses a high potential for recovering p even though the treatment of non ortho p generally requires more energy the electricity demand could be reduced by combining bio electrochemical systems with other technologies such as photocatalysis liang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b therefore it is economically possible to include emp in the current wastewater treatment system for removing and recovering p however the existing studies on the economic evaluation of the emp of p minerals mainly consider energy electricity consumption while other costs for scale up systems such as electrode materials reactor materials and maintenance cost are not taken into consideration fig 10 illustrates the impacts of phosphate concentration the type of p ortho or non ortho organic or inorganic the type of electrochemical system abiotic or biotic with or without membranes and the current density on the energy consumption in electrochemical p removal and recovery the energy consumption largely depends on the phosphate concentration overall systems treating low p containing wastewater consume more electricity the typical case is that the electricity consumption per kg ca p between the study of lei et al 2017 and perera et al 2020 was significantly different even though the same current density was applied 3 8 a m2 this is due to the much lower p concentration in the former study moreover membranes were used in the study of perera et al 2020 which reduced energy consumption because it can more effectively increase the cathodic ph and lead to better precipitation efficiency likewise similar current density was used in the study of lei et al 2019c and li et al 2021b yet less energy is consumed compared to the previous two studies resulting from the relatively high initial p concentration and the presence of caco3 or camg co3 2 particles additionally lei et al 2021b elucidated that the system s energy consumption increased with the dilution of p enriched wastewater pointing out the importance of performing p recovery from raw undiluted cheese wastewater when p concentration is too low typically 10 mg l the electricity consumption of emp for p recovery is too high to be considered for real applications lei et al 2019a lei et al 2019d previous studies on cost evaluation in p recovery via chemical precipitation suggested that the cost is acceptable when the po4 p concentration is above 50 mg l zhang et al 2013 the type of p also affects the associated energy consumption the recovery of organic p usually demands higher energy consumption because it requires a high energy input to break the molecule structure as shown in the study of zhang et al 2021 where 2050 kwh was consumed per kg p the treatment of inorganic non ortho p i e h2po2 may consume less energy zhang et al 2019b reported that recovering p from 708 mg l electroless nickel plating effluents with 91 0 a m2 current supply only needed 41 0 kwh kg p however due to limited studies it is hard to draw a solid conclusion regarding the energy consumption in electrochemical p recovery from inorganic non ortho phosphate future studies with a wide range of non ortho p compounds and concentrations should be performed to draw a convincing comparison between the energy consumption in recovering non ortho p compounds bes requires less energy input than abiotic ones due to the generation of electrons from exoelectrogenic microbes lei et al 2019a and lei et al 2019d used bioelectrochemical and abiotic electrochemical systems to treat domestic wastewater respectively and the specific energy consumption of the bio system 69 kwh kg p was lower than for the abiotic system 110 kwh kg p moreover the electricity consumption in the studies of wang et al 2020 and cusick et al 2014 which relied on bioelectrochemical functions was the lowest notably in the study of cusick and logan 2012 the overall energy efficiency of the mec h2 production vs electricity and substrate input is 73 4 which indicates that high overall energy efficiency is achievable if the h2 production could be maintained in the bio electrochemical system bes holds great potential in reducing energy consumption but it often requires additional carbon sources and its working conditions are stricter than abiotic systems a higher current density power input leads to higher energy consumption as presented in the study of lei et al 2019d and lei et al 2017 interestingly in the study of cusick et al 2014 the specific energy consumption at 0 8 v and 1 0 v was similar 6 6 kwh kg p because the increased precipitation rate compensated for the increased energy input however at 1 4 v the improved precipitation rate was not sufficient to offset the energy input leading to enhanced energy consumption 10 0 kwh kg p this is due to the formation of crystals on the cathode which builds a layer and impedes the migration of water h thus increasing the electrical resistance therefore measures such as regularly harvesting precipitates are required to stabilize the energy efficiency when operating electrochemical p recovery at a higher current density the electrode configuration also influences the energy consumption of the systems lei et al 2019c used caco3 to fill up the gap between anode and cathode to treat synthetic wastewater 18 6 mg l p with 3 5 a m2 current supply and the electricity consumption was as low as 29 kwh kg p notably all economic assessments mentioned above excluded the cost of electrodes membranes and other constructive facilities platinum group metal pgm coated electrodes anode are usually applied in electrochemical systems this increases the capex of emp systems significantly when scaling up the noble metal coated electrode may be replaced with cheaper materials i e graphite but the durability of non noble metal electrodes in long term operation needs further investigation consequently alternative electrode materials or better utilization of pgm coated electrodes should be investigated before scaling up furthermore the use of membranes in electrochemical systems is also a concern because of its monetary cost and maintenance since problems i e fouling and scaling frequently occur when treating actual wastewater barua et al 2019 bhambri and karn 2020 kumar et al 2019 marassi et al 2020 emp technologies can recover p in a desirable form without extra chemical dosing such as ca p that can be directly reused as fertilizer besides other valuable by products can be generated in the electrochemical system such as hydrogen which can be captured and utilized to compensate for the energy consumption e g as electron donor at the anode kuntke et al 2017 however the possible monetary reward from by products has not been systematically studied in the discussed literature further research is therefore recommended to assess the total value of electrochemical systems for p recovery ideally an in depth life cycle assessment which considers the cost of constructive facilities the maintenance the benefit from by products and the greenhouse gas footprint should be performed 5 future perspective emp has emerged as a promising approach to enhance p circularity a few pilot studies have been conducted to test the stability of emp at a larger scale lei et al 2021b designed a 2 8 l electrochemical reactor with tubular stainless steel cathode to treat cheese wastewater under long term 170 days continuous flow operation mode the system maintains high stability over the whole operation period after 173 days of treatment the reactor was almost filled with precipitates happe et al 2016 constructed a 3 l triple chamber mfc to treat digested sewage sludge containing iron phosphate and 67 p was recovered as struvite blatter et al 2020 conducted a pilot test to treat wet sewage sludge containing iron phosphates with a 168 l mec and 97 p was recovered however to date most studies have been performed at the laboratory scale developments are still needed to address the existing challenges before implementing electrochemical p recovery systems on a large scale system optimization for long term operation should be comprehensively studied in the lab scale study the p precipitates were directly scraped off the cathode after terminating the reactions which is inapplicable during continuous operation attempts have been made to obtain precipitates while minimizing disturbance on the treatment such as the hopper reactor design and polarity reversal takabe et al 2020 varigala et al 2021 however innovative product collection designs are still desired such as detachable electrodes an automatic scrapper and the sudden increase of current to detach deposits from the cathode the implementation of electrochemical p recovery is case dependent the wastewater matrix needs to be well evaluated before considering the application according to existing studies electrochemical precipitation is advisable for treating p rich wastewater such as dairy wastewater and toilet wastewater acidic wastewater is favored because it reduces the co precipitation of caco3 and enhances the purity of recovered products a database for the wastewater matrix and the corresponding system could be established for research purposes and system optimization in some industrial wastewaters such as metal plating industries non ortho p i e hypophosphite may be the dominant p species in such cases electrochemical systems would be a better and promising alternative however systematic studies are required to identify the efficiency energy consumption and limitations of the emp process towards the removal and recovery of p from non ortho p the economic assessment in this paper only considered electricity consumption which only accounts for part of the system s cost solely p recovery could be expensive compared to commercial p production from phosphate rock therefore integrating emp of p minerals into the current wastewater treatment scheme or with other technologies could be a way to compensate for the p recovery cost for example p recovery could be combined with pollutants removal and h2 or biogas production ding et al 2021 kuntke et al 2017 song et al 2021 moreover the reactor could be redesigned to utilize by products better for example in electrochemical systems reactive chlorine species can be formed in the presence of chloride ions which could function as disinfectants varigala et al 2021 used chlorine produced in electrochemical cells for on site disinfection of treated blackwater ultimately the acceptance of the recovered product should be considered even though p recovered from wastewater usually is cleaner than p rock it may cause concerns from public and fertilizer manufacturers especially when the product is recovered from heavy metals loaded or micro organic pollutants burdened wastewater thus how to build up trust and confidence in the products is also a question needed to be answered 6 conclusion emp systems hold vast potential in removing and recovering p either ortho or non ortho p the main reasons are a it is technically feasible to remove p in wastewater to the required level and recover p as effective fertilizers through bio electrochemical precipitation b on site treatment is possible without dosing extra chemicals c the monetary cost of bio electrochemical system could be comparable with conventional p treating technologies in theory yet it is important to acknowledge that multiple factors affect the system s performance including ph current density electrode configuration and water matrix currently there are questions needed to be answered before applying emp systems at full scale such as system stability under long term operation system output under different water matrices and energy consumption of scale up reactor additionally more research is needed to improve the utilization of by products the collection of deposits the wastewater assessment for on site application and the acceptance of products of electrochemical p recovery moreover further studies are required to explore the long term operation of emp

16382,phosphorus p is an essential element for the growth and reproduction of organisms unfortunately the natural p cycle has been broken by the overexploitation of p ores and the associated discharge of p into water bodies which may trigger the eutrophication of water bodies in the short term and possible p shortage soon consequently technologies emerged to recover p from wastewater to mitigate pollution and exploit secondary p resources electrochemically induced phosphate precipitation has the merit of achieving p recovery without dosing additional chemicals via creating a localized high ph environment near the cathode we critically reviewed the development of electrochemically induced precipitation systems toward p removal and recovery over the past ten years we summarized and discussed the effects of ph current density electrode configuration and water matrix on the performance of electrochemical systems next to ortho p we identified the potential and illustrated the mechanism of electrochemical p removal and recovery from non ortho p compounds by combined anodic or anode mediated oxidation and cathodic reduction precipitation furthermore we assessed the economic feasibility of electrochemical methods and concluded that they are more suitable for treating acidic p rich waste streams despite promising potentials and significant progress in recent years the application of electrochemical systems toward p recovery at a larger scale requires further research and development future work should focus on evaluating the system s performance under long term operation

cornel and schaum 2009 schaum 2018 besides it governs biological activities by participating in biochemical reactions as atp desmidt et al 2015 notably plants take up p from the soil while animals and humans supplement p through diet karunanithi et al 2015 in the natural cycle p originated from lithosphere and atmosphere would travel through biosphere and hydrosphere and eventually returns to the soil in the form of organic fertilizer establishing a closed cycle as illustrated in the green lines of fig 1 cornel and schaum 2009 yuan et al 2018 however with the growth of the global food demand intensive agricultural activities are required which unidirectionally amplifies p flow from soil to crops wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 the p depletion in soil is compensated by p fertilizer in addition the need for other p containing products such as detergents flame retardants and fireworks is also increasing with the expanding population chen and graedel 2016 the drastic increase of p demand accelerates the exploitation of phosphate rock which amplifies the p cycle as emphasized in the red line of fig 1 unfortunately phosphate rock is a non renewable resource whose consumption pace has gone far beyond regeneration and the p ores are regionally imbalanced cordell et al 2009 if no actions are taken the phosphate crisis might occur in the near future jasinski 2020 notably the regional p balances in latin america and the caribbean south asia central and west europe and oceania may lead to a shortage in 2022 according to the world fertilizer outlook 2022 from food and nations 2019 apart from scarcity at source a more urgent problem is the p enrichment in downstream water bodies the p fertilized in farmlands would leach and or run off into water bodies with rainfall chen and graedel 2016 liu et al 2020a meanwhile p produced and consumed by human society eventually enters and accumulates in water bodies through urban sewage systems mayer et al 2016 because of the lack of p recycling the p will find its destiny in water bodies surplus p in water bodies triggers eutrophication causes oxygen depletion in water bodies and further the hypoxia of aquatic organisms karunanithi et al 2015 even though eutrophication may appear as a natural process today the frequent occurrence of algae blooms is attributed to human activities especially the discharge of under treated wastewater overloaded with p because p used to be the critical limiting nutrient in these water bodies technologies have been developed to treat excess p in wastewater one of the most widely accepted methods is chemical precipitation during precipitation reagents such as iron aluminum magnesium and calcium salts are dosed to form less soluble or insoluble p minerals nancharaiah et al 2016 ye et al 2017 adsorption is another common physicochemical method for p removal adsorption is easy to operate but requirements for adsorbents are strict such as high stability reusability and p affinity crini et al 2019 commercial processes based on physicochemical methods have been applied to remove p and other nutrients from wastewaters ghosh et al 2019 jupp et al 2021 li et al 2019 melia et al 2017 ye et al 2017 moreover enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr could concentrate p from the liquid stream and is flexible to combine with other post p recovery technologies egle et al 2016 perera et al 2019 overall there is room for improvements in current p removal and recovery technologies such as reducing chemical input minimizing sludge processing simplifying operation steps and saving the organics consumed in ebpr process for energy production i e biogas in recent years electrochemical technologies ets have received increasing attention in wastewater treatment garcia segura et al 2018 modin and gustavsson 2014 muddemann et al 2019 srivastava et al 2020 likewise there is an increasing interest in applying electrochemically mediated precipitation emp as a strategy to remove and recover p from waste streams cusick and logan 2012 foroughi et al 2019 kappel et al 2013 lei et al 2017 wang et al 2020 compared to conventional methods for p recovery including chemical phosphate removal cpr adsorption and ebpr emp possesses the merits of simple operation moreover chemical additions are not required in emp because electrochemical reactions can lead to a high ph environment near the cathode to induce p deposition lei et al 2017 takabe et al 2020 more importantly emp recovers bioavailable p in one process and requires no or little post treatment therefore emp may help establish and maintain a new and sustainable p cycle by utilizing the p accumulated in waste streams as an alternative for mined p rocks several review articles have illustrated the application of ets in wastewater treatment including p removal by traditional electrochemical process i e electrocoagulation feng et al 2016 guedes et al 2014 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b muddemann et al 2019 nancharaiah et al 2016 perera et al 2019 tabassum et al 2021 emp is different from electrochemical coagulation the latter process applies sacrificial electrodes to release cations i e fe2 mg2 to remove phosphate which would produce a large amount of sludge and the electrodes need to be replaced regularly during long term operation by contrast condensed p minerals would be produced in emp process and the solids can be directly collected from the cathode surface besides emp usually employs inert electrodes which are not consumed during the reaction other ets such as electrodialysis often only concentrate p in the wastewater therefore a post treatment is required for electrodialysis concentrate to remove p from the solution and recover p as an applicable product zhang et al 2013 in comparison emp achieves p removal and recovery in one system with one step and without dosing chemicals however to the best of our knowledge there is no review article focusing on p removal and recovery using emp therefore this review article aims to fill in this knowledge gap by providing an overview of emp developments for p removal and recovery first we critically reviewed the mechanisms and influencing factors of emp in p removal and recovery second we emphasized the potential of emp in treating non ortho p compounds next we evaluated the economic feasibility of emp in recovering p from the perspective of electricity consumption finally we discussed the potential challenges toward the commercialization of emp in p removal and recovery from wastewaters and proposed possible directions for future research 2 the working principle of electrochemically mediated precipitation a typical electrochemical system consists of an anode a cathode and an external power supply as presented in fig 2 a emp of p minerals is achieved through ph elevation at the cathode surface while phosphate ions do not directly participate in the electrochemical reactions at the cathode water molecules are reduced into h2 and oh leading to the elevation of local ph eq 1 meanwhile cations i e ca2 would move towards and accumulate near the cathode due to electric migration as a result the saturation index si of p minerals would increase driving the formation and precipitation of p minerals on the cathode as shown in eq 2 fig 2b presents the si of possible calcium phosphate ca p in response to the rise of local ph it is apparent that the rise of local ph increases the si moreover the high local ph near the cathode would reduce the solubility of p minerals i e ca p further boosting the precipitation of p minerals in this way the precipitates can be directly collected from the cathode requiring no extra solid liquid separation process which is required in conventional methods at the anode oxidation of water generates h neutralizing the oh produced on the cathode eq 3 therefore while the local ph at the cathode would increase the bulk solution ph is not expected to change significantly in the electrochemical systems moreover the presence of buffer ions such as bi carbonate would also stabilize the ph of the bulk solution cid et al 2018 lei et al 2018b besides the organic compounds in the solution would be oxidized and even mineralized to some extent at the anode 1 cathode 4h2o 4e 4oh 2h2 2 5ca2 3hpo4 2 4oh ca5 po4 3oh 3h2o 3 anode 2h2o 4h o2 4e struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o and ca p are the two common products in emp system the struvite process possesses the advantage of simultaneously recovering nitrogen n and p karunanithi et al 2015 electrochemical struvite recovery has been studied for different waste streams huang et al 2016 hug and udert 2013 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2019c however the direct formation of struvite at the cathode is challenging because the high local ph would favor the shift of n species from nh4 to nh3 belarbi et al 2020 li et al 2021b besides a high ph environment may lead to the formation of mg oh 2 instead of struvite therefore the current density which regulates the production of oh needs to be controlled wang et al 2022 reported that the percentage of struvite that deposits on the cathode decreased from 91 to 18 when the current density is increased from 5 8 to 17 3 a m2 moreover extra mg2 is usually required to achieve efficient struvite recovery when targeted wastewater is low in n and mg2 content it is more suitable to recover p as ca p eq 2 shaddel et al 2019 as ca2 widely exists in wastewater typically 20 120 mg l in domestic wastewater there is no requirement for ca2 dosing in emp of ca p especially in calcium enriched wastewaters such as effluent from dairy industries around 2200 mg l ca2 lei et al 2018a lei et al 2021a moreover ca p recovered by emp is similar in composition to rock phosphate and therefore a suitable alternative p source for industrial p fertilizer production without process modifications melia et al 2017 in some emp systems ion exchange membranes iems are applied to prevent the neutralization of the anolyte low ph with the catholyte high ph kappel et al 2013 perera et al 2020 with iems the p recovery efficiency is projected to increase because the ph change in the media expands further away from the electrodes meanwhile the low ph environment in the anode chamber can eliminate bi carbonate which can significantly improve the purity of recovered solids lei et al 2019b 2 1 the role of ph the ph is a decisive factor that affects the precipitation of p minerals to differentiate we will discuss local ph which is the ph at the cathode surface and bulk ph which is the solution ph in general in this section phosphate presents in various forms under different ph conditions as shown in fig 3a for example h2po4 is the main form when ph is below 7 2 while hpo4 2 becomes the predominating form when ph exceeds 7 2 sø 2011 a high ph condition provides a higher thermodynamic driving force for phosphate to precipitate lei et al 2017 firstly the si of typical p precipitates i e hap would elevate along with increasing ph value because phosphate would be deprotonated and more oh the components of hydroxyapatite hap would be available under high ph secondly the solubility of p precipitates is lower under high ph conditions which benefits the deposition of p minerals lei et al 2017 showed that 20 of 0 6 mm p was removed at an initial bulk ph of 10 0 even under open circuit conditions in the presence of 1 0 mm ca while no apparent p removal was observed at bulk ph 4 0 or 8 4 however in the electrochemical system the bulk ph is less critical than local ph because the reduction of water molecules at the cathode raises the local ph and promotes the nucleation and growth of p crystals in the same experimental setup but a closed electrical circuit 3 8 a m2 the p removal increased to over 48 in all three bulk ph conditions 4 0 8 4 and 10 0 lei et al 2017 other studies also supported the argument that bulk ph is not crucial in emp lu et al 2005 deliberately controlled the bulk ph at 5 1 where ca p cannot be formed but ca p was collected from the cathode furthermore ca p was successfully recovered in an electrochemical system treating acidic cheese wastewater bulk ph 5 lei et al 2021a lei et al 2019b also investigated emp of p minerals in domestic wastewater as a function of acidification they found that even with a dramatic change of bulk ph from 7 5 to 3 8 the p removal efficiency was not much affected decreased slightly from 55 to 49 compared with the bulk ph the local ph is more affecting the electrochemical precipitation according to lei et al 2017 the local ph near the cathode surface can reach as high as 13 2 significantly higher than the bulk ph nonetheless the bulk ph still plays a role it could indirectly affect p precipitation by influencing the speciation and even the bi carbonate concentration in wastewater if the wastewater is acidified low ph the bi carbonate concentration will decrease which means less carbonate will compete for ca2 with phosphate in this way wastewater with low bulk ph could mitigate the adverse effect of bi carbonate on p precipitation the bulk ph is expected to remain stable in emp process attributing to the buffering ions in water and the neutralization of h generated on the anode with oh generated on the cathode perera et al 2020 however lei et al 2017 reported a severe decrease in bulk ph in emp of ca p with synthetical solutions this is because oh produced at the cathode is consumed by precipitation reactions while there are no extra h consuming reactions in the system also precipitation reactions remove buffer species from the water at high current densities a m2 the generated h exceeded the buffer capacity of the bulk solution resulting in a decrease of the bulk ph perera et al 2020 lei et al 2019b showed that the change of bulk ph is linked to the initial bulk ph of treated domestic wastewater the bulk ph of wastewater decreased after treatment when the initial bulk ph was acidified below 6 0 while it increased when the initial bulk ph was above 6 0 this is likely related to the loss of bi carbonate buffer ions by pre acidification and the depletion of oh by co2 mg2 and nh4 notably it was also reported that the bulk ph increased after electrochemical treatment with the presence of bi carbonate which would consume the h generated on the anode and left the oh accumulated in the bulk solution lei et al 2019b lei et al 2018b 2 2 impact of current density in electrochemical systems the applied current density directly determines the formation rate of oh at the cathode regulating the precipitation of p minerals the p removal percentage increases with elevating current density because high current density would promote oh production at the cathode aiding p precipitation as shown in fig 4 a lei et al 2019b lei et al 2021a lei et al 2021b perera et al 2020 takabe et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however when the current density exceeds a certain value the p removal percentage would maintain stable as in the case of lei et al 2021a and zhang et al 2021 the reason could be that there was too little p in the solution to be deposited as the p removal percentage was over 90 after the current density reached 40 a cm2 another reason could be that the precipitation layer formed on the cathode hindered the p diffusion towards the cathode surface interestingly a porous structure fig 6c which is created by h2 generated on the cathode was observed on the precipitation layer and may assist p diffusion towards the cathode surface in the study of takabe et al 2020 the p removal percentage slightly decreased after the current density surpassed a certain level fig 4a the limiting factor was the strong electrostatic repulsion between the cathode and phosphate at a very high current density moreover the ortho p removal in the study of takabe et al 2020 was significantly lower than the other studies indicating high current density over 80 a m2 could hinder the precipitation of p minerals therefore a low current density condition is favored during p recovery for both p removal and energy consumption additionally the initial p removal rate would be affected by the applied current density cid et al 2018 found that the p removal rate was increased from 0 05 to 0 13 mg l s when the current density was increased from 26 to 150 a m2 batch operation 18 6 mg l p the applied current density could also affect the size and composition of precipitates perera et al 2020 found the size of precipitated particles decreased with increasing current density from 3 8 to 50 4 a m2 as presented in fig 4b this is explained by the increased ph and si of p minerals with increased current density which results in preferred nucleation over growth for the crystallization process lu et al 2005 nielsen 1969 however small size precipitate would hinder the separation process and lead to low p recovery as shown in fig 4a supporting the argument that a low current density condition favors the p recovery moreover lei et al 2018b observed that amorphous calcium phosphate acp was formed under 1 9 a m2 while hap was found under 18 9 a m2 batch operation 18 6 mg l p unfortunately the relative abundance ra of ca p in recovered solids decreased with the increasing current density when electrochemical p recovery was performed at a low current density of 0 2 a m2 almost none mg oh 2 and only limited caco3 were formed lei et al 2020a reported that a current density as low as 0 04 a m2 could trigger ca p precipitation at the cathode therefore from the perspective of both removal efficiency and product purity a very high current density is not desirable although with high current density the removal kinetics can be enhanced and the treatment time can be shortened the purity of recovered products regarding p content may be reduced and the specific energy consumption may be increased 2 3 impact of cell configuration 2 3 1 exploration of bioanode in abiotic electrochemical systems p precipitation is driven by external current which generally results in high energy consumption to reduce energy consumption bioanodes could be applied in a typical bioelectrochemical system bes exoelectrogenic microbes grow as firm biofilms on the anode which oxidize soluble organic compounds in the bulk solution and release electrons to the anode logan et al 2008 logan et al 2006 thus organic compounds act as electron donors in the bes instead of water as in abiotic electrochemical systems the electrons are then transferred to the cathode through an external circuit to support the reduction reactions at the cathode either oxygen is reduced to water oxygen reduction reaction orr in a microbial fuel cell mfc or h water are reduced to h2 gas hydrogen evolution reaction her in a microbial electrolysis cell mec elevating the local ph cusick et al 2010 fig 5 a is an example of a single chamber bioelectrochemical reactor an external power supply is required to drive the nonspontaneous reactions i e her at the cathode the energy demand for bioelectrochemical mediated p precipitation was significantly reduced compared to that of abiotic electrochemical precipitation ichihashi and hirooka 2012 yuan and kim 2017 moreover bes can effectively avoid the formation of chlorinated organic compounds which are highly toxic to living organisms lei et al 2019a researchers have explored the possibility of bes in recovering p fischer et al 2011 demonstrated that mfc could enable p recovery from digested sewage sludge however in their concept the mfc was only used to dissolve and release phosphate from iron phosphate extra chemicals magnesium and ammonium salts and additional ph adjustments were still required to achieve p recovery eventually later ichihashi and hirooka 2012 and hirooka and ichihashi 2013 investigated the potential of a single chamber air cathode mfc on p removal and recovery in the study of ichihashi and hirooka 2012 swine wastewater was flowing through two mfcs in a fed batch mode the results suggested that around 70 82 p was removed in each mfc in the study of hirooka and ichihashi 2013 p in artificial wastewater was removed at the range of 19 55 as struvite depending on the concentrations of lattice ions mg2 and nh4 the two studies proved the achievability of p removal and recovery in bes in mec the p removal effectiveness and the p precipitation rate increased with current density blatter et al 2019 cusick and logan 2012 lei et al 2019a wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 pepè sciarria et al 2019 compared the p recovery effectiveness in a digestate by mec and mfc respectively it was observed that mfc resulted in 10 15 higher removal of p than mec a fixed voltage of 1 07 v was applied in typical domestic wastewater the amount of readily biodegradable organic carbon is inadequate for microbes to provide sufficient electric current and a high enough coulombic efficiency for a complete p recovery yuan and kim 2017 therefore supplementary organic compounds are usually spiked in bioelectrochemical reactors when treating actual wastewater cusick and logan 2012 hirooka and ichihashi 2013 the p recovery would increase with elevating organic compounds almatouq and babatunde 2016 lei et al 2019a however adding organic compounds is a challenge for application because it increases the overall cost substantially and could cause unexpected interactions in the water matrix membranes are used in bio electrochemical systems to separate the anodic and the cathodic chamber which could effectively improve p removal effectiveness fischer et al 2011 tao et al 2014 ye et al 2019a obtained a p recovery from 24 4 to 83 2 in a cem contained mec similarly wang et al 2020 applied three types of membranes bipolar membrane aem and cem in a mec and recovered over 80 of p 5 mm in the form of ca p notably ye et al 2019b tested three types of membranes cem forward osmosis membrane and nonwoven membrane and found that mfc with cem had the best p removal effectiveness 95 however the use of membranes could trigger problems such as membrane fouling and high internal resistance of the reactor which could lower energy efficiency and increase the cost blatter et al 2020 cusick et al 2014 happe et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 marassi et al 2020 2 3 2 design of cathode in membrane less emp the cathode is where the precipitation of p minerals occurs therefore the cathode design plays an important role in the removal and recovery of p firstly the surface area of the cathode would affect p removal efficiency as well as the purity of the recovered product cusick and logan 2012 reported that the p recovery as struvite with stainless steel mesh ssm 19 cm2 and stainless steel foil ssf 7 cm2 was similar when the applied voltage ranged from 0 75 to 0 90 v in this voltage range the output current may be the limiting factor instead of the electrode area however when the voltage was increased from 0 90 to 1 05 v ssm gave higher p recovery 40 than ssf 26 due to its larger surface area in contrast yuan and kim 2017 argued that ssf would perform better when there was a large amount of p to recover they tested the performance of single ssm multiple ssm and ssf as the cathode in mec and found that the p recovery was lower with ssm cathode although the p removal was not affected the possible reason is that the size of struvite crystals was too small to be collected from the open spaces in ssm besides lei et al 2018a tested titanium plate cathode with three different surface areas 4 16 and 36 cm2 under the same current supply they observed that the formation of ca p significantly increased with the cathode area a larger surface area favors the formation of ca p because the generation of both mg oh 2 and caco3 can be limited under low current density lei et al 2020a notably when a large specific surface area is required carbon based materials i e graphite felt are better alternatives than traditional titanium plates lei et al 2020a fig 6 shows the images of the precipitation of p minerals on different types of cathode apart from the surface area and the material the gap between electrodes also matters lei et al 2019d studied p removal at different anode and cathode distances 0 5 3 0 and 6 0 cm while the p removal efficiency was not affected by the anode and cathode distance under a constant current mode a smaller gap could significantly reduce the cell potential from 4 6 v to 3 4 v so as the energy consumption besides li et al 2021a stated that cell potential plays a more important role in p recovery than electrode distance moreover the electrode gap would influence the recombination of cathode produced oh with anode produced h affecting the utilization rate of oh for precipitation lei et al 2019c proposed a simple yet efficient way to deal with the acid base neutralization issue in electrochemical systems by introducing caco3 particles into the electrochemical cell to fill up the space between the anode and the cathode as presented in fig 7 a lei et al 2019c when h is produced at the anode it would firstly react with caco3 instead of neutralizing with oh leading to an accumulation of oh even in the bulk solution and releasing ca2 for the precipitation of ca p eq 4 consequently ca p would precipitate on the cathode and on the surface of caco3 particles and even in the solution similarly siderite feco3 magnesite mgco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 were packed in the electrochemical cell to assist the precipitation of ferric phosphate struvite and other p containing products respectively chen et al 2021 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b 4 caco3 2h ca2 co2 h2o automatic product collection could be achieved through intelligent cathode design p precipitates could be redissolved and detached from the cathode by temporarily reversing the polarity of the platinized titanium anode and cathode perera et al 2020 takabe et al 2020 perera et al 2020 and takabe et al 2020 reported that 3 min polarity reversal was enough to detach the whole p precipitates from the new anode the h generated at the new anode former cathode would dissolve part of the precipitates and reduce the adhesion of crystals to the new anode besides oxygen produced on the new anode may help the detachment and sedimentation of deposits other cell designs could also benefit the collection of precipitates varigala et al 2021 adjusted the reactor into a hopper shape coupled with a suction pipe collecting sediments without interrupting operation as shown in fig 7c notably lei et al 2021b designed a scalable column shaped electrochemical reactor that consists of a tubular stainless steel cathode as presented in fig 7b although the anode and cathode were placed vertically against each other the precipitates did not fall off from the cathode surface over 173 days of continuous operation 2 4 impact of water matrix given the complexity of actual wastewater it is crucial to test the performance of emp system for p recovery in both synthetic solutions and real wastewater to understand the uncertainty of wastewater characteristics and eventually predict how the water matrix would affect p precipitation in the electrochemical system 2 4 1 phosphate concentration the initial phosphate concentration in wastewater is crucial for applying emp in recovering p lei et al 2019d lei et al 2020b lei et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 li et al 2021a and chen et al 2021 observed that the p recovery rate increased with initial p concentration on the contrary yuan and kim 2017 illustrated that p recovery dropped with increasing phosphate concentration which may be related to the cathode structure ssm that cannot hold a large number of struvite crystals from this perspective a different cathode type should be used or precipitates produced in the system should be collected regularly to maintain a high p recovery wang et al 2020 investigated p removal as a function of phosphate concentration 61 9 to 464 6 mg l in a mec system after 8 hours reaction they observed that p recovery exceeded 80 with 61 9 mg l phosphate while p recovery was around 50 with 154 9 mg l phosphate and below 50 with 309 7 and 64 6 mg l phosphate it is worth mentioning that a high concentration of h2po4 may lower the local ph via its buffering capacity likewise lei et al 2021b reported that the p removal efficiency increased with dilution in electrochemical p recovery from cheese wastewater which has a p concentration as high as 789 mg l however the p removal rate decreased dramatically from 1194 to 207 mg p day 2 4 2 interaction with coexisting substances the purity of recovered p minerals mostly depends on phosphate concentration lei et al 2019a demonstrated that an increase of phosphate concentration from 0 23 to 0 76 mm results in increased ra of ca p from 21wt to 66wt however in typical domestic wastewater the bi carbonate concentration is significantly higher than phosphate the bi carbonate concentration in wastewater would affect p removal efficiency and the quality of recovered p products co3 2 would compete for ca2 to form caco3 and carbonate substituted hap cid et al 2018 lei et al 2017 takabe et al 2020 observed that about 34 ca2 was removed in the form of caco3 lei et al 2018b showed a reduced p removal from 51 9 to 24 6 when bi carbonate concentration was increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mm ph is around 8 0 however if the bi carbonate concentration is low 1 0 or 3 0 mm the p removal efficiency was promoted by 7 1 and 7 6 respectively this is because a low bi carbonate concentration is beneficial to establish a high local ph environment near the cathode while not reducing free ca2 significantly the bi carbonate speciation is highly ph dependent fig 3 therefore the adverse influence of bi carbonate may be reduced by adjusting ph lei et al 2019b showed that when adjusting wastewater ph from 7 5 to 3 8 the calcium carbonate formation significantly decreased but the p removal remained around 50 magnesium mg in water can form multiple precipitates such as brucite mg oh 2 dolomite and struvite in the presence of ammonium and phosphate lei et al 2019b takabe et al 2020 in electrochemical systems mg2 moves to the cathode due to mass diffusion and electromigration forming mg oh 2 the governing magnesium species in the recovered precipitates lei et al 2019b moreover mg2 can substitute ca2 incorporating into ca p structure or being adsorbed onto hap crystals cao and harris 2008 furthermore the presence of mg2 may influence the growth rate and the solubility of hap cid et al 2018 lowering the amount of mg precipitates is possible through ph adjustment and current density control lei et al 2019b natural organic matter nom such as humic acid and fulvic acid is ubiquitous in water bodies and soil lei et al 2018c studied the influence of three types of nom suwannee river nom nordic lake nom and pony lake nom on p removal during electrochemical treatment overall nom improved ca p precipitation on the cathode surface to some extent mainly via physical co precipitation with ca p after balancing its negative effect on free ca2 availability in the bulk solution in addition the studies of kappel et al 2013 and lei et al 2018c indicated that nom could slow down the formation of crystalline ca p lei et al 2018c also found that the co precipitation of nom with ca p alters the color of recovered solids the color intensity increases with the increase of nom concentration 3 non ortho phosphorus next to ortho phosphate electrochemical systems can also remove and recover p from non ortho p compounds including phosphonates organic phosphorus and hypophosphite fig 8 non ortho p is widely found in aquatic ecosystems as one of the leading p fractions brooker et al 2018 in water bodies non ortho p can be photochemically or microbiologically decomposed and transformed into more active ortho phosphate contributing to the eutrophication of water bodies zhang et al 2019b however technologies mainly focus on the removal and recovery of ortho phosphate only a few studies have investigated the potential of recovering p from non ortho p biological processes ozonation advanced oxidation process and ion exchange resins have been applied to remove and to a less extent recover p from non ortho p chemical processes have been developed to enhance the removal of non ortho p pocostales et al 2010 successfully degraded organic p with ozone besides microwave activated peroxide generating hydroxyl radicals was applied to convert organic p into ortho phosphate which can be concentrated and recovered through post treatment gifford et al 2015 pocostales et al 2010 in addition uv technology has been developed to convert organic p into ortho phosphate through either direct photolysis or indirect photodegradation by reactive oxygen species rott et al 2017 sindelar et al 2016 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b based on previous studies it can be concluded that p recovery from non ortho p compounds is a two step process firstly non ortho p needs to be converted into ortho phosphate and then the converted ortho phosphate is removed or recovered through approaches developed for ortho phosphate lei et al 2020b recovered ca p from synthetic wastewater loaded with organic p nitrilotris see fig 8a using a single cell electrochemical system with pt anode and ti cathode as shown in fig 9a organic p was converted to ortho phosphate by anode or anode mediated oxidation subsequently the converted ortho phosphate precipitated with calcium ions on the cathode surface where a high ph environment was established by water reduction additionally lei et al 2020b found that the recovery performance was better in actual wastewater than in model solutions this is because chloride ions in real waste streams result in the formation of reactive chlorine species i e clo which can facilitate the oxidization of organic p subsequently zhang et al 2021 again proved the possibility of one step p recovering from phosphonates edtmp fig 8b in an electrochemical cell with synthetic wastewater furthermore marassi et al 2020 investigated the continuous flow treatment of dairy wastewater in a 2 8 l air cathode mfc the mfc cell realized 90 removal of organic p during the long term operation period 105 days the ortho phosphate concentration increased initially in the effluent indicating the transformation of organic p into ortho phosphate which is likely due to microbial degradation nancharaiah et al 2016 later the ortho phosphate concentration decreased in the effluent probably due to emp of p minerals as crystals were observed on the cathode surface zhang et al 2019a designed a single compartment photoelectrocatalytic cell pec with tio2 ni sb sno2 tna nss bifunctional photoanode and activated carbon fiber acf cathode to treat hypophosphite loaded see fig 8c wastewater as illustrated in fig 9b at the anode photoelectrocatalytic reactions generate fe3 from fe2 active oxidants i e hydroxyl radical and ozone and electrons the active oxidants convert hypophosphite into ortho phosphate which would form insoluble iron phosphate with fe3 moreover h2o2 can be produced at the cathode enhancing the oxidation of hypophosphite in the tested pec 1 0 mm hypophosphite was entirely oxidized at 3 0 v with 3 0 mm fe2 addition zhang et al 2019a the authors assessed the efficiency and the economic aspect of the pec system for treating hypophosphite enriched real electroless nickel plating effluents they concluded that p could be effectively recovered in the form of fepo4 at a lower cost compared to the conventional fenton process even though this system removes non ortho p in a single step treatment the product cannot be used directly as fertilizer because of the low p bioavailability of iron phosphate several factors affect the performance of emp in removing and recovering non ortho p firstly the anode material determines the transformation effectiveness of non ortho p into ortho phosphate lei et al 2020b compared three types of anode materials and elucidated that the oxidation efficiencies are in the order of ru ir pt ir pt similarly tna nss generate ho a powerful oxidant near the anode improving the evolution of ortho phosphate zhang et al 2019a secondly coexisting ions and substances in wastewater affect the system efficiency lei et al 2020b elucidated that chloride ion has a positive effect on non ortho p conversion due to the formation of chlorine in the photoelectrochemical system designed by zhang et al 2019b nitrate and nom enhanced non ortho p removal because they are photo sensitizers and could promote the formation of ho in contrast bi carbonate shows a negative impact because it scavenges ho lastly the solution ph may influence the anodic reactions a better p recovery was observed under acidic conditions because it is beneficial to ho generation zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b 4 economic assessment table 1 presents an economic comparison of different electrochemical systems towards p removal and recovery regarding specific electricity consumption in theory the electricity consumption of recovering ortho phosphate can be as low as 0 3 kg in the electrochemical system while 0 22 kg in the bes assuming the electricity price is 0 1 kwh kappel et al 2013 wang et al 2020 if taking the cost of chemicals into consideration ca2 addition the total cost of electricity and chemical in the study of wang et al 2020 0 91 kg p is still comparable with mined phosphate rock which is around 0 80 kg p excluding transportation costs kappel et al 2013 additionally the energy cost of electrochemical p recovery is comparable to cpr 2 6 10 4 kg p daneshgar et al 2019 these preliminary comparisons indicate that emp possesses a high potential for recovering p even though the treatment of non ortho p generally requires more energy the electricity demand could be reduced by combining bio electrochemical systems with other technologies such as photocatalysis liang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b therefore it is economically possible to include emp in the current wastewater treatment system for removing and recovering p however the existing studies on the economic evaluation of the emp of p minerals mainly consider energy electricity consumption while other costs for scale up systems such as electrode materials reactor materials and maintenance cost are not taken into consideration fig 10 illustrates the impacts of phosphate concentration the type of p ortho or non ortho organic or inorganic the type of electrochemical system abiotic or biotic with or without membranes and the current density on the energy consumption in electrochemical p removal and recovery the energy consumption largely depends on the phosphate concentration overall systems treating low p containing wastewater consume more electricity the typical case is that the electricity consumption per kg ca p between the study of lei et al 2017 and perera et al 2020 was significantly different even though the same current density was applied 3 8 a m2 this is due to the much lower p concentration in the former study moreover membranes were used in the study of perera et al 2020 which reduced energy consumption because it can more effectively increase the cathodic ph and lead to better precipitation efficiency likewise similar current density was used in the study of lei et al 2019c and li et al 2021b yet less energy is consumed compared to the previous two studies resulting from the relatively high initial p concentration and the presence of caco3 or camg co3 2 particles additionally lei et al 2021b elucidated that the system s energy consumption increased with the dilution of p enriched wastewater pointing out the importance of performing p recovery from raw undiluted cheese wastewater when p concentration is too low typically 10 mg l the electricity consumption of emp for p recovery is too high to be considered for real applications lei et al 2019a lei et al 2019d previous studies on cost evaluation in p recovery via chemical precipitation suggested that the cost is acceptable when the po4 p concentration is above 50 mg l zhang et al 2013 the type of p also affects the associated energy consumption the recovery of organic p usually demands higher energy consumption because it requires a high energy input to break the molecule structure as shown in the study of zhang et al 2021 where 2050 kwh was consumed per kg p the treatment of inorganic non ortho p i e h2po2 may consume less energy zhang et al 2019b reported that recovering p from 708 mg l electroless nickel plating effluents with 91 0 a m2 current supply only needed 41 0 kwh kg p however due to limited studies it is hard to draw a solid conclusion regarding the energy consumption in electrochemical p recovery from inorganic non ortho phosphate future studies with a wide range of non ortho p compounds and concentrations should be performed to draw a convincing comparison between the energy consumption in recovering non ortho p compounds bes requires less energy input than abiotic ones due to the generation of electrons from exoelectrogenic microbes lei et al 2019a and lei et al 2019d used bioelectrochemical and abiotic electrochemical systems to treat domestic wastewater respectively and the specific energy consumption of the bio system 69 kwh kg p was lower than for the abiotic system 110 kwh kg p moreover the electricity consumption in the studies of wang et al 2020 and cusick et al 2014 which relied on bioelectrochemical functions was the lowest notably in the study of cusick and logan 2012 the overall energy efficiency of the mec h2 production vs electricity and substrate input is 73 4 which indicates that high overall energy efficiency is achievable if the h2 production could be maintained in the bio electrochemical system bes holds great potential in reducing energy consumption but it often requires additional carbon sources and its working conditions are stricter than abiotic systems a higher current density power input leads to higher energy consumption as presented in the study of lei et al 2019d and lei et al 2017 interestingly in the study of cusick et al 2014 the specific energy consumption at 0 8 v and 1 0 v was similar 6 6 kwh kg p because the increased precipitation rate compensated for the increased energy input however at 1 4 v the improved precipitation rate was not sufficient to offset the energy input leading to enhanced energy consumption 10 0 kwh kg p this is due to the formation of crystals on the cathode which builds a layer and impedes the migration of water h thus increasing the electrical resistance therefore measures such as regularly harvesting precipitates are required to stabilize the energy efficiency when operating electrochemical p recovery at a higher current density the electrode configuration also influences the energy consumption of the systems lei et al 2019c used caco3 to fill up the gap between anode and cathode to treat synthetic wastewater 18 6 mg l p with 3 5 a m2 current supply and the electricity consumption was as low as 29 kwh kg p notably all economic assessments mentioned above excluded the cost of electrodes membranes and other constructive facilities platinum group metal pgm coated electrodes anode are usually applied in electrochemical systems this increases the capex of emp systems significantly when scaling up the noble metal coated electrode may be replaced with cheaper materials i e graphite but the durability of non noble metal electrodes in long term operation needs further investigation consequently alternative electrode materials or better utilization of pgm coated electrodes should be investigated before scaling up furthermore the use of membranes in electrochemical systems is also a concern because of its monetary cost and maintenance since problems i e fouling and scaling frequently occur when treating actual wastewater barua et al 2019 bhambri and karn 2020 kumar et al 2019 marassi et al 2020 emp technologies can recover p in a desirable form without extra chemical dosing such as ca p that can be directly reused as fertilizer besides other valuable by products can be generated in the electrochemical system such as hydrogen which can be captured and utilized to compensate for the energy consumption e g as electron donor at the anode kuntke et al 2017 however the possible monetary reward from by products has not been systematically studied in the discussed literature further research is therefore recommended to assess the total value of electrochemical systems for p recovery ideally an in depth life cycle assessment which considers the cost of constructive facilities the maintenance the benefit from by products and the greenhouse gas footprint should be performed 5 future perspective emp has emerged as a promising approach to enhance p circularity a few pilot studies have been conducted to test the stability of emp at a larger scale lei et al 2021b designed a 2 8 l electrochemical reactor with tubular stainless steel cathode to treat cheese wastewater under long term 170 days continuous flow operation mode the system maintains high stability over the whole operation period after 173 days of treatment the reactor was almost filled with precipitates happe et al 2016 constructed a 3 l triple chamber mfc to treat digested sewage sludge containing iron phosphate and 67 p was recovered as struvite blatter et al 2020 conducted a pilot test to treat wet sewage sludge containing iron phosphates with a 168 l mec and 97 p was recovered however to date most studies have been performed at the laboratory scale developments are still needed to address the existing challenges before implementing electrochemical p recovery systems on a large scale system optimization for long term operation should be comprehensively studied in the lab scale study the p precipitates were directly scraped off the cathode after terminating the reactions which is inapplicable during continuous operation attempts have been made to obtain precipitates while minimizing disturbance on the treatment such as the hopper reactor design and polarity reversal takabe et al 2020 varigala et al 2021 however innovative product collection designs are still desired such as detachable electrodes an automatic scrapper and the sudden increase of current to detach deposits from the cathode the implementation of electrochemical p recovery is case dependent the wastewater matrix needs to be well evaluated before considering the application according to existing studies electrochemical precipitation is advisable for treating p rich wastewater such as dairy wastewater and toilet wastewater acidic wastewater is favored because it reduces the co precipitation of caco3 and enhances the purity of recovered products a database for the wastewater matrix and the corresponding system could be established for research purposes and system optimization in some industrial wastewaters such as metal plating industries non ortho p i e hypophosphite may be the dominant p species in such cases electrochemical systems would be a better and promising alternative however systematic studies are required to identify the efficiency energy consumption and limitations of the emp process towards the removal and recovery of p from non ortho p the economic assessment in this paper only considered electricity consumption which only accounts for part of the system s cost solely p recovery could be expensive compared to commercial p production from phosphate rock therefore integrating emp of p minerals into the current wastewater treatment scheme or with other technologies could be a way to compensate for the p recovery cost for example p recovery could be combined with pollutants removal and h2 or biogas production ding et al 2021 kuntke et al 2017 song et al 2021 moreover the reactor could be redesigned to utilize by products better for example in electrochemical systems reactive chlorine species can be formed in the presence of chloride ions which could function as disinfectants varigala et al 2021 used chlorine produced in electrochemical cells for on site disinfection of treated blackwater ultimately the acceptance of the recovered product should be considered even though p recovered from wastewater usually is cleaner than p rock it may cause concerns from public and fertilizer manufacturers especially when the product is recovered from heavy metals loaded or micro organic pollutants burdened wastewater thus how to build up trust and confidence in the products is also a question needed to be answered 6 conclusion emp systems hold vast potential in removing and recovering p either ortho or non ortho p the main reasons are a it is technically feasible to remove p in wastewater to the required level and recover p as effective fertilizers through bio electrochemical precipitation b on site treatment is possible without dosing extra chemicals c the monetary cost of bio electrochemical system could be comparable with conventional p treating technologies in theory yet it is important to acknowledge that multiple factors affect the system s performance including ph current density electrode configuration and water matrix currently there are questions needed to be answered before applying emp systems at full scale such as system stability under long term operation system output under different water matrices and energy consumption of scale up reactor additionally more research is needed to improve the utilization of by products the collection of deposits the wastewater assessment for on site application and the acceptance of products of electrochemical p recovery moreover further studies are required to explore the long term operation of emp in p removal and recovery at a large scale and make the process economical and practical soundable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16383,ensuring access to water sanitation and hygiene wash for all requires a thorough understanding of the many contextual complexities that influence access to these services complexities spanning environmental economic political and social dimensions amongst others can intersect and compound to hinder sustainable access to wash for certain demographics or entire communities this is of particular importance for challenging contexts where conventional wash approaches are ineffective targeted approaches are required for these contexts to ensure that communities are not left behind in pursuit of the sustainable development goals review of wash literature identified seven broad types of challenging contexts challenging environments transient or environmentally dependant communities climate vulnerable communities remote communities poor urban communities refugee camps and emergency contexts this review explores the intersecting complexities affecting access to wash in these challenging contexts and how failure to understand the interconnectedness of these complexities has resulted in wash solutions that are unaffordable not inclusive or unsustainable to our knowledge this review is the first of its kind we emphasise the need to unpack intersecting complexities affecting wash in challenging contexts and we believe that incorporating such an approach early in wash

how these intersect limiting people from participating in community led total sanitation clts processes or from building maintaining and accessing sanitation infrastructure while intersecting complexities affect access to wash everywhere unpacking intersecting complexities may be most important in challenging contexts where access to wash is persistently lagging the term challenging contexts has been adapted from the sanitation learning hub slh n d who define these contexts as populations that cannot successfully be served by traditional sanitation and hygiene programs e g communities in flood prone areas where conventional pit latrines are inappropriate in this work we expand on the slh s definition and consider challenging contexts to be those which are hardest to reach with conventional wash approaches this means that communities in challenging contexts may be some of the most left behind as we continue to pursue sdg 6 similar terms have been used by other organisations within the wash sector the world bank water and sanitation program wsp 2011 assessed affordable sanitation options for challenging areas in cambodia and lao people s democratic republic and ide formerly international development enterprises 2019 reported on complex operational environments in bangladesh other organisations and programs have used terminology that is specific to certain elements affecting challenging contexts such as challenging environments e g bukauskas and michael 2015 djonoputro et al 2010 to our knowledge this is the first review of literature on wash in challenging contexts with an emphasis on intersecting complexities and thus it constitutes a novel and necessary contribution to the field intersecting complexities in challenging contexts were noted by tillett and jones 2021 in a recent desk review on sanitation programs for rural challenging contexts however exploration of how these intersecting complexities affect wash access was out of the scope of their research an approach which considers both intersecting complexities and the dynamics of challenging contexts has yet to be widely applied in the wash sector and there remains no documented mechanism to identify intersecting complexities and account for these in wash programs we posit that this is a critical knowledge and methodological gap which holds the key to successful provision of wash services for those hardest to reach we encourage wash practitioners to take a proactive approach in unpacking intersecting complexities in challenging contexts as failure to do so hinders affordable inclusive and sustainable wash access for all the primary intention of this review is to introduce the lens of intersecting complexities documenting and analysing how the interconnectedness of complexities affects access to wash in challenging contexts we review the wash literature to explore intersecting complexities encountered in different types of challenging contexts section 3 we then investigate how wash programs that target such complexities in isolation i e without considering their interconnections can yield solutions that are inappropriate e g due to lack of affordability inclusivity or sustainability section 4 finally we discuss the need for a holistic mechanism to unpack intersecting complexities in challenging contexts ultimately we believe this lens holds enormous potential to improve the success of wash programs in challenging contexts and provide sustainable appropriate and contextualised solutions for those currently hardest to reach 2 methods 2 1 search strategy and screening the foundation of this study is a review of literature primarily published case studies and analyses of wash programs to explore intersecting complexities encountered in different types of challenging contexts globally we present this review as a conceptual article callahan 2010 with the purpose of introducing the lens of intersecting complexities through which to examine persistent lags in wash access in challenging contexts few literature sources exist which speak directly to both challenging contexts and intersecting complexities affecting wash access therefore broad searches of scopus and google scholar were used to identify both peer reviewed and grey literature search terms specified water and sanitation in combination with terminology related to challenging contexts e g fragile contexts marginalised populations hardest to reach additional literature was identified from reference lists of key sources or from attendance at wash conferences searches were conducted between october 2020 and july 2021 only sources in english were reviewed which we acknowledge is a limitation and may exclude important sources of knowledge identified sources were reviewed for discussion of multiple and overlapping complexities affecting access to wash in challenging contexts sources which focused on a single complexity or on isolated complexities were considered out of scope over 90 sources were reviewed as part of this process approximately one third of these were grey literature sources while the remaining were peer reviewed articles 2 2 organisation of literature sources in section 3 literature sources were organised into seven broad challenging context types based on terminology used in the studies themselves challenging environments transient or environmentally dependant communities climate vulnerable communities remote or isolated communities poor urban communities refugee or internally displaced person camps and emergency contexts sources were then reviewed with an emphasis on how intersecting complexities affect wash access in these contexts we stress that the primary purpose of organising the literature sources into these context types was to provide structure to the review our goal is not to create categorisations of context types but to transcend this terminology and begin a discussion about the intersecting complexities in all challenging contexts this is important as many of the context types listed above are not mutually exclusive e g challenging environments transient communities and climate vulnerable communities as this study only considered literature on intersecting complexities in challenging contexts a relatively under researched area it is likely that other types of challenging contexts exist that are not discussed in this review furthermore a limitation of the search terms used meant that many of the sources were specific to low and middle income countries other examples of challenging contexts exist in high income countries and could include contexts as extreme as zero or low gravity we believe however that the broad range of contexts reviewed underpins a comprehensive analysis of intersecting complexities that encompasses many if not most of the contexts currently hardest to reach in section 4 examples from the literature were organised to demonstrate how inappropriate wash solutions for challenging contexts have resulted from a failure to unpack intersecting complexities three themes were identified solutions that were unaffordable not inclusive or not sustainable 3 review of intersecting complexities in challenging contexts in the following subsections we explore intersecting complexities that affect wash access in different types of challenging contexts these challenging context types are used to provide structure to this review so that we may analyse intersecting complexities in areas of literature that use similar terminology 3 1 challenging environments challenging environments e g flood prone areas water scarce areas are a broad context type and have been defined as areas where conventional wash solutions e g pit latrines are not appropriate feasible or affordable given complexities related to the physical environment bukauskas and michael 2015 djonoputro et al 2010 a wealth of studies related to wash in challenging environments exists many of which note that intersecting complexities beyond the environment influence access to wash djonoputro et al 2010 is amongst several studies which use the terminology of challenging environments the authors noted that communities in challenging environments face economic institutional and social complexities that are as critical as the technical complexities arising from the environment itself for one an increase in population density in urban centres globally has yielded an increase in riverside and coastal settlements that house migrants or marginalised community members of lower wealth status occupation in these settlements may not be strictly legal and governments may be unwilling to invest in sanitation or other infrastructure for these communities this can result in contamination from poorly planned and constructed sanitation infrastructure affecting both the health of the community and the environment djonoputro et al 2010 social and cultural norms such as attitudes toward sanitation also influence community practices particularly if there are competing priorities e g livelihoods road access access to drinking water furthermore djonoputro et al 2010 expected climate change to exacerbate many of these complexities increasing both migration to and the hazards of living in challenging environments abraham et al 2011 evaluated ecosan ecological sanitation projects in 12 countries they observed that most communities in challenging environments dealt with a combination of complexities difficult ground conditions groundwater levels lack of settlement planning water scarcity and rural development abraham et al 2011 a study conducted by ide cambodia and the human centered design innovation lab hcd ilab noted the interconnectedness of complexities related to social norms and time in challenging environments hcd ilab et al 2012 social norms around sanitation were seen to change with the seasons as annual floods limited toilet access and caused community members to return to open defecation hcd ilab et al 2012 flooding also caused environmental contamination from overflowing pits as well as road damage further limiting the accessibility of isolated communities and disrupting supply chain access and mason availability hcd ilab et al 2012 in 2015 a program for sanitation in challenging environments was initiated in cambodia by engineers without borders australia fitzgerald and romano 2019 this program focused on flood prone water scarce and floating communities i e where homes float on water at least part of the year as well as areas of hard ground and high groundwater ministry of rural development 2019 literature related to this program emphasised that those living in challenging environments are often marginalised members of society with little economic political or social security bukauskas et al 2017 these communities may have little choice but to inhabit challenging environments and hard to reach areas because of increasing population density and inadequate land planning in urban centres furthermore labour migration and particular livelihoods e g low or seasonal incomes environmentally dependant livelihoods compound complexities for communities that are already poor and vulnerable bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 these types of livelihoods make sanitation access difficult as temporary residence and fluctuating incomes can impact a person s or community s willingness to pay bukauskas et al 2017 willingness to pay in such contexts may also be influenced by a hierarchy of needs da jose and truslove 2020 emphasised the need to understand a household s priorities that may be competing with sanitation complexities related to time were also highlighted in many of these studies either because temporary settlements are less likely to invest in sanitation or because seasonal events e g flooding changes in surface water elevation affect the sanitation infrastructure needed to ensure sustainable containment and faecal sludge management bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 da jose and truslove 2020 while the above studies all refer to challenging environments specifically there is an abundance of literature on similar contexts that do not use this terminology but which could be included under this broad umbrella much of this literature also explores intersecting complexities morshed and sobhan 2010 emphasised the compounding effects of inappropriate sanitation facilities on women and adolescent girls in flood prone or waterlogged communities in bangladesh hagan et al 2012 highlighted socio economic complexities such as poverty and deep seated attitudes that influenced sanitation in floating communities in cambodia sample et al 2016 discussed complexities hindering the implementation of community led total sanitation in riverside communities in nigeria including conflict between communities and government as well as economic cultural and physical complexities these examples indicate that while environmental complexities might seem to be the primary concern multiple complexities beyond the physical environment intersect to impact wash in challenging environments 3 2 transient or environmentally dependant communities communities that are based on specific livelihoods particularly those that require migration or are inextricably linked with the environment also have multiple intersecting complexities that affect access to wash services 3 2 1 fishing communities abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 reported on fishing communities on the islands of lake victoria in eastern africa populations in these communities have increased in recent years and continued lack of government support has contributed to limited wash access the authors highlighted that the transient nature of fishing communities affects willingness to pay for permanent wash infrastructure abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 furthermore open defecation has persisted because of difficulties in construction e g due to high costs and collapsible or hard soils education levels and the presence of multiple cultures and cultural norms resulting environmental and water contamination from open defecation particularly during the rainy season ultimately affects both the health of these communities as well as their livelihoods abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 also noted that fishing communities are often geographically remote and marginalised for a variety of socioeconomic complexities this was echoed by kalumbi et al 2020 who studied the wash habits and attitudes of fishing communities around lake malombe malawi the authors attributed few policies and minimal research on wash in fishing communities to remoteness and they emphasised that these communities are often the most poor marginalised and vulnerable kalumbi et al 2020 poor wash practices were compounded by the livelihood s seasonal and migratory nature a lack of consideration for environmental factors such as sandy soils and flash floods and a lack of consideration for social and cultural norms kalumbi et al 2020 3 2 2 mining communities a recent increase in artisanal and small scale mining communities in ghana resulted from increasing gold prices and decreasing incomes from agricultural livelihoods long et al 2013 lynas et al 2019 temporary residence in mining communities is common as miners often migrate to find better opportunities lynas et al 2019 mining consumes large volumes of water and also contaminates surrounding water sources primarily with mercury or other toxic metals which cannot be detected without adequate testing long et al 2013 lynas et al 2019 this water is subsequently consumed by the community and used for household activities or religious practices contamination of water sources coupled with health and safety risks associated with the work make mining communities more vulnerable than other livelihood based communities lynas et al 2019 additionally these communities have limited sanitation coverage and no designated areas for open defecation though defecation near water sources is considered prohibited long et al 2013 mining communities are often neglected by governments or other legal efforts which fail to protect these communities or the surrounding environments long et al 2013 lynas et al 2019 lynas et al 2019 highlighted the need to understand local cultures and wash behaviours to ensure contextualised wash interventions for these communities 3 2 3 pastoralist communities pastoralist communities are nomadic and migrate frequently throughout the year often due to seasonal changes in the environment and resources e g water availability axweso 2011 studied pastoralist communities in northern tanzania and noted that members of these communities namely women and children often have to travel long distances to find adequate water sources for both the community and their livestock migration and changing seasons also affect hygiene practices amongst these communities as limited water in the dry season is needed for purposes other than washing or bathing axweso 2011 discussed the effects of colonialism on pastoralist communities as these communities are often seen as needing to modernise consequently pastoralist populations have been misunderstood and misrepresented in politics resulting in exclusion from decision making processes and few policies that adequately address the needs and priorities of these groups axweso 2011 additionally social and cultural norms affect construction and use of pit latrines often prohibiting men and women from sharing latrines because of stigma related to menstruation axweso 2011 these cultural complexities were echoed by fostvedt mills et al 2018 particularly gender norms and taboos around menstruation the authors also discussed environmental complexities such as droughts and floods financial complexities and lack of government prioritisation for pastoralist communities across eastern and southern africa fostvedt mills et al 2018 whitley et al 2019 examined wash approaches for pastoralists in the afar region of ethiopia and noted that pastoralist communities are vulnerable to climate change see section 3 3 below and various development projects exacerbating many of the intersecting complexities whitley et al 2019 stressed that wash interventions specific to pastoralist populations are few likely due to minimal understanding of this lifestyle 3 3 climate vulnerable communities communities that deal with challenging environments or that rely heavily on the surrounding environment for their livelihoods also deal with added complexities related to climate change in particular climate change is expected to exacerbate complexities for those already impacted by disproportionate access to water and sanitation environmentally challenging contexts traditionally marginalised groups within a community and people living in poverty such as informal settlements discussed in section 3 5 kohlitz and iyer 2021 megaw et al 2020 mills et al 2019 mills et al 2019 discussed the impacts of climate change on urban sanitation specifically the threats of worsening physical hazards which can damage or limit access to wash infrastructure the authors noted that marginalised or vulnerable groups will be disproportionately impacted mills et al 2019 megaw et al 2020 noted the need to account for heterogeneity amongst these marginalised groups to ensure inclusive wash responses in climate vulnerable communities the authors provided a framework to unpack the effects of climate change on inclusive wash emphasising that local knowledge is often gendered and only certain knowledge will be considered valid based on patriarchal systems megaw et al 2020 the authors also discussed indigenous groups around the world which may be displaced from their traditional lands because of climate change disrupting many of their connections to and practices with local water sources competing priorities above the need to adapt for climate change were also noted as complexities and the fact that communities may place an under or over reliance on power holders e g governments policy makers to push for climate change and wash programs megaw et al 2020 also mentioned the uncertainty and unpredictability related to climate change as physical hazards that damage wash infrastructure can develop slowly over many years e g rising sea levels causing erosion or can occur quickly e g flash floods kohlitz and iyer 2021 highlighted the interlinking pathways between climate change and its influence on sanitation they emphasised that the complexity of climate change can compound other complexities negatively impacting communities health safety and livelihoods furthermore the authors noted that climate change adaptations have not been prioritised or adequately funded in the wash sector the authors provided a framework that guides changes to planning delivery and monitoring approaches for rural sanitation and climate change programs emphasising the need to include the most vulnerable and the most affected in decision making processes kohlitz and iyer 2021 this framework demonstrated the connections between physical climate hazards social complexities and local practices e g deforestation water conservation to impact livelihoods access to resources and access to sanitation kohlitz and iyer 2021 3 4 remote or isolated communities several studies have noted intersecting complexities resulting in limited wash infrastructure coverage in geographically remote or isolated communities i e low density contexts that are removed from urban centres for example willetts et al 2017 evaluated the sanitation value chain and associated supply chains for low density remote contexts in indonesia and vietnam the authors observed intersecting complexities that were both spatial and economic in nature the most remote communities were often those with the highest rates of poverty furthermore complexities for these hard to reach communities were compounded by the change in seasons as most roads were of poor quality and became impassable during certain times of the year willetts et al 2017 o reilly et al 2017 studied remote communities in india to evaluate how complexities of both physical distance and social distance sustain open defecation the authors related physical distance to accessibility road infrastructure and environmental conditions describing physically distant communities as those which are far from urban centres and have lower levels of access to electricity health care and education social distance was defined as marginalisation of communities based on economic political social or cultural aspects o reilly et al 2017 the authors discussed the interconnectedness of physical and social remoteness and the related structural inequalities and systematic marginalisation e g due to disenfranchisement or differences in class and caste o reilly et al 2017 noted that different social groups within a community may be limited by when where and how they can defecate and geographical marginalisation of those in remote communities may result in inadequate government support both financially and politically to provide sanitation solutions remote indigenous communities in australia are another example of a challenging context with limited access to wash the office of the auditor general in western australia oag 2015 found that drinking water quality in these communities often does not meet standards up to 80 of the communities studied had unsafe levels of e coli in addition to contaminated drinking water sources torres strait islander and aboriginal peoples are often burdened with clogged wastewater treatment infrastructure and poorly maintained hygiene services hall 2019 the oag 2015 concluded that additional government support would be needed for delivery of essential services noting that costs of support were impacted by the communities geographical remoteness hall 2019 explored complexities affecting wash access in other isolated indigenous communities in australia and noted that most communities are both socially and economically marginalised many complexities were found to be interconnected in these contexts population growth and overcrowding in homes impacted hygiene behaviours and access to adequately maintained hygiene infrastructure and the remoteness of these communities contributed to a lack of maintenance and long wait times for repairs hall 2019 hall et al 2020 additionally few waste bins and cultural norms related to privacy were noted as reasons for frequent sewer and pipe blockages from non flushable items hall 2019 indigenous communities have strong ties with the lands on which they reside and consider re location at times proposed as a solution by government officials as breaking their cultural and spiritual connection to country this means that relocation is not an option should environmental contamination occur hall 2019 remote indigenous communities in canada and the united states were also noted for having lower levels of access to wash compared to the rest of the countries populations and for being disproportionately impacted by contamination or poor maintenance hall 2019 these studies all specified contexts that are geographically remote or isolated but they frequently noted that these contexts are socially remote as well indeed most if not all of the challenging context types discussed in this review could be described as socially remote furthermore these studies discussed remote communities that are also economically marginalised however complexities related to geographical remoteness can also affect access in areas where finances are less of a concern for example infrequent and costly transport of supplies or operators can impact wastewater management in antarctica zhang et al 2016 3 5 poor urban communities in contrast to geographically remote communities this challenging context type refers to communities that are or are close to urban centres and which are often densely populated populations living in poverty including factors related to income access to shelter or health care etc often have no option but to live on marginal land or in informal settlements or slums intersecting complexities can also influence wash in these contexts particularly where the urban poor are marginalised by the government or other power holders like landlords joshi et al 2011 conducted a study in bangladesh india and kenya which highlighted the heterogeneity of the urban poor many political and institutional complexities were noted particularly as many urban poor are forced to live in informal settlements or slums that are illegal or semi legal and do not have secure land tenure i e a person or community does not have the right to own the land failure to understand the complexity of the urban poor when delivering sanitation services resulted in exacerbated inequality for members of communities and households who are socially marginalised joshi et al 2011 mcgranahan 2015 examined complexities affecting sanitation in poor urban communities particularly economic political and institutional complexities that need to be tackled to provide sanitation to everyone everywhere mcgranahan 2015 stated that these complexities are compounded by the fact that people living in these contexts have low incomes which ultimately affects their level of influence on politics and public affairs the author noted that many of the institutional complexities intersect with complexities related to poverty e g low incomes social marginalisation lack of education illness political discrimination which are outside of the influence of most sanitation programs additional political and social complexities included landlord tenant relationships and land tenure where land tenure is insecure governments may be unwilling to or restricted from providing sanitation services insecure land tenure and fear of eviction may also affect residents willingness to pay for sanitation furthermore urban areas with high percentages of renters are often at the mercy of landlords who make decisions about sanitation landlords may have no interest in improving sanitation facilities or may choose to invest in sanitation only if it means they can increase rent mcgranahan 2015 mosello and o leary 2017 studied urban areas in cambodia noting that discrepancies in sanitation access remain largest between urban and rural communities as well as the highest and lowest wealth quintiles the authors found that large portions of the urban population have unequal sanitation service delivery particularly those who live at the margins of society for reasons that are deeply rooted in the economic political and social trajectory of the country p 8 examples of this included livelihoods such as low cash or temporary work as well as the complexity of social marginalisation because of gender age and disability peri urban areas were also highlighted as lagging in equal sanitation service delivery particularly informal settlements reasons for this included concerns about land tenure and discriminatory or negative attitudes from the government towards migrants the urban poor and those living in informal settlements mosello and o leary 2017 specific literature on wash in informal settlements or slums is vast and many studies have highlighted intersecting complexities affecting these complex heterogenous and high density contexts indeed pierce 2017 noted complexities that affected basic service access for four slum settlements in hyderabad india and grouped them into five categories economic spatial social political and institutional the author found that spatial and political complexities influenced service access the most slums are often located on marginal land are unregulated by the government and are underrepresented in politics meanwhile social and institutional complexities had more influence over slum formation and long term residence specifically discrimination against those of particular race ethnicity caste or religion or issues with insecure land tenure and formal settlement recognition pierce 2017 sinharoy et al 2019 built on pierce s categories in a review of academic and grey literature for drivers and barriers of wash policies in urban informal settlements the authors added a category for informational complexities such as lack of data or indicators for informal settlements sinharoy et al 2019 the authors also noted that informal settlements affected by environmental complexities such as high water table collapsible soils or risk of natural hazards may experience compounded concerns related to wash sinharoy et al 2019 3 6 refugee or internally displaced person camps other types of challenging contexts are refugee camps or internally displaced person camps where intersecting complexities affect service provision cronin et al 2008 conducted a global review of wash in refugee camps and noted that these camps are often located on marginal land with complexities related to the environment security seasonal changes in water supply and limited financial resources for humanitarian organisations focused on providing wash attitudes and wash practices were linked to refugees origins people from rural or nomadic areas had less knowledge of the importance of hygiene in densely populated settings cronin et al 2008 indeed biran et al 2012 studied sanitation and hygiene practices in long term refugee camps and found that people from rural communities were more likely to practice open defecation than people from urban communities additionally the authors found that open defecation practices were gendered as more women practiced open defecation than men in refugee camps in ethiopia biran et al 2012 biran et al 2012 stressed the need to account for place of origin education level and available household funds when considering wash interventions for refugee camps time can play a particularly key role in the initial development of such camps in emergency situations van der helm et al 2017 described the zaatari refugee camp in jordan and how water and sanitation infrastructure transitioned from the emergency phase to post emergency sustainability the authors noted that concerns about health and environmental safety inequality and operation and maintenance needs arose because of increasing population density fast camp expansion and the repurposing of construction materials for household wash facilities van der helm et al 2017 social and or cultural complexities related to coping mechanisms during times of crises were noted for exacerbating inequalities in wash access van der helm et al 2017 furthermore the legal status of both refugees and humanitarian organisations in a host country were highlighted as impacting conventional wash programs the authors discussed urban wash service delivery approaches that were considered for zaatari with notable contextual differences to account for inadequate resources and uncertain timeframes van der helm et al 2017 3 7 emergency contexts emergency contexts could refer to areas of conflict contexts dealing with natural disasters or communities affected by disease outbreak yates et al 2018 in this way emergency contexts can overlap with several of the abovementioned challenging context types including refugee camps or areas that have been affected by climate related disasters yates et al 2018 conducted a systematic review on wash interventions for emergencies in low and middle income countries they noted that while emergency situations call for prioritisation of immediate assistance over long term sustainability effectiveness of wash interventions still depend on contextual factors particularly social and cultural preferences yates et al 2018 krishnan 2019 reported on the relief efforts in odisha india after cyclone phailin in 2013 and found that many wash interventions had not been appropriate for the local context cultural attitudes and preferences meant that large portions of the communities continued practicing open defecation and several communities prioritised sanitation below the need to restore houses or livelihoods krishnan 2019 richard and kiani 2019 noted that some social groups are often excluded in recovery efforts specifically people with disabilities or the elderly the authors conducted a rapid review on the inclusion of disability and older age in humanitarian wash interventions and highlighted that emergency contexts often ignore the needs of these demographics because of multiple social environmental and institutional complexities richard and kiani 2019 similar to the effects of climate change relief for emergency and disaster situations may be felt disproportionately by vulnerable and marginalised populations disease outbreak can also constitute an emergency and can exacerbate existing complexities in challenging contexts the onset of covid 19 for example has added complexity to wash programs and compounded concerns for those already impacted by unequal access to water and sanitation emergency response was delayed because of lockdown restrictions after tropical cyclone harold hit vanuatu the solomon islands fiji and tonga in april 2020 du parc and spieth 2020 health concerns due to contaminated water sources poor sanitation and limited hygiene infrastructure after the cyclone were further exacerbated by the threat of covid transmission du parc and spieth 2020 in a study of 25 countries in sub saharan africa ekumah et al 2020 expected that communities with existing inequalities in wash would have increased vulnerability to covid 19 the authors suggested that those in challenging contexts such as informal settlements would have to break lockdown procedures to access services like water and sanitation ekumah et al 2020 bennett et al 2020 also highlighted the vulnerability of fishing communities to covid 19 not only did the pandemic increase health risks for these communities but it also greatly affected their livelihoods because of disruptions to the economy the authors noted that political economic social environmental and climatic conditions intersect to exacerbate effects of covid 19 particularly for the most vulnerable bennett et al 2020 p 339 3 8 common complexities for each challenging context type the previous sections demonstrated that many of the challenging context types overlap this is shown in table 1 literature sources are numbered in the leftmost column in the order in which they were discussed check marks indicate where the sources align to different types of challenging contexts shown in the top rows because the challenging context types are not mutually exclusive we offer instead the lens of intersecting complexities to examine persistent lags in wash access in any challenging context many complexities discussed in this review are common across the challenging context types however an exhaustive list of complexities affecting wash access in all challenging contexts may not be possible for this reason we simplify discussion of complexities by grouping them into six broad dimensions which were formed during the review table 2 a short list of the most common complexities discussed in this review is provided in tables 3 and 4 complexities are listed in the leftmost column grouped as per the six dimensions of complexity outlined in table 2 numbers coinciding to literature sources in table 1 indicate where the complexities align to specific studies and different types of challenging contexts it should be noted that grouping of complexities into specific dimensions is somewhat subjective some literature sources grouped complexities into similar dimensions and remaining complexities have been grouped based on our own interpretations importantly use of the six dimensions to unpack complexities is intended to enable further discussion of these complexities and their interconnections rather than serving as an end point for analysing the complexities in different challenging contexts we stress that the grouping of complexities into specific dimensions is less important than unpacking the interconnections between complexities themselves 4 the effects of intersecting complexities on appropriate solutions our review demonstrates that every type of challenging context has multiple complexities which affect access to wash furthermore many of these complexities are inextricably linked with each other indicating that a solution that tackles isolated complexities is unlikely to be appropriate many of the studies reviewed discussed persistent challenges in ensuring appropriate wash solutions for challenging contexts in many cases these persistent challenges were because of a lack of understanding of interconnections between complexities in challenging contexts for example joshi et al 2011 noted the frustration of the urban poor who felt that sanitation programs provided inappropriate solutions that didn t account for local norms religious beliefs questions about citizenship status insecure land tenure or the community s motivations for investing in sanitation the authors contended that sanitation provision is often dictated by policies or sector conventions that are far removed from local level needs and socio cultural practices joshi et al 2011 p 102 the reviewed literature often noted that wash solutions for challenging contexts were inappropriate for communities predominantly because of questions related to affordability inclusivity and sustainability these three issues are further explored in sections 4 1 to 4 3 4 1 solutions that are unaffordable for a community technological sanitation solutions designed specifically for challenging environments are consistently and unsurprisingly described as more expensive than conventional sanitation solutions e g pit latrines bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 tillett and jones 2021 adapted conventional solutions e g raised latrines for flood prone areas are also more expensive because of additional materials and labour requirements hcd ilab et al 2012 in remote locations these costs may increase further remote areas already have higher costs for sanitation infrastructure compared to urban centres because of costs for transportation and labour abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 o reilly et al 2017 willetts et al 2017 ultimately solutions for challenging contexts have been unaffordable for communities that are typically described as poor bukauskas et al 2017 willetts et al 2017 while it has been widely discussed that wash solutions need to be accompanied by financial support mechanisms these mechanisms often depend on either government subsidies or donor investments these may falter due to discriminatory attitudes or lack of priority and lack of continued financial support after implementation may limit long term sustainability bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 joshi et al 2011 tillett and jones 2021 examples of subsidies for sanitation in remote communities showed that these did not cover even a quarter of the cost of a latrine which the community attributed to corruption and discrimination against the poor o reilly et al 2017 other examples have relied on a community s willingness to pay for sanitation but did not account for lack of land tenure residents are unlikely to invest in sanitation when they may be evicted without notice joshi et al 2011 mcgranahan 2015 these examples suggest that limited consideration of intersecting complexities affecting challenging contexts can result in unaffordable wash solutions which inadvertently discriminate against the poor who often have to pay the most for essential services pierce 2017 4 2 solutions that are not inclusive of all members of a community lack of appropriate wash services disproportionately affects people who are discriminated based on gender age disability health status and more simavi 2018 wateraid 2018 wash services need to be safe equitable and non discriminatory accounting for accessibility needs cultural practices and menstrual hygiene management cohre et al 2008 exclusion of people from equitable access persists for a variety of reasons mosello and o leary 2017 noted that persistent exclusion in sanitation service delivery was due to sector specific structural and systemic factors and incentives behaviours and power relations that hinder progress p 7 mcgranahan 2015 stated that the reason that sanitation standards often fail to benefit those most in need derives from the nature of standards and the ways in which even standards applied equally can have inequitable consequences p 247 furthermore the complexity of challenging contexts means that appropriately inclusive wash is often not prioritise richard and kiani 2019 tillett and jones 2021 lack of inclusion in wash programs may be deliberate or inadvertent and can be affected by donor priorities limited budgets lack of inclusive programming within an organisation or lack of national strategies or policies joshi et al 2011 tillett and jones 2021 ultimately addressing access to wash in challenging contexts may still leave certain communities or members of the community behind furthermore those who are marginalised for multiple reasons may experience exacerbated inequalities and be excluded from seemingly inclusive wash simavi 2018 discussed the added complexities of geography formality of an area e g informal settlements and wealth quintiles on traditionally marginalised groups such as women in informal settlements who are discriminated based on gender as well as land tenure status other studies have emphasised women and girls in mining communities or flood prone areas who experience similar inequalities lynas et al 2019 morshed and sobhan 2010 there is a need to consider intersectionality in wash programs soeters et al 2019 wateraid 2018 and particularly for challenging contexts indeed a number of studies listed in this review have discussed intersectionality specifically related to wash and or climate change e g megaw et al 2020 richard and kiani 2019 tillett and jones 2021 intersectionality emphasises the compounding effects felt by those who are marginalised for multiple aspects of their identity e g race gender class and many others cho et al 2013 may 2015 the need for intersectionality to inform wash may also be more nuanced heterogeneity within certain demographics or changes in age or stage in life can affect wash needs e g women while menstruating or pregnant simavi 2018 4 3 solutions that are not sustainable long term sustainability can be hindered by lack of continuous financial support as mentioned in section 4 1 bukauskas and michael 2015 joshi et al 2011 tillett and jones 2021 or affected by deep seated attitudes around wash some lifestyles or livelihoods mean that open defecation is the traditional norm and simpler than constructing permanent infrastructure kalumbi et al 2020 whitley et al 2019 inappropriate and or undesirable solutions may not be used by the community joshi et al 2011 and solutions for environmentally challenging contexts may require more maintenance and frequent replacement bukauskas et al 2017 additionally wash services for contexts that are remote or difficult to access may mean that adequate monitoring and evaluation is not possible bukauskas et al 2017 fostvedt mills et al 2018 hall 2019 adequate faecal sludge management is needed to ensure sustainable sanitation services faecal sludge management fsm ensures that faecal sludge from onsite sanitation technologies i e technologies that are not connected to a sewer and therefore store waste onsite is safely and sustainably stored collected transported treated and either disposed or reused strande 2014 sustainable fsm is still a challenge around the world and may be further complicated in challenging contexts particularly if there are no policies or national strategies in place bukauskas et al 2017 ensuring wash solutions are sustainable requires a thorough understanding of intersecting complexities in challenging contexts 5 conclusions challenging contexts are those which are hardest to reach with conventional wash approaches access to wash services in challenging contexts is complex ensuring that communities in challenging contexts are not left behind in pursuit of sustainable development goal 6 means that intersecting complexities affecting wash access in these contexts need to be considered in this paper we introduce the lens of intersecting complexities and review literature on wash in challenging contexts to explore how complexities intersect and compound to affect access to wash this review has demonstrated that limited understanding or consideration of the interconnectedness of complexities affecting wash access can result in solutions that are inappropriate this suggests a clear and urgent need for a holistic mechanism to unpack intersecting complexities in challenging contexts despite many good examples of studies that unearthed intersecting complexities in particular contexts our review found that no such approach yet exists to guide wash practitioners in identifying and accounting for intersecting complexities in the planning design and delivery of wash programs while it is likely that no solution could overcome every complexity affecting wash access in challenging contexts a proactive approach for identifying intersecting complexities and accounting for these in the early stages of wash programs is we argue critical for ensuring the provision of appropriate and contextualised wash solutions we believe that the development and validation of a practical approach to unpack intersecting complexities can help tackle persistent and contextual inequalities in wash access across a wide array of settings in the meantime we encourage practitioners to 1 explore possible complexities in each dimension 2 consider how these complexities might intersect within as well as across dimensions and 3 consider how the temporal dimension i e change over time might influence and compound complexities or introduce new complexities to affect wash access our objective is to strengthen wash approaches for challenging contexts and provide practitioners policy makers and communities with the means to achieve wider and more affordable inclusive and sustainable wash services we believe that considering intersecting complexities is critical to ensuring wash solutions and programs are appropriate for those who are hardest to reach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
16383,ensuring access to water sanitation and hygiene wash for all requires a thorough understanding of the many contextual complexities that influence access to these services complexities spanning environmental economic political and social dimensions amongst others can intersect and compound to hinder sustainable access to wash for certain demographics or entire communities this is of particular importance for challenging contexts where conventional wash approaches are ineffective targeted approaches are required for these contexts to ensure that communities are not left behind in pursuit of the sustainable development goals review of wash literature identified seven broad types of challenging contexts challenging environments transient or environmentally dependant communities climate vulnerable communities remote communities poor urban communities refugee camps and emergency contexts this review explores the intersecting complexities affecting access to wash in these challenging contexts and how failure to understand the interconnectedness of these complexities has resulted in wash solutions that are unaffordable not inclusive or unsustainable to our knowledge this review is the first of its kind we emphasise the need to unpack intersecting complexities affecting wash in challenging contexts and we believe that incorporating such an approach early in wash programs can ensure that intersecting complexities are accounted for in the design of wash solutions ultimately this novel lens may provide critical guidance for wash programs in challenging contexts ensuring that wash solutions are contextually appropriate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wash sanitation challenging contexts challenging environments appropriate technology intersectionality 1 introduction global access to water sanitation and hygiene wash services has increased significantly in recent years however progress is still needed to ensure available and sustainably managed services for all by 2030 and achieve sustainable development goal sdg 6 as of 2017 2 2 billion people globally still lacked access to safely managed drinking water 4 2 billion lacked access to safely managed sanitation and 3 0 billion lacked access to basic home handwashing services united nations 2020 the sdgs emphasise access for all with a focus on the most marginalised and vulnerable cavill et al 2016 united nations 2020 ensuring no one is left behind requires targeted programs for communities that are continually lagging in access to wash services access to wash is affected by contextual complexities which span environmental economic social and political dimensions amongst others examples of complexities can include water scarcity flooding or other natural hazards environmental complexities financing income levels or livelihoods economic complexities social and cultural norms or lifestyles social complexities and land availability legal rights or government support political complexities we use the term complexities to limit any immediate implication of a deficit as opposed to other terms prevalent in literature on wash including disadvantages e g house et al 2017 barriers e g sinharoy et al 2019 or challenges e g djonoputro et al 2010 while complexities may seem distinct or isolated this review outlines how they often intersect and many are likely to have a compounding effect intersecting complexities and their influence on wash access have been investigated by house et al 2017 who organised clusters of disadvantage to demonstrate how these intersect limiting people from participating in community led total sanitation clts processes or from building maintaining and accessing sanitation infrastructure while intersecting complexities affect access to wash everywhere unpacking intersecting complexities may be most important in challenging contexts where access to wash is persistently lagging the term challenging contexts has been adapted from the sanitation learning hub slh n d who define these contexts as populations that cannot successfully be served by traditional sanitation and hygiene programs e g communities in flood prone areas where conventional pit latrines are inappropriate in this work we expand on the slh s definition and consider challenging contexts to be those which are hardest to reach with conventional wash approaches this means that communities in challenging contexts may be some of the most left behind as we continue to pursue sdg 6 similar terms have been used by other organisations within the wash sector the world bank water and sanitation program wsp 2011 assessed affordable sanitation options for challenging areas in cambodia and lao people s democratic republic and ide formerly international development enterprises 2019 reported on complex operational environments in bangladesh other organisations and programs have used terminology that is specific to certain elements affecting challenging contexts such as challenging environments e g bukauskas and michael 2015 djonoputro et al 2010 to our knowledge this is the first review of literature on wash in challenging contexts with an emphasis on intersecting complexities and thus it constitutes a novel and necessary contribution to the field intersecting complexities in challenging contexts were noted by tillett and jones 2021 in a recent desk review on sanitation programs for rural challenging contexts however exploration of how these intersecting complexities affect wash access was out of the scope of their research an approach which considers both intersecting complexities and the dynamics of challenging contexts has yet to be widely applied in the wash sector and there remains no documented mechanism to identify intersecting complexities and account for these in wash programs we posit that this is a critical knowledge and methodological gap which holds the key to successful provision of wash services for those hardest to reach we encourage wash practitioners to take a proactive approach in unpacking intersecting complexities in challenging contexts as failure to do so hinders affordable inclusive and sustainable wash access for all the primary intention of this review is to introduce the lens of intersecting complexities documenting and analysing how the interconnectedness of complexities affects access to wash in challenging contexts we review the wash literature to explore intersecting complexities encountered in different types of challenging contexts section 3 we then investigate how wash programs that target such complexities in isolation i e without considering their interconnections can yield solutions that are inappropriate e g due to lack of affordability inclusivity or sustainability section 4 finally we discuss the need for a holistic mechanism to unpack intersecting complexities in challenging contexts ultimately we believe this lens holds enormous potential to improve the success of wash programs in challenging contexts and provide sustainable appropriate and contextualised solutions for those currently hardest to reach 2 methods 2 1 search strategy and screening the foundation of this study is a review of literature primarily published case studies and analyses of wash programs to explore intersecting complexities encountered in different types of challenging contexts globally we present this review as a conceptual article callahan 2010 with the purpose of introducing the lens of intersecting complexities through which to examine persistent lags in wash access in challenging contexts few literature sources exist which speak directly to both challenging contexts and intersecting complexities affecting wash access therefore broad searches of scopus and google scholar were used to identify both peer reviewed and grey literature search terms specified water and sanitation in combination with terminology related to challenging contexts e g fragile contexts marginalised populations hardest to reach additional literature was identified from reference lists of key sources or from attendance at wash conferences searches were conducted between october 2020 and july 2021 only sources in english were reviewed which we acknowledge is a limitation and may exclude important sources of knowledge identified sources were reviewed for discussion of multiple and overlapping complexities affecting access to wash in challenging contexts sources which focused on a single complexity or on isolated complexities were considered out of scope over 90 sources were reviewed as part of this process approximately one third of these were grey literature sources while the remaining were peer reviewed articles 2 2 organisation of literature sources in section 3 literature sources were organised into seven broad challenging context types based on terminology used in the studies themselves challenging environments transient or environmentally dependant communities climate vulnerable communities remote or isolated communities poor urban communities refugee or internally displaced person camps and emergency contexts sources were then reviewed with an emphasis on how intersecting complexities affect wash access in these contexts we stress that the primary purpose of organising the literature sources into these context types was to provide structure to the review our goal is not to create categorisations of context types but to transcend this terminology and begin a discussion about the intersecting complexities in all challenging contexts this is important as many of the context types listed above are not mutually exclusive e g challenging environments transient communities and climate vulnerable communities as this study only considered literature on intersecting complexities in challenging contexts a relatively under researched area it is likely that other types of challenging contexts exist that are not discussed in this review furthermore a limitation of the search terms used meant that many of the sources were specific to low and middle income countries other examples of challenging contexts exist in high income countries and could include contexts as extreme as zero or low gravity we believe however that the broad range of contexts reviewed underpins a comprehensive analysis of intersecting complexities that encompasses many if not most of the contexts currently hardest to reach in section 4 examples from the literature were organised to demonstrate how inappropriate wash solutions for challenging contexts have resulted from a failure to unpack intersecting complexities three themes were identified solutions that were unaffordable not inclusive or not sustainable 3 review of intersecting complexities in challenging contexts in the following subsections we explore intersecting complexities that affect wash access in different types of challenging contexts these challenging context types are used to provide structure to this review so that we may analyse intersecting complexities in areas of literature that use similar terminology 3 1 challenging environments challenging environments e g flood prone areas water scarce areas are a broad context type and have been defined as areas where conventional wash solutions e g pit latrines are not appropriate feasible or affordable given complexities related to the physical environment bukauskas and michael 2015 djonoputro et al 2010 a wealth of studies related to wash in challenging environments exists many of which note that intersecting complexities beyond the environment influence access to wash djonoputro et al 2010 is amongst several studies which use the terminology of challenging environments the authors noted that communities in challenging environments face economic institutional and social complexities that are as critical as the technical complexities arising from the environment itself for one an increase in population density in urban centres globally has yielded an increase in riverside and coastal settlements that house migrants or marginalised community members of lower wealth status occupation in these settlements may not be strictly legal and governments may be unwilling to invest in sanitation or other infrastructure for these communities this can result in contamination from poorly planned and constructed sanitation infrastructure affecting both the health of the community and the environment djonoputro et al 2010 social and cultural norms such as attitudes toward sanitation also influence community practices particularly if there are competing priorities e g livelihoods road access access to drinking water furthermore djonoputro et al 2010 expected climate change to exacerbate many of these complexities increasing both migration to and the hazards of living in challenging environments abraham et al 2011 evaluated ecosan ecological sanitation projects in 12 countries they observed that most communities in challenging environments dealt with a combination of complexities difficult ground conditions groundwater levels lack of settlement planning water scarcity and rural development abraham et al 2011 a study conducted by ide cambodia and the human centered design innovation lab hcd ilab noted the interconnectedness of complexities related to social norms and time in challenging environments hcd ilab et al 2012 social norms around sanitation were seen to change with the seasons as annual floods limited toilet access and caused community members to return to open defecation hcd ilab et al 2012 flooding also caused environmental contamination from overflowing pits as well as road damage further limiting the accessibility of isolated communities and disrupting supply chain access and mason availability hcd ilab et al 2012 in 2015 a program for sanitation in challenging environments was initiated in cambodia by engineers without borders australia fitzgerald and romano 2019 this program focused on flood prone water scarce and floating communities i e where homes float on water at least part of the year as well as areas of hard ground and high groundwater ministry of rural development 2019 literature related to this program emphasised that those living in challenging environments are often marginalised members of society with little economic political or social security bukauskas et al 2017 these communities may have little choice but to inhabit challenging environments and hard to reach areas because of increasing population density and inadequate land planning in urban centres furthermore labour migration and particular livelihoods e g low or seasonal incomes environmentally dependant livelihoods compound complexities for communities that are already poor and vulnerable bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 these types of livelihoods make sanitation access difficult as temporary residence and fluctuating incomes can impact a person s or community s willingness to pay bukauskas et al 2017 willingness to pay in such contexts may also be influenced by a hierarchy of needs da jose and truslove 2020 emphasised the need to understand a household s priorities that may be competing with sanitation complexities related to time were also highlighted in many of these studies either because temporary settlements are less likely to invest in sanitation or because seasonal events e g flooding changes in surface water elevation affect the sanitation infrastructure needed to ensure sustainable containment and faecal sludge management bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 da jose and truslove 2020 while the above studies all refer to challenging environments specifically there is an abundance of literature on similar contexts that do not use this terminology but which could be included under this broad umbrella much of this literature also explores intersecting complexities morshed and sobhan 2010 emphasised the compounding effects of inappropriate sanitation facilities on women and adolescent girls in flood prone or waterlogged communities in bangladesh hagan et al 2012 highlighted socio economic complexities such as poverty and deep seated attitudes that influenced sanitation in floating communities in cambodia sample et al 2016 discussed complexities hindering the implementation of community led total sanitation in riverside communities in nigeria including conflict between communities and government as well as economic cultural and physical complexities these examples indicate that while environmental complexities might seem to be the primary concern multiple complexities beyond the physical environment intersect to impact wash in challenging environments 3 2 transient or environmentally dependant communities communities that are based on specific livelihoods particularly those that require migration or are inextricably linked with the environment also have multiple intersecting complexities that affect access to wash services 3 2 1 fishing communities abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 reported on fishing communities on the islands of lake victoria in eastern africa populations in these communities have increased in recent years and continued lack of government support has contributed to limited wash access the authors highlighted that the transient nature of fishing communities affects willingness to pay for permanent wash infrastructure abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 furthermore open defecation has persisted because of difficulties in construction e g due to high costs and collapsible or hard soils education levels and the presence of multiple cultures and cultural norms resulting environmental and water contamination from open defecation particularly during the rainy season ultimately affects both the health of these communities as well as their livelihoods abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 also noted that fishing communities are often geographically remote and marginalised for a variety of socioeconomic complexities this was echoed by kalumbi et al 2020 who studied the wash habits and attitudes of fishing communities around lake malombe malawi the authors attributed few policies and minimal research on wash in fishing communities to remoteness and they emphasised that these communities are often the most poor marginalised and vulnerable kalumbi et al 2020 poor wash practices were compounded by the livelihood s seasonal and migratory nature a lack of consideration for environmental factors such as sandy soils and flash floods and a lack of consideration for social and cultural norms kalumbi et al 2020 3 2 2 mining communities a recent increase in artisanal and small scale mining communities in ghana resulted from increasing gold prices and decreasing incomes from agricultural livelihoods long et al 2013 lynas et al 2019 temporary residence in mining communities is common as miners often migrate to find better opportunities lynas et al 2019 mining consumes large volumes of water and also contaminates surrounding water sources primarily with mercury or other toxic metals which cannot be detected without adequate testing long et al 2013 lynas et al 2019 this water is subsequently consumed by the community and used for household activities or religious practices contamination of water sources coupled with health and safety risks associated with the work make mining communities more vulnerable than other livelihood based communities lynas et al 2019 additionally these communities have limited sanitation coverage and no designated areas for open defecation though defecation near water sources is considered prohibited long et al 2013 mining communities are often neglected by governments or other legal efforts which fail to protect these communities or the surrounding environments long et al 2013 lynas et al 2019 lynas et al 2019 highlighted the need to understand local cultures and wash behaviours to ensure contextualised wash interventions for these communities 3 2 3 pastoralist communities pastoralist communities are nomadic and migrate frequently throughout the year often due to seasonal changes in the environment and resources e g water availability axweso 2011 studied pastoralist communities in northern tanzania and noted that members of these communities namely women and children often have to travel long distances to find adequate water sources for both the community and their livestock migration and changing seasons also affect hygiene practices amongst these communities as limited water in the dry season is needed for purposes other than washing or bathing axweso 2011 discussed the effects of colonialism on pastoralist communities as these communities are often seen as needing to modernise consequently pastoralist populations have been misunderstood and misrepresented in politics resulting in exclusion from decision making processes and few policies that adequately address the needs and priorities of these groups axweso 2011 additionally social and cultural norms affect construction and use of pit latrines often prohibiting men and women from sharing latrines because of stigma related to menstruation axweso 2011 these cultural complexities were echoed by fostvedt mills et al 2018 particularly gender norms and taboos around menstruation the authors also discussed environmental complexities such as droughts and floods financial complexities and lack of government prioritisation for pastoralist communities across eastern and southern africa fostvedt mills et al 2018 whitley et al 2019 examined wash approaches for pastoralists in the afar region of ethiopia and noted that pastoralist communities are vulnerable to climate change see section 3 3 below and various development projects exacerbating many of the intersecting complexities whitley et al 2019 stressed that wash interventions specific to pastoralist populations are few likely due to minimal understanding of this lifestyle 3 3 climate vulnerable communities communities that deal with challenging environments or that rely heavily on the surrounding environment for their livelihoods also deal with added complexities related to climate change in particular climate change is expected to exacerbate complexities for those already impacted by disproportionate access to water and sanitation environmentally challenging contexts traditionally marginalised groups within a community and people living in poverty such as informal settlements discussed in section 3 5 kohlitz and iyer 2021 megaw et al 2020 mills et al 2019 mills et al 2019 discussed the impacts of climate change on urban sanitation specifically the threats of worsening physical hazards which can damage or limit access to wash infrastructure the authors noted that marginalised or vulnerable groups will be disproportionately impacted mills et al 2019 megaw et al 2020 noted the need to account for heterogeneity amongst these marginalised groups to ensure inclusive wash responses in climate vulnerable communities the authors provided a framework to unpack the effects of climate change on inclusive wash emphasising that local knowledge is often gendered and only certain knowledge will be considered valid based on patriarchal systems megaw et al 2020 the authors also discussed indigenous groups around the world which may be displaced from their traditional lands because of climate change disrupting many of their connections to and practices with local water sources competing priorities above the need to adapt for climate change were also noted as complexities and the fact that communities may place an under or over reliance on power holders e g governments policy makers to push for climate change and wash programs megaw et al 2020 also mentioned the uncertainty and unpredictability related to climate change as physical hazards that damage wash infrastructure can develop slowly over many years e g rising sea levels causing erosion or can occur quickly e g flash floods kohlitz and iyer 2021 highlighted the interlinking pathways between climate change and its influence on sanitation they emphasised that the complexity of climate change can compound other complexities negatively impacting communities health safety and livelihoods furthermore the authors noted that climate change adaptations have not been prioritised or adequately funded in the wash sector the authors provided a framework that guides changes to planning delivery and monitoring approaches for rural sanitation and climate change programs emphasising the need to include the most vulnerable and the most affected in decision making processes kohlitz and iyer 2021 this framework demonstrated the connections between physical climate hazards social complexities and local practices e g deforestation water conservation to impact livelihoods access to resources and access to sanitation kohlitz and iyer 2021 3 4 remote or isolated communities several studies have noted intersecting complexities resulting in limited wash infrastructure coverage in geographically remote or isolated communities i e low density contexts that are removed from urban centres for example willetts et al 2017 evaluated the sanitation value chain and associated supply chains for low density remote contexts in indonesia and vietnam the authors observed intersecting complexities that were both spatial and economic in nature the most remote communities were often those with the highest rates of poverty furthermore complexities for these hard to reach communities were compounded by the change in seasons as most roads were of poor quality and became impassable during certain times of the year willetts et al 2017 o reilly et al 2017 studied remote communities in india to evaluate how complexities of both physical distance and social distance sustain open defecation the authors related physical distance to accessibility road infrastructure and environmental conditions describing physically distant communities as those which are far from urban centres and have lower levels of access to electricity health care and education social distance was defined as marginalisation of communities based on economic political social or cultural aspects o reilly et al 2017 the authors discussed the interconnectedness of physical and social remoteness and the related structural inequalities and systematic marginalisation e g due to disenfranchisement or differences in class and caste o reilly et al 2017 noted that different social groups within a community may be limited by when where and how they can defecate and geographical marginalisation of those in remote communities may result in inadequate government support both financially and politically to provide sanitation solutions remote indigenous communities in australia are another example of a challenging context with limited access to wash the office of the auditor general in western australia oag 2015 found that drinking water quality in these communities often does not meet standards up to 80 of the communities studied had unsafe levels of e coli in addition to contaminated drinking water sources torres strait islander and aboriginal peoples are often burdened with clogged wastewater treatment infrastructure and poorly maintained hygiene services hall 2019 the oag 2015 concluded that additional government support would be needed for delivery of essential services noting that costs of support were impacted by the communities geographical remoteness hall 2019 explored complexities affecting wash access in other isolated indigenous communities in australia and noted that most communities are both socially and economically marginalised many complexities were found to be interconnected in these contexts population growth and overcrowding in homes impacted hygiene behaviours and access to adequately maintained hygiene infrastructure and the remoteness of these communities contributed to a lack of maintenance and long wait times for repairs hall 2019 hall et al 2020 additionally few waste bins and cultural norms related to privacy were noted as reasons for frequent sewer and pipe blockages from non flushable items hall 2019 indigenous communities have strong ties with the lands on which they reside and consider re location at times proposed as a solution by government officials as breaking their cultural and spiritual connection to country this means that relocation is not an option should environmental contamination occur hall 2019 remote indigenous communities in canada and the united states were also noted for having lower levels of access to wash compared to the rest of the countries populations and for being disproportionately impacted by contamination or poor maintenance hall 2019 these studies all specified contexts that are geographically remote or isolated but they frequently noted that these contexts are socially remote as well indeed most if not all of the challenging context types discussed in this review could be described as socially remote furthermore these studies discussed remote communities that are also economically marginalised however complexities related to geographical remoteness can also affect access in areas where finances are less of a concern for example infrequent and costly transport of supplies or operators can impact wastewater management in antarctica zhang et al 2016 3 5 poor urban communities in contrast to geographically remote communities this challenging context type refers to communities that are or are close to urban centres and which are often densely populated populations living in poverty including factors related to income access to shelter or health care etc often have no option but to live on marginal land or in informal settlements or slums intersecting complexities can also influence wash in these contexts particularly where the urban poor are marginalised by the government or other power holders like landlords joshi et al 2011 conducted a study in bangladesh india and kenya which highlighted the heterogeneity of the urban poor many political and institutional complexities were noted particularly as many urban poor are forced to live in informal settlements or slums that are illegal or semi legal and do not have secure land tenure i e a person or community does not have the right to own the land failure to understand the complexity of the urban poor when delivering sanitation services resulted in exacerbated inequality for members of communities and households who are socially marginalised joshi et al 2011 mcgranahan 2015 examined complexities affecting sanitation in poor urban communities particularly economic political and institutional complexities that need to be tackled to provide sanitation to everyone everywhere mcgranahan 2015 stated that these complexities are compounded by the fact that people living in these contexts have low incomes which ultimately affects their level of influence on politics and public affairs the author noted that many of the institutional complexities intersect with complexities related to poverty e g low incomes social marginalisation lack of education illness political discrimination which are outside of the influence of most sanitation programs additional political and social complexities included landlord tenant relationships and land tenure where land tenure is insecure governments may be unwilling to or restricted from providing sanitation services insecure land tenure and fear of eviction may also affect residents willingness to pay for sanitation furthermore urban areas with high percentages of renters are often at the mercy of landlords who make decisions about sanitation landlords may have no interest in improving sanitation facilities or may choose to invest in sanitation only if it means they can increase rent mcgranahan 2015 mosello and o leary 2017 studied urban areas in cambodia noting that discrepancies in sanitation access remain largest between urban and rural communities as well as the highest and lowest wealth quintiles the authors found that large portions of the urban population have unequal sanitation service delivery particularly those who live at the margins of society for reasons that are deeply rooted in the economic political and social trajectory of the country p 8 examples of this included livelihoods such as low cash or temporary work as well as the complexity of social marginalisation because of gender age and disability peri urban areas were also highlighted as lagging in equal sanitation service delivery particularly informal settlements reasons for this included concerns about land tenure and discriminatory or negative attitudes from the government towards migrants the urban poor and those living in informal settlements mosello and o leary 2017 specific literature on wash in informal settlements or slums is vast and many studies have highlighted intersecting complexities affecting these complex heterogenous and high density contexts indeed pierce 2017 noted complexities that affected basic service access for four slum settlements in hyderabad india and grouped them into five categories economic spatial social political and institutional the author found that spatial and political complexities influenced service access the most slums are often located on marginal land are unregulated by the government and are underrepresented in politics meanwhile social and institutional complexities had more influence over slum formation and long term residence specifically discrimination against those of particular race ethnicity caste or religion or issues with insecure land tenure and formal settlement recognition pierce 2017 sinharoy et al 2019 built on pierce s categories in a review of academic and grey literature for drivers and barriers of wash policies in urban informal settlements the authors added a category for informational complexities such as lack of data or indicators for informal settlements sinharoy et al 2019 the authors also noted that informal settlements affected by environmental complexities such as high water table collapsible soils or risk of natural hazards may experience compounded concerns related to wash sinharoy et al 2019 3 6 refugee or internally displaced person camps other types of challenging contexts are refugee camps or internally displaced person camps where intersecting complexities affect service provision cronin et al 2008 conducted a global review of wash in refugee camps and noted that these camps are often located on marginal land with complexities related to the environment security seasonal changes in water supply and limited financial resources for humanitarian organisations focused on providing wash attitudes and wash practices were linked to refugees origins people from rural or nomadic areas had less knowledge of the importance of hygiene in densely populated settings cronin et al 2008 indeed biran et al 2012 studied sanitation and hygiene practices in long term refugee camps and found that people from rural communities were more likely to practice open defecation than people from urban communities additionally the authors found that open defecation practices were gendered as more women practiced open defecation than men in refugee camps in ethiopia biran et al 2012 biran et al 2012 stressed the need to account for place of origin education level and available household funds when considering wash interventions for refugee camps time can play a particularly key role in the initial development of such camps in emergency situations van der helm et al 2017 described the zaatari refugee camp in jordan and how water and sanitation infrastructure transitioned from the emergency phase to post emergency sustainability the authors noted that concerns about health and environmental safety inequality and operation and maintenance needs arose because of increasing population density fast camp expansion and the repurposing of construction materials for household wash facilities van der helm et al 2017 social and or cultural complexities related to coping mechanisms during times of crises were noted for exacerbating inequalities in wash access van der helm et al 2017 furthermore the legal status of both refugees and humanitarian organisations in a host country were highlighted as impacting conventional wash programs the authors discussed urban wash service delivery approaches that were considered for zaatari with notable contextual differences to account for inadequate resources and uncertain timeframes van der helm et al 2017 3 7 emergency contexts emergency contexts could refer to areas of conflict contexts dealing with natural disasters or communities affected by disease outbreak yates et al 2018 in this way emergency contexts can overlap with several of the abovementioned challenging context types including refugee camps or areas that have been affected by climate related disasters yates et al 2018 conducted a systematic review on wash interventions for emergencies in low and middle income countries they noted that while emergency situations call for prioritisation of immediate assistance over long term sustainability effectiveness of wash interventions still depend on contextual factors particularly social and cultural preferences yates et al 2018 krishnan 2019 reported on the relief efforts in odisha india after cyclone phailin in 2013 and found that many wash interventions had not been appropriate for the local context cultural attitudes and preferences meant that large portions of the communities continued practicing open defecation and several communities prioritised sanitation below the need to restore houses or livelihoods krishnan 2019 richard and kiani 2019 noted that some social groups are often excluded in recovery efforts specifically people with disabilities or the elderly the authors conducted a rapid review on the inclusion of disability and older age in humanitarian wash interventions and highlighted that emergency contexts often ignore the needs of these demographics because of multiple social environmental and institutional complexities richard and kiani 2019 similar to the effects of climate change relief for emergency and disaster situations may be felt disproportionately by vulnerable and marginalised populations disease outbreak can also constitute an emergency and can exacerbate existing complexities in challenging contexts the onset of covid 19 for example has added complexity to wash programs and compounded concerns for those already impacted by unequal access to water and sanitation emergency response was delayed because of lockdown restrictions after tropical cyclone harold hit vanuatu the solomon islands fiji and tonga in april 2020 du parc and spieth 2020 health concerns due to contaminated water sources poor sanitation and limited hygiene infrastructure after the cyclone were further exacerbated by the threat of covid transmission du parc and spieth 2020 in a study of 25 countries in sub saharan africa ekumah et al 2020 expected that communities with existing inequalities in wash would have increased vulnerability to covid 19 the authors suggested that those in challenging contexts such as informal settlements would have to break lockdown procedures to access services like water and sanitation ekumah et al 2020 bennett et al 2020 also highlighted the vulnerability of fishing communities to covid 19 not only did the pandemic increase health risks for these communities but it also greatly affected their livelihoods because of disruptions to the economy the authors noted that political economic social environmental and climatic conditions intersect to exacerbate effects of covid 19 particularly for the most vulnerable bennett et al 2020 p 339 3 8 common complexities for each challenging context type the previous sections demonstrated that many of the challenging context types overlap this is shown in table 1 literature sources are numbered in the leftmost column in the order in which they were discussed check marks indicate where the sources align to different types of challenging contexts shown in the top rows because the challenging context types are not mutually exclusive we offer instead the lens of intersecting complexities to examine persistent lags in wash access in any challenging context many complexities discussed in this review are common across the challenging context types however an exhaustive list of complexities affecting wash access in all challenging contexts may not be possible for this reason we simplify discussion of complexities by grouping them into six broad dimensions which were formed during the review table 2 a short list of the most common complexities discussed in this review is provided in tables 3 and 4 complexities are listed in the leftmost column grouped as per the six dimensions of complexity outlined in table 2 numbers coinciding to literature sources in table 1 indicate where the complexities align to specific studies and different types of challenging contexts it should be noted that grouping of complexities into specific dimensions is somewhat subjective some literature sources grouped complexities into similar dimensions and remaining complexities have been grouped based on our own interpretations importantly use of the six dimensions to unpack complexities is intended to enable further discussion of these complexities and their interconnections rather than serving as an end point for analysing the complexities in different challenging contexts we stress that the grouping of complexities into specific dimensions is less important than unpacking the interconnections between complexities themselves 4 the effects of intersecting complexities on appropriate solutions our review demonstrates that every type of challenging context has multiple complexities which affect access to wash furthermore many of these complexities are inextricably linked with each other indicating that a solution that tackles isolated complexities is unlikely to be appropriate many of the studies reviewed discussed persistent challenges in ensuring appropriate wash solutions for challenging contexts in many cases these persistent challenges were because of a lack of understanding of interconnections between complexities in challenging contexts for example joshi et al 2011 noted the frustration of the urban poor who felt that sanitation programs provided inappropriate solutions that didn t account for local norms religious beliefs questions about citizenship status insecure land tenure or the community s motivations for investing in sanitation the authors contended that sanitation provision is often dictated by policies or sector conventions that are far removed from local level needs and socio cultural practices joshi et al 2011 p 102 the reviewed literature often noted that wash solutions for challenging contexts were inappropriate for communities predominantly because of questions related to affordability inclusivity and sustainability these three issues are further explored in sections 4 1 to 4 3 4 1 solutions that are unaffordable for a community technological sanitation solutions designed specifically for challenging environments are consistently and unsurprisingly described as more expensive than conventional sanitation solutions e g pit latrines bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 tillett and jones 2021 adapted conventional solutions e g raised latrines for flood prone areas are also more expensive because of additional materials and labour requirements hcd ilab et al 2012 in remote locations these costs may increase further remote areas already have higher costs for sanitation infrastructure compared to urban centres because of costs for transportation and labour abaliwano and kiyimba 2011 o reilly et al 2017 willetts et al 2017 ultimately solutions for challenging contexts have been unaffordable for communities that are typically described as poor bukauskas et al 2017 willetts et al 2017 while it has been widely discussed that wash solutions need to be accompanied by financial support mechanisms these mechanisms often depend on either government subsidies or donor investments these may falter due to discriminatory attitudes or lack of priority and lack of continued financial support after implementation may limit long term sustainability bukauskas et al 2017 bukauskas and michael 2015 joshi et al 2011 tillett and jones 2021 examples of subsidies for sanitation in remote communities showed that these did not cover even a quarter of the cost of a latrine which the community attributed to corruption and discrimination against the poor o reilly et al 2017 other examples have relied on a community s willingness to pay for sanitation but did not account for lack of land tenure residents are unlikely to invest in sanitation when they may be evicted without notice joshi et al 2011 mcgranahan 2015 these examples suggest that limited consideration of intersecting complexities affecting challenging contexts can result in unaffordable wash solutions which inadvertently discriminate against the poor who often have to pay the most for essential services pierce 2017 4 2 solutions that are not inclusive of all members of a community lack of appropriate wash services disproportionately affects people who are discriminated based on gender age disability health status and more simavi 2018 wateraid 2018 wash services need to be safe equitable and non discriminatory accounting for accessibility needs cultural practices and menstrual hygiene management cohre et al 2008 exclusion of people from equitable access persists for a variety of reasons mosello and o leary 2017 noted that persistent exclusion in sanitation service delivery was due to sector specific structural and systemic factors and incentives behaviours and power relations that hinder progress p 7 mcgranahan 2015 stated that the reason that sanitation standards often fail to benefit those most in need derives from the nature of standards and the ways in which even standards applied equally can have inequitable consequences p 247 furthermore the complexity of challenging contexts means that appropriately inclusive wash is often not prioritise richard and kiani 2019 tillett and jones 2021 lack of inclusion in wash programs may be deliberate or inadvertent and can be affected by donor priorities limited budgets lack of inclusive programming within an organisation or lack of national strategies or policies joshi et al 2011 tillett and jones 2021 ultimately addressing access to wash in challenging contexts may still leave certain communities or members of the community behind furthermore those who are marginalised for multiple reasons may experience exacerbated inequalities and be excluded from seemingly inclusive wash simavi 2018 discussed the added complexities of geography formality of an area e g informal settlements and wealth quintiles on traditionally marginalised groups such as women in informal settlements who are discriminated based on gender as well as land tenure status other studies have emphasised women and girls in mining communities or flood prone areas who experience similar inequalities lynas et al 2019 morshed and sobhan 2010 there is a need to consider intersectionality in wash programs soeters et al 2019 wateraid 2018 and particularly for challenging contexts indeed a number of studies listed in this review have discussed intersectionality specifically related to wash and or climate change e g megaw et al 2020 richard and kiani 2019 tillett and jones 2021 intersectionality emphasises the compounding effects felt by those who are marginalised for multiple aspects of their identity e g race gender class and many others cho et al 2013 may 2015 the need for intersectionality to inform wash may also be more nuanced heterogeneity within certain demographics or changes in age or stage in life can affect wash needs e g women while menstruating or pregnant simavi 2018 4 3 solutions that are not sustainable long term sustainability can be hindered by lack of continuous financial support as mentioned in section 4 1 bukauskas and michael 2015 joshi et al 2011 tillett and jones 2021 or affected by deep seated attitudes around wash some lifestyles or livelihoods mean that open defecation is the traditional norm and simpler than constructing permanent infrastructure kalumbi et al 2020 whitley et al 2019 inappropriate and or undesirable solutions may not be used by the community joshi et al 2011 and solutions for environmentally challenging contexts may require more maintenance and frequent replacement bukauskas et al 2017 additionally wash services for contexts that are remote or difficult to access may mean that adequate monitoring and evaluation is not possible bukauskas et al 2017 fostvedt mills et al 2018 hall 2019 adequate faecal sludge management is needed to ensure sustainable sanitation services faecal sludge management fsm ensures that faecal sludge from onsite sanitation technologies i e technologies that are not connected to a sewer and therefore store waste onsite is safely and sustainably stored collected transported treated and either disposed or reused strande 2014 sustainable fsm is still a challenge around the world and may be further complicated in challenging contexts particularly if there are no policies or national strategies in place bukauskas et al 2017 ensuring wash solutions are sustainable requires a thorough understanding of intersecting complexities in challenging contexts 5 conclusions challenging contexts are those which are hardest to reach with conventional wash approaches access to wash services in challenging contexts is complex ensuring that communities in challenging contexts are not left behind in pursuit of sustainable development goal 6 means that intersecting complexities affecting wash access in these contexts need to be considered in this paper we introduce the lens of intersecting complexities and review literature on wash in challenging contexts to explore how complexities intersect and compound to affect access to wash this review has demonstrated that limited understanding or consideration of the interconnectedness of complexities affecting wash access can result in solutions that are inappropriate this suggests a clear and urgent need for a holistic mechanism to unpack intersecting complexities in challenging contexts despite many good examples of studies that unearthed intersecting complexities in particular contexts our review found that no such approach yet exists to guide wash practitioners in identifying and accounting for intersecting complexities in the planning design and delivery of wash programs while it is likely that no solution could overcome every complexity affecting wash access in challenging contexts a proactive approach for identifying intersecting complexities and accounting for these in the early stages of wash programs is we argue critical for ensuring the provision of appropriate and contextualised wash solutions we believe that the development and validation of a practical approach to unpack intersecting complexities can help tackle persistent and contextual inequalities in wash access across a wide array of settings in the meantime we encourage practitioners to 1 explore possible complexities in each dimension 2 consider how these complexities might intersect within as well as across dimensions and 3 consider how the temporal dimension i e change over time might influence and compound complexities or introduce new complexities to affect wash access our objective is to strengthen wash approaches for challenging contexts and provide practitioners policy makers and communities with the means to achieve wider and more affordable inclusive and sustainable wash services we believe that considering intersecting complexities is critical to ensuring wash solutions and programs are appropriate for those who are hardest to reach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

16384,both algae and bacteria are essential inhabitants of surface waters their presence is of ecological significance and sometimes of public health concern triggering various control actions interactions of microalgae macroalgae submerged aquatic vegetation and bacteria appear to be important phenomena necessitating a deeper understanding by those involved in research and management of microbial water quality given the long standing reliance on escherichia coli as an indicator of the potential presence of pathogens in natural waters understanding its biology in aquatic systems is necessary the major effects of algae and aquatic vegetation on e coli growth and survival including changes in the nutrient supply modification of water properties and constituents impact on sunlight radiation penetration survival as related to substrate attachment algal mediation of secondary habitats and survival inhibition due to the release of toxic substances and antibiotics are discussed in this review an examination of horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic resistance potential strain specific interactions effects on the microbial microalgae and grazer community structure and hydrodynamic controls is given outlooks due to existing and expected consequences of climate change and advances in observation technologies via high resolution satellite imaging unmanned aerial vehicles drones and mathematical modeling are additionally covered the multiplicity of interactions among bacteria algae and aquatic vegetation as well as multifaceted impacts of these interactions create a wide spectrum of research opportunities and technology developments keywords microbial water quality nutrient supply phycosphere oxygen forms radiation penetration biofilms algal mats antibacterial substances 1 introduction algae aquatic vegetation and bacteria are essential inhabitants of the aquatic environment and their presence is of ecological and sometimes public health significance total coliforms and particularly fecal coliforms have historically been used to monitor for fecal contamination in various water sources and subsequent water treatment efficacy escherichia coli is part of a larger group of fecal coliforms an assortment of bacterial species mainly sourced from feces and the focus of many monitoring and research efforts since numerous e coli serotypes can cause human illness if ingested kaper et al 2004 jang et al 2017 hence the presence of e coli in natural waters is used as the chief indicator of microbial water quality for recreation agricultural irrigation aquaculture and efficiency of water treatment price and wildeboer 2017 monitoring for the presence of e coli is also used to evaluate agricultural aquacultural and urban management practices on lands surrounding surface waters petersen and hubbart 2020 improvements in understanding interactions of e coli with various constituents in the aquatic environment lead to better interpretation of monitoring results and better decisions for water quality management natural waters also contain populations of algae aquatic vegetation av grazers and or nutrients that can change e coli concentrations or alter the aquatic community structure the aquatic environment constituents considered in this review are algae including macro and microalgae periphyton benthic algae and cyanobacteria also referred to as blue green algae and aquatic vegetation av algae and av are known to supply carbon compete with e coli for nutrients modify the water chemistry shelter e coli from solar radiation and release toxins and stimulants vanden heuvel et al 2010 fuentes et al 2016 wu et al 2021 different types of algae and av can have different impacts on e coli survival by altering e coli populations algae and av can consequently affect any e coli based evaluation of the effectiveness of land based practices such as waste management livestock feeding operations stormwater control recreational activities and conservation practices on microbial water quality conversely changes in land based practices e g agricultural practices may indirectly affect e coli populations via the impact on algae and av in particular practices causing or controlling eutrophication may influence algal populations and consequently affect the conditions e coli has adapted to for survival similarly algicide applications used to control algal populations can influence e coli survival via a change in algal and av community composition and concentrations climate change and extreme weather events present an additional challenge to resource managers and researchers tasked with monitoring and predicting both algal blooms and pathogenic bacteria movement and concentrations within the aquatic environment the global warming processes most often considered when assessing aquatic ecosystem impacts are intensified precipitation events that increase nutrient delivery processes via run off followed by prolonged droughts that lead to increased water temperatures and thermal stratification over a longer period reidmiller et al 2018 these actions create conditions that favor the growth development and maintenance of harmful algal blooms habs and cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms cyanohabs in marine and freshwater environments such as those used as aquaculture agriculture and drinking water sources cyanohabs in warmer waters often result in increased thermal stratification and the formation of surface scums which provide additional competitive advantages for cyanobacteria compared to eukaryotic algae in freshwater systems huisman et al 2004 kardinaal et al 2007 a scenario which can promote the growth of e coli mezrioui et al 1994 vijayavel et al 2013 likewise the risk of transmission of pathogenic bacteria such as cryptosporidium spp and e coli into public drinking and recreational waters is increased with precipitation events as more frequent or extreme storm events such as predicted with climate change can overwhelm sewer systems and lead to overflows that contaminate these waters patz et al 2008 2014 thus providing additional opportunities for synergistic cyanobacteria pathogenic bacteria interactions the predicted increase and intensification of cyanohabs due to climate change also could create a scenario in which e coli concentrations and occurrences in the aquatic system would increase and require greater resource monitoring efforts for environmental and public health safety blaustein et al 2013 described e coli survival rates across various temperatures in six different types of waters and hypothesized that interactions with algae and algal toxins may influence survival work by lee et al 2016 and halac et al 2019 concluded that hydrographic and water temperature conditions were more important in predicting the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria associated with cyanobacteria than nutrient conditions similarly bomo et al 2011 demonstrated that there are species specific interactions between cyanobacteria and pathogenic bacteria with the toxigenic cyanobacteria expected to proliferate under predicted climatic changes e g microcystis and anabaena influencing the growth and survival of e coli however other authors have determined that toxic substances such as microcystins produced by numerous bloom forming cyanobacteria species are detrimental to e coli dixon et al 2004 valdor and aboal 2007 halac et al 2019 consequently while the risk to human health from toxin producing cyanohabs may increase under future climate scenarios the human health risk from pathogenic bacteria may decrease however more research is needed with regards to cyanobacteria blooms that do not produce toxins estimated to be approximately 75 of global cyanobacteria blooms groendahl and fink 2017 yet would provide the substrate and nutrient sources needed for the proliferation of e coli in this scenario the predation of e coli by grazers may be lessened by predicted climate change driven ecological shifts that promote the growth of cyanobacteria over other algal species as both toxic and non toxic cyanoshabs often lead to reduced grazer fitness in the natural aquatic environment fyda et al 2010 paerl and otten 2013 sukenik et al 2015 it has been noted that some algal and cyanobacterial exudates have a stimulatory effect on bacteria including stimulation of bacterial dna synthesis murray et al 1986 enhancement of bacterial horizontal gene transfer matsui et al 2003 increased bacterial biofilm formation espeland and wetzel 2001 as well as bacteria community composition shifts van hannen et al 1999 however the impact and extent to which these factors promote or inhibit e coli success in natural waters is largely unexplored the community involved in the detection monitoring prediction and management of bacterial pathogens and indicators in natural waters is very diverse it includes not only microbiologists and phycologists there are many engineering technical modeling professionals who are becoming involved in microbial water quality assessments for agricultural irrigation recreational and aquaculture water sources this audience can benefit from a conceptual overview of interactions between e coli algae and av as a knowledge base for elucidating the dynamics of microbial water quality and developing environmental monitoring and management schemes to improve water quality especially as climate change adds additional human and environmental health and food safety concerns providing such an overview is the objective of this paper which summarizes and discusses the state of the knowledge about algae and av effects on microbial water quality with an emphasis on e coli as the primary indicator organism used routinely in many monitoring designs and management decisions in the microbial water quality field 2 major effects of algae and av on e coli survival fig 1 presents the major aspects of algae and av effects on bacteria survival in natural water environments that are reviewed here with a focus on e coli gurung et al 1999 quero et al 2015 and ramanan et al 2016 detail the role of algae and av derived carbon and other nutrients in the aquatic environment both algal and av photosynthetic and decomposition processes release carbon and other nutrients which are used by bacteria in various mutualistic and competitive relationships algae and av provide surfaces for the development of biofilms which become productive habitats for bacteria quero et al 2015 jang et al 2017 and can promote or inhibit zooplankton grazer populations reche et al 1997 paerl and otten 2013 both algae and av can alter the sunlight energy transfer in water thus shielding bacteria from radiative damage but can also cause negative effects on bacteria through photosynthetic processes that change oxygen forms and ph to conditions that are unfavorable for bacteria summarized in curtis 2003 work demonstrating the toxicity of algal substances to bacteria has been on going since the 1940s pratt et al 1944 with current research focusing on the effects of cyanobacteria toxins on e coli martin et al 2017 when considering competition between these organisms for nitrogen phosphorus carbon and microelements and the role that grazers play in the bacterial algal and av community structures the resulting interactions between these constituents appear to be convoluted with feedback loops and interrelations this complex system of interactions manifests itself in many controls exerted on e coli populations in natural aquatic environments 2 1 changes in the nutrient supply 2 1 1 carbon in the phycosphere algal exudates influence bacteria in the vicinity of algae the term phycosphere used for the first time in 1972 was defined as a zone that may exist extending outward from an algal cell or colony for an undefined distance in which the bacterial growth is stimulated by the extracellular products of the alga bell and mitchell 1972 the phycosphere is one of the most ignored yet distinctive aquatic habitats for bacteria cho et al 2015 kim et al 2014 lee et al 2013 ramanan et al 2015 sapp et al 2007 within the phycosphere high concentrations of fixed organic carbon are available for consumption as compared to the vast oligotrophic surroundings in marine and fresh waters algae release carbon to avoid photoinhibition cherrier et al 2015 as bacteria are usually limited by cell generated energy for nutrient transport they can be highly dependent on algal organic carbon exudates for their energy supply jansson 1988 this relationship has been considered a form of commensalism in which bacteria growth and survival is limited by carbon produced by the algae more so than nutrient availability in the phycosphere gurung et al 1999 microalgae exudate is composed mainly of carbohydrates followed by different nitrogenous compounds and vitamins myklestad 1995 underwood et al 2004 watanabe et al 2008 the relationship between the green alga chlorella vulgaris and e coli in nutrient replete conditions was described as mutualistic by both delgadillo mirquez et al 2016 and žitnik et al 2019 wherein the bacteria used the oxygen produced by the algae to oxidize organic matter and produced co2 essential for algal photosynthetic activity in return similarly cho et al 2015 demonstrated that algae supply fixed organic carbon to a consortium of mutualistic bacteria mostly belonging to plant growth promoting bacteria and bacteria in return supply dissolved inorganic carbon and low molecular weight organic carbon for algal consumption in aquatic systems bacterial growth is often limited by algal supplied carbon daufresne et al 2008 wyatt and turetsky 2015 thus conditions that prevent or slow algal population development result in low fecal coliform including e coli concentrations maestre valero et al 2011 reported that in covered reservoirs where the reduction in water temperature and solar radiation limited algal photosynthetic activity the shortage of organic matter and cooler water temperature led to a very low concentration of fecal coliforms and e coli similarly suppression of algal biomass due to the presence of duckweed mats led to anoxic and neutral pond conditions and the removal of 99 7 of e coli and 91 8 of enterococci cells papadopoulos and tsihrintzis 2011 2 1 2 competition for nutrients the relationship between bacteria and algae concerning nutrients has been regarded as competitive gurung et al 1999 at low nutrient concentrations an increase in algal derived organic carbon can stimulate the growth of the bacteria community because bacteria are more biologically efficient at low nutrient concentration currie and kalff 1984 suttle et al 1990 rothhaupt and giide 1992 drakare 2002 at high nutrient concentrations however algae can take up nutrients predominantly over bacteria due to greater maximum uptake rates gurung et al 1999 the type of relationship between bacteria and algae depends on environmental conditions gurung et al 1999 when light is abundant relative to nutrients algae fix carbon in surplus and subsequently exude large amounts of it lancelot 1983 in such a situation bacterial growth is nutrient limited because organic carbon availability is greater than nutrient availability however at low light nutrient ratios algae excrete less organic carbon due to lower photosynthetic rates and bacteria become energy limited because of an organic carbon deficit gurung et al 1999 thus competitive interactions between bacteria and algae are expected to be more intense at higher light nutrient ratios while commensalism would be promoted at lower light nutrient ratios phosphorus is the nutrient often used to demonstrate the switch between algae and bacteria relationship types bratbak and thingstad 1985 when the growth of algae and bacteria is limited only by phosphorus the interaction between them is competitive however when bacterial growth is also limited by organic carbon the interaction between algae and bacteria becomes more complex liu et al 2012 the interplay between light intensity and phosphorus concentrations as factors determining the relationship between algae and heterotrophic bacteria was elucidated in experiments by gurung et al 1999 using the green alga scenedesmus acutus and bacteria from a freshwater lake in japan gurung et al 1999 found that bacteria were carbon limited at a light intensity 55 µe m 2 s 1 thus indicating a commensal relationship between algae and bacteria fig 2 above that light intensity bacteria suffered from an organic carbon deficit rather than phosphorus limitation because of low algal biomass which reduced the phosphorus supply however at moderate phosphorus supply rates and light intensities 55 µe m 2 s 1 bacterial growth was limited by phosphorus rather than organic carbon because the carbon supply derived from algae exceeded the phosphorus supply relative to bacterial demand fig 2c further increases in the phosphorus supply reduced or eliminated phosphorus limitation for both algae and bacteria fig 2d thus competitive interaction was most intense at a moderate phosphorus supply rate fig 2c these results demonstrated that there is a shift between commensalism for carbon and competition for phosphorus depending on light intensity and nutrient supply rate gurung et al 1999 in mesocosm experiments examining the interactions of algae and heterotrophic bacteria liu et al 2012 found that the addition of carbon as glucose immediately resulted in the decline of chlorophyll a this was attributed to inorganic nutrient competition between the algae and bacteria carbon additions such as glucose stimulate bacterial growth and activity which in turn alters the nutrients available to algae and changes the competitive relationships between algae and bacteria a similar effect was observed by joint et al 2002 danovaro 1998 and cotner et al 2010 all of whom noted large increases in bacterial activity with the addition of glucose the addition of glucose across a range of concentrations resulted in a decline of algal biomass which was explained by the ability of heterotrophic bacteria to outcompete the algae for available inorganic nutrients nutrient availability appears to control the switch from mutualism to competition in laboratory experiments designed to examine the relationship between e coli and c vulgaris at a constant temperature light and regulated ph žitnik et al 2019 in this laboratory study the electrical conductance ec of the solution was used as the measure of nutrient availability with an ec 1569 µs cm indicating a high nutrient concentration žitnik et al 2019 found at an ec 1569 µs cm e coli concentrations were high regardless of the presence of c vulgaris whereas at an ec 1569 µs cm the presence of high concentrations of c vulgaris 1 107 cells ml 1 inhibited the growth of e coli but below this algal cell concentration the ability of c vulgaris to inhibit the growth of e coli declined the adaptive response of e coli to being outcompeted in nutrient deficient conditions involves genetic mutations that increase the efficiency of usage or uptake of the limiting nutrient halac et al 2019 roose et al 2020 halac et al 2019 described two different forms of adaptive strategies under the nutrient limitation that affect cellular physiology in different ways adaptation to nitrogen starvation caused changes that resulted in increased nitrogen scavenging ability of e coli adaptation to magnesium starvation initiated restructuring of the cell s outer membrane to a configuration that allows magnesium to be redistributed to other biological processes roose et al 2020 demonstrated the abundance of bacterial nir and nos genes in response to nitrogen pulses in newly constructed and established wetlands that allowed the bacterial community to compete with benthic algae for limited nitrogen resources e coli competes not only with algae but also with other bacteria in natural freshwater environments nutrient additions did not affect microbial concentrations including e coli concentrations in the water column in mesocosm experiments conducted by gregory et al 2017 however e coli populations associated with the benthos sediment did show a growth response work by barnard et al 2017 showed that the introduction of spirogyra grevilleana a benthic green alga to a biofiltration system reduced the concentrations of both e coli and nitrogen constituents as the interest in benthic algal populations grows for a variety of human and environmental health reasons bouma gregson et al 2017 the interplay of benthic algae benthic cyanobacteria and the microbiome including e coli should be examined more thoroughly 2 1 3 lysis of algal cells at the onset of algal cell death there is usually a large initial release of soluble materials amounting to 20 50 of the cell s organic content depinto and verhoff 1977 cole 1982 the released dissolved organic matter includes significant carbohydrate 52 and biodegradable 55 to 74 fractions bouteleux et al 2005 the organic matter and soluble materials from dead algal cells can be rapidly metabolized by bacteria both in the laboratory and under natural conditions iturriaga and hoppe 1977 cole 1982 these substances are always composed of polysaccharides glucanes glucose polymers belonging to the family of starches or laminarines bouteleux et al 2005 biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc released by algae was the preferred substrate for e coli growth in the laboratory experiments of bouteleux et al 2005 in this study the addition of algogenic organic matter aom from chlorinated natural waters led to an e coli growth equivalent to that of tap water without addition while the addition of aom from ozonated natural waters allowed a 4 to 12 fold increase in e coli growth rates compared to tap water without bdoc addition bouteleux et al 2005 further demonstrated that conditions and reasons for algal cell lysis can affect the suitability of the lysed material to be a nutritious substrate for e coli specifically after ozonation in which aom particles are broken into smaller biodegradable units that are more quickly assimilated by bacteria the aom particles in the bouteleux et al 2005 study were composed of a mixture of very diverse organic compounds of which approximately 50 were identified as sugars other nutritive elements such as growth factors vitamins amino acids siderophores trace elements and organic cofactors are all possibly part of aom mixes and help facilitate the survival of heterotrophic bacteria including e coli in addition to death and decay processes algal reproduction can provide a nutrient pool for example during mating chlamydomonas reinhardtii a species of green algae releases a lytic factor a substance that breaks down the cell wall allowing for fusion of gametes this digestion releases soluble carbohydrates in amounts up to 3 10 6 pg cell 1 within a few hours solter and gibor 1977 2 2 modification of water properties and constituents 2 2 1 changes in oxygen concentrations and forms algal photosynthetic activity results in ph elevation and increased oxygenation but respiration processes and organic matter oxidation also affect the dissolved oxygen do concentrations in aquatic environments on a diurnal cycle ansa et al 2011 cheng et al 2013 limited research regarding the impacts of oxygen concentrations on bacteria has been conducted in natural waters but increased oxygenation in wastewater treatment ponds wtps or lagoons attributed to algal abundance has been observed to affect fecal bacteria die off due to the production of toxic oxygen species curtis et al 1992 liu et al 2016 this occurs due to the presence of sensitizers i e light absorbing compounds which transfer energy to other molecules photooxidation is the process where endogenous or exogenous sensitizers absorb light and transfer energy to other molecules leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros when ros including singlet oxygen superoxide hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals are formed through these energy transfer reactions microorganisms can be damaged curtis et al 1992 observations of this effect in freshwater environments are scarce the work by ansa et al 2011 for a tropical lake in ghana presents an example as do some studies in wtps in these examples an increased efficacy of the removal of bacteria was attributed to algae mediated elevated oxygen concentrations that lead to photooxidation ansa et al 2011 2015 liu et al 2016 curtis 1990 and curtis et al 1992 showed that ph and ros concentrations play a proportional role to the survival of e coli in wtps with less damage to e coli occurring at ph concentrations below 8 al tameemi and kadhim 2019 found that the presence of the green algae mougeotia sp and nostochopsis sp in wtps increased the do 20 mg l 1 and ph 10 6 to concentrations that were detrimental to e coli algae induced changes in ph and do have a demonstrated seasonality in temperate and tropical climates creating seasonal patterns in e coli removal efficiency in wtps in temperate environments liu et al 2016 and liang et al 2018 noted that removal efficiencies of pathogenic microorganisms during wastewater treatment over a year were highly variable with higher removal efficiencies documented in the summer and fall seasons correlating with the presence of dense algal blooms similarly in tropical riverine waters allam and el gemaizy 2015 found that when summer algal populations were densest e coli concentrations were lowest 2 2 2 changes in ph diurnal variation in co2 concentration occurs as a result of photosynthesis dubinsky and rotem 1974 in natural environments dubinsky and rotem 1974 and laboratory mesocosm experiments vasker et al 2021 this diurnal fluctuation in ph is described as a do concentration peak in mid afternoon and falling to a minimum concentration overnight as photosynthesis ceases but respiration continues more work has been done in wtps than in natural environments to elucidate this effect on coliform bacteria in wtps gray 2004 and amengual morro et al 2012 reported that during periods of rapid photosynthesis algal demand for co2 exceeds that produced by bacterial respiration carbonate and bicarbonate ions dissociate to produce co2 which is used by the algae and hydroxyl ions which accumulate and can raise the ph to above 10 this ph imbalance between day and night inactivates coliforms due to algal photosynthetic activity exceeding bacterial respiration during the daytime amengual morro et al 2012 diurnal variation in ph in eutrophic lakes may negatively affect e coli survival even if ph does not reach critical basic high values given as ph 9 5 by parhad and rao 1974 and awuah 2006 interactions of ph and other factors on e coli survival have not systematically been studied in natural water environments davies colley et al 1997 1999 found that light related inactivation of e coli is dependent on ph in wtps under elevated ph conditions ph 8 5 e coli is inactivated by exogenous mechanisms while endogenous mechanisms inactivate e coli more slowly under moderate ph conditions the effects of ph on e coli have been attributed to conformational changes in the membrane of the bacteria both bosshard et al 2010a b and curtis et al 1994 found that bacterial inactivation resulted from respiratory chain damage that caused a physical breakdown in the membrane that exposed nucleic acids to environmental stresses 2 3 impact of solar radiation penetration the sunlight mediated e coli inactivation largely depends on the medium in which bacteria are present and the degree of solar exposure dias et al 2017 algae can reduce or enhance the harmful effects of sunlight on bacteria by impeding light penetration and increasing do concentrations curtis et al 1992 light attenuation by algae can partially compensate for the harm to fecal coliforms caused by algal photosynthesis in the form of increased do and ph concentrations that cause photooxidation curtis et al 1994 showed that different algal concentrations affected light attenuation with short wavelength spectra being more impacted by algal biomass than long wavelength spectra in turbid aquatic systems light is attenuated exponentially as a function of chlorophyll a derived from algae resulting in an exponential decrease in light penetration in response to a small increase in chlorophyll a grobbelaar 1989 curtis et al 1994 dokulil 1994 in natural ponds solar radiation penetration decreases with increased algal biomass van der steen et al 2000 light attenuation can also impede the e coli inactivation caused by the presence of endogenous sensitizers such compounds are present within e coli and other coliform cells bolton et al 2010 the photosensitizer related inactivation of e coli was first studied for uv b radiation reed 1997 davies colley et al 1999 and more recently was determined to occur across the entire visible light spectrum kadir and nelson 2014 uv b radiation 290 320 nm creates direct dna damage in e coli cells shilton 2005 typically damage from uv b radiation only occurs in the top few centimeters of water because of increasing par attenuation rates with depth due to the presence of surface water algal biomass increased in colored dissolved organic material cdom and turbidity causing materials van der steen et al 2000 shilton 2005 maraccini et al 2016 farrell et al 2018 maraccini et al 2016 noted species specific responses to solar inactivation with e coli being less affected by solar damage in highly turbid waters than enterococcus faecalis huber et al 2011 demonstrated that turbidity causing materials can impact uv inactivation through various mechanisms including scattering and absorption of incident uv light and shielding of bacteria protozoa and viruses preventing sufficient uv doses for pathogen inactivation diurnal dynamics of e coli concentrations in freshwater sources are complex lian et al 2018 found that the uv b dose delivery schedule the combination of dose rate and exposure time influences the inactivation of e coli and ms 2 an e coli bacteriophage at all uv b doses investigated in optically clear water through this work two inactivation phases were identified a uv b dose rate limited inactivation phase and a dose rate saturation inactivation phase algae also have unique diurnal cycles hansson 1995 and the synergistic effect of this with e coli diurnal cycles and uv radiation have not been investigated extended survival of e coli and salmonella enterica ser typhimurium in the presence of the green alga cladophora was attributed to the algae mediated protection from uv irradiation via the production of exudates beckinghausen et al 2014 the production of secondary metabolites that offer photoprotection is summarized in klisch and häder 2008 and carreto and carignan 2011 such effect was observed with mycosporines and mycosporine like amino acids maas which are low molecular weight water soluble molecules that absorb uv radiation in the wavelength range of 310 365 nm and possibly scavenge o2 these substances exhibited a sunscreen like function preventing growth inhibition of e coli in both marine and freshwater suh et al 2003 oren and gunde cimerman 2007 rastogi et al 2015 2 4 algae mediated secondary habitats 2 4 1 biofilms surfaces of water bodies rocks sediments and submerged aquatic vegetation may be covered with algae mediated biofilms that present a suitable habitat for bacteria mats that form on the surface of water or rocks are typically composed of epiphytic algae cyanobacteria detritus and sediments many cyanobacteria species frequently establish biofilms on water surfaces which cause human health risks due to the presence of algal toxins paerl et al 2000 bomo et al 2011 these biofilms represent a nutrient rich environment that promotes the growth and survival of various bacteria for example the densities of e coli mpn enterococci mpn and clostridium perfringens cfu attached to mats of the cyanobacteria lyngbya wollei averaged 3 5 3 2 and 3 2 log g 1 respectively vijayavel et al 2013 similarly dratchev et al 1957 found that concentrations of e coli in surface films and foams were 100 1000 times greater than concentrations in the underlying water phototrophs can survive in natural biofilms formed on a variety of substrates such as rocks without known organic carbon and energy sources cockell et al 2011 adding a new dimension to studies on the growth of algae and bacteria in extreme environments both bacteria and algae survive in extreme conditions by secreting high levels of extracellular polymeric substances eps including organic carbon special ice active substances like glycoproteins which change the physicochemical surroundings of the immediate environment can be secreted to help support biological functions in extreme conditions ramanan et al 2016 algae and cyanobacteria biofilms form on spider webs with coastal water evaporation being the sole source of nutrients azua bustos et al 2012 wierzchos et al 2015 found a diversity of cyanobacteria and bacteria living in gypsum deposits in the atacama desert in which the cyanobacteria formed a protective environment for the bacterial community periphyton communities composed of algae protozoa and fungi that grow attached to benthic surfaces provide a suitable habitat for bacterial growth ksoll et al 2007 periphyton in sediment biofilms supported a sizable e coli population that exhibited seasonal dynamics ranging from 102 to 104 cfu gdw 1 in the summer and from 100 to 104 cfu gdw 1 in the winter stocker et al 2019 staley et al 2011 surmised that decreases in the water column algae populations likely led to the increase of periphyton in the system through mesocosm experiments conducted through lighted and darkened conditions after the agrochemical atrazine was applied significantly higher e coli densities were found in the sediments of illuminated microcosms and there was a strong negative trend in the correlation between algae in the water column and e coli densities in the sediments staley et al 2011 2 4 2 attachment to micro and macroalgae association of e coli with planktonic microalgae appears to exhibit a complex dependence on species strains and level on nutrients in the water fang et al 2022 results of microcosm research allowed authors to suggest that e coli and enterococci showed little association with three green microalgae species while three opportunistic pathogen species had the propensity to form such association in another microcosm study perkins et al 2016 also found no correlation between e coli and particles although detachment of e coli cells from algal surface is plausible the factors that cause this and rates of detachment have not been elucidated so far ansa et al 2011 simulated the shear stress caused detachment after one and three days of introduction of e coli in microcosms with algae similar numbers of detached cells were found for both days whereas the e coli concentrations in solution decreased attached e coli can receive necessary carbon from the algae it is associated with fang et al 2022 thus algae die off may initiate the detachment since the level of nutrients in water can control the bacteria attachment to algae a change in this level may also cause detachment studies of release of e coli from bottom sediments showed that e coli moves from sediment to water column in absence of shear stress possibly due to chemotaxis pachepsky et al 2017 park et al 2017 it is not known if this type of detachment may occur with e coli associated with algae macroalgae provide excellent attachment conditions for e coli attached e coli were abundant accounting for up to 3250 cfu g 1 of algal material in the work of quero et al 2015 macroalgal associated e coli isolates belonged to all phylogroups including pathogenic ones and escherichia cryptic clades quero et al 2015 mathai et al 2019 quero et al 2019 showed that isolates of e coli obtained from various benthic macroalgae species hadpotential to grow even at in situ temperatures using only algal extracts as the source of carbon and nutrients these same isolates also had the ability to produce biofilms in vitro the genotypic diversity of the attached e coli isolates was high with significant differences between those found associated with algae and the e coli populations in the overlying water quero et al 2015 found that the algal attached e coli populations consisted of both resident and transient strains likely resulting from the heterogeneous input of fecal bacteria from the surrounding urban environment and that the abundance of algal attached e coli was positively correlated with e coli abundance in overlying waters much work has been done to study the relationship between fecal indicator bacteria and annual blooms of cladophora in lake michigan and these studies can be used as a reference point for other investigations high densities of e coli among other enterococci have been observed in attached and free floating cladophora mats at densities often exceeding 100 000 cfu g 1 algal material byappanahalli et al 2003 englebert et al 2008b ishii et al 2006 van den huevel et al 2010 within lake michigan cladophora appears to stimulate the growth and naturalization of bacteria and concentrations of bacteria significantly decreased with increasing distance from algal mats in nearshore waters verhougstraete et al 2010 environmental conditions appear to play a role in the movement and survival of e coli and human pathogenic bacteria salmonella spp campylobacter spp shigella spp and shiga toxin producing e coli stec within the lake release of e coli from cladophora mats to surrounding water was attributed to wave action whitman et al 2003 englebert et al 2008a also noted that strong wind and wave influences were required to dislodge bacteria from cladophora during low energy conditions low wind and wave action small amounts of bacteria were released from cladophora mats but these organisms did not show long term survival when free floating in the water englebert et al 2008a the presence of e coli within cladophora mats is correlated with temperature whitman et al 2003 ksoll et al 2007 during warmer summer temperatures bacteria concentrations are highest in cladophora mats and require more intense wave or wind action to dislodge the bacteria from the algal material as water temperature decreases the cladophora habitat breaks down resulting in greater numbers of bacteria being released to the surrounding water verhougstraete et al 2010 whitman et al 2003 and englebert et al 2008b found that e coli and enterococci survived much longer 45 days in association with cladophora mats than other pathogenic bacteria species while other human pathogens such as salmonella spp and shigella spp were found in 40 to 100 of cladophora samples collected from lake michigan ishii et al 2006 these species were only able to survive outside of the cladophora mats for 10 and 2 days respectively englebert et al 2008b quero et al 2015 demonstrated that e coli can be associated with macroalgae other than cladophora and that bacterial abundance was highly variable on both spatial and temporal scales however zulkifly et al 2012 found microscopic evidence for a diverse bacterial community associated with cladophora glomerata and molecular evidence for ca 100 distinct sequences classifiable to genus at an 80 confidence level or species at a 96 97 confidence level within nine bacterial phyla but did not find e coli or related human pathogens this highlights the importance of considering algal species identifications as well as life cycle stages biochemical composition nutrient availability and temporal and spatial variability when examining the factors that influence bacteria adhesion attachment to macroalgae filamentous green algae decreased populations of bacteria in the water column ansa et al 2011 found that the attachment of fecal bacteria to macroalgae and suspended solids in eutrophic lakes is a potential natural means of removal of bacterial pathogens e coli may attach to each other to algae and to suspended particles this aggregate forming process is commonly viewed as the mechanism that causes the removal of coliforms from the suspended state cheng et al 2013 settling does not necessarily occur though but can be mediated when bacteria bind together with large organic molecules forming aggregates hess erga et al 2008 liu et al 2013 mamane et al 2008 wu et al 2005 in the absence of settling algae related attachment appeared to stimulate bacterial growth in microcosm experiments badgley et al 2012 in their laboratory study the increase of algae attached e coli concentrations did not appear to come from the continuing transition of e coli from the water column to the algal filaments over time when normalized to the scale of the entire microcosm the total population of e coli in microcosms containing algae grew more than one order of magnitude over the initial inoculum size algal microcosms also allowed for greater persistence of e coli over time when compared to bacterial persistence in microcosms without algae the observed e coli growth after additional input of nitrogen suggests that algae are capable of supplying enough carbon to support sustained long term growth of attached e coli in large scale systems this supply of photosynthetically fixed carbon in addition to protection from other detrimental effects such as ultraviolet light may be why algae are a favorable substrate for e coli bouteleux et al 2005 microscopic observations done using a gfp labeled e coli strain supported the hypothesis that the growth of e coli occurred directly on algal filaments fig 3 the number of fluorescent e coli colonies that were observed to be attached to algal filaments increased over time indicating an increasing population size algal mats washed onto beaches may get buried in the sand by wave action or human activities where they are protected from sunlight and desiccation here indicator bacteria may multiply due to available nutrients from the decomposing mats the beach sand can serve as a source of indicator bacteria for the nearshore water especially when waves resuspend buried mats whitman et al 2003 byappanahalli et al 2006 gubelit and vainshtein 2011 found similar cladophora enteric bacteria interactions along the eastern gulf of finland shoreline particularly in regions where water salinities were below 2 ppt 2 4 3 submerged aquatic vegetation submerged av have the potential to harbor and disperse e coli and other bacterial pathogens in a large number of water bodies staley et al 2012 eurasian watermilfoil ewm harbored elevated densities of e coli and several potential pathogenic bacteria groups including aeromonas enterobacteriaceae and clostridium mathai et al 2019 these authors observed that ewm could serve as a temporal source for transmission of microbiota to the water column a significant difference in chemical composition distribution pattern community structure of av and bacterial population was attributed to seasonality geospatial niches and nutritional potential of several av species by othman and haroon 2020 the presence of wetland plants decreased populations of e coli via mechanisms of filtration antibiosis attachment production of antimicrobial substances and increases in microbial competition karim 1999 karim et al 2008 observed a decrease in populations of e coli s enterica ser typhimurium bacteriophages ms 2 and poliovirus in wetland environments and attributed the die off to increased microbial competition or predation pitlo and dawson 1990 noted that the presence of submerged av in water sources increased the bed and bank roughness causing decreased flow rates and increased water quality and e coli survival 2 5 survival inhibition due to release of toxic substances and antibiotics 2 5 1 toxic and antibacterial substances the release of substances toxic to coliform bacteria by algae was first suggested by sieburth and pratt 1962 and was often cited as a possible factor of bacterial die off many algal taxa release substances inhibitory to bacteria cole 1982 ansa et al 2011 one of the most common algal toxins found in the freshwater environment is microcystin a hepatotoxin produced by numerous cyanobacteria species harke et al 2016 while this toxin can be lethal to domestic and wild animals and detrimental to humans harke et al 2016 it does not have a strong antibacterial action on e coli dixon et al 2004 and increased concentrations of microcystin may prolong the growth cycle of e coli yang et al 2008 cyanobacteria have also been identified as a source of biologically active compounds with antibacterial properties østensvik et al 1998 abed et al 2009 bomo et al 2011 aqueous methanol and other organic solvents found in cyanobacteria extracts possess antibacterial properties kellam and walker 1989 frankmölle et al 1992 falch et al 1995 fig 4 demonstrates this effect using the cyanobacterium tychonema bourrellyi and several bacteria species secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria are associated with toxic hormonal antineoplastic and antimicrobial effects carmichael 1992 patterson et al 1994 these antimicrobial substances may target various kinds of microorganisms including prokaryotes and eukaryotes østensvik et al 1998 however a negative association between cyanobacteria and fecal coliforms was reported by halac et al 2019 for the periods when high 3 2 104 to 1 2 106 cells ml 1 cyanobacteria cell concentration occurred halac et al 2019 showed that both e coli and enterococcus spp had decreased growth rates in the presence of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa leading the authors to hypothesize that the high cell concentration found during microcystis blooms could inhibit bacteria growth although both species of bacteria were negatively affected by the presence of m aeruginosa e coli was more sensitive than enterococcus spp similarly martin et al 2017 exposed e coli to 1 and 10 mg l 1 microcystin lr and found no evidence that this toxin induced oxidative or cell envelope stress dziallas and grossart 2011 woodhouse et al 2015 and su et al 2017 among others suggest that the relationship between environmental cyanobacteria blooms and fecal indicator bacteria is complex with temperature do concentrations algal bloom stage nutrient availability and co occurring bacteria community dynamics all playing a role in toxin production and interaction antibiotics are one group of substances that can be released by algae and can affect bacteria survival the first antibiotic to be isolated from algae chlorella pyrenoidosa and c vulgaris was chlorellin which was effective against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria including staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pyogenes bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa pratt et al 1944 since this early work numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate the antibiotic compounds made by algae summarized in de morais et al 2015 and how these compounds may interact with bacteria summarized in shannon and abu ghannam 2016 2 5 2 interference with bacteria quorum sensing qs quorum sensing qs bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density gram positive and gram negative bacteria use qs communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities that include symbiosis virulence competence conjugation antibiotic production motility sporulation and biofilm formation miller and bassler 2001 qs interference has been shown to occur between algae and bacterial biofilms reviewed in joint et al 2007 and rivas et al 2010 qs can be inhibited or stimulated depending on the algal species qs is well pronounced in e coli populations surette et al 1999 sperandino et al 2003 tests using e coli jb523 showed that one freshwater and five marine microalgae species exhibited quorum sensing inhibitory activity whereas two algal species stimulated quorum sensing regulated gene expression natrah et al 2011 several marine macroalgae were able to disrupt bacterial qs activities reviewed in dobretsov et al 2009 and natrah et al 2011 and some bacteria have been shown to use qs to regulate algicidal activities against toxigenic cyanobacteria wu et al 2017 but more research needs to be conducted using e coli and algae that typically co occur with it in natural waters 2 6 horizontal gene transfer the genetic makeup of both bacteria and algae is changing due to horizontal gene transfer hgt in the phycosphere kouzuma and watanabe 2015 a plausible consequence of this evolutionary process can be the acquisition and subsequent expression of antibiotic resistant genes in algae the study of antibiotic resistant gene expression in algae is currently in its infancy and the impact on both human health through routes of exposure such as recreational water contact agricultural irrigation waters on fresh produce or within aquaculture waters and gene transfer to bacteria cohabitating in the phycosphere has yet to be determined it is not known whether habs which occur throughout all water types are increasing hgt rates that could lead to antibiotic resistance though it has been documented that hgt from bacteria to algae aids algae in adapting to environmental extremes schönknecht et al 2013 raymond and remias 2019 the strain specific differences in e coli algae interactions begin with the expression of specific genes heo et al 2019 reported the results of a genome wide exploration of e coli genes that promote growth in c vulgaris these authors identified four genes riba ribd ribe and ssue that exerted a growth promoting effect on c vulgaris there is consortia of algae and bacteria that can be efficient in the detoxification of organic and inorganic pollutants removal of nutrients from wastewaters and bioenergy production compared to the efficacy of individual microorganisms subashchandrabose et al 2011 shetty et al 2019 thus it could be beneficial to improve our understanding of which expressed genes influence the efficiency of these processes the issue of e coli strain variability is not adequately addressed in current environmental studies on algae av e coli interactions and its importance presents a research question to explore 2 7 predation of e coli relatively little is known about the effect of algae and av on the activity of predators controlling the population of e coli in natural waters work presented by ansa et al 2012 reported that cladocerans were important to the removal of fecal coliforms in wtp systems whereas burnet et al 2017 demonstrated in laboratory assays that these filter feeding zooplankton did not exert a significant impact on e coli population even when the zooplankton were in bloom concentrations laboratory experiments by mickalide and kuehn 2019 demonstrated different survival patterns when e coli was present with algae or ciliate predators versus algae plus ciliates it is known that av provide a niche habitat for zooplankton and macroinvertebrates that may prey on various bacteria species watkins et al 1983 additionally the quantity and quality of the av habitat percentage of co occurring cyanobacteria can impact the predator community structure bolduc et al 2016 henesy et al 2021 and predator fitness fyda et al 2010 paerl and otten 2013 sukenik et al 2015 however the direct effect algae and or av communities and community shifts on e coli predators needs to be further examined in drinking recreational agricultural and aquaculture waters 3 outlook a wide spectrum of research opportunities and technology developments is created by the multiplicity of interactions among e coli algae and av as well as the multifaceted impacts of these interactions particularly when global climate change and the need to safeguard environmental and human health from water borne pathogens is considered global climate change is rapidly altering the aquatic environment via temporal and spatial shifts in rain drought cycle driven nutrient pulses and temperature anomalies and thus the relationships between aquatic organisms is being altered too cavicchioli et al 2019 with this in mind researchers engineers and resource managers alike need to understand the biological interactions of e coli within the aquatic environment utilize standard microbial water quality monitoring practices and incorporate emerging technologies as a means to offer the best environmental and human health safeguards with many complex questions surrounding algal bacterial interactions left largely unresolved the application of omics approaches will likely surge over the next several years a diverse omics based analysis could lead to a collective characterization and insight on biological questions involving genetic alterations metabolites and community composition reviewed in cooper and smith 2015 the decreased cost and increased availability of genomic sequencing should aid in the exploration of genetic material sharing by e coli via horizontal gene transfer an area with limited exploration beyond what matsui et al 2003 reported nearly 20 years ago metagenomic approaches can shed light on the identification classification and relative abundance of bacteria within assorted biotic mixtures without cultivation and may ultimately uncover unrecognized algal associated e coli populations for example ling et al 2020 used 16s rdna sequencing to fully characterize the bacterial diversity found associated with several understudied micro algal species using a more complex functional metagenomics analysis nitschke et al 2020 established bacterial genera present within phenotypically distinct bacterial algal communities while elucidating differences in metabolic pathways similar approaches could uncover factors influencing e coli survival within the phycosphere gene expression approaches i e proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics can inform on the micro scale activities transpiring between bacteria and algae and can complement microbiome compilations by answering not just the question of which bacteria are present and dominant but the levels of gene expression and functions of the different bacterial taxa such detailed datasets have only begun to be assembled and explored krohn molt et al 2017 applied these tools to the microalgal bacterial microbiome of specific phycosphere biofilms to characterize on a community level bacterial phylogeny differential gene expression and functional relevance of proteins found therein on larger scales satellite remote sensing is a fast developing resource being used to characterize aquatic habitats water quality monitoring programs worldwide conduct routine surveillance to protect human health from toxins produced by habs and from various pathogens such as e coli enterococcus spp and vibrio spp initially monitored by screening discrete water samples for toxins and or pathogens this labor and time intensive practice is now routinely being augmented through the use of satellite remote sensing coupled with forecasting models developed using data from long term monitoring programs in marine and estuarine waters optical discrimination of absorption backscatter and chlorophyll a anomalies are used to identify dinoflagellate and diatom blooms tomlinson et al 2009 anderson et al 2011 soto et al 2015 wolny et al 2020 in freshwater cyanobacteria blooms are identified in satellite imagery using a spectral shape algorithm wynne et al 2008 2010 while pathogenic bacteria cannot be monitored directly the use of satellite derived temperature precipitation solar radiance turbidity wave and wind action and submarine groundwater discharge data in non linear models coupled with satellite imagery can help identify areas of degraded water quality likely to support pathogenic bacteria populations laureano rosario et al 2019 schollaert uz et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 a suite of hyperspectral sensors being designed for deployment on several nasa satellite missions launching after 2022 will provide the increased spectral temporal and spatial resolution needed for observing algae bacteria and their synergistic effects in global waters schollaert uz et al 2019 werdell et al 2019 ahead of these missions research should focus on determining the severity and extent of these algae bacteria interactions and the most useful predictive models for human and environmental health safeguards such as those in place for the detection of vibrio parahaemolyticus in chesapeake bay deluca et al 2020 bacteria laden plume waters on the southern california coast nezlin et al 2008 and e coli and diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins produced by various hab species in the uk s coastal shellfish aquaculture facilities schmidt et al 2018 however there is less data and consequently fewer predictive models in development for e coli in agricultural irrigation waters pachepsky et al 2016 though the need is there since the in situ autonomous monitoring devices currently available are cost prohibitive and not designed for long term deployments andres et al 2018 small unmanned aerial systems suas or drones provide new opportunities to estimate algal populations and other water quality parameters in e coli habitats the high spatial and temporal density of measurements as well as relative low cost makes using drones very attractive two research avenues are emerging with this technology one consists of applying machine learning methods and building empirical models to estimate e coli concentrations from imagery morgan et al 2020 another consists of applying bio optical algorithms to estimate water quality parameters that affect e coli concentrations including algal population density and then using models that allows for the prediction of e coli populations from the water quality parameters giardino et al 2015 pyo et al 2016 mathematical modeling of algal bacterial interactions remains to be developed a conceptual model seen in fig 5 was presented by natrah et al 2014 to date this conceptual model has not been converted into a mathematical model for conditions in recreational and agricultural irrigation waters a model such as this is needed for several reasons first the variability of data on e coli die offs in the literature is massive a large range in e coli inactivation rates from 0 2 to 43 6 d 1 has been reported for algal systems this type of model should help to narrow this range by indicating the major factors and interactions for site specific conditions second because of the complexity of aquatic ecosystems changes in algal populations create no single but simultaneously several effects on e coli survival results of model development are encouraging and thought provoking for example mathematical models showed that a mutualistic situation could occur with the introduction of carbon flow from algae to bacteria even if algae and bacteria compete with each other for inorganic phosphorus yasuaki and hisao 2001 zuñiga et al 2020 have developed a robust modeling framework that quantifies the metabolic drivers of numerous phototrophs this should help researchers understand the microbial community structure and function modeling algae bacteria consortiums explains the dynamics of wastewater treatment solimeno et al 2019 however focused work is needed to address differences in site specific situations in natural water settings the conceptual model in fig 5 creates an efficient road map for planning experiments that would elucidate reasons for qualitative and quantitative differences in the survival of different bacteria in the presence of various algae such differences were observed for example with e coli and vibrio cholerae mezrioui et al 1994 and enterococci taxa and c perfringens al tameemi and kadhim 2019 in the presence of green algae in the wastewater environment however future research should turn attention to natural waters to test the applicability of the conceptual model of natrah et al 2014 to cyanobacteria species where there is less certainty about positive or negative algal bacterial interactions and a growing global concern over cyanobacteria induced declines in water quality 4 conclusions interactions of algal populations and av with e coli occur via a multitude of mechanisms these mechanisms have been studied and understood to different extents and will be impacted by predicted climate change scenarios algae and av can provide nutrition and shelter to e coli but can also make water quality unfavorable for e coli predicting the site specific outcome of these trends is the grand challenge for microbial water quality theory and applications interactions of e coli with algae and av need to be considered on different scales scales of interest encompass the range from the molecular scale where horizontal gene transfer and strain differences are important to the landscape scale where monitoring is needed to delineate zones of different favorability for e coli similarly temporal scales of interest span an extensive range that include diurnal oscillations and seasonality research in e coli algae interactions has a great number of possible directions the expansion of predictive abilities regarding the fate of e coli appears to be one of the critical success metrics with many potentially significant predictors and uncertainty in their relative importance machine learning methods should have many successful applications the effect of algae and av on e coli is a matter of public health in most situations progress in this field requires a multidisciplinary effort the authors hope that this review will facilitate interactions between specialists of different backgrounds working on microbial water quality declaration of competing interest the authors have no competing interests to declare 
16384,both algae and bacteria are essential inhabitants of surface waters their presence is of ecological significance and sometimes of public health concern triggering various control actions interactions of microalgae macroalgae submerged aquatic vegetation and bacteria appear to be important phenomena necessitating a deeper understanding by those involved in research and management of microbial water quality given the long standing reliance on escherichia coli as an indicator of the potential presence of pathogens in natural waters understanding its biology in aquatic systems is necessary the major effects of algae and aquatic vegetation on e coli growth and survival including changes in the nutrient supply modification of water properties and constituents impact on sunlight radiation penetration survival as related to substrate attachment algal mediation of secondary habitats and survival inhibition due to the release of toxic substances and antibiotics are discussed in this review an examination of horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic resistance potential strain specific interactions effects on the microbial microalgae and grazer community structure and hydrodynamic controls is given outlooks due to existing and expected consequences of climate change and advances in observation technologies via high resolution satellite imaging unmanned aerial vehicles drones and mathematical modeling are additionally covered the multiplicity of interactions among bacteria algae and aquatic vegetation as well as multifaceted impacts of these interactions create a wide spectrum of research opportunities and technology developments keywords microbial water quality nutrient supply phycosphere oxygen forms radiation penetration biofilms algal mats antibacterial substances 1 introduction algae aquatic vegetation and bacteria are essential inhabitants of the aquatic environment and their presence is of ecological and sometimes public health significance total coliforms and particularly fecal coliforms have historically been used to monitor for fecal contamination in various water sources and subsequent water treatment efficacy escherichia coli is part of a larger group of fecal coliforms an assortment of bacterial species mainly sourced from feces and the focus of many monitoring and research efforts since numerous e coli serotypes can cause human illness if ingested kaper et al 2004 jang et al 2017 hence the presence of e coli in natural waters is used as the chief indicator of microbial water quality for recreation agricultural irrigation aquaculture and efficiency of water treatment price and wildeboer 2017 monitoring for the presence of e coli is also used to evaluate agricultural aquacultural and urban management practices on lands surrounding surface waters petersen and hubbart 2020 improvements in understanding interactions of e coli with various constituents in the aquatic environment lead to better interpretation of monitoring results and better decisions for water quality management natural waters also contain populations of algae aquatic vegetation av grazers and or nutrients that can change e coli concentrations or alter the aquatic community structure the aquatic environment constituents considered in this review are algae including macro and microalgae periphyton benthic algae and cyanobacteria also referred to as blue green algae and aquatic vegetation av algae and av are known to supply carbon compete with e coli for nutrients modify the water chemistry shelter e coli from solar radiation and release toxins and stimulants vanden heuvel et al 2010 fuentes et al 2016 wu et al 2021 different types of algae and av can have different impacts on e coli survival by altering e coli populations algae and av can consequently affect any e coli based evaluation of the effectiveness of land based practices such as waste management livestock feeding operations stormwater control recreational activities and conservation practices on microbial water quality conversely changes in land based practices e g agricultural practices may indirectly affect e coli populations via the impact on algae and av in particular practices causing or controlling eutrophication may influence algal populations and consequently affect the conditions e coli has adapted to for survival similarly algicide applications used to control algal populations can influence e coli survival via a change in algal and av community composition and concentrations climate change and extreme weather events present an additional challenge to resource managers and researchers tasked with monitoring and predicting both algal blooms and pathogenic bacteria movement and concentrations within the aquatic environment the global warming processes most often considered when assessing aquatic ecosystem impacts are intensified precipitation events that increase nutrient delivery processes via run off followed by prolonged droughts that lead to increased water temperatures and thermal stratification over a longer period reidmiller et al 2018 these actions create conditions that favor the growth development and maintenance of harmful algal blooms habs and cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms cyanohabs in marine and freshwater environments such as those used as aquaculture agriculture and drinking water sources cyanohabs in warmer waters often result in increased thermal stratification and the formation of surface scums which provide additional competitive advantages for cyanobacteria compared to eukaryotic algae in freshwater systems huisman et al 2004 kardinaal et al 2007 a scenario which can promote the growth of e coli mezrioui et al 1994 vijayavel et al 2013 likewise the risk of transmission of pathogenic bacteria such as cryptosporidium spp and e coli into public drinking and recreational waters is increased with precipitation events as more frequent or extreme storm events such as predicted with climate change can overwhelm sewer systems and lead to overflows that contaminate these waters patz et al 2008 2014 thus providing additional opportunities for synergistic cyanobacteria pathogenic bacteria interactions the predicted increase and intensification of cyanohabs due to climate change also could create a scenario in which e coli concentrations and occurrences in the aquatic system would increase and require greater resource monitoring efforts for environmental and public health safety blaustein et al 2013 described e coli survival rates across various temperatures in six different types of waters and hypothesized that interactions with algae and algal toxins may influence survival work by lee et al 2016 and halac et al 2019 concluded that hydrographic and water temperature conditions were more important in predicting the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria associated with cyanobacteria than nutrient conditions similarly bomo et al 2011 demonstrated that there are species specific interactions between cyanobacteria and pathogenic bacteria with the toxigenic cyanobacteria expected to proliferate under predicted climatic changes e g microcystis and anabaena influencing the growth and survival of e coli however other authors have determined that toxic substances such as microcystins produced by numerous bloom forming cyanobacteria species are detrimental to e coli dixon et al 2004 valdor and aboal 2007 halac et al 2019 consequently while the risk to human health from toxin producing cyanohabs may increase under future climate scenarios the human health risk from pathogenic bacteria may decrease however more research is needed with regards to cyanobacteria blooms that do not produce toxins estimated to be approximately 75 of global cyanobacteria blooms groendahl and fink 2017 yet would provide the substrate and nutrient sources needed for the proliferation of e coli in this scenario the predation of e coli by grazers may be lessened by predicted climate change driven ecological shifts that promote the growth of cyanobacteria over other algal species as both toxic and non toxic cyanoshabs often lead to reduced grazer fitness in the natural aquatic environment fyda et al 2010 paerl and otten 2013 sukenik et al 2015 it has been noted that some algal and cyanobacterial exudates have a stimulatory effect on bacteria including stimulation of bacterial dna synthesis murray et al 1986 enhancement of bacterial horizontal gene transfer matsui et al 2003 increased bacterial biofilm formation espeland and wetzel 2001 as well as bacteria community composition shifts van hannen et al 1999 however the impact and extent to which these factors promote or inhibit e coli success in natural waters is largely unexplored the community involved in the detection monitoring prediction and management of bacterial pathogens and indicators in natural waters is very diverse it includes not only microbiologists and phycologists there are many engineering technical modeling professionals who are becoming involved in microbial water quality assessments for agricultural irrigation recreational and aquaculture water sources this audience can benefit from a conceptual overview of interactions between e coli algae and av as a knowledge base for elucidating the dynamics of microbial water quality and developing environmental monitoring and management schemes to improve water quality especially as climate change adds additional human and environmental health and food safety concerns providing such an overview is the objective of this paper which summarizes and discusses the state of the knowledge about algae and av effects on microbial water quality with an emphasis on e coli as the primary indicator organism used routinely in many monitoring designs and management decisions in the microbial water quality field 2 major effects of algae and av on e coli survival fig 1 presents the major aspects of algae and av effects on bacteria survival in natural water environments that are reviewed here with a focus on e coli gurung et al 1999 quero et al 2015 and ramanan et al 2016 detail the role of algae and av derived carbon and other nutrients in the aquatic environment both algal and av photosynthetic and decomposition processes release carbon and other nutrients which are used by bacteria in various mutualistic and competitive relationships algae and av provide surfaces for the development of biofilms which become productive habitats for bacteria quero et al 2015 jang et al 2017 and can promote or inhibit zooplankton grazer populations reche et al 1997 paerl and otten 2013 both algae and av can alter the sunlight energy transfer in water thus shielding bacteria from radiative damage but can also cause negative effects on bacteria through photosynthetic processes that change oxygen forms and ph to conditions that are unfavorable for bacteria summarized in curtis 2003 work demonstrating the toxicity of algal substances to bacteria has been on going since the 1940s pratt et al 1944 with current research focusing on the effects of cyanobacteria toxins on e coli martin et al 2017 when considering competition between these organisms for nitrogen phosphorus carbon and microelements and the role that grazers play in the bacterial algal and av community structures the resulting interactions between these constituents appear to be convoluted with feedback loops and interrelations this complex system of interactions manifests itself in many controls exerted on e coli populations in natural aquatic environments 2 1 changes in the nutrient supply 2 1 1 carbon in the phycosphere algal exudates influence bacteria in the vicinity of algae the term phycosphere used for the first time in 1972 was defined as a zone that may exist extending outward from an algal cell or colony for an undefined distance in which the bacterial growth is stimulated by the extracellular products of the alga bell and mitchell 1972 the phycosphere is one of the most ignored yet distinctive aquatic habitats for bacteria cho et al 2015 kim et al 2014 lee et al 2013 ramanan et al 2015 sapp et al 2007 within the phycosphere high concentrations of fixed organic carbon are available for consumption as compared to the vast oligotrophic surroundings in marine and fresh waters algae release carbon to avoid photoinhibition cherrier et al 2015 as bacteria are usually limited by cell generated energy for nutrient transport they can be highly dependent on algal organic carbon exudates for their energy supply jansson 1988 this relationship has been considered a form of commensalism in which bacteria growth and survival is limited by carbon produced by the algae more so than nutrient availability in the phycosphere gurung et al 1999 microalgae exudate is composed mainly of carbohydrates followed by different nitrogenous compounds and vitamins myklestad 1995 underwood et al 2004 watanabe et al 2008 the relationship between the green alga chlorella vulgaris and e coli in nutrient replete conditions was described as mutualistic by both delgadillo mirquez et al 2016 and žitnik et al 2019 wherein the bacteria used the oxygen produced by the algae to oxidize organic matter and produced co2 essential for algal photosynthetic activity in return similarly cho et al 2015 demonstrated that algae supply fixed organic carbon to a consortium of mutualistic bacteria mostly belonging to plant growth promoting bacteria and bacteria in return supply dissolved inorganic carbon and low molecular weight organic carbon for algal consumption in aquatic systems bacterial growth is often limited by algal supplied carbon daufresne et al 2008 wyatt and turetsky 2015 thus conditions that prevent or slow algal population development result in low fecal coliform including e coli concentrations maestre valero et al 2011 reported that in covered reservoirs where the reduction in water temperature and solar radiation limited algal photosynthetic activity the shortage of organic matter and cooler water temperature led to a very low concentration of fecal coliforms and e coli similarly suppression of algal biomass due to the presence of duckweed mats led to anoxic and neutral pond conditions and the removal of 99 7 of e coli and 91 8 of enterococci cells papadopoulos and tsihrintzis 2011 2 1 2 competition for nutrients the relationship between bacteria and algae concerning nutrients has been regarded as competitive gurung et al 1999 at low nutrient concentrations an increase in algal derived organic carbon can stimulate the growth of the bacteria community because bacteria are more biologically efficient at low nutrient concentration currie and kalff 1984 suttle et al 1990 rothhaupt and giide 1992 drakare 2002 at high nutrient concentrations however algae can take up nutrients predominantly over bacteria due to greater maximum uptake rates gurung et al 1999 the type of relationship between bacteria and algae depends on environmental conditions gurung et al 1999 when light is abundant relative to nutrients algae fix carbon in surplus and subsequently exude large amounts of it lancelot 1983 in such a situation bacterial growth is nutrient limited because organic carbon availability is greater than nutrient availability however at low light nutrient ratios algae excrete less organic carbon due to lower photosynthetic rates and bacteria become energy limited because of an organic carbon deficit gurung et al 1999 thus competitive interactions between bacteria and algae are expected to be more intense at higher light nutrient ratios while commensalism would be promoted at lower light nutrient ratios phosphorus is the nutrient often used to demonstrate the switch between algae and bacteria relationship types bratbak and thingstad 1985 when the growth of algae and bacteria is limited only by phosphorus the interaction between them is competitive however when bacterial growth is also limited by organic carbon the interaction between algae and bacteria becomes more complex liu et al 2012 the interplay between light intensity and phosphorus concentrations as factors determining the relationship between algae and heterotrophic bacteria was elucidated in experiments by gurung et al 1999 using the green alga scenedesmus acutus and bacteria from a freshwater lake in japan gurung et al 1999 found that bacteria were carbon limited at a light intensity 55 µe m 2 s 1 thus indicating a commensal relationship between algae and bacteria fig 2 above that light intensity bacteria suffered from an organic carbon deficit rather than phosphorus limitation because of low algal biomass which reduced the phosphorus supply however at moderate phosphorus supply rates and light intensities 55 µe m 2 s 1 bacterial growth was limited by phosphorus rather than organic carbon because the carbon supply derived from algae exceeded the phosphorus supply relative to bacterial demand fig 2c further increases in the phosphorus supply reduced or eliminated phosphorus limitation for both algae and bacteria fig 2d thus competitive interaction was most intense at a moderate phosphorus supply rate fig 2c these results demonstrated that there is a shift between commensalism for carbon and competition for phosphorus depending on light intensity and nutrient supply rate gurung et al 1999 in mesocosm experiments examining the interactions of algae and heterotrophic bacteria liu et al 2012 found that the addition of carbon as glucose immediately resulted in the decline of chlorophyll a this was attributed to inorganic nutrient competition between the algae and bacteria carbon additions such as glucose stimulate bacterial growth and activity which in turn alters the nutrients available to algae and changes the competitive relationships between algae and bacteria a similar effect was observed by joint et al 2002 danovaro 1998 and cotner et al 2010 all of whom noted large increases in bacterial activity with the addition of glucose the addition of glucose across a range of concentrations resulted in a decline of algal biomass which was explained by the ability of heterotrophic bacteria to outcompete the algae for available inorganic nutrients nutrient availability appears to control the switch from mutualism to competition in laboratory experiments designed to examine the relationship between e coli and c vulgaris at a constant temperature light and regulated ph žitnik et al 2019 in this laboratory study the electrical conductance ec of the solution was used as the measure of nutrient availability with an ec 1569 µs cm indicating a high nutrient concentration žitnik et al 2019 found at an ec 1569 µs cm e coli concentrations were high regardless of the presence of c vulgaris whereas at an ec 1569 µs cm the presence of high concentrations of c vulgaris 1 107 cells ml 1 inhibited the growth of e coli but below this algal cell concentration the ability of c vulgaris to inhibit the growth of e coli declined the adaptive response of e coli to being outcompeted in nutrient deficient conditions involves genetic mutations that increase the efficiency of usage or uptake of the limiting nutrient halac et al 2019 roose et al 2020 halac et al 2019 described two different forms of adaptive strategies under the nutrient limitation that affect cellular physiology in different ways adaptation to nitrogen starvation caused changes that resulted in increased nitrogen scavenging ability of e coli adaptation to magnesium starvation initiated restructuring of the cell s outer membrane to a configuration that allows magnesium to be redistributed to other biological processes roose et al 2020 demonstrated the abundance of bacterial nir and nos genes in response to nitrogen pulses in newly constructed and established wetlands that allowed the bacterial community to compete with benthic algae for limited nitrogen resources e coli competes not only with algae but also with other bacteria in natural freshwater environments nutrient additions did not affect microbial concentrations including e coli concentrations in the water column in mesocosm experiments conducted by gregory et al 2017 however e coli populations associated with the benthos sediment did show a growth response work by barnard et al 2017 showed that the introduction of spirogyra grevilleana a benthic green alga to a biofiltration system reduced the concentrations of both e coli and nitrogen constituents as the interest in benthic algal populations grows for a variety of human and environmental health reasons bouma gregson et al 2017 the interplay of benthic algae benthic cyanobacteria and the microbiome including e coli should be examined more thoroughly 2 1 3 lysis of algal cells at the onset of algal cell death there is usually a large initial release of soluble materials amounting to 20 50 of the cell s organic content depinto and verhoff 1977 cole 1982 the released dissolved organic matter includes significant carbohydrate 52 and biodegradable 55 to 74 fractions bouteleux et al 2005 the organic matter and soluble materials from dead algal cells can be rapidly metabolized by bacteria both in the laboratory and under natural conditions iturriaga and hoppe 1977 cole 1982 these substances are always composed of polysaccharides glucanes glucose polymers belonging to the family of starches or laminarines bouteleux et al 2005 biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc released by algae was the preferred substrate for e coli growth in the laboratory experiments of bouteleux et al 2005 in this study the addition of algogenic organic matter aom from chlorinated natural waters led to an e coli growth equivalent to that of tap water without addition while the addition of aom from ozonated natural waters allowed a 4 to 12 fold increase in e coli growth rates compared to tap water without bdoc addition bouteleux et al 2005 further demonstrated that conditions and reasons for algal cell lysis can affect the suitability of the lysed material to be a nutritious substrate for e coli specifically after ozonation in which aom particles are broken into smaller biodegradable units that are more quickly assimilated by bacteria the aom particles in the bouteleux et al 2005 study were composed of a mixture of very diverse organic compounds of which approximately 50 were identified as sugars other nutritive elements such as growth factors vitamins amino acids siderophores trace elements and organic cofactors are all possibly part of aom mixes and help facilitate the survival of heterotrophic bacteria including e coli in addition to death and decay processes algal reproduction can provide a nutrient pool for example during mating chlamydomonas reinhardtii a species of green algae releases a lytic factor a substance that breaks down the cell wall allowing for fusion of gametes this digestion releases soluble carbohydrates in amounts up to 3 10 6 pg cell 1 within a few hours solter and gibor 1977 2 2 modification of water properties and constituents 2 2 1 changes in oxygen concentrations and forms algal photosynthetic activity results in ph elevation and increased oxygenation but respiration processes and organic matter oxidation also affect the dissolved oxygen do concentrations in aquatic environments on a diurnal cycle ansa et al 2011 cheng et al 2013 limited research regarding the impacts of oxygen concentrations on bacteria has been conducted in natural waters but increased oxygenation in wastewater treatment ponds wtps or lagoons attributed to algal abundance has been observed to affect fecal bacteria die off due to the production of toxic oxygen species curtis et al 1992 liu et al 2016 this occurs due to the presence of sensitizers i e light absorbing compounds which transfer energy to other molecules photooxidation is the process where endogenous or exogenous sensitizers absorb light and transfer energy to other molecules leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros when ros including singlet oxygen superoxide hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals are formed through these energy transfer reactions microorganisms can be damaged curtis et al 1992 observations of this effect in freshwater environments are scarce the work by ansa et al 2011 for a tropical lake in ghana presents an example as do some studies in wtps in these examples an increased efficacy of the removal of bacteria was attributed to algae mediated elevated oxygen concentrations that lead to photooxidation ansa et al 2011 2015 liu et al 2016 curtis 1990 and curtis et al 1992 showed that ph and ros concentrations play a proportional role to the survival of e coli in wtps with less damage to e coli occurring at ph concentrations below 8 al tameemi and kadhim 2019 found that the presence of the green algae mougeotia sp and nostochopsis sp in wtps increased the do 20 mg l 1 and ph 10 6 to concentrations that were detrimental to e coli algae induced changes in ph and do have a demonstrated seasonality in temperate and tropical climates creating seasonal patterns in e coli removal efficiency in wtps in temperate environments liu et al 2016 and liang et al 2018 noted that removal efficiencies of pathogenic microorganisms during wastewater treatment over a year were highly variable with higher removal efficiencies documented in the summer and fall seasons correlating with the presence of dense algal blooms similarly in tropical riverine waters allam and el gemaizy 2015 found that when summer algal populations were densest e coli concentrations were lowest 2 2 2 changes in ph diurnal variation in co2 concentration occurs as a result of photosynthesis dubinsky and rotem 1974 in natural environments dubinsky and rotem 1974 and laboratory mesocosm experiments vasker et al 2021 this diurnal fluctuation in ph is described as a do concentration peak in mid afternoon and falling to a minimum concentration overnight as photosynthesis ceases but respiration continues more work has been done in wtps than in natural environments to elucidate this effect on coliform bacteria in wtps gray 2004 and amengual morro et al 2012 reported that during periods of rapid photosynthesis algal demand for co2 exceeds that produced by bacterial respiration carbonate and bicarbonate ions dissociate to produce co2 which is used by the algae and hydroxyl ions which accumulate and can raise the ph to above 10 this ph imbalance between day and night inactivates coliforms due to algal photosynthetic activity exceeding bacterial respiration during the daytime amengual morro et al 2012 diurnal variation in ph in eutrophic lakes may negatively affect e coli survival even if ph does not reach critical basic high values given as ph 9 5 by parhad and rao 1974 and awuah 2006 interactions of ph and other factors on e coli survival have not systematically been studied in natural water environments davies colley et al 1997 1999 found that light related inactivation of e coli is dependent on ph in wtps under elevated ph conditions ph 8 5 e coli is inactivated by exogenous mechanisms while endogenous mechanisms inactivate e coli more slowly under moderate ph conditions the effects of ph on e coli have been attributed to conformational changes in the membrane of the bacteria both bosshard et al 2010a b and curtis et al 1994 found that bacterial inactivation resulted from respiratory chain damage that caused a physical breakdown in the membrane that exposed nucleic acids to environmental stresses 2 3 impact of solar radiation penetration the sunlight mediated e coli inactivation largely depends on the medium in which bacteria are present and the degree of solar exposure dias et al 2017 algae can reduce or enhance the harmful effects of sunlight on bacteria by impeding light penetration and increasing do concentrations curtis et al 1992 light attenuation by algae can partially compensate for the harm to fecal coliforms caused by algal photosynthesis in the form of increased do and ph concentrations that cause photooxidation curtis et al 1994 showed that different algal concentrations affected light attenuation with short wavelength spectra being more impacted by algal biomass than long wavelength spectra in turbid aquatic systems light is attenuated exponentially as a function of chlorophyll a derived from algae resulting in an exponential decrease in light penetration in response to a small increase in chlorophyll a grobbelaar 1989 curtis et al 1994 dokulil 1994 in natural ponds solar radiation penetration decreases with increased algal biomass van der steen et al 2000 light attenuation can also impede the e coli inactivation caused by the presence of endogenous sensitizers such compounds are present within e coli and other coliform cells bolton et al 2010 the photosensitizer related inactivation of e coli was first studied for uv b radiation reed 1997 davies colley et al 1999 and more recently was determined to occur across the entire visible light spectrum kadir and nelson 2014 uv b radiation 290 320 nm creates direct dna damage in e coli cells shilton 2005 typically damage from uv b radiation only occurs in the top few centimeters of water because of increasing par attenuation rates with depth due to the presence of surface water algal biomass increased in colored dissolved organic material cdom and turbidity causing materials van der steen et al 2000 shilton 2005 maraccini et al 2016 farrell et al 2018 maraccini et al 2016 noted species specific responses to solar inactivation with e coli being less affected by solar damage in highly turbid waters than enterococcus faecalis huber et al 2011 demonstrated that turbidity causing materials can impact uv inactivation through various mechanisms including scattering and absorption of incident uv light and shielding of bacteria protozoa and viruses preventing sufficient uv doses for pathogen inactivation diurnal dynamics of e coli concentrations in freshwater sources are complex lian et al 2018 found that the uv b dose delivery schedule the combination of dose rate and exposure time influences the inactivation of e coli and ms 2 an e coli bacteriophage at all uv b doses investigated in optically clear water through this work two inactivation phases were identified a uv b dose rate limited inactivation phase and a dose rate saturation inactivation phase algae also have unique diurnal cycles hansson 1995 and the synergistic effect of this with e coli diurnal cycles and uv radiation have not been investigated extended survival of e coli and salmonella enterica ser typhimurium in the presence of the green alga cladophora was attributed to the algae mediated protection from uv irradiation via the production of exudates beckinghausen et al 2014 the production of secondary metabolites that offer photoprotection is summarized in klisch and häder 2008 and carreto and carignan 2011 such effect was observed with mycosporines and mycosporine like amino acids maas which are low molecular weight water soluble molecules that absorb uv radiation in the wavelength range of 310 365 nm and possibly scavenge o2 these substances exhibited a sunscreen like function preventing growth inhibition of e coli in both marine and freshwater suh et al 2003 oren and gunde cimerman 2007 rastogi et al 2015 2 4 algae mediated secondary habitats 2 4 1 biofilms surfaces of water bodies rocks sediments and submerged aquatic vegetation may be covered with algae mediated biofilms that present a suitable habitat for bacteria mats that form on the surface of water or rocks are typically composed of epiphytic algae cyanobacteria detritus and sediments many cyanobacteria species frequently establish biofilms on water surfaces which cause human health risks due to the presence of algal toxins paerl et al 2000 bomo et al 2011 these biofilms represent a nutrient rich environment that promotes the growth and survival of various bacteria for example the densities of e coli mpn enterococci mpn and clostridium perfringens cfu attached to mats of the cyanobacteria lyngbya wollei averaged 3 5 3 2 and 3 2 log g 1 respectively vijayavel et al 2013 similarly dratchev et al 1957 found that concentrations of e coli in surface films and foams were 100 1000 times greater than concentrations in the underlying water phototrophs can survive in natural biofilms formed on a variety of substrates such as rocks without known organic carbon and energy sources cockell et al 2011 adding a new dimension to studies on the growth of algae and bacteria in extreme environments both bacteria and algae survive in extreme conditions by secreting high levels of extracellular polymeric substances eps including organic carbon special ice active substances like glycoproteins which change the physicochemical surroundings of the immediate environment can be secreted to help support biological functions in extreme conditions ramanan et al 2016 algae and cyanobacteria biofilms form on spider webs with coastal water evaporation being the sole source of nutrients azua bustos et al 2012 wierzchos et al 2015 found a diversity of cyanobacteria and bacteria living in gypsum deposits in the atacama desert in which the cyanobacteria formed a protective environment for the bacterial community periphyton communities composed of algae protozoa and fungi that grow attached to benthic surfaces provide a suitable habitat for bacterial growth ksoll et al 2007 periphyton in sediment biofilms supported a sizable e coli population that exhibited seasonal dynamics ranging from 102 to 104 cfu gdw 1 in the summer and from 100 to 104 cfu gdw 1 in the winter stocker et al 2019 staley et al 2011 surmised that decreases in the water column algae populations likely led to the increase of periphyton in the system through mesocosm experiments conducted through lighted and darkened conditions after the agrochemical atrazine was applied significantly higher e coli densities were found in the sediments of illuminated microcosms and there was a strong negative trend in the correlation between algae in the water column and e coli densities in the sediments staley et al 2011 2 4 2 attachment to micro and macroalgae association of e coli with planktonic microalgae appears to exhibit a complex dependence on species strains and level on nutrients in the water fang et al 2022 results of microcosm research allowed authors to suggest that e coli and enterococci showed little association with three green microalgae species while three opportunistic pathogen species had the propensity to form such association in another microcosm study perkins et al 2016 also found no correlation between e coli and particles although detachment of e coli cells from algal surface is plausible the factors that cause this and rates of detachment have not been elucidated so far ansa et al 2011 simulated the shear stress caused detachment after one and three days of introduction of e coli in microcosms with algae similar numbers of detached cells were found for both days whereas the e coli concentrations in solution decreased attached e coli can receive necessary carbon from the algae it is associated with fang et al 2022 thus algae die off may initiate the detachment since the level of nutrients in water can control the bacteria attachment to algae a change in this level may also cause detachment studies of release of e coli from bottom sediments showed that e coli moves from sediment to water column in absence of shear stress possibly due to chemotaxis pachepsky et al 2017 park et al 2017 it is not known if this type of detachment may occur with e coli associated with algae macroalgae provide excellent attachment conditions for e coli attached e coli were abundant accounting for up to 3250 cfu g 1 of algal material in the work of quero et al 2015 macroalgal associated e coli isolates belonged to all phylogroups including pathogenic ones and escherichia cryptic clades quero et al 2015 mathai et al 2019 quero et al 2019 showed that isolates of e coli obtained from various benthic macroalgae species hadpotential to grow even at in situ temperatures using only algal extracts as the source of carbon and nutrients these same isolates also had the ability to produce biofilms in vitro the genotypic diversity of the attached e coli isolates was high with significant differences between those found associated with algae and the e coli populations in the overlying water quero et al 2015 found that the algal attached e coli populations consisted of both resident and transient strains likely resulting from the heterogeneous input of fecal bacteria from the surrounding urban environment and that the abundance of algal attached e coli was positively correlated with e coli abundance in overlying waters much work has been done to study the relationship between fecal indicator bacteria and annual blooms of cladophora in lake michigan and these studies can be used as a reference point for other investigations high densities of e coli among other enterococci have been observed in attached and free floating cladophora mats at densities often exceeding 100 000 cfu g 1 algal material byappanahalli et al 2003 englebert et al 2008b ishii et al 2006 van den huevel et al 2010 within lake michigan cladophora appears to stimulate the growth and naturalization of bacteria and concentrations of bacteria significantly decreased with increasing distance from algal mats in nearshore waters verhougstraete et al 2010 environmental conditions appear to play a role in the movement and survival of e coli and human pathogenic bacteria salmonella spp campylobacter spp shigella spp and shiga toxin producing e coli stec within the lake release of e coli from cladophora mats to surrounding water was attributed to wave action whitman et al 2003 englebert et al 2008a also noted that strong wind and wave influences were required to dislodge bacteria from cladophora during low energy conditions low wind and wave action small amounts of bacteria were released from cladophora mats but these organisms did not show long term survival when free floating in the water englebert et al 2008a the presence of e coli within cladophora mats is correlated with temperature whitman et al 2003 ksoll et al 2007 during warmer summer temperatures bacteria concentrations are highest in cladophora mats and require more intense wave or wind action to dislodge the bacteria from the algal material as water temperature decreases the cladophora habitat breaks down resulting in greater numbers of bacteria being released to the surrounding water verhougstraete et al 2010 whitman et al 2003 and englebert et al 2008b found that e coli and enterococci survived much longer 45 days in association with cladophora mats than other pathogenic bacteria species while other human pathogens such as salmonella spp and shigella spp were found in 40 to 100 of cladophora samples collected from lake michigan ishii et al 2006 these species were only able to survive outside of the cladophora mats for 10 and 2 days respectively englebert et al 2008b quero et al 2015 demonstrated that e coli can be associated with macroalgae other than cladophora and that bacterial abundance was highly variable on both spatial and temporal scales however zulkifly et al 2012 found microscopic evidence for a diverse bacterial community associated with cladophora glomerata and molecular evidence for ca 100 distinct sequences classifiable to genus at an 80 confidence level or species at a 96 97 confidence level within nine bacterial phyla but did not find e coli or related human pathogens this highlights the importance of considering algal species identifications as well as life cycle stages biochemical composition nutrient availability and temporal and spatial variability when examining the factors that influence bacteria adhesion attachment to macroalgae filamentous green algae decreased populations of bacteria in the water column ansa et al 2011 found that the attachment of fecal bacteria to macroalgae and suspended solids in eutrophic lakes is a potential natural means of removal of bacterial pathogens e coli may attach to each other to algae and to suspended particles this aggregate forming process is commonly viewed as the mechanism that causes the removal of coliforms from the suspended state cheng et al 2013 settling does not necessarily occur though but can be mediated when bacteria bind together with large organic molecules forming aggregates hess erga et al 2008 liu et al 2013 mamane et al 2008 wu et al 2005 in the absence of settling algae related attachment appeared to stimulate bacterial growth in microcosm experiments badgley et al 2012 in their laboratory study the increase of algae attached e coli concentrations did not appear to come from the continuing transition of e coli from the water column to the algal filaments over time when normalized to the scale of the entire microcosm the total population of e coli in microcosms containing algae grew more than one order of magnitude over the initial inoculum size algal microcosms also allowed for greater persistence of e coli over time when compared to bacterial persistence in microcosms without algae the observed e coli growth after additional input of nitrogen suggests that algae are capable of supplying enough carbon to support sustained long term growth of attached e coli in large scale systems this supply of photosynthetically fixed carbon in addition to protection from other detrimental effects such as ultraviolet light may be why algae are a favorable substrate for e coli bouteleux et al 2005 microscopic observations done using a gfp labeled e coli strain supported the hypothesis that the growth of e coli occurred directly on algal filaments fig 3 the number of fluorescent e coli colonies that were observed to be attached to algal filaments increased over time indicating an increasing population size algal mats washed onto beaches may get buried in the sand by wave action or human activities where they are protected from sunlight and desiccation here indicator bacteria may multiply due to available nutrients from the decomposing mats the beach sand can serve as a source of indicator bacteria for the nearshore water especially when waves resuspend buried mats whitman et al 2003 byappanahalli et al 2006 gubelit and vainshtein 2011 found similar cladophora enteric bacteria interactions along the eastern gulf of finland shoreline particularly in regions where water salinities were below 2 ppt 2 4 3 submerged aquatic vegetation submerged av have the potential to harbor and disperse e coli and other bacterial pathogens in a large number of water bodies staley et al 2012 eurasian watermilfoil ewm harbored elevated densities of e coli and several potential pathogenic bacteria groups including aeromonas enterobacteriaceae and clostridium mathai et al 2019 these authors observed that ewm could serve as a temporal source for transmission of microbiota to the water column a significant difference in chemical composition distribution pattern community structure of av and bacterial population was attributed to seasonality geospatial niches and nutritional potential of several av species by othman and haroon 2020 the presence of wetland plants decreased populations of e coli via mechanisms of filtration antibiosis attachment production of antimicrobial substances and increases in microbial competition karim 1999 karim et al 2008 observed a decrease in populations of e coli s enterica ser typhimurium bacteriophages ms 2 and poliovirus in wetland environments and attributed the die off to increased microbial competition or predation pitlo and dawson 1990 noted that the presence of submerged av in water sources increased the bed and bank roughness causing decreased flow rates and increased water quality and e coli survival 2 5 survival inhibition due to release of toxic substances and antibiotics 2 5 1 toxic and antibacterial substances the release of substances toxic to coliform bacteria by algae was first suggested by sieburth and pratt 1962 and was often cited as a possible factor of bacterial die off many algal taxa release substances inhibitory to bacteria cole 1982 ansa et al 2011 one of the most common algal toxins found in the freshwater environment is microcystin a hepatotoxin produced by numerous cyanobacteria species harke et al 2016 while this toxin can be lethal to domestic and wild animals and detrimental to humans harke et al 2016 it does not have a strong antibacterial action on e coli dixon et al 2004 and increased concentrations of microcystin may prolong the growth cycle of e coli yang et al 2008 cyanobacteria have also been identified as a source of biologically active compounds with antibacterial properties østensvik et al 1998 abed et al 2009 bomo et al 2011 aqueous methanol and other organic solvents found in cyanobacteria extracts possess antibacterial properties kellam and walker 1989 frankmölle et al 1992 falch et al 1995 fig 4 demonstrates this effect using the cyanobacterium tychonema bourrellyi and several bacteria species secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria are associated with toxic hormonal antineoplastic and antimicrobial effects carmichael 1992 patterson et al 1994 these antimicrobial substances may target various kinds of microorganisms including prokaryotes and eukaryotes østensvik et al 1998 however a negative association between cyanobacteria and fecal coliforms was reported by halac et al 2019 for the periods when high 3 2 104 to 1 2 106 cells ml 1 cyanobacteria cell concentration occurred halac et al 2019 showed that both e coli and enterococcus spp had decreased growth rates in the presence of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa leading the authors to hypothesize that the high cell concentration found during microcystis blooms could inhibit bacteria growth although both species of bacteria were negatively affected by the presence of m aeruginosa e coli was more sensitive than enterococcus spp similarly martin et al 2017 exposed e coli to 1 and 10 mg l 1 microcystin lr and found no evidence that this toxin induced oxidative or cell envelope stress dziallas and grossart 2011 woodhouse et al 2015 and su et al 2017 among others suggest that the relationship between environmental cyanobacteria blooms and fecal indicator bacteria is complex with temperature do concentrations algal bloom stage nutrient availability and co occurring bacteria community dynamics all playing a role in toxin production and interaction antibiotics are one group of substances that can be released by algae and can affect bacteria survival the first antibiotic to be isolated from algae chlorella pyrenoidosa and c vulgaris was chlorellin which was effective against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria including staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pyogenes bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa pratt et al 1944 since this early work numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate the antibiotic compounds made by algae summarized in de morais et al 2015 and how these compounds may interact with bacteria summarized in shannon and abu ghannam 2016 2 5 2 interference with bacteria quorum sensing qs quorum sensing qs bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density gram positive and gram negative bacteria use qs communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities that include symbiosis virulence competence conjugation antibiotic production motility sporulation and biofilm formation miller and bassler 2001 qs interference has been shown to occur between algae and bacterial biofilms reviewed in joint et al 2007 and rivas et al 2010 qs can be inhibited or stimulated depending on the algal species qs is well pronounced in e coli populations surette et al 1999 sperandino et al 2003 tests using e coli jb523 showed that one freshwater and five marine microalgae species exhibited quorum sensing inhibitory activity whereas two algal species stimulated quorum sensing regulated gene expression natrah et al 2011 several marine macroalgae were able to disrupt bacterial qs activities reviewed in dobretsov et al 2009 and natrah et al 2011 and some bacteria have been shown to use qs to regulate algicidal activities against toxigenic cyanobacteria wu et al 2017 but more research needs to be conducted using e coli and algae that typically co occur with it in natural waters 2 6 horizontal gene transfer the genetic makeup of both bacteria and algae is changing due to horizontal gene transfer hgt in the phycosphere kouzuma and watanabe 2015 a plausible consequence of this evolutionary process can be the acquisition and subsequent expression of antibiotic resistant genes in algae the study of antibiotic resistant gene expression in algae is currently in its infancy and the impact on both human health through routes of exposure such as recreational water contact agricultural irrigation waters on fresh produce or within aquaculture waters and gene transfer to bacteria cohabitating in the phycosphere has yet to be determined it is not known whether habs which occur throughout all water types are increasing hgt rates that could lead to antibiotic resistance though it has been documented that hgt from bacteria to algae aids algae in adapting to environmental extremes schönknecht et al 2013 raymond and remias 2019 the strain specific differences in e coli algae interactions begin with the expression of specific genes heo et al 2019 reported the results of a genome wide exploration of e coli genes that promote growth in c vulgaris these authors identified four genes riba ribd ribe and ssue that exerted a growth promoting effect on c vulgaris there is consortia of algae and bacteria that can be efficient in the detoxification of organic and inorganic pollutants removal of nutrients from wastewaters and bioenergy production compared to the efficacy of individual microorganisms subashchandrabose et al 2011 shetty et al 2019 thus it could be beneficial to improve our understanding of which expressed genes influence the efficiency of these processes the issue of e coli strain variability is not adequately addressed in current environmental studies on algae av e coli interactions and its importance presents a research question to explore 2 7 predation of e coli relatively little is known about the effect of algae and av on the activity of predators controlling the population of e coli in natural waters work presented by ansa et al 2012 reported that cladocerans were important to the removal of fecal coliforms in wtp systems whereas burnet et al 2017 demonstrated in laboratory assays that these filter feeding zooplankton did not exert a significant impact on e coli population even when the zooplankton were in bloom concentrations laboratory experiments by mickalide and kuehn 2019 demonstrated different survival patterns when e coli was present with algae or ciliate predators versus algae plus ciliates it is known that av provide a niche habitat for zooplankton and macroinvertebrates that may prey on various bacteria species watkins et al 1983 additionally the quantity and quality of the av habitat percentage of co occurring cyanobacteria can impact the predator community structure bolduc et al 2016 henesy et al 2021 and predator fitness fyda et al 2010 paerl and otten 2013 sukenik et al 2015 however the direct effect algae and or av communities and community shifts on e coli predators needs to be further examined in drinking recreational agricultural and aquaculture waters 3 outlook a wide spectrum of research opportunities and technology developments is created by the multiplicity of interactions among e coli algae and av as well as the multifaceted impacts of these interactions particularly when global climate change and the need to safeguard environmental and human health from water borne pathogens is considered global climate change is rapidly altering the aquatic environment via temporal and spatial shifts in rain drought cycle driven nutrient pulses and temperature anomalies and thus the relationships between aquatic organisms is being altered too cavicchioli et al 2019 with this in mind researchers engineers and resource managers alike need to understand the biological interactions of e coli within the aquatic environment utilize standard microbial water quality monitoring practices and incorporate emerging technologies as a means to offer the best environmental and human health safeguards with many complex questions surrounding algal bacterial interactions left largely unresolved the application of omics approaches will likely surge over the next several years a diverse omics based analysis could lead to a collective characterization and insight on biological questions involving genetic alterations metabolites and community composition reviewed in cooper and smith 2015 the decreased cost and increased availability of genomic sequencing should aid in the exploration of genetic material sharing by e coli via horizontal gene transfer an area with limited exploration beyond what matsui et al 2003 reported nearly 20 years ago metagenomic approaches can shed light on the identification classification and relative abundance of bacteria within assorted biotic mixtures without cultivation and may ultimately uncover unrecognized algal associated e coli populations for example ling et al 2020 used 16s rdna sequencing to fully characterize the bacterial diversity found associated with several understudied micro algal species using a more complex functional metagenomics analysis nitschke et al 2020 established bacterial genera present within phenotypically distinct bacterial algal communities while elucidating differences in metabolic pathways similar approaches could uncover factors influencing e coli survival within the phycosphere gene expression approaches i e proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics can inform on the micro scale activities transpiring between bacteria and algae and can complement microbiome compilations by answering not just the question of which bacteria are present and dominant but the levels of gene expression and functions of the different bacterial taxa such detailed datasets have only begun to be assembled and explored krohn molt et al 2017 applied these tools to the microalgal bacterial microbiome of specific phycosphere biofilms to characterize on a community level bacterial phylogeny differential gene expression and functional relevance of proteins found therein on larger scales satellite remote sensing is a fast developing resource being used to characterize aquatic habitats water quality monitoring programs worldwide conduct routine surveillance to protect human health from toxins produced by habs and from various pathogens such as e coli enterococcus spp and vibrio spp initially monitored by screening discrete water samples for toxins and or pathogens this labor and time intensive practice is now routinely being augmented through the use of satellite remote sensing coupled with forecasting models developed using data from long term monitoring programs in marine and estuarine waters optical discrimination of absorption backscatter and chlorophyll a anomalies are used to identify dinoflagellate and diatom blooms tomlinson et al 2009 anderson et al 2011 soto et al 2015 wolny et al 2020 in freshwater cyanobacteria blooms are identified in satellite imagery using a spectral shape algorithm wynne et al 2008 2010 while pathogenic bacteria cannot be monitored directly the use of satellite derived temperature precipitation solar radiance turbidity wave and wind action and submarine groundwater discharge data in non linear models coupled with satellite imagery can help identify areas of degraded water quality likely to support pathogenic bacteria populations laureano rosario et al 2019 schollaert uz et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 a suite of hyperspectral sensors being designed for deployment on several nasa satellite missions launching after 2022 will provide the increased spectral temporal and spatial resolution needed for observing algae bacteria and their synergistic effects in global waters schollaert uz et al 2019 werdell et al 2019 ahead of these missions research should focus on determining the severity and extent of these algae bacteria interactions and the most useful predictive models for human and environmental health safeguards such as those in place for the detection of vibrio parahaemolyticus in chesapeake bay deluca et al 2020 bacteria laden plume waters on the southern california coast nezlin et al 2008 and e coli and diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins produced by various hab species in the uk s coastal shellfish aquaculture facilities schmidt et al 2018 however there is less data and consequently fewer predictive models in development for e coli in agricultural irrigation waters pachepsky et al 2016 though the need is there since the in situ autonomous monitoring devices currently available are cost prohibitive and not designed for long term deployments andres et al 2018 small unmanned aerial systems suas or drones provide new opportunities to estimate algal populations and other water quality parameters in e coli habitats the high spatial and temporal density of measurements as well as relative low cost makes using drones very attractive two research avenues are emerging with this technology one consists of applying machine learning methods and building empirical models to estimate e coli concentrations from imagery morgan et al 2020 another consists of applying bio optical algorithms to estimate water quality parameters that affect e coli concentrations including algal population density and then using models that allows for the prediction of e coli populations from the water quality parameters giardino et al 2015 pyo et al 2016 mathematical modeling of algal bacterial interactions remains to be developed a conceptual model seen in fig 5 was presented by natrah et al 2014 to date this conceptual model has not been converted into a mathematical model for conditions in recreational and agricultural irrigation waters a model such as this is needed for several reasons first the variability of data on e coli die offs in the literature is massive a large range in e coli inactivation rates from 0 2 to 43 6 d 1 has been reported for algal systems this type of model should help to narrow this range by indicating the major factors and interactions for site specific conditions second because of the complexity of aquatic ecosystems changes in algal populations create no single but simultaneously several effects on e coli survival results of model development are encouraging and thought provoking for example mathematical models showed that a mutualistic situation could occur with the introduction of carbon flow from algae to bacteria even if algae and bacteria compete with each other for inorganic phosphorus yasuaki and hisao 2001 zuñiga et al 2020 have developed a robust modeling framework that quantifies the metabolic drivers of numerous phototrophs this should help researchers understand the microbial community structure and function modeling algae bacteria consortiums explains the dynamics of wastewater treatment solimeno et al 2019 however focused work is needed to address differences in site specific situations in natural water settings the conceptual model in fig 5 creates an efficient road map for planning experiments that would elucidate reasons for qualitative and quantitative differences in the survival of different bacteria in the presence of various algae such differences were observed for example with e coli and vibrio cholerae mezrioui et al 1994 and enterococci taxa and c perfringens al tameemi and kadhim 2019 in the presence of green algae in the wastewater environment however future research should turn attention to natural waters to test the applicability of the conceptual model of natrah et al 2014 to cyanobacteria species where there is less certainty about positive or negative algal bacterial interactions and a growing global concern over cyanobacteria induced declines in water quality 4 conclusions interactions of algal populations and av with e coli occur via a multitude of mechanisms these mechanisms have been studied and understood to different extents and will be impacted by predicted climate change scenarios algae and av can provide nutrition and shelter to e coli but can also make water quality unfavorable for e coli predicting the site specific outcome of these trends is the grand challenge for microbial water quality theory and applications interactions of e coli with algae and av need to be considered on different scales scales of interest encompass the range from the molecular scale where horizontal gene transfer and strain differences are important to the landscape scale where monitoring is needed to delineate zones of different favorability for e coli similarly temporal scales of interest span an extensive range that include diurnal oscillations and seasonality research in e coli algae interactions has a great number of possible directions the expansion of predictive abilities regarding the fate of e coli appears to be one of the critical success metrics with many potentially significant predictors and uncertainty in their relative importance machine learning methods should have many successful applications the effect of algae and av on e coli is a matter of public health in most situations progress in this field requires a multidisciplinary effort the authors hope that this review will facilitate interactions between specialists of different backgrounds working on microbial water quality declaration of competing interest the authors have no competing interests to declare
