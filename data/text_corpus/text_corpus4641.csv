23205,two dimensional added mass and radiation damping data of vugts 1968 related to heaving rectangular sections in deep water are represented by empirical formulas although other data exist the vugts data are considered to be the standard in experimental planar motion hydrodynamics research of basic geometries of many floating bodies including those of several wave energy conversion systems the present empirical effort was undertaken to make the vugts results useful in strip theory analyses of the heaving and pitching motions of slender vessels having rectangular sections for approximate predictions of the hydrodynamic coefficients added mass and radiation damping of these systems the empirical expressions provide manageable analytical expressions in the derivations the behaviors of the parametric constants for each coefficient are found to be approximate rectilinear functions of the beam to draft ratio the applicability of the empirical expressions is enhanced by this finding keywords hydrodynamic coefficients strip theory rectangular section 1 introduction the prediction of wave induced motions of slender barge shaped bodies can be performed with good accuracy by using the strip theory a two dimensional theory slender bodies are those for which the beam and draft are much smaller than the vessel length the strip theory has its foundation in fluid mechanics and its application to floating bodies was first done by krylov 1896 according to pedersen 2000 the strip theory was revised over a half century later by korvin kroukovsky 1955 the method as presented by that author was later corrected and refined by korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 the work of these authors was further modified by motora 1964 those referenced papers describe the application of the strip theory to the planar motions of ships in regular seas the theory was expanded by salvesen et al 1970 that work is considered to be the cornerstone of contemporary ship motion analysis using the strip theory an excellent review of the linear strip theory is presented by bishop and price 1979 there have been several formulations of nonlinear strip theories one of the earliest of these is the quadratic theory of jensen and pedersen 1979 more recently fan and wilson 2004 present a time domain non linear strip theory the basics of strip theory are described by mccormick 2010 2014 other advances in the strip theory include those of journée 1992 and bandyk and beck 2009 of interest herein are the deep water two dimensional hydrodynamic inertial and damping force terms in the equations of motion the former force term is due to the inertial reaction of the ambient water to body motion while the latter is due to the body motion induced surface waves that carry energy from the body the most accurate method available to determination of these two dimensional hydrodynamic forces is that incorporating boundary elements and numerical solution techniques see for example the paper of koo and kim 2015 the applications of numerical techniques are somewhat expensive depending on the software package used in this paper empirical expressions for rectangular sections are presented to represent the frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping coefficients of the equations of motions furthermore the expressions include the beam to draft ratio effects on the hydrodynamic coefficients this aspect greatly expands the applicability of the equations 2 empirical and experimental added mass and radiation damping coefficients the prediction of the performance of a rectangular barge system depends to a great extent on the expressions for the added mass and radiation damping coefficients in the equations of motion consider the rectangular barge section sketched in fig 1 although not shown the barge has a length l that is much greater than both the beam b and draft d the barge then can be considered to be a hydrodynamically slender body by doing so the strip theory can be used with rather good accuracy the error associated with the use of two dimensional strip theory is not significant if the slender body conditions are satisfied as discussed by newman 1977 the experimentally determined two dimensional hydrodynamic coefficients of vugts 1968 are directed at the use of the strip theory 2 1 added mass coefficient consider first the dimensionless added mass coefficient μ defined as the ratio of the added mass and the displaced mass both per unit body length vugts 1968 presents results of this coefficient as a function of the deep water wave number k 0 parameter defined as 1 ζ ω b 2 g k o b 2 the deep water wave number is k o 2π λo where λo is the deep water wavelength also in eq 1 are the gravitational acceleration g the uniform beam b of the section and the circular frequency of the heaving motion ω the experimental data of vugts 1968 for this coefficient over the dimensionaless wave number range of approximately 0 5 ζ k 0 b 2 1 2 1 75 are presented in fig 2 for ζ 0 35 it appears that the data can be represented by the following expression 2 μ m w ρ b d a b j 0 c ζ n here m w is the added mass per unit length of the barge section a b c and n are to be determined parametric constants d is the barge draft and ρ is the mass density of the displaced water the prime is used to indicate per unit length the function j 0 in eq 2 is the bessel function of the first kind zero order the vugts data in fig 2 are found to have one minimum point and one inflection point it is these points upon which in part this empirical analysis is based let the value μ1 correspond to the minimum point in a data set at ζ1 at that point the slope of the μ ζ curve then equals zero d dζ 1 0 the inflection point is that at which the second derivative curve is zero d 2 dζ2 2 0 in addition to these points we choose the next point where dμ dζ 4 0 and specify that the infinite frequency value μ4 is at that point for a given b d value μ4 is approximately obtained from the formula derived by mccormick and hudson 2008 which is the following 3 μ 1 2 π b d 4 d 2 b 2 ln 4 d 2 b 2 1 4 d 2 b 2 ln 1 4 d 2 b 2 8 d b tan 1 b 2 d 2 π 2 values obtained from this equation for the vugts 1968 experiment are presented in fig 2 as stated four conditions are required to determine the four parametric constants in eq 2 referring to vugts 1968 data in fig 1 the conditions used here are as follows a the slope of the μ ζ curve is zero at ζ1 where ζ1 0 mathematically the condition is dμ dζ 1 0 in order to satisfy this condition j 1 cζ1 n j 1 q1 0 where the argument of the bessel function is 4 c ζ 1 n q 1 3 8317 note if n 1 0 the ζ1 can equal 0 however that condition does not result in the behavior of vugts data the numerical value is approximately that given by abramowitz and stegun 1965 and others b the approximate value of μ1 at ζ1 is obtained from the data in fig 2a as illustrated in fig 2b c the second derivative of the μ ζ curve is zero at ζ2 where ζ2 ζ1 illustrated in fig 2b mathematically we write d 2μ dζ2 ζ2 0 although the ζ2 value is a little difficult to identify for the data in fig 2 it can be identified with an error of about 0 05 for the b d 2 and 4 data hence these data are used to determine the argument of the bessel function in eq 2 using the notation introduced in eq 4 the bessel function argument is 5 q 2 c ζ 2 n which is unknown combine equations 4 and 5 by eliminating c and then solve for n the result can be combined with the condition needed to satisfy the condition d 2μ dζ2 ζ2 0 to obtain the following equation 6 n 1 q 2 j 1 q 2 j 0 q 2 ln q 1 q 2 ln ζ 1 ζ 2 the values of point coordinates ζ1 μ1 ζ2 and μ2 are found to be approximate rectilinear functions of b d these functions are the following 7 ζ 1 0 0817 b d 0 4768 8 μ 1 0 3167 b d 0 1667 9 ζ 2 0 1067 b d 1 1467 and 10 μ 2 0 4000 b d 0 3000 curves resulting from equation 7 through 10 are presented in fig 3 the coefficients a and b in eq 2 are evaluated by simultaneously solving the following equations resulting from the respective applications of eq 2 to points 1 and 2 11 μ 1 0 3167 b d 0 1667 a b j 0 q 1 here the approximation of μ2 is from eq 10 the value of q1 is in eq 4 while the q2 values are in table 1 the results obtained from solving equations 10 and 11 for a and b are in table 2 with the calculated values of c resulting from either equation 3 or 4 again the results of the empirical dimensionless added mass coefficient are presented in fig 2 with the measured values of vugts 1968 2 2 radiation damping the vugts 1968 radiation damping data for a rectangular section is presented in fig 4 with curves resulting from the application of eq 12 the behavior of the experimental data leads to the expression in eq 12 that is the assumed expression for the non dimensional two dimensional radiation damping coefficient is 12 υ b r ρ b d b 2 g a ζ b e cζ here b r is the radiation damping coefficient per unit body length the expression for ζ is as presented for eq 1 the parametric coefficients a b and c must be determined as will be shown these are parametric constants that depend on the breadth to draft ratio b d the subscripts r identifies the damping coefficient as that resulting from radiation from a heaving strip the data in fig 4 have two apparent points of interest the first of these is the maximum corresponding to the condition of dυ dζ 0 while the second is the inflection point where d 2υ dζ2 0 these points are identified by the italicized subscripts 1 and 2 respectively the first is the maximum data point υ 1 ζ 1 and the second is υ 2 ζ 2 the approximate values of these points based on the b d are presented in table 3 the relationships between the point values b d are approximately rectilinear as a result these can be well approximated by the following equations 13 ζ 1 0 0467 b d 0 377 14 υ 1 0 313 b d 0 257 15 ζ 2 0 090 b d 0 060 and 16 υ 2 0 225 b d 0 180 plots obtained from equation 14 through 17 are presented in fig 5 by applying the zero slope and inflection point conditions at υ 1 ζ 1 and υ 2 ζ 2 the parametric constants b a and c in eq 13 are respectively found to be as follows 17 b 1 ζ 2 ζ 1 1 2 18 a υ 1 e 1 ζ 1 b and 19 c b ζ 1 values of a b and c for fig 5 plots are presented in table 4 3 comparison of empirical theoretical numerical and cfd results in order to obtain an idea of the advantage of using the empirical results of section 2 in strip theory analyses the results are compared with selected theoretical numerical analyses and 194 computational fluid dynamics studies of selected vugts 1968 rectangular section data there are several theoretical expressions for the radiation damping coefficients according to petersen and marnæs 1989 these include those presented by holstein 1937 havelock 1942 ursell 1954 tasai 1959 and yamamoto et al 1980 in addition mccormick 1987 modified the method presented in morse and ingard 1968 in the application to motion prediction of hinged barge floating systems these are based on the irrotational flow assumption where singularities are distributed over the two dimensional section the derivations of these coefficients are based on the energy comparison of the body motion and that of the radiated waves from both sides of the body in addition bonfiglio et al 2011 apply both a theoretical numerical analysis and a computational fluid dynamics cfd to selected results from vugts 1968 in that study the theoretical analyses result from applications of the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse method to the rectangular sectioned body the cfd analysis results from application of interdymfoam from the openfoam collection to the rectangular section 3 1 added mass coefficient the results presented in fig 6 result are the theoretical and cfd curves of bonfiglio et al 2011 and the empirical curves applied to the vugts 1968 rectangular section as in fig 2 the deep water results are over a range 0 ζ 2 the results show that the theoretical analysis under predicts the added mass when ζ 0 5 the amount of under prediction increases as ζ increases for the ζ less than approximately 0 5 considered to be the low frequency range of ζ vugts 1968 concludes that the deviations in the added mass data are due to experimental inaccuracies he writes only in the low frequency range ωob 2g 0 5 deviations appear especially in the added mass this is due to experimental inaccuracies the inaccuracies to which vugts 1968 refers are the differences between the experimental data and the expected behavior hence a true comparison of the empirical and theoretical results and the experimental data cannot be performed for ζ 0 5 however the expected behavior is approximately that of the empirical curves over this ζ range the openfoam cfd results in fig 6 are for ζ 0 5 over approximately 0 5 ζ 1 0 the cfd results compare well with the experimental data for ζ 1 0 the cfd analysis under predicts the experimental data although by a lesser amount that the theoretical results 3 2 radiation damping coefficient the deep water radiation damping coefficient expression from havelock 1942 tasai 1959 and yamamoto et al 1980 is of the form 20 b r 4 ρ g 2 ω 3 e 2 ω 2 g d sin 2 ω 2 g b 2 combine this expression with those in equation 1 and the vugts coefficient in eq 13 to obtain thefollowing 21 υ b d e 4 ζ 2 d b ζ 3 si n 2 ζ 2 for comparison results obtained from this equation are presented in fig 7 with the results obtained using eq 13 from fig 7 the reader can see that the comparison of the experimental data and those obtained by using eq 21 decreases as the beam to draft b d ratio increases the radiation damping coefficient results from bonfiglio et al 2011 for b d 2 are presented in fig 8 the comparison of the theoretical data with the experimental data is quite good for selected data points over 0 2 ζ 1 2 the cfd results show an over prediction for ζ 1 25 the empirical curve under predicts the data for ζ 0 4 the reason for this under prediction is that the data points chosen to obtain the coefficient values in eq 13 were done so to better satisfy the high frequency high k o results 4 discussion and conclusions in engineering studies of the dynamics heaving and pitching of floating bodies having rectangular sections the strip theory method was and is widely used to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients added mass and radiation damping in the equations of motion the hydrodynamic coefficients represented by empirical expressions can result in an increase in prediction accuracy and a reduction in analytical complexity with this in mind the respective added mass and radiation damping coefficient expressions in equations 2 and 12 are presented those expressions are based on the deep water experimental data of vugts 1968 in addition to those expressions in equations 2 and 12 a number of other relationships were tried to accurately represent the experimental data the value of the results of the chosen empirical hydrodynamic coefficients is in their seemingly wide applicability in the seakeeping analysis of box sections using the strip theory in the empirical equations are parametric coefficients which depend on the beam to draft b d ratio these parametric coefficients a b and c for the added mass expression in eq 2 are seen to have approximate straight line relationships with the beam to draft b d as can be seen in fig 3 similarly straight line relationships for the parametric coefficients a b and c in the radiation damping expression in eq 12 are seen in fig 5 one can conclude that these relationships approximately hold for a b d range that well exceeds the value of 8 the comparisons of the empirical and experimental added mass coefficients with the theoretical and cfd added mass results of bonfiglio et al 2011 presented in fig 6 show that the agreement of both theoretical and cfd results decrease with an increasing ζ for ζ 1 this is the higher frequency range of heaving motions the reason for the disagreements is speculative it is possible that eddy motions have a significant contribution to the added mass value that is not readily predicted in fig 7 are the data obtained from the havelock 1942 equation eq 21 this potential flow expression is similar to those of tasai 1959 and yamamoto et al 1980 the reader can see that the results obtained from eq 21 do not compare well with the experimental and empirical results furthermore the comparison worsens as the beam to depth ratio b d increases in fig 7 based on the vugts 1968 data the empirical hydrodynamic coefficient expressions appear to be appropriate for use in an engineering application of the strip theory to the analyses of slender box lighter geometries the empirical equations are readily applicable to various b d values for ζ 0 4 for both the added mass and radiation damping coefficient predictions

mechanical energy however such turbines suffer from low aerodynamic efficiency low powers produced and narrow operating range the current work proposes the operating principle of using water as the working fluid rather than air by submerging the wells turbine in the sea water to enhance its performance this gives an advantage for the turbine operation with a fluid having specific weight higher fluid than air the analysis is carried out for an innovative device proposed by boccotti in which a vertical axis hydraulic wells turbine installed inside a vertical duct and contained in a caisson below the sea water surface the cfd simulations are performed depend on the steady 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans calculations on this type of axial turbine rotor with realizable k ε turbulence model a comparative analysis between the computational results and experimental results is carried out and a good agreement is found between both results this paper proved that the hydraulic immersed wells turbine performance is better than that of the air conventional wells turbine a substantial improvement in the torque coefficient is achieved with the hydraulic turbine of about 1 4 times the torque of the conventional air turbine using water as a working fluid which is the proposed concept leads to a wider operating range unlike using air in addition the effects of blade profile and rotor solidity on the turbine performance were clarified computationally in this work two kinds of symmetric blade profiles have been used naca 0015 and s1046 the present computational investigation was carried out for three rotor solidities 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 through changing the number of turbine blades 8 6 and 3 blades it is found that for a hydraulic wells turbine

sea waves which acts as oscillating water column owc is one of the methods which used to convert wave energy into electricity raghunathan 1995 presented an extensive review on the performance of different types of turbines producing power from oscillating water columns wells turbine was proposed by professor a a wells in 1976 as a self rectifying axial flow air driven turbine suitable for the owc the turbine is called wells turbine and able to convert the motion of a reversing airflow of periodic manner into mechanical energy it is an axial flow self rectifying low pressure air turbine which works continuously in one direction the turbine blades are built using symmetric airfoils and the stagger angle γ on the airfoils is set to be 90 thereby the wells turbine is able to convert the oscillating wave motion of the free water surface into bi directional air flow usually ocean waves oscillate up and down in an air chamber by reciprocating flow up and down of the wave the water compresses the air in the chamber between the water surface and the turbine the free water surface converts the oscillating wave motion into bi directional air flow through the wells turbine the main elements of the configuration are the air chamber and the wells turbine with the electrical generator fig 1 the blades of wells turbine were distributed symmetrically on the plane normal to the turbine rotation axis this type of blade arrangement gives the advantage of making the turbine insensitive to the incoming flow direction due to the symmetrical airfoils the tangential force acts on the blades only in one direction even though air flow begins to oscillate due to the contact between the flow and the turbine blades the drag force will affect the large area of the turbine blade these lift and drag forces are resolved into a tangential component f θ which introduces the torque on the blades to rotate around the turbine axis and as well as an axial component f x which creates the thrust along the turbine axis fig 2 therefore the incidence angle α of a rotating turbine blade embedded in oscillating airflow has negative and positive values with an average value of 0 considering symmetrical blade cross section the tangential force f θ will be in the same direction based on negative or positive values of the incidence angle α thus a unidirectional torque is always created from this turbine regardless of the direction of the airflow 2 state of art and research gap many research works have attempted to enhance the performance of wells turbine gato et al 1996 and curran and gato 1996 experimentally investigated the performance of various configurations of wells turbine dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 presented an investigation of the performance of wells turbine numerically in details raghunathan et al 1989 assessed the wells turbine characteristics under various inlet flow features and conditions many geometrical parameters and their effect on the performance of wells turbine like blade geometry kim et al 2001 blade setting angle setoguchi et al 2003 using end plates takao et al 2006 2007 and tip clearance torresi et al 2008a have been investigated the effect of usage of guide vanes on constant chord setoguchi et al 2001 and variable chord govardhan and dhanasekaran 1998 wells turbine blade has also been studied leakage flow from blade tip and its effect on the turbine output has been investigated either with uniform tip clearance or with non uniform tip clearance by taha et al in taha and sugiyono sawada 2010 taha et al 2011 however wells turbines equipped with guide vanes starts to stall before those without guide vanes suzuki 2005 govardhan and dhanasekaran 2002 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 recognized the important of the blade shape therefore they studied the blade profile influence and solidity on a large scale wells turbines performance they have considered various flow conditions such as sinusoidal assuming regular waves and real sea conditions irregular waves operating under bi directional unsteady flow conditions folley et al 2006 examined the performance of a contra rotating wells turbine installed in the limpet wave power station then compared the results to the corresponding data obtained from both theoretical analysis and model tests shaaban and abdel hafiz shaaban and abdel hafiz 2012 presented a numerical investigation of the effect of casing geometry on the performance of wells turbine halder and samad halder et al 2015 investigated the effect of groove casing on wells turbine performance with different values of groove depth and tip clearance halder et al 2016 carried out a three dimensional steady state simulation coupled with a multi objective optimization of blade sweep for a wells turbine a numerical simulation based on design optimization is conducted for a bidirectional wells turbine to judge the dependency of the extracted power on operating range of the turbine halder et al 2017 shaaban 2016 optimized the levelized cost of electricity lcoe of power generation from waves in plants which depends on wells turbines as converter by optimizing the radial solidity of their rotors mohamed et al 2011 introduced and developed the performance by using a multi objective optimization and cfd codes coupled with genetic algorithms in a house optimization library to maximize the torque output by maximizing the tangential force which induced by a mono plane wells turbine mohamed and shaaban 2013 2014 studied and optimized the effect of blade pitch angle of a self rectifying wells turbine to improve the performance under movable blades shehata et al 2017 developed a passive flow control method using a transient cfd analysis to improve the performance of symmetrical airfoil profile used for wells turbine working with oscillating flow in the stall regime nazeryan and lakzian 2017 investigated two blade designs the conventional design a constant thickness blade ctb and the new design a variable thickness blade vtb by solving rans equations in steady mode with sst turbulence model a blade shape modifications such as profile thickness and sweeping of the turbine with steady and unsteady flows are done using multi objective optimization based on surrogate coupled genetic algorithm halder et al 2018 an innovative owc plant is proposed by boccotti 2002 and filianoti 1991 in which the turbine is driven directly by the oscillating water flow this gives the privilege of using fluid having higher specific weight than air camporeale et al 2003 performed three dimensional unsteady flow simulations in order to predict the performance of high and low solidity wells turbines operating in boccotti s owc plant near la spezia italy coast the previous literature review highlights the limitation of operation of wells turbine due to its low performance and narrow operating range although some previous works boccotti 2002 filianoti 1991 camporeale et al 2003 have discussed the concept of immersed hydraulic wells turbine used in boccotti s owc plant for sea wave energy conversion however more intensive studies are needed in order to provide a detailed description for the different performance characteristics and the fluid dynamic behavior related to this innovative device by taking the advantage of the flexibility of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods therefore this paper aims to develop a larger analysis of immersed hydraulic wells turbines by using two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 alongside with changing the rotor solidity ranging from high solidity to low solidity overall this paper explores the effects of using oscillating water flow instead of air flow to drive the wells turbine with both blade types and suggest recommendation for future designs some parameters effects such as owc chamber and duct as well as the wave shape pattern will not included in this work maybe these parameters will be investigated in next projects as done before in hashem et al 2017 ramadan et al 2014a ramadan et al 2014a 2014a 2014b fig 3 depicts a scheme of owc plant with air or hydraulic wells turbines with vertical axes mounted inside vertical duct could be employed in order to convert a portion of the wave energy into mechanical rotational energy fig 3 a shows the traditional owc plant in which the turbine is driven by an air flux and is characterized by high solidity and high rotational speed which ranges from 500 rpm till 5000 rpm camporeale et al 2003 the wells turbine is the most common type of air turbines utilized in the owc plants due to simplicity reliability and robustness of its design an innovative owc device is patented by boccotti 2002 which allows the use of special turbines immersed inside sea water and supposed to be moved directly by means of the oscillating water flow see fig 3 b the innovative owc plant is a plant comprising a caisson breakwater with air pocket and vertical duct which is positioned to cover the whole length of the caisson breakwater where the air pocket is exist the lower part of the caisson breakwater is filled with water and the vertical duct extends outside passing through the upper wall of the caisson the upper opening of the vertical duct is usually located just beneath surface of the sea water while its lower opening does not hit the base of the caisson a compressor is used to pump air into the caisson in order to form an air pocket above the water level inside the caisson the compressor could be located either on land or on an offshore platform and the compressed air is delivered to the top of the caisson through hoses the height of the air pocket is being adjusted through valve or tap till the resonance condition is reached in this manner wells turbines with vertical axes can be installed inside the vertical duct for sea wave energy conversion purposes such operating principle is thought to produce more power output higher efficiency and wider operating range as being water of a higher specific weight and higher momentum than air moreover using water as a working fluid has the advantage of delay of separation or delay of stall condition as the stall point can be shifted towards the airfoil trailing edge hence the turbine performance could be enhanced due to the excess energy transfers to the blade by the attached flow therefore applying the proposed concept could substantially enhance the performance of wells turbines employed in the traditional owc plants in order to realize the significance of using wells turbines in sea water applications the performance of such turbines is computationally evaluated using the commercial cfd code ansys fluent the performance of this turbine is expressed in terms of torque coefficient stagnation pressure drop coefficient and turbine efficiency at different values of flow coefficient moreover a detailed study of an immersed hydraulic wells turbine with different values of rotor solidity is performed based on the innovative design of the boccotti s owc plant 3 theoretical background 3 1 governing equations computational fluid dynamics techniques are based on solving of the navier stokes equations which fully govern any fluid flow navier stokes n s equations are derived by applying the second law of newton to flow motion taking into considerations the assumption that the fluid stress is the summation of two terms which are the diffusion viscous term proportional to the velocity gradient and a pressure term the solution of the navier stokes n s equations is obtained in the form of velocity field which is a description of the fluid velocity at a given point located in certain space and time the continuity equation for approximately constant density flow incompressible flow due to low mach number m 0 3 is only function of velocity and it is not a function of pressure however the momentum equations are the only equations that contain pressure term a direct approach is followed to obtain the results of pressure by discretizing both continuity and momentum equations then solving them simultaneously a mathematical model is proposed in which the navier stokes n s equations are replaced with discretized algebraic equations that could be solved by different algorithms a suitable turbulence model is adopted to accurately predict the fluctuating velocity within a finite discretized domain consisting of volumetric mesh cells the realizable k ε model is the turbulence model used to solve the problem of turbulence modeling in the present work the governing equations for a three dimensional can be described on incompressible form neglecting the density terms as following continuity equation 1 ρ u i t ρ u i x i 0 momentum equation 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i μ 2 u i x j x j where u i and u j denotes the fluid velocities in i and j direction vectors p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and μ represents the dynamic viscosity the steady state reynold s averaged navier stokes rans mean solutions are obtained using the appropriate turbulence model rans is an additional simplification where the governing equations equations 1 and 2 are time averaged and thus the time term could be neglected 3 2 turbulence model many two equations turbulence models have been proposed in the fluid flow simulation and prediction in most of these models the turbulence kinetic energy k is considered as one of the variables but there are many different choices for the second variable the k ε model with dissipation rate ε as a second variable is the most widely used turbulence model usually the realizable k ε model is recommended for rotating zones and bodies in all previous studies and publication mohamed et al 2011 mohamed and shaaban 2013 2014 hashem and mohamed 2018 in this work the turbine blades are rotating around certain axis therefore the realizable k ε model will be retained in all the simulations the realizable k ε model which had been proposed and introduced by shih et al 1995 is a relatively recent development and differs from the standard k ε model in two remarkable points as following the realizable k ε model includes a modified equation for the turbulent flow viscosity the dissipation rate ε has a new transport equation and it is included in the realizable k ε model it is obtained from a full equation for the transport of vorticity fluctuations the meaning of realizable is that the k ε model matches certain mathematical restrictions on the reynolds stresses of turbulent flows this feature is not available in the other k ε models an advantage of the realizable k ε model is its capability to predict the pervasion rate of round jets and planar with high accuracy it shows a superior performance when dealing with flows comprising rotation boundary layers due to intensive adverse pressure gradients separation and recirculation in order to understand more about the mathematics of the realizable k ε model the boussinesq hypothesis and the eddy viscosity definition are combined together to obtain of the normal reynolds stress for incompressible flow as follow 3 u 2 2 3 k 2 ν t v x transport equations for the realizable k ε model 4 x j k u j x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k and 5 x j ε u j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε

constant however it will be variable in realizable k ε model and this is the main difference between the three models c μ can be computed from 6 c μ 1 a 0 a s k u ε where u s i j s i j ω i j ω i j the realizable k ε model constants are c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 4 methodology the total wells turbine performance is numerically investigated by solving the steady three dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans besides turbulence is modeled using the realizable k ε model the enhanced wall treatment is used in the near wall flow modeling the combination of the realizable k ε model and the enhanced wall treatment enables good prediction of the performance moving reference frame mrf technique is used to model the rotating blade in the domain the basic governing equations are solved in the absolute frame and discretized by the finite volume method using the cfd code ansys fluent many discretization schemes are used in the current work such as simplec algorithm for pressure velocity coupling standard scheme for pressure second order upwind scheme for momentum and turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ɛ the solutions are considered once the maximum residual values are reached to 10 4 the authors in the present work considered the rotor geometry which is experimentally investigated by curran and gato 1996 fig 4 shows a perspective view of geometry of the turbine model which is created based on curran and gato 1996 for validation purposes the complete simulations in this work are performed on a wells turbine rotor with two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 as shown in fig 5 all specifications of the investigated turbine model are provided in table 1 fig 6 shows a perspective view of the flow domain for the 1 8 turbine model the symmetrical shape of the turbine around the rotation axis helps the authors to use the flow domain as one blade to blade passage periodic boundaries are used on the domain sides through the tangential direction of the flow domain therefore by the periodic concept the flow domain can be extended to any number of blades in the post processing the domain has a length equals four and eight the chord length of the blade upstream and downstream of tested blade respectively as shown in fig 6 for the boundary conditions non slip stationary wall is used for the hub and the blade surfaces the casing surface is treated as a non slip moving wall because of the rotating frame of reference as mentioned before the periodic boundary condition is used for the tangential sides to obtain the repetitive characteristics of the flow around the blades at the inlet constant velocity is considered to obtain uniform flow however at outlet boundary the radial equilibrium outlet pressure boundary condition is used to well consider the radial variations of both pressure and velocity downstream the turbine blade in table 2 a summary of all parameters which has used for pre processing and boundary conditions is introduced all the computational meshes appeared in the present work are created by means of the ansys meshing fig 7 depicts the unstructured mesh consists of tetrahedral elements that employed on the whole flow domain in the present work the unstructured tetrahedral elements are substantially increased in the vicinity of wall boundaries in order to get a normalized wall distance y 1 keeping y 5 ensures the capability of resolving the viscous sub layer and consequently using wall functions could be omitted this is achieved by employing inflation or the so called prismatic layers on surface of the hub blade and casing the number of inflation layers is 20 with a growth rate of 1 3 for all wall boundaries the height of the first layer normal to the wall is set to be about 4 10 6 m to achieve y 1 at all operating conditions 4 1 mesh independence test a mesh size independence test is performed to ensure minimum influence of mesh size on the results obtained from the present numerical simulation the mesh size is increased in five gradual steps from 1 440 182 cells to 4 057 831 elements while maintaining the y value less than unity this test showed that the maximum percentage variation in rotor torque coefficient of 1 95 in efficiency of 1 85 and in stagnation pressure drop coefficient of 0 8 fig 8 illustrates the effect of mesh size on the turbine efficiency obtained from the numerical simulation at ϕ 0 15 the good quality fine mesh with total number of approximately 2 580 800 elements provided a sufficient level of mesh independency and hence it is used throughout the present work all parameters affecting the turbine performance are determined at different values of flow coefficient ϕ υ x u by changing the axial velocity υ x we can control and change the flow coefficient with considering constant rotational speed in the absolute reference frame all default values are used for the initiation and initialization of the solution regarding the convergence criteria the default values of under relaxation factors are not convenient for solution convergence to occur the present solution suffers from some difficulties in convergence particularly at high values of flow coefficients ϕ 0 225 consequently values of under relaxation factors are reduced to accelerate the convergence process table 3 shows the modified values of under relaxation factors which are implemented in the flow solver at ϕ 0 275 5 results and discussions this section mainly discusses the results obtained from a reliable cfd simulation to investigate the performance of immersed axial turbine inside water an accurate model validation by comparison the numerical results with published experimental work are presented furthermore a full description about the performance of such turbine is provided in terms of three non dimensional coefficients namely they are the torque coefficient stagnation pressure drop coefficient and turbine efficiency the calculations are carried out for various values of flow coefficient the effects of different rotor solidities 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 are also discussed in this section 5 1 model validation the computational results obtained from the present numerical simulation are validated by comparison with the experimental values of curran and gato 1996 in this study the total turbine performance is expressed in the form of three non dimensional coefficients which are torque coefficient c t stagnation pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 and turbine efficiency η the definitions of these coefficients are as follows 7 c t t ρ ω 2 r 5 where we can defined these parameters as t is the rotor torque ω is the angular velocity ρ is the air density and r is the tip radius 8 c δ p 0 δ p 0 ρ ω 2 r 2 where δ p 0 is the stagnation pressure drop 9 η t ω δ p 0 q where q is the volume flow rate in the current study the adopted methodology is validated against the experimental data reported within literature in order to obtain reliable and accurate results fig 9 present a comparison of the turbine performance on a naca 0015 blade profile between the computational and experimental results of curran and gato 1996 for tip clearance of 1 mm the torque coefficient c t stagnation pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 and turbine efficiency η are calculated and analyzed for a wide range of flow coefficients starting by flow coefficient equals ϕ 0 075 all the performance parameters has been calculated and analyzed to obtain the off design performance characteristics from figure it can be observed that the computational results of the present work are in a good agreement compared with the published experimental values of curran and gato 1996 moreover comparisons between the present values and other computational values of torresi et al 2008a shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 and halder et al folley et al 2006 are conducted to ensure that the proposed model is accepted as an analytical tool for the assessment of wells turbine performance fig 9 showed that the present results are closer to the experimental work curran and gato 1996 than other results of takao et al 2007 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 folley et al 2006 which showed an over estimation especially at high values of flow coefficient typically ϕ 0 225 as known that the stall point is decided by a decrease in the turbine torque coefficient all the computational results indicated that the stalling point is predicted at a different value of flow coefficient than the one obtained from the experiment the predicted torque coefficient in this work is slightly lower than that of the experimental one except for the stall margin while the stagnation pressure drop coefficient is almost the same hence the turbine efficiency of the present computational results before the stalling point is slightly lower see fig 9 c the value of peak efficiency obtained from the present calculation differs by approximately 6 and occurs at almost the same value of flow coefficient of experimental results ϕ 0 1 fig 9 a proved that the method introduced by shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 failed to predict the turbine performance under stall and deep stall conditions i e ϕ 0 225 however it can be observed in fig 9 that the current model succeeded to predict the stall margin with quite good accuracy compared to other computational models listed in the current work moreover the deviation in the peak efficiency predicted by shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 is calculated as 1 3 and occurs at shifted value of flow coefficient ϕ 0 15 far from that obtained experimentally on the other hand for the results of halder et al folley et al 2006 fig 9 the three parameters of its computational results are much higher than those of the experimental one the value of peak efficiency differs by approximately 6 5 and is predicted at the value of flow coefficient ϕ 0 125 which is very close to the experimental one before the stall point it is clear that the computational results of halder et al folley et al 2006 have larger deviation from the experimental results curran and gato 1996 than that of shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 however the values of halder et al folley et al 2006 have the same trend of the experimental ones furthermore the computational results obtained by torresi et al 2008a are in quite good agreement with the experimental data until incipient stall condition around ϕ 0 225 see fig 9 a the value of peak efficiency of torresi et al 2008a is accurately predicted and it differs by approximately 1 2 and occurs at a flow coefficient ϕ 0 125 which is approaching the experimental one 5 2 effect of working fluid the effect of changing the working fluid from air to water on the performance of wells turbine having two different blade profiles is investigated the symmetric naca 0015 and the s1046 airfoils are the blade profiles of the investigated turbine model in the present work and in terms of three non dimensional parameters the performance of the turbine is studied as shown in fig 10 one of the most interesting parameters affecting the turbine performance is the torque coefficient c t and its variation with flow coefficient ϕ is shown in fig 10 a the torque coefficient of the wells turbine inside water increased considerably following the same trend of the turbine efficiency for the hydraulic turbine that consists of naca 0015 as a blade profile the maximum torque coefficient c t reaches 0 15 at ϕ 0 275 as shown in fig 10 a however the maximum torque coefficient in case of air turbine is 0 12 at ϕ 0 25 this means the peak torque coefficient is improved by 36 4 relative increase based on the torque coefficient of air on the other hand the maximum torque coefficient c t of a turbine in water having s1046 blades reaches 0 17 at ϕ 0 275 however it is equal 0 11 at ϕ 0 25 when air is used as working fluid with relative increase equals 42 5 based on air value the main reason for the increased turbine torque coefficient is the higher momentum of the water and delaying of the separation despite the increase in density and viscosity of the water as a working fluid the pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 has not changed through the whole operating range as in fig 10 b the turbine efficiency of wells turbine immersed in water compared with its efficiency in air at different values of flow coefficients is shown in fig 10 c the maximum increase in turbine efficiency in water having naca 0015 blade is about 4 times its efficiency in air at flow coefficient of ϕ 0 3 however the maximum increase in the efficiency of hydraulic turbine consists of s1046 blade is about 1 8 times the efficiency of air wells turbine at the same flow coefficient for instant at turbine efficiency η 0 5 the hydraulic wells turbine of naca 0015 profile has an operating range about 1 5 times its range in air this is due to higher values of specific weight of the water than that of the air both torque coefficient and efficiency of wells turbine having s1046 blades in water are higher than its counterparts having naca 0015 blades either in air or in water the performance of immersed hydraulic turbine of naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections is better than air turbine having both profiles through the whole range of operation from ϕ 0 075 to ϕ 0 3 the stall point of the air wells turbine having the two blade sections is occurred at ϕ 0 25 while the stall point of hydraulic turbine with both profile is shifted to some higher value ϕ 0 275 than that working with air when using water flow instead of airflow it can be concluded that wells turbine works more efficient due to the higher value of the reynolds number about 14 times for density and viscosity of both air and water actually comparing the conventional air wells turbine and the immersed hydraulic wells turbine in terms of non dimensional parameters could be misleading when both machine are supposed to rotate at the same rotational speed and having the same inlet velocities as a matter of fact in the two cases the power input is completely different this can be verified looking at the values of the static pressure in the two different cases when considering immersed turbines figs 14 and 15 we have pressure levels in the order of 107 pa whereas considering air turbine we have pressure levels in the order of 104 pa in order to explain the effect of using water instead of air as a working fluid for wells turbine an investigation is also performed on the flow field around two different types of turbine blades namely naca 0015 and s1046 the flow characteristics can be explained in more detail by analyzing the flow field through the turbine for different flow regime before and after stall condition in particular the three flow conditions with ϕ 0 1 02 and 0 3 are considered the tangential velocity v θ contour lines on the plane of constant radius through 50 passage height h are plotted and illustrated in fig 11 a and b the direction of the axial flow is from the left to right sides in each figure and indicated by the blue arrow in fig 11 the red dotted lines represent the boundary layer edge while the red solid ovals symbolize the region of separated flow as shown in the two figures at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the boundary layer on the suction surface ss at the mid span is relatively thin and attached from the leading to trailing edges a separated region appears from the leading to trailing edge which is followed by a wake extending toward the downstream periodic boundary and then re entering at the upstream periodic boundary it also can be seen that the wake formed by the front side blade interacts with the boundary layer as the flow coefficient increases the separated region tends to be larger and creeps forward due to the increase of the incidence while the interaction between the wake formed by the front side blade and the boundary layer becomes weaker these phenomena excite the boundary layer to be thicker and to separate from the suction surface ss a deep separation of the boundary layer can lead to a stall condition of the turbine fig 11 a and b show comparisons of the flow patterns between turbines having naca 0015 and s1046 profiles when using air and water as working fluids respectively further it can be seen that at ϕ 0 1in fig 11 a and b there is no significant difference in the tangential velocity contour lines for the two airfoils as they have the same performance characteristics in air and water refer to fig 10 a c the difference can be seen clearly at ϕ 0 2 in which the separation region for the immersed hydraulic turbine with s1046 airfoil is smaller than the others therefore the stall condition of the immersed turbine having s1046 profile is delayed as compared to its counterpart in air it can be noted that the start of separation is slightly delayed when using naca 0015 section in water more than air referring to fig 10 a c the stall condition of the conventional air turbine occur at ϕ 0 2 however the stall condition is delayed to occur at ϕ 0 275 when the air is replaced by water this explains the wider operating range and the better performance of immersed hydraulic turbine than conventional air turbine with the same blade section at ϕ 0 2 immediately this reveals the effect of immersing turbine in water and switching to s1046 instead of traditional naca sections for the rotor of such turbine furthermore it also can be observed that the all cases result in tangential velocity contour lines almost the same at ϕ 0 3 a possible reason may be that the performance characteristics of these cases are very close except for the conventional air turbine with naca 0015 which have a lower efficiency torque and produce lower torque see fig 10 a c at ϕ 0 3 deep stall condition the boundary layer on the suction surface ss for the conventional air turbine having naca 0015 is a little bit thicker than the others which adversely affects its performance however as shown in fig 11 the boundary layer separation is investigated only on the plane of constant radius through 50 h at ϕ 0 2 a further explanation can be offered by observing fig 12 a and b in which the separated flow on different planes of constant radius is investigated fig 12 a and b present the contour lines of tangential velocity v θ around naca 0015 and s1046 blades on planes of constant radius through 10 h 50 h and 90 h respectively the figures are for conventional air conventional turbine and immersed hydraulic turbine at flow coefficient ϕ 0 2 operating condition while the direction of the axial flow is from the left to right sides in each figure and indicated by the blue arrow as shown in fig 12 considerable boundary layer separation occurs on the plane of constant radius at 90 h which is just under the tip because of the high swirling components and wakes behind the blades which grows as flow coefficient increases on the other hand this deep flow separation behavior is not encountered on the plane of constant radius at 10 h and 50 h it indicates that the stall condition of the turbine is stimulated strongly by the flow around the tip which almost is due to the tip leakage flow further it is interesting to observe in fig 12 a and b that at ϕ 0 2 the boundary layer remains attached over almost the entire blade chord on the plane at 10 h which is just above the hub however it is obvious that the boundary layer on the suction side ss of the both rotor blades naca 0015 and s046 on plane of constant radius through 50 h is much thinner than that at 10 h this effect may be owing to the excessive angle of attack near the hub mamun et al 2004 and also the interaction between the boundary layers of the hub and the blades wells turbine is often have high solidity rotors therefore it is thought that the main reason why the wells turbine blades start stalling at tip rather than at hub is related to the reduction of the interference factor between foils moving with radial outward contours of tangential velocity at h 50 indicate that there is no significant change in the flow field except for an increase in velocity with the flow coefficient when compared velocity contours at 10 and 50 of the flow passage height h with velocity contours at 90 h it can be observed that the effect of flow around the tip is more significant during stall condition than that around the hub fig 12 a and b show that the boundary layer on the rotor blade get thicker and more flow separation occurs in case of using air as a working fluid rather than using water this explains why the turbine working with air is the first to stall as deduced in raghunathan et al 1989 setoguchi et al 2003 fig 13 shows the streamlines distribution at mid span of the flow passage h 50 around naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections of air and hydraulic wells turbines at lower flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the streamlines distribution is almost the same and the flow is attached to the suction surface ss of the two blades for all cases this explains why the efficiency remains almost at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 either for air or hydraulic wells turbine see fig 10c the flow separation increases with the increase in ϕ from 0 2 to 0 3 for air turbine at higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 3 deep stall conditions are visible and separation region appears on the blade ss of both profiles because of the low pressure on it the air turbine shows a large size separation zone at ϕ 0 3 which gives a low efficiency as indicated by fig 10 c however the flow in case of hydraulic turbine has less separation at the same flow coefficient in hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 for ϕ 0 3 a wider flow separation zone appeared on its ss and a lower efficiency is obtained as compared to hydraulic turbine having s1046 the flow pattern around s1046 in water is free of any reversed or separated flow on the blade ss at ϕ 0 3 the contour lines of static pressure on pressure and suction sides of the turbine are plotted and shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively the variation in the static pressure distribution on pressure surface ps of two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 for both conventional air and hydraulic wells turbines at operating condition ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 and stall condition ϕ 3 are illustrated in fig 14 a and b respectively as illustrated in fig 14 a and b there is a high pressure region near the leading edge at pressure surface ps because of the stagnation point the region of high pressure on the pressure surface is marked in fig 14 a and b by a black solid rectangle and a black dotted line border it is interesting to note that the high static pressure in the vicinity of the leading edge of the two blade profiles increases as the flow coefficient increases due to the increase of the flow incidence angle as seen in fig 14 a at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the high pressure zone in the s1046 blade is greater than that in the naca 0015 consequently the blade loading of the air wells turbine is higher in the s1046 than the naca 0015 at these flow coefficients however the high pressure covers almost the same area at ϕ 0 3 in case of use of either blade profile on the other side it is found that the high pressure zone on the s1046 blade s surface is greater than that on naca 0015 blade s surface if the turbine is immersed in water which makes the first possessing a higher loading coefficient as shown in fig 14 b at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 it can be observed that the pressure distribution of the both types of turbines having s1046 and the naca 0015 is almost the same on the pressure and suction surfaces see figs 14 and 15 therefore the performance of both blades in air is almost the same at the low flow coefficients ϕ 0 15 in middle region of the chord static pressure also changes from hub root of the blade to tip head of the blade in normal turbine operation ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 on one hand for conventional air turbine it is computed that the region of high pressure of naca 0015 blade occupies 4 17 5 and 55 2 of chord length from the leading edge at different three flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 respectively see fig 14 a on the other hand the high pressure region of s1046 blade in air occupies 5 3 22 5 and 48 of chord length for values of flow coefficients similar to ones when naca 0015 is adopted comparatively fig 14 b indicated that the high pressure zone on the pressure surface ps of immersed hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 section covers 6 23 2 and 78 3 of chord length at values of flow coefficient namely 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 respectively while the high pressure zone in case of immersed hydraulic turbine with s1046 section covers 5 8 45 4 and 93 3 of chord length at the before mentioned values of flow coefficient in addition it can be noted clearly from the figures that the high pressure region at ϕ 0 3 exceeds the position of maximum thickness of both airfoils namely 30 c for naca 0015 and 30 8 c for s1046 therefore it leads to turbine stall however it can be observed in fig 13 b the high pressure zone at ϕ 0 2 exceeds the position of maximum thickness of s1046 blade and this explains the remarkable drop in torque coefficient of the water turbine after this value of flow coefficient exactly at ϕ 0 225 moreover when the flow coefficient increases fig 14 a and b the pressure distribution becomes non uniform in the leading edge portion near the hub due to the formation of horseshoe vortices on both blade surfaces nazeryan and lakzian 2017 the horseshoe vortices are defined as an element of end wall boundary layer flows and usually decrease the torque coefficient as they interact with the boundary layer of both hub and blade surfaces lampart 2009 at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the non uniform pressure distribution is marked in fig 14 a and b by black colored oval fig 15 a and b shows the static pressure distribution on suction surface ss of the two blade types naca 0015 and s1046 at different three flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 the higher and the lower pressure values are at the trailing edge and leading edge respectively at lower flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the pressure variance is almost the same for conventional air turbine and immersed hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 and s1046 sections from the leading edge to the trailing edge as flow coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the pressure increases from leading edge to trailing edge in all cases either naca 0015 or s1046 airfoils it is also noticed that a non uniform pressure distribution is observed on the suction surface ss of both turbine blades when the value of flow coefficient exceeds 0 2 at even higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 3 the low pressure zone in the s1046 blade 13 3 c and 21 2 c for air and water respectively is greater than that in the naca 0015 blade 8 4 c and 9 7 c for air and water respectively particularly near the tip zone of suction surface as shown in fig 15 a and b therefore this means that mainstream near the leading edge of the s1046 blade s suction surface has a higher velocity than that of the naca 0015 blade s suction surface this helps in delaying the stall and decreasing region of the separated flow at high flow coefficients from figs 14 a and 15 a it can be concluded that the blade loss for the conventional air turbine having s1046 is lower than that having naca 0015 at high flow coefficients for immersed hydraulic turbines the same conclusion also could be obtained through the operating range 0 1 ϕ 0 3 refer to fig 10 a c at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the streamlines are uniform and remain almost attached on the ss of both blade sections naca0015 and s1046 either for air or water as flow coefficient increases flow separation occurs near the trailing edge te and the streamlines become non uniform the stall point starts moving from trailing edge te to leading edge le and consequently the separated flow area becomes larger the separated flow is defined as the area measured by the distance between the separation line and the trailing edge te of the blade the separation lines are marked in fig 16 a and b by a red dotted line alongside an arrow indicating direction of the circulated flow it can be noticed that a large corner vortex is appeared near the hub te of the two blades at ϕ 0 2 in all cases except for the hydraulic turbine having s1046 a larger spiral vortex in the clockwise at ϕ 0 3 is observed near the hub le in case of air turbine having naca 0015 and s1046 besides hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 only for s1046 blade in water there is no presence for such vortex within the flow pattern on the suction surface ss at ϕ 0 3 and fig 16 b is affirming that both naca 0015 and s1046 in air have separated flow for more than 50 of the surface area at ϕ 0 3 while the separated area is much less for naca 0015 at the same flow coefficient as assigned above hydraulic turbine having s1046 is filled the ss with small size separation zone which occupies the lower portion of the blade near the te therefore it can be concluded that the stall is delayed in both cases naca and s1046 in water and it is more pronounced in case of hydraulic turbine with s1046 profile this explains the higher performance of the turbine when the wells turbine is submerged inside water fig 17 shows that the flow is usually attached at low flow coefficients and the streamlines are uniform in the tip region for both cases a and b at ϕ 0 1 the flow remains close to the blade ss under un stalled conditions at higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 2 the fluid particles pass through the tip gap with high momentum and mixes with a weak tip vortex on the ss it can be obvious in case of air and hydraulic turbines having s1046 blade section increasing the flow coefficient from ϕ 0 2 to ϕ 0 3 flow separation and stalling occurs at te in drastic manner and the tip leakage flow streamlines become highly non uniform in air turbine having both airfoil types the leakage flow from the ss crosses the tip gap towards the te and they usually mix with strong tip vortex near the ss at ϕ 0 3 similar behavior can be noticed in case of hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 however the leakage flow mix with weak tip vortex on the ss of s1046 in water at the same value of flow coefficient this is the main reason of the dramatic drop in turbine efficiency for all cases except for s1046 in water at ϕ 0 3 as shown in fig 10 c the detailed analysis of the flow field indicated that the stalling of flow does not occur first at hub region and then spread outward it appears rather to be commitment to the tip leakage vortex and tends to spread inboard from the tip region to mid span reducing the power output significantly as a matter of fact this is a unique feature of wells turbine as referred to in thakker et al 2001 torresi et al 2008b watterson and raghunathan 1996 a way to verify this is to highlight the radial vorticity component on mid span at different flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 for both air and hydraulic wells turbines for ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the flow is attached of both sides of the naca 0015 and s1046 blades in the two cases as no separation takes place at low flow coefficients the component of radial vorticity possesses positive negative values along the ss ps of the turbine blade as seen in fig 19 for higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 3 the deep stall condition is reached and separation occurs however the flow separation is more detectable in naca 0015 than s1046 fig 19 presents the contours of radial vorticity component in blade to blade planes through different flow passage heights near the hub h 10 at mid span h 50 and near the tip h 90 at ϕ 0 2 a relevant outward radial flow downstream of the rotor is remarked with a consequent decrease in the actual flow deflection toward the tip region h 90 where the flow tends to separate such a behavior effectively explained in raghunathan et al 1897 gato and de o falcao 1984 horlock 1978 and it is due to the blade cascade effect which decreases along with the solidity from hub to tip for wells turbine with constant chord blades torresi et al 2006 2008b the blade cascade effect can be highlighted at ϕ 0 2 in fig 19 moving from hub h 10 to tip h 90 the cascade pitch increases and the incoming flow from the ps becomes less effective in counteracting the separated flow on the ss of the preceding blade this effect is more obvious in air wells turbine than hydraulic turbine and this explains why air turbines is the first to stall fig 20 presents the contours of radial vorticity on the blade ss for three different flow coefficient values the separated flow areas were indicated by regions of negative radial vorticity blue along the blade suction surface ss of both blade types for air a marginal separation region is detected at the hub region near the trailing edge te at the lower portion of both blades at ϕ 0 1 a smaller separation zone can be seen in water turbine near the hub of naca 0015 but it is disappearing in case of s1046 in water this implies that the flow remains attached over the whole suction surface of the s1046 blade in water for ϕ 0 2 separation takes place at the suction side hub near the te then extends to the suction side tip near the te in air while the flow is separated and kept only at the hub region of hydraulic turbines this implies that the hub is critical and closer to stall at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 for ϕ 0 3 the deep stall condition is reached and the ss of most cases is completely filled with separated flow negative radial vorticity however the ss of hydraulic turbine consists of s1046 suffers from two discrete separation zones one at the hub region and the other near the blade tip as seen in fig 20 b the details of the flow characteristics have been carried out by means of the tangential vorticity component at the mid chord of the flow passage on x 0 the corresponding contours are shown in fig 21 for two turbine blades naca 0015 and s1046 in air and water this figure shows that in all cases a vortex with positive tangential vorticity values red is generated due to the high axial velocity of the flow in the tip region this vortex is usually referred to tip leakage vortex which originated from the surface of blade tip as it can be readily seen that the positive vortex red is stronger than the negative one blue and the two contra rotating vortices are bending toward the blade suction surface ss furthermore the radial vorticity component is affected by the cascade effect which limits the growth of the region of negative radial vorticity to the duct therefore the tendency of the flow to separation could be avoided as previously seen in figs 18 20 for air turbine the tip leakage vortex in naca 0015 is stronger than that in s1046 because of the higher axial flow velocity in the tip region similar concluding remarks are obtained for water turbines moreover it can be noticed that there is another vortex on the ss which becomes stronger as the flow coefficient increases for all cases this vortex travels away from the blade in the axial direction as it is evinced by the position of the vortex shed by the preceding blade this vortex travels more rapidly when increasing the value of the flow coefficient such vortex is not developed in hydraulic turbine with s1046 blade profile at ϕ 0 1 the boundary layer on the suction surface of the blade becomes more pronounced in naca 0015 as compared to s1046 and hence the regions of separated flow is larger in turbines consists of naca 0015 blades as highlighted in fig 21 on the other hand it can be noticed the appearance of a vortex on the pressure side ps near at the hub and is getting stronger by increasing the flow coefficient from 0 1 to 0 3 this vortex is stronger in case of using s1046 as the default blade section for wells turbine however s1046 in water doesn t show any region of separated flow near its hub on the pressures side ps at ϕ 0 1 5 3 effect of rotor solidity the rotor solidity σ is calculated by σ n c 2 π r where n is the number of blades c is the chord length and r is the radius it is obvious that varying the number of turbine blades n affects the rotor solidity σ due to its significance the effects of rotor solidity on the performance of the immersed wells turbine are investigated by varying the number of turbine blades eight and six turbine blades with the blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 airfoils at different values of flow coefficient ϕ are investigated corresponding to rotor solidity σ 0 48 and 0 64 respectively as shown in fig 22 however in order to be able to efficiently harness wave energy the solidity of the wells turbine has to be extremely low thus a lower rotor solidity σ of 0 24 is adopted which means that the hydraulic wells turbine in this work has only three blades n 3 knowing that the boccotti s owc device has a hydraulic turbine with only two blades n 2 and low rotor solidity and its speed is kept constant at 150 rpm fig 22 a reveals that decreasing the number of blades n decreases the rotor torque coefficient c t at any value of the flow coefficient ϕ consequently a wider range of operation is obtained by increasing the rotor solidity σ gradually from 0 24 to 0 64 by means increasing the number of blades n through the whole operating range the immersed turbine having s1046 blades possesses high torque coefficients when maintaining a rotor solidity σ of 0 64 and 0 48 in fig 22 b it can be noticed that the stagnation pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 of the eight bladed turbine is higher than that having six and three blades it is clear from fig 22 c that the turbine efficiency η of the turbine decreases significantly with an increase in rotor solidity σ by varying the number of turbine blades for the extremely low solidity σ 0 24 it can be noticed that pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 of s1046 blade is higher than that of naca 0015 which cause a reduction in efficiency for turbine with naca 0015 blade it can be concluded that for all values of rotor solidity the s1046 blade in water performs better than naca 0015 through the whole operating range from ϕ 0 075 to ϕ 0 3 in order to explain the effect of rotor solidity on the performance of the immersed hydraulic wells turbine which is the proposed concept the flow field around naca 0015 and s1046 blades is also investigated fig 23 depicts the contours of tangential velocity v θ on the mid plane for three different rotor solidities namely 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 at three flow coefficients in both blades these three flow coefficients are equal to 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 corresponding to low flow coefficient incipient stall and deep stall conditions fig 23 a and b show comparisons of the flow patterns between water turbines having naca 0015 and s1046 airfoils respectively at ϕ 0 1 fig 23 a and b shows approximately more attached flow from the leading edge to the trailing edge for all solidities because of the low axial velocity though it can be seen in fig 23 b that the s1046 with solidity equal to 0 24 at ϕ 0 1 has a thicker boundary layer to some extent than the others at ϕ 0 2 the tip leakage vortex becomes bigger toward the trailing edge and this leads to a deeper flow separation around that region in particular around the trailing edge of turbine rotors with extremely low solidity i e σ 0 24 at ϕ 0 3 fig 23 a and b indicate that a more considerable separation occurs around rotors of low solidity compared to high solidity rotors causing a narrower operating range and affects the performance harmfully it can be explained that the wide distance between the blades for the case of low solidity augment the vortex wake flow to enlarge separation zone on the blade suction surface furthermore occurrence of the stall condition becomes earlier with decreasing in rotor solidity which means that low solidity rotors perform worse than high solidity ones referring to fig 22 a c it can be noted that the incipient stall condition occurs at ϕ 0 225 when naca 0015 is used with rotor solidity equal to 0 24 0 48 and shifted to a higher value of flow coefficient ϕ 0 275 for solidity equal to 0 64 while the incipient stall condition of s1046 for σ 0 24 0 48 and 0 64 which occurs at ϕ 0 175 0 2 and 0 225 respectively a further explanation can be offered by observing fig 24 a and b the tangential velocity contours are depicted on three different planes near hub mid span and near tip the detailed flow around naca 0015 and s1046 can be found in fig 24 which demonstrates the tangential velocity v θ contours on three planes along the span wise direction of the blade these planes are located near hub 10 h mid span 50 h and near tip 90 h at flow coefficient ϕ 0 2 for three different values of rotor solidity equal to 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 as discussed before the flow separation increases with increasing the flow passage height h of the turbine this shows that the boundary layer profile of the high and low solidity is the same at low flow coefficients as revealed in fig 24 a and b it is obvious that the size of separation zone at the mid span and near tip is decreased substantially in the high solidity rotors having s1046 therefore it results in better performance for the s1046 with high values of solidity just beneath the tip h 90 the smaller separation zone in the s1046 with σ 0 64 is owing to the presence of high velocity mainstream which causes smaller interaction between the tip leakage vortex and the suction surface ss of the rotor blade furthermore it should be noted that the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and the mainstream near the tip zone h 90 of the high solidity rotors is stronger than that around the tip zone of the rotor solidity rotors because the velocity of the mainstream around the tip zone of the high solidity is higher than that in the vicinity of the tip zone of the low solidity rotors see fig 24 a and b at h 90 fig 25 shows the streamlines distribution at mid span of the flow passage h 50 around naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections in water with different rotor solidity at lower flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the streamlines distribution is almost the same as the flow seems to be stuck to the most of suction surface ss of the two blades for all different solidities values it can be seen that the flow separation becomes more salient at ϕ 0 3 especially for hydraulic turbines consist of naca 0015 blades as the solidity decreases the separation bubble on the ss becomes smaller and closer to the leading edge le of the naca 0015 blade section however the separation bubble is not presented at any value of rotor solidity when using s1046 as the default blade section for immersed hydraulic wells turbine at ϕ 0 3 static pressure contours on both pressure and suction sides of the turbine blade with different rotor solidity at flow coefficients equal to 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are plotted and shown in figs 26 and 27 respectively the variation in the static pressure distribution on pressure side for rotor solidity σ 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 of two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 is shown in fig 26 a and b respectively the region of high pressure on the pressure surface is marked in fig 26 a and b by a black solid rectangle and a black dotted line border as seen in fig 26 a for all values of flow coefficients the high pressure zone in the high solidity rotors is greater than that in the rotors with low solidity consequently the blade loading of the high solidity rotor is higher than the low solidity at these flow coefficients fig 27 a and b shows the static pressure distribution on suction surface ss of the two blade types naca 0015 and s1046 with different rotors of solidity σ 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 at flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 as discussed before it can be observed that the higher and the lower pressure values are at the trailing edge and leading edge respectively at lower flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the pressure change is almost the same from the leading edge to the trailing edge in all solidity values for rotors having either naca 0015 or s1046 blades as flow coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the pressure on the two blade s suction surfaces increases from leading edge to trailing edge for all values of rotor solidity at ϕ 0 3 the low pressure zone in the s1046 blade 21 2 c 18 3 c and 17 2 c corresponding rotor solidity equal to 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 respectively is greater than that in the naca 0015 blade 9 7 c 4 6 c and 5 1 c corresponding rotor solidity equal to 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 respectively particularly near the tip zone of suction surface as shown in fig 27 a and b fig 28 shows the streamlines distribution on the ss with different rotor solidity at various flow coefficients ϕ as illustrated before the separation lines in this figure are marked by a red dotted line with an arrow indicating direction of the reversed flow at ϕ 0 1 the streamlines are uniform and remain almost attached on the ss of both blade sections naca0015 and s1046 in water for the three values of rotor solidity it can be noticed that the separation bubble is formed only on the ss of naca 0015 blade in water at ϕ 0 2 when the solidity is maintained at σ 0 64 furthermore low solidity turbines σ 0 24 showed no vortical behavior except for naca 0015 at ϕ 0 3 whereas two pair of vortices are observed large corner separation vortex near the hub le and smaller vortex near the tip te hence it can be concluded that the intensity of the vortical flow is higher in high solidity rotors than low solidity ones the flow pattern through hydraulic turbines having s1046 profile affirmed that no marked separation vortices could be appeared at the three values of rotor solidity fig 29 depicts the volume streamlines near the blade tip to illustrate the effect of tip leakage flow in hydraulic turbine with different rotor solidity at various flow coefficients ϕ at ϕ 0 1 the flow is attached to the blade surface showing uniform flow pattern in the tip region for all solidities for ϕ 0 2 the fluid near the blade tip mixes with a weak tip vortex on the ss rotors consist of s1046 blades with extremely low solidity σ 0 24 have the weakest tip vortex as compared to the others the stall condition is reached when the flow coefficient increased to 0 3 and s1046 showed the minimum tip leakage flow at the three studied values of rotor solidity σ 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 fig 30 presents the contours of radial vorticity component on the mid span of rotor blade with different rotor solidity it can be noticed that the flow is attached to the surface of the naca 0015 and s1046 blades for both low and high solidity rotors at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 at ϕ 0 3 the flow is separated from the surface of the two blade profiles due to deep stalling this figure also indicates that positive and negative radial vorticity on the suction and pressure sides reduces as the rotor solidity reduces moreover the separated flow is appeared significantly in case of high solidity rotors fig 31 presents the contours of radial vorticity of rotors with three different solidity on planes of constant radius through 10 50 and 90 h at ϕ 0 2 this figure suggests that an increase in solidity leads to a decrease in blade stall angle at the near blade tip region h 90 at high angles of attack a separation vortex appears on the blade suction surface in the hub side to reduce the blade circulation because of the excessive angle of attack near the hub fig 32 presents the contour lines of radial vorticity component ξ r on the ss of immersed wells turbine with different rotor solidity at three flow coefficients the less rotor solidity is maintained the less size of separation zone the less negative radial vorticity on the suction side of the turbine blade is obtained for instant the flow remains attached over the whole suction surface of both naca 0015 and s1046 at the three flow coefficients for extremely low solidity rotors σ 0 24 but naca 0015 shows a separated area extending from the tip to the mid span at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the separation regions could barely appear on the ss for all values of rotor solidity except for naca 0015 which introduces a marginal area of separation near at its hub near the te as indicated in fig 32 fig 33 depicts the tangential vorticity contours ξ θ on meridional plane x 0 for naca 0015 and s1046 in water with different rotor solidity this figure shows that the tip leakage vortex red in high solidity rotors is stronger than that in low solidity rotors for both blade types similarly the other counter rotating vortices blue become less effective by reducing the rotor solidity 6 conclusions the present work introduced a new operational concept of wells turbine where it is immersed inside water the results indicated that the present concept of immersed or hydraulic turbine is a promising for further wells turbine applications in sea wave energy conversion s wec wells turbine performance is computationally investigated using realizable k ε model with enhanced wall treatment to model the near wall flow where its numerical results are validated against experimental work the model is based on 3d steady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in multiple rotating reference frame mrf accordingly the following conclusions are obtained substantial improvements of the turbine performance are achieved when using water as a working fluid instead of air the maximum torque coefficient c t having naca 0015 reaches 1 36 times maximum torque value in air while the maximum increase in the torque coefficient c t reaches 1 4 times its value in air when s1046 profile is used despite the increased density and viscosity of water the pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 has not changed through the whole range of operation the maximum increase in turbine efficiency in water having naca 0015 blade is about 4 times its efficiency in air at flow coefficient of ϕ 0 275 however the maximum increase in the efficiency of immersed turbine consists of s1046 blade is about 1 8 times the efficiency of air wells turbine at ϕ 0 3 the stall point is also delayed and a wider operating range with higher efficiency is achieved for the hydraulic turbine in water both torque coefficient and efficiency of wells turbine having s1046 blades in water are higher than its counterparts having naca 0015 blades either in air or in water the performance of immersed hydraulic turbine of naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections is better than air turbine having both profiles through the whole range of operation from ϕ 0 075 to ϕ 0 3 the performance is investigated when changing the rotor solidity a wider operation range of this turbine is obtained by increasing the rotor number of turbine blades increasing the number of turbine blades increases the rotor torque coefficient at different operating conditions s1046 is considered to be the most suitable blade cross section for immersed hydraulic wells turbine for the investigated three values of rotor solidities less effect of the blade type is found compared with the parameters of type of the working fluid and value of the rotor solidity 
23206,wells turbines self rectifying air driven axial turbines are typically used to convert pneumatic power available in the periodic reversed airflow in oscillating water column owc device into mechanical energy however such turbines suffer from low aerodynamic efficiency low powers produced and narrow operating range the current work proposes the operating principle of using water as the working fluid rather than air by submerging the wells turbine in the sea water to enhance its performance this gives an advantage for the turbine operation with a fluid having specific weight higher fluid than air the analysis is carried out for an innovative device proposed by boccotti in which a vertical axis hydraulic wells turbine installed inside a vertical duct and contained in a caisson below the sea water surface the cfd simulations are performed depend on the steady 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans calculations on this type of axial turbine rotor with realizable k ε turbulence model a comparative analysis between the computational results and experimental results is carried out and a good agreement is found between both results this paper proved that the hydraulic immersed wells turbine performance is better than that of the air conventional wells turbine a substantial improvement in the torque coefficient is achieved with the hydraulic turbine of about 1 4 times the torque of the conventional air turbine using water as a working fluid which is the proposed concept leads to a wider operating range unlike using air in addition the effects of blade profile and rotor solidity on the turbine performance were clarified computationally in this work two kinds of symmetric blade profiles have been used naca 0015 and s1046 the present computational investigation was carried out for three rotor solidities 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 through changing the number of turbine blades 8 6 and 3 blades it is found that for a hydraulic wells turbine

sea waves which acts as oscillating water column owc is one of the methods which used to convert wave energy into electricity raghunathan 1995 presented an extensive review on the performance of different types of turbines producing power from oscillating water columns wells turbine was proposed by professor a a wells in 1976 as a self rectifying axial flow air driven turbine suitable for the owc the turbine is called wells turbine and able to convert the motion of a reversing airflow of periodic manner into mechanical energy it is an axial flow self rectifying low pressure air turbine which works continuously in one direction the turbine blades are built using symmetric airfoils and the stagger angle γ on the airfoils is set to be 90 thereby the wells turbine is able to convert the oscillating wave motion of the free water surface into bi directional air flow usually ocean waves oscillate up and down in an air chamber by reciprocating flow up and down of the wave the water compresses the air in the chamber between the water surface and the turbine the free water surface converts the oscillating wave motion into bi directional air flow through the wells turbine the main elements of the configuration are the air chamber and the wells turbine with the electrical generator fig 1 the blades of wells turbine were distributed symmetrically on the plane normal to the turbine rotation axis this type of blade arrangement gives the advantage of making the turbine insensitive to the incoming flow direction due to the symmetrical airfoils the tangential force acts on the blades only in one direction even though air flow begins to oscillate due to the contact between the flow and the turbine blades the drag force will affect the large area of the turbine blade these lift and drag forces are resolved into a tangential component f θ which introduces the torque on the blades to rotate around the turbine axis and as well as an axial component f x which creates the thrust along the turbine axis fig 2 therefore the incidence angle α of a rotating turbine blade embedded in oscillating airflow has negative and positive values with an average value of 0 considering symmetrical blade cross section the tangential force f θ will be in the same direction based on negative or positive values of the incidence angle α thus a unidirectional torque is always created from this turbine regardless of the direction of the airflow 2 state of art and research gap many research works have attempted to enhance the performance of wells turbine gato et al 1996 and curran and gato 1996 experimentally investigated the performance of various configurations of wells turbine dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 presented an investigation of the performance of wells turbine numerically in details raghunathan et al 1989 assessed the wells turbine characteristics under various inlet flow features and conditions many geometrical parameters and their effect on the performance of wells turbine like blade geometry kim et al 2001 blade setting angle setoguchi et al 2003 using end plates takao et al 2006 2007 and tip clearance torresi et al 2008a have been investigated the effect of usage of guide vanes on constant chord setoguchi et al 2001 and variable chord govardhan and dhanasekaran 1998 wells turbine blade has also been studied leakage flow from blade tip and its effect on the turbine output has been investigated either with uniform tip clearance or with non uniform tip clearance by taha et al in taha and sugiyono sawada 2010 taha et al 2011 however wells turbines equipped with guide vanes starts to stall before those without guide vanes suzuki 2005 govardhan and dhanasekaran 2002 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 recognized the important of the blade shape therefore they studied the blade profile influence and solidity on a large scale wells turbines performance they have considered various flow conditions such as sinusoidal assuming regular waves and real sea conditions irregular waves operating under bi directional unsteady flow conditions folley et al 2006 examined the performance of a contra rotating wells turbine installed in the limpet wave power station then compared the results to the corresponding data obtained from both theoretical analysis and model tests shaaban and abdel hafiz shaaban and abdel hafiz 2012 presented a numerical investigation of the effect of casing geometry on the performance of wells turbine halder and samad halder et al 2015 investigated the effect of groove casing on wells turbine performance with different values of groove depth and tip clearance halder et al 2016 carried out a three dimensional steady state simulation coupled with a multi objective optimization of blade sweep for a wells turbine a numerical simulation based on design optimization is conducted for a bidirectional wells turbine to judge the dependency of the extracted power on operating range of the turbine halder et al 2017 shaaban 2016 optimized the levelized cost of electricity lcoe of power generation from waves in plants which depends on wells turbines as converter by optimizing the radial solidity of their rotors mohamed et al 2011 introduced and developed the performance by using a multi objective optimization and cfd codes coupled with genetic algorithms in a house optimization library to maximize the torque output by maximizing the tangential force which induced by a mono plane wells turbine mohamed and shaaban 2013 2014 studied and optimized the effect of blade pitch angle of a self rectifying wells turbine to improve the performance under movable blades shehata et al 2017 developed a passive flow control method using a transient cfd analysis to improve the performance of symmetrical airfoil profile used for wells turbine working with oscillating flow in the stall regime nazeryan and lakzian 2017 investigated two blade designs the conventional design a constant thickness blade ctb and the new design a variable thickness blade vtb by solving rans equations in steady mode with sst turbulence model a blade shape modifications such as profile thickness and sweeping of the turbine with steady and unsteady flows are done using multi objective optimization based on surrogate coupled genetic algorithm halder et al 2018 an innovative owc plant is proposed by boccotti 2002 and filianoti 1991 in which the turbine is driven directly by the oscillating water flow this gives the privilege of using fluid having higher specific weight than air camporeale et al 2003 performed three dimensional unsteady flow simulations in order to predict the performance of high and low solidity wells turbines operating in boccotti s owc plant near la spezia italy coast the previous literature review highlights the limitation of operation of wells turbine due to its low performance and narrow operating range although some previous works boccotti 2002 filianoti 1991 camporeale et al 2003 have discussed the concept of immersed hydraulic wells turbine used in boccotti s owc plant for sea wave energy conversion however more intensive studies are needed in order to provide a detailed description for the different performance characteristics and the fluid dynamic behavior related to this innovative device by taking the advantage of the flexibility of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods therefore this paper aims to develop a larger analysis of immersed hydraulic wells turbines by using two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 alongside with changing the rotor solidity ranging from high solidity to low solidity overall this paper explores the effects of using oscillating water flow instead of air flow to drive the wells turbine with both blade types and suggest recommendation for future designs some parameters effects such as owc chamber and duct as well as the wave shape pattern will not included in this work maybe these parameters will be investigated in next projects as done before in hashem et al 2017 ramadan et al 2014a ramadan et al 2014a 2014a 2014b fig 3 depicts a scheme of owc plant with air or hydraulic wells turbines with vertical axes mounted inside vertical duct could be employed in order to convert a portion of the wave energy into mechanical rotational energy fig 3 a shows the traditional owc plant in which the turbine is driven by an air flux and is characterized by high solidity and high rotational speed which ranges from 500 rpm till 5000 rpm camporeale et al 2003 the wells turbine is the most common type of air turbines utilized in the owc plants due to simplicity reliability and robustness of its design an innovative owc device is patented by boccotti 2002 which allows the use of special turbines immersed inside sea water and supposed to be moved directly by means of the oscillating water flow see fig 3 b the innovative owc plant is a plant comprising a caisson breakwater with air pocket and vertical duct which is positioned to cover the whole length of the caisson breakwater where the air pocket is exist the lower part of the caisson breakwater is filled with water and the vertical duct extends outside passing through the upper wall of the caisson the upper opening of the vertical duct is usually located just beneath surface of the sea water while its lower opening does not hit the base of the caisson a compressor is used to pump air into the caisson in order to form an air pocket above the water level inside the caisson the compressor could be located either on land or on an offshore platform and the compressed air is delivered to the top of the caisson through hoses the height of the air pocket is being adjusted through valve or tap till the resonance condition is reached in this manner wells turbines with vertical axes can be installed inside the vertical duct for sea wave energy conversion purposes such operating principle is thought to produce more power output higher efficiency and wider operating range as being water of a higher specific weight and higher momentum than air moreover using water as a working fluid has the advantage of delay of separation or delay of stall condition as the stall point can be shifted towards the airfoil trailing edge hence the turbine performance could be enhanced due to the excess energy transfers to the blade by the attached flow therefore applying the proposed concept could substantially enhance the performance of wells turbines employed in the traditional owc plants in order to realize the significance of using wells turbines in sea water applications the performance of such turbines is computationally evaluated using the commercial cfd code ansys fluent the performance of this turbine is expressed in terms of torque coefficient stagnation pressure drop coefficient and turbine efficiency at different values of flow coefficient moreover a detailed study of an immersed hydraulic wells turbine with different values of rotor solidity is performed based on the innovative design of the boccotti s owc plant 3 theoretical background 3 1 governing equations computational fluid dynamics techniques are based on solving of the navier stokes equations which fully govern any fluid flow navier stokes n s equations are derived by applying the second law of newton to flow motion taking into considerations the assumption that the fluid stress is the summation of two terms which are the diffusion viscous term proportional to the velocity gradient and a pressure term the solution of the navier stokes n s equations is obtained in the form of velocity field which is a description of the fluid velocity at a given point located in certain space and time the continuity equation for approximately constant density flow incompressible flow due to low mach number m 0 3 is only function of velocity and it is not a function of pressure however the momentum equations are the only equations that contain pressure term a direct approach is followed to obtain the results of pressure by discretizing both continuity and momentum equations then solving them simultaneously a mathematical model is proposed in which the navier stokes n s equations are replaced with discretized algebraic equations that could be solved by different algorithms a suitable turbulence model is adopted to accurately predict the fluctuating velocity within a finite discretized domain consisting of volumetric mesh cells the realizable k ε model is the turbulence model used to solve the problem of turbulence modeling in the present work the governing equations for a three dimensional can be described on incompressible form neglecting the density terms as following continuity equation 1 ρ u i t ρ u i x i 0 momentum equation 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i μ 2 u i x j x j where u i and u j denotes the fluid velocities in i and j direction vectors p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and μ represents the dynamic viscosity the steady state reynold s averaged navier stokes rans mean solutions are obtained using the appropriate turbulence model rans is an additional simplification where the governing equations equations 1 and 2 are time averaged and thus the time term could be neglected 3 2 turbulence model many two equations turbulence models have been proposed in the fluid flow simulation and prediction in most of these models the turbulence kinetic energy k is considered as one of the variables but there are many different choices for the second variable the k ε model with dissipation rate ε as a second variable is the most widely used turbulence model usually the realizable k ε model is recommended for rotating zones and bodies in all previous studies and publication mohamed et al 2011 mohamed and shaaban 2013 2014 hashem and mohamed 2018 in this work the turbine blades are rotating around certain axis therefore the realizable k ε model will be retained in all the simulations the realizable k ε model which had been proposed and introduced by shih et al 1995 is a relatively recent development and differs from the standard k ε model in two remarkable points as following the realizable k ε model includes a modified equation for the turbulent flow viscosity the dissipation rate ε has a new transport equation and it is included in the realizable k ε model it is obtained from a full equation for the transport of vorticity fluctuations the meaning of realizable is that the k ε model matches certain mathematical restrictions on the reynolds stresses of turbulent flows this feature is not available in the other k ε models an advantage of the realizable k ε model is its capability to predict the pervasion rate of round jets and planar with high accuracy it shows a superior performance when dealing with flows comprising rotation boundary layers due to intensive adverse pressure gradients separation and recirculation in order to understand more about the mathematics of the realizable k ε model the boussinesq hypothesis and the eddy viscosity definition are combined together to obtain of the normal reynolds stress for incompressible flow as follow 3 u 2 2 3 k 2 ν t v x transport equations for the realizable k ε model 4 x j k u j x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k and 5 x j ε u j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε

constant however it will be variable in realizable k ε model and this is the main difference between the three models c μ can be computed from 6 c μ 1 a 0 a s k u ε where u s i j s i j ω i j ω i j the realizable k ε model constants are c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 4 methodology the total wells turbine performance is numerically investigated by solving the steady three dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans besides turbulence is modeled using the realizable k ε model the enhanced wall treatment is used in the near wall flow modeling the combination of the realizable k ε model and the enhanced wall treatment enables good prediction of the performance moving reference frame mrf technique is used to model the rotating blade in the domain the basic governing equations are solved in the absolute frame and discretized by the finite volume method using the cfd code ansys fluent many discretization schemes are used in the current work such as simplec algorithm for pressure velocity coupling standard scheme for pressure second order upwind scheme for momentum and turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ɛ the solutions are considered once the maximum residual values are reached to 10 4 the authors in the present work considered the rotor geometry which is experimentally investigated by curran and gato 1996 fig 4 shows a perspective view of geometry of the turbine model which is created based on curran and gato 1996 for validation purposes the complete simulations in this work are performed on a wells turbine rotor with two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 as shown in fig 5 all specifications of the investigated turbine model are provided in table 1 fig 6 shows a perspective view of the flow domain for the 1 8 turbine model the symmetrical shape of the turbine around the rotation axis helps the authors to use the flow domain as one blade to blade passage periodic boundaries are used on the domain sides through the tangential direction of the flow domain therefore by the periodic concept the flow domain can be extended to any number of blades in the post processing the domain has a length equals four and eight the chord length of the blade upstream and downstream of tested blade respectively as shown in fig 6 for the boundary conditions non slip stationary wall is used for the hub and the blade surfaces the casing surface is treated as a non slip moving wall because of the rotating frame of reference as mentioned before the periodic boundary condition is used for the tangential sides to obtain the repetitive characteristics of the flow around the blades at the inlet constant velocity is considered to obtain uniform flow however at outlet boundary the radial equilibrium outlet pressure boundary condition is used to well consider the radial variations of both pressure and velocity downstream the turbine blade in table 2 a summary of all parameters which has used for pre processing and boundary conditions is introduced all the computational meshes appeared in the present work are created by means of the ansys meshing fig 7 depicts the unstructured mesh consists of tetrahedral elements that employed on the whole flow domain in the present work the unstructured tetrahedral elements are substantially increased in the vicinity of wall boundaries in order to get a normalized wall distance y 1 keeping y 5 ensures the capability of resolving the viscous sub layer and consequently using wall functions could be omitted this is achieved by employing inflation or the so called prismatic layers on surface of the hub blade and casing the number of inflation layers is 20 with a growth rate of 1 3 for all wall boundaries the height of the first layer normal to the wall is set to be about 4 10 6 m to achieve y 1 at all operating conditions 4 1 mesh independence test a mesh size independence test is performed to ensure minimum influence of mesh size on the results obtained from the present numerical simulation the mesh size is increased in five gradual steps from 1 440 182 cells to 4 057 831 elements while maintaining the y value less than unity this test showed that the maximum percentage variation in rotor torque coefficient of 1 95 in efficiency of 1 85 and in stagnation pressure drop coefficient of 0 8 fig 8 illustrates the effect of mesh size on the turbine efficiency obtained from the numerical simulation at ϕ 0 15 the good quality fine mesh with total number of approximately 2 580 800 elements provided a sufficient level of mesh independency and hence it is used throughout the present work all parameters affecting the turbine performance are determined at different values of flow coefficient ϕ υ x u by changing the axial velocity υ x we can control and change the flow coefficient with considering constant rotational speed in the absolute reference frame all default values are used for the initiation and initialization of the solution regarding the convergence criteria the default values of under relaxation factors are not convenient for solution convergence to occur the present solution suffers from some difficulties in convergence particularly at high values of flow coefficients ϕ 0 225 consequently values of under relaxation factors are reduced to accelerate the convergence process table 3 shows the modified values of under relaxation factors which are implemented in the flow solver at ϕ 0 275 5 results and discussions this section mainly discusses the results obtained from a reliable cfd simulation to investigate the performance of immersed axial turbine inside water an accurate model validation by comparison the numerical results with published experimental work are presented furthermore a full description about the performance of such turbine is provided in terms of three non dimensional coefficients namely they are the torque coefficient stagnation pressure drop coefficient and turbine efficiency the calculations are carried out for various values of flow coefficient the effects of different rotor solidities 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 are also discussed in this section 5 1 model validation the computational results obtained from the present numerical simulation are validated by comparison with the experimental values of curran and gato 1996 in this study the total turbine performance is expressed in the form of three non dimensional coefficients which are torque coefficient c t stagnation pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 and turbine efficiency η the definitions of these coefficients are as follows 7 c t t ρ ω 2 r 5 where we can defined these parameters as t is the rotor torque ω is the angular velocity ρ is the air density and r is the tip radius 8 c δ p 0 δ p 0 ρ ω 2 r 2 where δ p 0 is the stagnation pressure drop 9 η t ω δ p 0 q where q is the volume flow rate in the current study the adopted methodology is validated against the experimental data reported within literature in order to obtain reliable and accurate results fig 9 present a comparison of the turbine performance on a naca 0015 blade profile between the computational and experimental results of curran and gato 1996 for tip clearance of 1 mm the torque coefficient c t stagnation pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 and turbine efficiency η are calculated and analyzed for a wide range of flow coefficients starting by flow coefficient equals ϕ 0 075 all the performance parameters has been calculated and analyzed to obtain the off design performance characteristics from figure it can be observed that the computational results of the present work are in a good agreement compared with the published experimental values of curran and gato 1996 moreover comparisons between the present values and other computational values of torresi et al 2008a shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 and halder et al folley et al 2006 are conducted to ensure that the proposed model is accepted as an analytical tool for the assessment of wells turbine performance fig 9 showed that the present results are closer to the experimental work curran and gato 1996 than other results of takao et al 2007 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 folley et al 2006 which showed an over estimation especially at high values of flow coefficient typically ϕ 0 225 as known that the stall point is decided by a decrease in the turbine torque coefficient all the computational results indicated that the stalling point is predicted at a different value of flow coefficient than the one obtained from the experiment the predicted torque coefficient in this work is slightly lower than that of the experimental one except for the stall margin while the stagnation pressure drop coefficient is almost the same hence the turbine efficiency of the present computational results before the stalling point is slightly lower see fig 9 c the value of peak efficiency obtained from the present calculation differs by approximately 6 and occurs at almost the same value of flow coefficient of experimental results ϕ 0 1 fig 9 a proved that the method introduced by shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 failed to predict the turbine performance under stall and deep stall conditions i e ϕ 0 225 however it can be observed in fig 9 that the current model succeeded to predict the stall margin with quite good accuracy compared to other computational models listed in the current work moreover the deviation in the peak efficiency predicted by shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 is calculated as 1 3 and occurs at shifted value of flow coefficient ϕ 0 15 far from that obtained experimentally on the other hand for the results of halder et al folley et al 2006 fig 9 the three parameters of its computational results are much higher than those of the experimental one the value of peak efficiency differs by approximately 6 5 and is predicted at the value of flow coefficient ϕ 0 125 which is very close to the experimental one before the stall point it is clear that the computational results of halder et al folley et al 2006 have larger deviation from the experimental results curran and gato 1996 than that of shaaban and abdel hafiz thakker and abdulhadi 2008 however the values of halder et al folley et al 2006 have the same trend of the experimental ones furthermore the computational results obtained by torresi et al 2008a are in quite good agreement with the experimental data until incipient stall condition around ϕ 0 225 see fig 9 a the value of peak efficiency of torresi et al 2008a is accurately predicted and it differs by approximately 1 2 and occurs at a flow coefficient ϕ 0 125 which is approaching the experimental one 5 2 effect of working fluid the effect of changing the working fluid from air to water on the performance of wells turbine having two different blade profiles is investigated the symmetric naca 0015 and the s1046 airfoils are the blade profiles of the investigated turbine model in the present work and in terms of three non dimensional parameters the performance of the turbine is studied as shown in fig 10 one of the most interesting parameters affecting the turbine performance is the torque coefficient c t and its variation with flow coefficient ϕ is shown in fig 10 a the torque coefficient of the wells turbine inside water increased considerably following the same trend of the turbine efficiency for the hydraulic turbine that consists of naca 0015 as a blade profile the maximum torque coefficient c t reaches 0 15 at ϕ 0 275 as shown in fig 10 a however the maximum torque coefficient in case of air turbine is 0 12 at ϕ 0 25 this means the peak torque coefficient is improved by 36 4 relative increase based on the torque coefficient of air on the other hand the maximum torque coefficient c t of a turbine in water having s1046 blades reaches 0 17 at ϕ 0 275 however it is equal 0 11 at ϕ 0 25 when air is used as working fluid with relative increase equals 42 5 based on air value the main reason for the increased turbine torque coefficient is the higher momentum of the water and delaying of the separation despite the increase in density and viscosity of the water as a working fluid the pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 has not changed through the whole operating range as in fig 10 b the turbine efficiency of wells turbine immersed in water compared with its efficiency in air at different values of flow coefficients is shown in fig 10 c the maximum increase in turbine efficiency in water having naca 0015 blade is about 4 times its efficiency in air at flow coefficient of ϕ 0 3 however the maximum increase in the efficiency of hydraulic turbine consists of s1046 blade is about 1 8 times the efficiency of air wells turbine at the same flow coefficient for instant at turbine efficiency η 0 5 the hydraulic wells turbine of naca 0015 profile has an operating range about 1 5 times its range in air this is due to higher values of specific weight of the water than that of the air both torque coefficient and efficiency of wells turbine having s1046 blades in water are higher than its counterparts having naca 0015 blades either in air or in water the performance of immersed hydraulic turbine of naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections is better than air turbine having both profiles through the whole range of operation from ϕ 0 075 to ϕ 0 3 the stall point of the air wells turbine having the two blade sections is occurred at ϕ 0 25 while the stall point of hydraulic turbine with both profile is shifted to some higher value ϕ 0 275 than that working with air when using water flow instead of airflow it can be concluded that wells turbine works more efficient due to the higher value of the reynolds number about 14 times for density and viscosity of both air and water actually comparing the conventional air wells turbine and the immersed hydraulic wells turbine in terms of non dimensional parameters could be misleading when both machine are supposed to rotate at the same rotational speed and having the same inlet velocities as a matter of fact in the two cases the power input is completely different this can be verified looking at the values of the static pressure in the two different cases when considering immersed turbines figs 14 and 15 we have pressure levels in the order of 107 pa whereas considering air turbine we have pressure levels in the order of 104 pa in order to explain the effect of using water instead of air as a working fluid for wells turbine an investigation is also performed on the flow field around two different types of turbine blades namely naca 0015 and s1046 the flow characteristics can be explained in more detail by analyzing the flow field through the turbine for different flow regime before and after stall condition in particular the three flow conditions with ϕ 0 1 02 and 0 3 are considered the tangential velocity v θ contour lines on the plane of constant radius through 50 passage height h are plotted and illustrated in fig 11 a and b the direction of the axial flow is from the left to right sides in each figure and indicated by the blue arrow in fig 11 the red dotted lines represent the boundary layer edge while the red solid ovals symbolize the region of separated flow as shown in the two figures at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the boundary layer on the suction surface ss at the mid span is relatively thin and attached from the leading to trailing edges a separated region appears from the leading to trailing edge which is followed by a wake extending toward the downstream periodic boundary and then re entering at the upstream periodic boundary it also can be seen that the wake formed by the front side blade interacts with the boundary layer as the flow coefficient increases the separated region tends to be larger and creeps forward due to the increase of the incidence while the interaction between the wake formed by the front side blade and the boundary layer becomes weaker these phenomena excite the boundary layer to be thicker and to separate from the suction surface ss a deep separation of the boundary layer can lead to a stall condition of the turbine fig 11 a and b show comparisons of the flow patterns between turbines having naca 0015 and s1046 profiles when using air and water as working fluids respectively further it can be seen that at ϕ 0 1in fig 11 a and b there is no significant difference in the tangential velocity contour lines for the two airfoils as they have the same performance characteristics in air and water refer to fig 10 a c the difference can be seen clearly at ϕ 0 2 in which the separation region for the immersed hydraulic turbine with s1046 airfoil is smaller than the others therefore the stall condition of the immersed turbine having s1046 profile is delayed as compared to its counterpart in air it can be noted that the start of separation is slightly delayed when using naca 0015 section in water more than air referring to fig 10 a c the stall condition of the conventional air turbine occur at ϕ 0 2 however the stall condition is delayed to occur at ϕ 0 275 when the air is replaced by water this explains the wider operating range and the better performance of immersed hydraulic turbine than conventional air turbine with the same blade section at ϕ 0 2 immediately this reveals the effect of immersing turbine in water and switching to s1046 instead of traditional naca sections for the rotor of such turbine furthermore it also can be observed that the all cases result in tangential velocity contour lines almost the same at ϕ 0 3 a possible reason may be that the performance characteristics of these cases are very close except for the conventional air turbine with naca 0015 which have a lower efficiency torque and produce lower torque see fig 10 a c at ϕ 0 3 deep stall condition the boundary layer on the suction surface ss for the conventional air turbine having naca 0015 is a little bit thicker than the others which adversely affects its performance however as shown in fig 11 the boundary layer separation is investigated only on the plane of constant radius through 50 h at ϕ 0 2 a further explanation can be offered by observing fig 12 a and b in which the separated flow on different planes of constant radius is investigated fig 12 a and b present the contour lines of tangential velocity v θ around naca 0015 and s1046 blades on planes of constant radius through 10 h 50 h and 90 h respectively the figures are for conventional air conventional turbine and immersed hydraulic turbine at flow coefficient ϕ 0 2 operating condition while the direction of the axial flow is from the left to right sides in each figure and indicated by the blue arrow as shown in fig 12 considerable boundary layer separation occurs on the plane of constant radius at 90 h which is just under the tip because of the high swirling components and wakes behind the blades which grows as flow coefficient increases on the other hand this deep flow separation behavior is not encountered on the plane of constant radius at 10 h and 50 h it indicates that the stall condition of the turbine is stimulated strongly by the flow around the tip which almost is due to the tip leakage flow further it is interesting to observe in fig 12 a and b that at ϕ 0 2 the boundary layer remains attached over almost the entire blade chord on the plane at 10 h which is just above the hub however it is obvious that the boundary layer on the suction side ss of the both rotor blades naca 0015 and s046 on plane of constant radius through 50 h is much thinner than that at 10 h this effect may be owing to the excessive angle of attack near the hub mamun et al 2004 and also the interaction between the boundary layers of the hub and the blades wells turbine is often have high solidity rotors therefore it is thought that the main reason why the wells turbine blades start stalling at tip rather than at hub is related to the reduction of the interference factor between foils moving with radial outward contours of tangential velocity at h 50 indicate that there is no significant change in the flow field except for an increase in velocity with the flow coefficient when compared velocity contours at 10 and 50 of the flow passage height h with velocity contours at 90 h it can be observed that the effect of flow around the tip is more significant during stall condition than that around the hub fig 12 a and b show that the boundary layer on the rotor blade get thicker and more flow separation occurs in case of using air as a working fluid rather than using water this explains why the turbine working with air is the first to stall as deduced in raghunathan et al 1989 setoguchi et al 2003 fig 13 shows the streamlines distribution at mid span of the flow passage h 50 around naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections of air and hydraulic wells turbines at lower flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the streamlines distribution is almost the same and the flow is attached to the suction surface ss of the two blades for all cases this explains why the efficiency remains almost at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 either for air or hydraulic wells turbine see fig 10c the flow separation increases with the increase in ϕ from 0 2 to 0 3 for air turbine at higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 3 deep stall conditions are visible and separation region appears on the blade ss of both profiles because of the low pressure on it the air turbine shows a large size separation zone at ϕ 0 3 which gives a low efficiency as indicated by fig 10 c however the flow in case of hydraulic turbine has less separation at the same flow coefficient in hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 for ϕ 0 3 a wider flow separation zone appeared on its ss and a lower efficiency is obtained as compared to hydraulic turbine having s1046 the flow pattern around s1046 in water is free of any reversed or separated flow on the blade ss at ϕ 0 3 the contour lines of static pressure on pressure and suction sides of the turbine are plotted and shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively the variation in the static pressure distribution on pressure surface ps of two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 for both conventional air and hydraulic wells turbines at operating condition ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 and stall condition ϕ 3 are illustrated in fig 14 a and b respectively as illustrated in fig 14 a and b there is a high pressure region near the leading edge at pressure surface ps because of the stagnation point the region of high pressure on the pressure surface is marked in fig 14 a and b by a black solid rectangle and a black dotted line border it is interesting to note that the high static pressure in the vicinity of the leading edge of the two blade profiles increases as the flow coefficient increases due to the increase of the flow incidence angle as seen in fig 14 a at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the high pressure zone in the s1046 blade is greater than that in the naca 0015 consequently the blade loading of the air wells turbine is higher in the s1046 than the naca 0015 at these flow coefficients however the high pressure covers almost the same area at ϕ 0 3 in case of use of either blade profile on the other side it is found that the high pressure zone on the s1046 blade s surface is greater than that on naca 0015 blade s surface if the turbine is immersed in water which makes the first possessing a higher loading coefficient as shown in fig 14 b at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 it can be observed that the pressure distribution of the both types of turbines having s1046 and the naca 0015 is almost the same on the pressure and suction surfaces see figs 14 and 15 therefore the performance of both blades in air is almost the same at the low flow coefficients ϕ 0 15 in middle region of the chord static pressure also changes from hub root of the blade to tip head of the blade in normal turbine operation ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 on one hand for conventional air turbine it is computed that the region of high pressure of naca 0015 blade occupies 4 17 5 and 55 2 of chord length from the leading edge at different three flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 respectively see fig 14 a on the other hand the high pressure region of s1046 blade in air occupies 5 3 22 5 and 48 of chord length for values of flow coefficients similar to ones when naca 0015 is adopted comparatively fig 14 b indicated that the high pressure zone on the pressure surface ps of immersed hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 section covers 6 23 2 and 78 3 of chord length at values of flow coefficient namely 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 respectively while the high pressure zone in case of immersed hydraulic turbine with s1046 section covers 5 8 45 4 and 93 3 of chord length at the before mentioned values of flow coefficient in addition it can be noted clearly from the figures that the high pressure region at ϕ 0 3 exceeds the position of maximum thickness of both airfoils namely 30 c for naca 0015 and 30 8 c for s1046 therefore it leads to turbine stall however it can be observed in fig 13 b the high pressure zone at ϕ 0 2 exceeds the position of maximum thickness of s1046 blade and this explains the remarkable drop in torque coefficient of the water turbine after this value of flow coefficient exactly at ϕ 0 225 moreover when the flow coefficient increases fig 14 a and b the pressure distribution becomes non uniform in the leading edge portion near the hub due to the formation of horseshoe vortices on both blade surfaces nazeryan and lakzian 2017 the horseshoe vortices are defined as an element of end wall boundary layer flows and usually decrease the torque coefficient as they interact with the boundary layer of both hub and blade surfaces lampart 2009 at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the non uniform pressure distribution is marked in fig 14 a and b by black colored oval fig 15 a and b shows the static pressure distribution on suction surface ss of the two blade types naca 0015 and s1046 at different three flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 the higher and the lower pressure values are at the trailing edge and leading edge respectively at lower flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the pressure variance is almost the same for conventional air turbine and immersed hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 and s1046 sections from the leading edge to the trailing edge as flow coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the pressure increases from leading edge to trailing edge in all cases either naca 0015 or s1046 airfoils it is also noticed that a non uniform pressure distribution is observed on the suction surface ss of both turbine blades when the value of flow coefficient exceeds 0 2 at even higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 3 the low pressure zone in the s1046 blade 13 3 c and 21 2 c for air and water respectively is greater than that in the naca 0015 blade 8 4 c and 9 7 c for air and water respectively particularly near the tip zone of suction surface as shown in fig 15 a and b therefore this means that mainstream near the leading edge of the s1046 blade s suction surface has a higher velocity than that of the naca 0015 blade s suction surface this helps in delaying the stall and decreasing region of the separated flow at high flow coefficients from figs 14 a and 15 a it can be concluded that the blade loss for the conventional air turbine having s1046 is lower than that having naca 0015 at high flow coefficients for immersed hydraulic turbines the same conclusion also could be obtained through the operating range 0 1 ϕ 0 3 refer to fig 10 a c at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the streamlines are uniform and remain almost attached on the ss of both blade sections naca0015 and s1046 either for air or water as flow coefficient increases flow separation occurs near the trailing edge te and the streamlines become non uniform the stall point starts moving from trailing edge te to leading edge le and consequently the separated flow area becomes larger the separated flow is defined as the area measured by the distance between the separation line and the trailing edge te of the blade the separation lines are marked in fig 16 a and b by a red dotted line alongside an arrow indicating direction of the circulated flow it can be noticed that a large corner vortex is appeared near the hub te of the two blades at ϕ 0 2 in all cases except for the hydraulic turbine having s1046 a larger spiral vortex in the clockwise at ϕ 0 3 is observed near the hub le in case of air turbine having naca 0015 and s1046 besides hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 only for s1046 blade in water there is no presence for such vortex within the flow pattern on the suction surface ss at ϕ 0 3 and fig 16 b is affirming that both naca 0015 and s1046 in air have separated flow for more than 50 of the surface area at ϕ 0 3 while the separated area is much less for naca 0015 at the same flow coefficient as assigned above hydraulic turbine having s1046 is filled the ss with small size separation zone which occupies the lower portion of the blade near the te therefore it can be concluded that the stall is delayed in both cases naca and s1046 in water and it is more pronounced in case of hydraulic turbine with s1046 profile this explains the higher performance of the turbine when the wells turbine is submerged inside water fig 17 shows that the flow is usually attached at low flow coefficients and the streamlines are uniform in the tip region for both cases a and b at ϕ 0 1 the flow remains close to the blade ss under un stalled conditions at higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 2 the fluid particles pass through the tip gap with high momentum and mixes with a weak tip vortex on the ss it can be obvious in case of air and hydraulic turbines having s1046 blade section increasing the flow coefficient from ϕ 0 2 to ϕ 0 3 flow separation and stalling occurs at te in drastic manner and the tip leakage flow streamlines become highly non uniform in air turbine having both airfoil types the leakage flow from the ss crosses the tip gap towards the te and they usually mix with strong tip vortex near the ss at ϕ 0 3 similar behavior can be noticed in case of hydraulic turbine having naca 0015 however the leakage flow mix with weak tip vortex on the ss of s1046 in water at the same value of flow coefficient this is the main reason of the dramatic drop in turbine efficiency for all cases except for s1046 in water at ϕ 0 3 as shown in fig 10 c the detailed analysis of the flow field indicated that the stalling of flow does not occur first at hub region and then spread outward it appears rather to be commitment to the tip leakage vortex and tends to spread inboard from the tip region to mid span reducing the power output significantly as a matter of fact this is a unique feature of wells turbine as referred to in thakker et al 2001 torresi et al 2008b watterson and raghunathan 1996 a way to verify this is to highlight the radial vorticity component on mid span at different flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 for both air and hydraulic wells turbines for ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the flow is attached of both sides of the naca 0015 and s1046 blades in the two cases as no separation takes place at low flow coefficients the component of radial vorticity possesses positive negative values along the ss ps of the turbine blade as seen in fig 19 for higher flow coefficient ϕ 0 3 the deep stall condition is reached and separation occurs however the flow separation is more detectable in naca 0015 than s1046 fig 19 presents the contours of radial vorticity component in blade to blade planes through different flow passage heights near the hub h 10 at mid span h 50 and near the tip h 90 at ϕ 0 2 a relevant outward radial flow downstream of the rotor is remarked with a consequent decrease in the actual flow deflection toward the tip region h 90 where the flow tends to separate such a behavior effectively explained in raghunathan et al 1897 gato and de o falcao 1984 horlock 1978 and it is due to the blade cascade effect which decreases along with the solidity from hub to tip for wells turbine with constant chord blades torresi et al 2006 2008b the blade cascade effect can be highlighted at ϕ 0 2 in fig 19 moving from hub h 10 to tip h 90 the cascade pitch increases and the incoming flow from the ps becomes less effective in counteracting the separated flow on the ss of the preceding blade this effect is more obvious in air wells turbine than hydraulic turbine and this explains why air turbines is the first to stall fig 20 presents the contours of radial vorticity on the blade ss for three different flow coefficient values the separated flow areas were indicated by regions of negative radial vorticity blue along the blade suction surface ss of both blade types for air a marginal separation region is detected at the hub region near the trailing edge te at the lower portion of both blades at ϕ 0 1 a smaller separation zone can be seen in water turbine near the hub of naca 0015 but it is disappearing in case of s1046 in water this implies that the flow remains attached over the whole suction surface of the s1046 blade in water for ϕ 0 2 separation takes place at the suction side hub near the te then extends to the suction side tip near the te in air while the flow is separated and kept only at the hub region of hydraulic turbines this implies that the hub is critical and closer to stall at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 for ϕ 0 3 the deep stall condition is reached and the ss of most cases is completely filled with separated flow negative radial vorticity however the ss of hydraulic turbine consists of s1046 suffers from two discrete separation zones one at the hub region and the other near the blade tip as seen in fig 20 b the details of the flow characteristics have been carried out by means of the tangential vorticity component at the mid chord of the flow passage on x 0 the corresponding contours are shown in fig 21 for two turbine blades naca 0015 and s1046 in air and water this figure shows that in all cases a vortex with positive tangential vorticity values red is generated due to the high axial velocity of the flow in the tip region this vortex is usually referred to tip leakage vortex which originated from the surface of blade tip as it can be readily seen that the positive vortex red is stronger than the negative one blue and the two contra rotating vortices are bending toward the blade suction surface ss furthermore the radial vorticity component is affected by the cascade effect which limits the growth of the region of negative radial vorticity to the duct therefore the tendency of the flow to separation could be avoided as previously seen in figs 18 20 for air turbine the tip leakage vortex in naca 0015 is stronger than that in s1046 because of the higher axial flow velocity in the tip region similar concluding remarks are obtained for water turbines moreover it can be noticed that there is another vortex on the ss which becomes stronger as the flow coefficient increases for all cases this vortex travels away from the blade in the axial direction as it is evinced by the position of the vortex shed by the preceding blade this vortex travels more rapidly when increasing the value of the flow coefficient such vortex is not developed in hydraulic turbine with s1046 blade profile at ϕ 0 1 the boundary layer on the suction surface of the blade becomes more pronounced in naca 0015 as compared to s1046 and hence the regions of separated flow is larger in turbines consists of naca 0015 blades as highlighted in fig 21 on the other hand it can be noticed the appearance of a vortex on the pressure side ps near at the hub and is getting stronger by increasing the flow coefficient from 0 1 to 0 3 this vortex is stronger in case of using s1046 as the default blade section for wells turbine however s1046 in water doesn t show any region of separated flow near its hub on the pressures side ps at ϕ 0 1 5 3 effect of rotor solidity the rotor solidity σ is calculated by σ n c 2 π r where n is the number of blades c is the chord length and r is the radius it is obvious that varying the number of turbine blades n affects the rotor solidity σ due to its significance the effects of rotor solidity on the performance of the immersed wells turbine are investigated by varying the number of turbine blades eight and six turbine blades with the blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 airfoils at different values of flow coefficient ϕ are investigated corresponding to rotor solidity σ 0 48 and 0 64 respectively as shown in fig 22 however in order to be able to efficiently harness wave energy the solidity of the wells turbine has to be extremely low thus a lower rotor solidity σ of 0 24 is adopted which means that the hydraulic wells turbine in this work has only three blades n 3 knowing that the boccotti s owc device has a hydraulic turbine with only two blades n 2 and low rotor solidity and its speed is kept constant at 150 rpm fig 22 a reveals that decreasing the number of blades n decreases the rotor torque coefficient c t at any value of the flow coefficient ϕ consequently a wider range of operation is obtained by increasing the rotor solidity σ gradually from 0 24 to 0 64 by means increasing the number of blades n through the whole operating range the immersed turbine having s1046 blades possesses high torque coefficients when maintaining a rotor solidity σ of 0 64 and 0 48 in fig 22 b it can be noticed that the stagnation pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 of the eight bladed turbine is higher than that having six and three blades it is clear from fig 22 c that the turbine efficiency η of the turbine decreases significantly with an increase in rotor solidity σ by varying the number of turbine blades for the extremely low solidity σ 0 24 it can be noticed that pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 of s1046 blade is higher than that of naca 0015 which cause a reduction in efficiency for turbine with naca 0015 blade it can be concluded that for all values of rotor solidity the s1046 blade in water performs better than naca 0015 through the whole operating range from ϕ 0 075 to ϕ 0 3 in order to explain the effect of rotor solidity on the performance of the immersed hydraulic wells turbine which is the proposed concept the flow field around naca 0015 and s1046 blades is also investigated fig 23 depicts the contours of tangential velocity v θ on the mid plane for three different rotor solidities namely 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 at three flow coefficients in both blades these three flow coefficients are equal to 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 corresponding to low flow coefficient incipient stall and deep stall conditions fig 23 a and b show comparisons of the flow patterns between water turbines having naca 0015 and s1046 airfoils respectively at ϕ 0 1 fig 23 a and b shows approximately more attached flow from the leading edge to the trailing edge for all solidities because of the low axial velocity though it can be seen in fig 23 b that the s1046 with solidity equal to 0 24 at ϕ 0 1 has a thicker boundary layer to some extent than the others at ϕ 0 2 the tip leakage vortex becomes bigger toward the trailing edge and this leads to a deeper flow separation around that region in particular around the trailing edge of turbine rotors with extremely low solidity i e σ 0 24 at ϕ 0 3 fig 23 a and b indicate that a more considerable separation occurs around rotors of low solidity compared to high solidity rotors causing a narrower operating range and affects the performance harmfully it can be explained that the wide distance between the blades for the case of low solidity augment the vortex wake flow to enlarge separation zone on the blade suction surface furthermore occurrence of the stall condition becomes earlier with decreasing in rotor solidity which means that low solidity rotors perform worse than high solidity ones referring to fig 22 a c it can be noted that the incipient stall condition occurs at ϕ 0 225 when naca 0015 is used with rotor solidity equal to 0 24 0 48 and shifted to a higher value of flow coefficient ϕ 0 275 for solidity equal to 0 64 while the incipient stall condition of s1046 for σ 0 24 0 48 and 0 64 which occurs at ϕ 0 175 0 2 and 0 225 respectively a further explanation can be offered by observing fig 24 a and b the tangential velocity contours are depicted on three different planes near hub mid span and near tip the detailed flow around naca 0015 and s1046 can be found in fig 24 which demonstrates the tangential velocity v θ contours on three planes along the span wise direction of the blade these planes are located near hub 10 h mid span 50 h and near tip 90 h at flow coefficient ϕ 0 2 for three different values of rotor solidity equal to 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 as discussed before the flow separation increases with increasing the flow passage height h of the turbine this shows that the boundary layer profile of the high and low solidity is the same at low flow coefficients as revealed in fig 24 a and b it is obvious that the size of separation zone at the mid span and near tip is decreased substantially in the high solidity rotors having s1046 therefore it results in better performance for the s1046 with high values of solidity just beneath the tip h 90 the smaller separation zone in the s1046 with σ 0 64 is owing to the presence of high velocity mainstream which causes smaller interaction between the tip leakage vortex and the suction surface ss of the rotor blade furthermore it should be noted that the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and the mainstream near the tip zone h 90 of the high solidity rotors is stronger than that around the tip zone of the rotor solidity rotors because the velocity of the mainstream around the tip zone of the high solidity is higher than that in the vicinity of the tip zone of the low solidity rotors see fig 24 a and b at h 90 fig 25 shows the streamlines distribution at mid span of the flow passage h 50 around naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections in water with different rotor solidity at lower flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 the streamlines distribution is almost the same as the flow seems to be stuck to the most of suction surface ss of the two blades for all different solidities values it can be seen that the flow separation becomes more salient at ϕ 0 3 especially for hydraulic turbines consist of naca 0015 blades as the solidity decreases the separation bubble on the ss becomes smaller and closer to the leading edge le of the naca 0015 blade section however the separation bubble is not presented at any value of rotor solidity when using s1046 as the default blade section for immersed hydraulic wells turbine at ϕ 0 3 static pressure contours on both pressure and suction sides of the turbine blade with different rotor solidity at flow coefficients equal to 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are plotted and shown in figs 26 and 27 respectively the variation in the static pressure distribution on pressure side for rotor solidity σ 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 of two different blade profiles naca 0015 and s1046 is shown in fig 26 a and b respectively the region of high pressure on the pressure surface is marked in fig 26 a and b by a black solid rectangle and a black dotted line border as seen in fig 26 a for all values of flow coefficients the high pressure zone in the high solidity rotors is greater than that in the rotors with low solidity consequently the blade loading of the high solidity rotor is higher than the low solidity at these flow coefficients fig 27 a and b shows the static pressure distribution on suction surface ss of the two blade types naca 0015 and s1046 with different rotors of solidity σ 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 at flow coefficients ϕ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 as discussed before it can be observed that the higher and the lower pressure values are at the trailing edge and leading edge respectively at lower flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the pressure change is almost the same from the leading edge to the trailing edge in all solidity values for rotors having either naca 0015 or s1046 blades as flow coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the pressure on the two blade s suction surfaces increases from leading edge to trailing edge for all values of rotor solidity at ϕ 0 3 the low pressure zone in the s1046 blade 21 2 c 18 3 c and 17 2 c corresponding rotor solidity equal to 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 respectively is greater than that in the naca 0015 blade 9 7 c 4 6 c and 5 1 c corresponding rotor solidity equal to 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 respectively particularly near the tip zone of suction surface as shown in fig 27 a and b fig 28 shows the streamlines distribution on the ss with different rotor solidity at various flow coefficients ϕ as illustrated before the separation lines in this figure are marked by a red dotted line with an arrow indicating direction of the reversed flow at ϕ 0 1 the streamlines are uniform and remain almost attached on the ss of both blade sections naca0015 and s1046 in water for the three values of rotor solidity it can be noticed that the separation bubble is formed only on the ss of naca 0015 blade in water at ϕ 0 2 when the solidity is maintained at σ 0 64 furthermore low solidity turbines σ 0 24 showed no vortical behavior except for naca 0015 at ϕ 0 3 whereas two pair of vortices are observed large corner separation vortex near the hub le and smaller vortex near the tip te hence it can be concluded that the intensity of the vortical flow is higher in high solidity rotors than low solidity ones the flow pattern through hydraulic turbines having s1046 profile affirmed that no marked separation vortices could be appeared at the three values of rotor solidity fig 29 depicts the volume streamlines near the blade tip to illustrate the effect of tip leakage flow in hydraulic turbine with different rotor solidity at various flow coefficients ϕ at ϕ 0 1 the flow is attached to the blade surface showing uniform flow pattern in the tip region for all solidities for ϕ 0 2 the fluid near the blade tip mixes with a weak tip vortex on the ss rotors consist of s1046 blades with extremely low solidity σ 0 24 have the weakest tip vortex as compared to the others the stall condition is reached when the flow coefficient increased to 0 3 and s1046 showed the minimum tip leakage flow at the three studied values of rotor solidity σ 0 64 0 48 and 0 24 fig 30 presents the contours of radial vorticity component on the mid span of rotor blade with different rotor solidity it can be noticed that the flow is attached to the surface of the naca 0015 and s1046 blades for both low and high solidity rotors at ϕ 0 1 and 0 2 at ϕ 0 3 the flow is separated from the surface of the two blade profiles due to deep stalling this figure also indicates that positive and negative radial vorticity on the suction and pressure sides reduces as the rotor solidity reduces moreover the separated flow is appeared significantly in case of high solidity rotors fig 31 presents the contours of radial vorticity of rotors with three different solidity on planes of constant radius through 10 50 and 90 h at ϕ 0 2 this figure suggests that an increase in solidity leads to a decrease in blade stall angle at the near blade tip region h 90 at high angles of attack a separation vortex appears on the blade suction surface in the hub side to reduce the blade circulation because of the excessive angle of attack near the hub fig 32 presents the contour lines of radial vorticity component ξ r on the ss of immersed wells turbine with different rotor solidity at three flow coefficients the less rotor solidity is maintained the less size of separation zone the less negative radial vorticity on the suction side of the turbine blade is obtained for instant the flow remains attached over the whole suction surface of both naca 0015 and s1046 at the three flow coefficients for extremely low solidity rotors σ 0 24 but naca 0015 shows a separated area extending from the tip to the mid span at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 1 the separation regions could barely appear on the ss for all values of rotor solidity except for naca 0015 which introduces a marginal area of separation near at its hub near the te as indicated in fig 32 fig 33 depicts the tangential vorticity contours ξ θ on meridional plane x 0 for naca 0015 and s1046 in water with different rotor solidity this figure shows that the tip leakage vortex red in high solidity rotors is stronger than that in low solidity rotors for both blade types similarly the other counter rotating vortices blue become less effective by reducing the rotor solidity 6 conclusions the present work introduced a new operational concept of wells turbine where it is immersed inside water the results indicated that the present concept of immersed or hydraulic turbine is a promising for further wells turbine applications in sea wave energy conversion s wec wells turbine performance is computationally investigated using realizable k ε model with enhanced wall treatment to model the near wall flow where its numerical results are validated against experimental work the model is based on 3d steady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in multiple rotating reference frame mrf accordingly the following conclusions are obtained substantial improvements of the turbine performance are achieved when using water as a working fluid instead of air the maximum torque coefficient c t having naca 0015 reaches 1 36 times maximum torque value in air while the maximum increase in the torque coefficient c t reaches 1 4 times its value in air when s1046 profile is used despite the increased density and viscosity of water the pressure drop coefficient c δ p 0 has not changed through the whole range of operation the maximum increase in turbine efficiency in water having naca 0015 blade is about 4 times its efficiency in air at flow coefficient of ϕ 0 275 however the maximum increase in the efficiency of immersed turbine consists of s1046 blade is about 1 8 times the efficiency of air wells turbine at ϕ 0 3 the stall point is also delayed and a wider operating range with higher efficiency is achieved for the hydraulic turbine in water both torque coefficient and efficiency of wells turbine having s1046 blades in water are higher than its counterparts having naca 0015 blades either in air or in water the performance of immersed hydraulic turbine of naca 0015 and s1046 blade sections is better than air turbine having both profiles through the whole range of operation from ϕ 0 075 to ϕ 0 3 the performance is investigated when changing the rotor solidity a wider operation range of this turbine is obtained by increasing the rotor number of turbine blades increasing the number of turbine blades increases the rotor torque coefficient at different operating conditions s1046 is considered to be the most suitable blade cross section for immersed hydraulic wells turbine for the investigated three values of rotor solidities less effect of the blade type is found compared with the parameters of type of the working fluid and value of the rotor solidity 
23207,the underwater explosion bubbles have significant applications in the military but the characteristics of bubble jet near a solid wall are still not very clear due to convenience and high efficiency the boundary integral method is used to study the characteristics of bubble jet in this paper the shape of bubble jet is simplified to a cylindrical shape when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the characteristics of bubble jet are characterized by three parameters including the cylindrical width diameter the cylindrical height and the jet velocity by adjusting the charge weight w the detonated depth h and the stand off distance parameter γ γ h h r m where h is the depth of solid wall and r m is the maximum bubble radius the relations of the bubble jet width height and velocity with them are explored where three appropriate mathematical models are selected finally based on the least square method three estimate formulas for bubble jet width height and velocity are obtained which have good accuracy to predict the bubble jet width height and velocity when w 50 1000 kg h 50 500 m and γ 0 65 1 5 the purpose is to provide a reference for computing the damage of the bubble jet to structures in engineering keywords boundary integral method least square method bubble jet velocity bubble jet width bubble jet height 1 introduction warships submarines and other marine structures as the important military forces may be severely damaged by the explosion of typical weapons such as mines and torpedoes in combat environment after detonation of an underwater explosive charge a shock wave and a secondary wave pulse generated by bubble are created successively cole and weller 1948 besides for the explosion near the structures a high velocity bubble jet will be formed towards the structures during the collapse stage of bubble which may cause extensive damage to the surrounding structures already weakened and damaged by the first shock wave barras et al 2012 cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 the bubble jet is very complicated the characteristics of which such as velocity and shape are determined by a number of factors including the charge weight the detonated depth of the charge the stand off distance parameter etc so far the features of the shock wave and the pulse pressure induced by the underwater explosion bubble have been clearly understood however few literature focus on the characteristics of the bubble jet and the influences of the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter on the bubble jet are still not very clear so it is of great significance to systematically study the relations between them motivated by military necessities since the beginning of the 20th century the underwater explosion has been a research hotspot all over the world cole and weller 1948 made a systematic conclusion on underwater explosion where the semi empirical formulas on the relations of the shock wave the maximum bubble radius and the pulsation cycle of bubble with the charge weight and the detonated depth were conducted rayleigh 1917 established an analytical formula to describe the bubble motion in the infinite incompressible liquid field afterwards the spherical equation is improved with the liquid viscosity compressibility energy dissipation etc geers and hunter 2002 gilmore 1952 hickling and plesset 1964 plesset and prosperetti 1977 however the aforementioned spherical equations are inapplicable to the asymmetrical motion when bubble is near the solid wall for the bubble near the solid wall some analytical formulas are also established chahine and bovis 1983 chahine 1982 van der geld and kuerten 2009 but these formulas are only suitable for the description of very small deformation for the larger deformation of bubble especially for the bubble jet these analytical formulas have too many limitations for the asymmetrical bubble near the solid wall the bubble jet is a part of complex hydrodynamics whose velocity and shape are completely different with the change of the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter so it is impracticable to deduce an analytical formula directly to denote their relations thus it is necessary to explore other approaches to establish their relations the experiment is another important approach to study the underwater explosion the dynamic responses of various structures subjected to underwater explosion loading for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter were studied such as rectangular plates hammond and grzebieta 2000 hung et al 2005 hung and hwangfu 2010 long et al 2017 ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 ramajeyathilagam et al 2000 circular plates klaseboer et al 2005a ming et al 2016 rajendran and narasimhan 2001 submerged cylinders brett and yiannakopolous 2008 stiffened plates zhang et al 2017a ship type box structures wang et al 2014 surface ships zhang et al 2011 etc however few underwater explosion experiments were concerned with the characteristics of the bubble jet or the structural responses subjected to the bubble jet impact brett and yiannakopolous 2008 cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 the interactions of the cylinder with the shock wave the bubble pulse wave the bubble jet and the bubble collapse were studied by brett and yiannakopolous 2008 where the bubble jet impact and the bubble collapse were found to be the most severe structural loads zhang et al 2013 did some researches on the influences of different initial charge shape detonating styles and boundary conditions on the bubble jet direction cui et al 2016 used small charge to analyze the characteristics of the bubble jet near various boundary conditions where the pressure pulses induced by the bubble jet impact on the solid wall and by the collision of the annular jet were also measured those experiments however mainly analyzed the bubble jet phenomenon qualitatively and the relations of the bubble jet velocity and the bubble jet shape with the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter were still rarely studied with the development of computer various numerical methods are developed to study the bubble dynamics and those numerical methods are mainly divided into three categories including boundary integral method brujan et al 2002 jayaprakash et al 2012 klaseboer et al 2005b li et al 2015 2016 ni et al 2015 wang 2014 wang et al 2005 the euler equations or navier stokes equations coupled with interface capture method or interface tracking method barras et al 2012 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 doihara and takahashi 2001 hsu et al 2014 liu et al 2017a 2018 popinet and zaleski 2002 and hybrid numerical approaches hsiao and chahine 2015 hsiao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2017b some researchers had done some works on the characteristics of the bubble jet using those numerical methods but most studies were not systematic on the basis of the boundary integral boundary jayaprakash et al 2012 numerically and experimentally studied the spark generated bubble dynamics near a vertical wall where the characteristics of the bubble jet such as jet velocity jet width jet base radius jet length jet equivalent cylinder radius etc with time or with stand off distance parameter were conducted ni et al 2015 also used the boundary integral method to study the spark generated bubble impact on a solid wall numerically and experimentally where the variations of the time and the jet tip velocity at the moment of impact with different stand off distance parameter were discussed other researchers also done some works on the pressure generated by the bubble jet impact on the solid wall using the boundary integral boundary li et al 2015 wang et al 2005 popinet and zaleski 2002 used the front tracking method to analyze the influence of viscosity on jet formation and evolution where an impact condition that the jet never impacts the other side of the bubble was obtained subsequently the characteristics of bubble jet in the toroidal stage were supplemented by liu et al 2018 and liu et al 2017a using the same method the jet generated by the bubble is usually accompanied with a high velocity so the compressibility of liquid cannot be neglected when the jet impacts on the solid wall hsiao et al 2014 used a hybrid numerical approach to study non spherical bubble dynamics near a sold wall where the bubble dynamics during expansion stage was captured by boundary integral method solver and the bubble jet impact was solved by a compressible finite difference flow solver the similar works were also done by wang et al 2016 using boundary integral method and discontinuous galerkin method for convenience in engineering the bubble jet is usually simplified to a cylindrical shape or other equivalent shapes and then the structural dynamics are computed by the equivalent jet the liquid jets with various shapes were also extensively studied by a large number of researchers foldyna et al 2009 guha et al 2011 hsu et al 2013 kibar et al 2010 as mentioned above the bubble dynamics have been extensively studied using various methods owing to the complexity of the bubble jet the characteristics of the bubble jet and the damage mechanisms of the bubble jet to structure in engineering are still not very clear due to convenience and high efficiency the boundary integral method is used to study the characteristics of the bubble jet in this paper where the shape of bubble jet is simplified to a cylindrical shape when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the characteristics of bubble jet are characterized by three parameters including the cylindrical width diameter the cylindrical height and the jet velocity by adjusting the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter the relations of the bubble jet width height and velocity with them are explored combined with the least square method the purpose is to provide a reference for computing the damage of the bubble jet to structure in engineering 2 numerical model 2 1 boundary integral method after the explosive charge is detonated in water a high pressure will be formed inside the bubble subsequently under the combined action of the high pressure and infinity pressure the bubble expands and collapses with a high reynolds number where the effect of viscosity on the bubble motion can be ignored generally brujan et al 2002 klaseboer et al 2005b the liquid compressibility is also ignored klaseboer et al 2005a 2005b it is assumed that the liquid is undisturbed before bubble expansion and collapse and the motion and deformation of bubble are thought to be axially symmetrical as shown in fig 1 therefore the liquid velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential ϕ in the form of cylindrical coordinates which satisfies laplace s equation 1 2 ϕ 0 based on the green s third identity with the green function g the laplace s equation can be transformed into following the boundary integral equation 2 λ p t ϕ p t s ϕ q t n g p q ϕ q t n g p q d s where p is the field or control point and q is the integral or source point s is the bubble surface as shown in k 1 n denotes the outward normal derivative at the boundary s λ p t is the solid angle g p q is the green function for a bubble near an infinite solid wall which is taken as brujan et al 2002 wang et al 2005 3 g p q 1 p q 1 p q where q is the reflected point of q with regard to the solid wall here we assume the scale of the solid wall is larger than the maximum radius r m so the influence of the solid wall in fig 1 on the bubble dynamics can be simulated by eq 3 the bubble boundary s is discretized into n nodes and n 1 linear elements the ϕ q t inside the elements can be obtained by the linear interpolation of the corresponding endpoint values then the boundary integral equation in discretized form can be expressed as 4 h φ t ψ where h is the n n coefficient matrix which is composed of the left term and the second term on the right side in eq 2 t is also the n n coefficient matrix denoting the first term on the right side in eq 2 φ and ψ are the n 1 column vectors which represents the velocity potential ϕ and its derivative ϕ n respectively in the process of solving the coefficient matrix h and t the strong singularity and the weak singularity will be formed in diagonal elements in h and t respectively which can be avoided very well using some special techniques klaseboer et al 2009 wilkerson 1993 the velocity potential ϕ at the bubble surface s can be updated using the following dynamics boundary condition 5 d ϕ d t 1 2 ϕ 2 p p b ρ σ κ ρ g z where ρ is the density of liquid σ is the surface tension coefficient κ the local surface curvature g the gravitational acceleration p is the infinite pressure at z 0 p b is the internal pressure of bubble which is assumed as uniform distribution and consists of a constant vapor pressure and a volume dependent non condensable gas pressure according to the adiabatic assumption the pressure p b can be expressed as klaseboer et al 2005a 2005b liu et al 2017b 6 p b p v p 0 r 0 r 3 ϑ where p v is the vapor pressure p 0 is the initial non condensable gas pressure at initial bubble radius r 0 r that is the bubble radius varies with bubble motion ϑ is the ratio of specific heats which is taken as 1 25 approximately after the velocity potential ϕ at the bubble surface is obtained the normal velocity ϕ n can be computed using the linear eq 4 and the shear velocity ϕ τ is directly obtained by computing the tangential gradient of ϕ along the surface then the bubble surface position x is updated by the kinematic boundary condition 7 d x d t ϕ in order to make the numerical simulation maintain stable the time step δ t in eq 5 and eq 7 is controlled using the following expression wang et al 2005 8 δ t δ ϕ max 1 2 ϕ 2 p p b ρ σ κ ρ g z 2 2 toroidal bubble model near the later stage of bubble collapse owing to the bjerknes forces crum 1975 pelekasis and tsamopoulos 1993 a high speed liquid jet is formed towards the solid wall the bubble changes from a singly connected domain to the doubly connected domain when the jet penetrates the opposite surface resulting in non unique velocity potential produced for this situation the integral boundary method in section 2 1 will be terminated for the subsequent computation in order to deal with this problem a vortex ring model is introduced to compute subsequent toroidal bubble motion the velocity potential ϕ is divided into two parts the potential ϕ v r induced by the vortex ring and the remnant potential ϕ r e wang et al 2005 9 ϕ ϕ v r ϕ r e the dynamics boundary condition in eq 5 and the kinematic boundary condition in eq 7 can be written in term of ϕ v r and ϕ r e as follows wang et al 2005 10 d ϕ r e d t 1 2 ϕ v r ϕ r e 2 ϕ v r ϕ v r ϕ r e p p b ρ σ κ ρ g z 11 d x d t ϕ v r ϕ r e where the remnant potential ϕ r e is updated in the same manner as the original velocity potential ϕ using the boundary integral method according to the biot savart law the potential ϕ v r is determined by the strength and position of the vortex ring with the assumption that jet impact occurs at one point the vortex ring strength is referred as the jump of potential ϕ across the jet impact points 2 3 initial parameters when the motion of underwater explosion bubble is simulated by updating the node velocity potential and position at the bubble surface using the boundary integral method the initial parameters should be determined first if the charge weight w and the detonated depth h is determined the maximum radius r m the internal pressure p 0 at bubble inception and initial radius r 0 can also be obtained easily by a great quantity of underwater explosion experiments the relation of r m with w and h was summarized as follows cole and weller 1948 12 r m 3 38 w h 10 1 3 where the maximum radius r m increases with the increase of charge weight w and decreases with the increase of the detonated depth h after the charge is detonated the internal pressure p 0 at bubble inception can be expressed as 13 p 0 1 39 10 5 3 4 w π r 0 3 ϑ the determination of the initial bubble radius r 0 should be associated with the rayleigh plesset equation plesset and prosperetti 1977 rayleigh 1917 14 r r 3 2 r 2 1 ρ p v p 0 r 0 r 3 ϑ 2 σ r p for the underwater explosion bubble the surface tension is insignificant in comparison to the internal pressure so the surface tension can be neglected integrate the rayleigh plesset equation from r 0 to r m combined with r 0 when r r 0 and r r m then the internal pressure p 0 is expressed as 15 p 0 p p v 1 ϑ 1 r 0 r m 3 1 r 0 r m 3 ϑ 1 the p 0 in eq 15 is replaced by eq 13 resulting in 16 1 39 10 5 p p v 1 ϑ 1 3 w 4 π r m 3 ϑ 1 r 0 r m 3 ϑ 1 r 0 r m 3 1 on the basis of eq 12 eq 13 and eq 16 the initial radius r 0 and the initial internal pressure p 0 can be obtained once the charge weight w and the detonated depth h are determined 3 verification of numerical model in this section in order to prove the validity of the boundary integral method for underwater explosion bubble an underwater explosion experiment is conducted in a 2m 2m 2m cubic steel water tank filled with tap water the relative position of underwater explosion bubble with solid wall and free surface is shown in fig 1 the charge type the charge weight w the detonated depth h and the depth of the solid wall h are displayed in table 1 the charge is ignited by an electric detonator with room temperature 34 8 c and atmospheric pressure 0 101 m p a and the bubble motion is captured by the phantom v12 1 high speed camera from a 0 4m 0 7 m transparent window at 5000 frames s with an exposure time 199 6 μ s the maximum bubble radius r m approximately equals to 0 265 m and the spatial resolution 1 08 m m per pixel more detailed information about the experimental setup can be found in the work of cui et al 2016 according to eq 12 eq 13 and eq 16 the initial bubble radius r 0 0 0204 m and the initial internal pressure p 0 66 928 m p a for the boundary integral method the influence of the node number n and δ ϕ in eq 8 on bubble motion had been studied in the work of liu et al 2017b where the results is almost convergent when n 70 and δ ϕ 0 01 which is adopted in our computations the comparison of numerical results with underwater explosion bubble experiment is shown in fig 2 after the explosive charge is detonated a high pressure gas surrounded by the liquid is formed as shown in fig 2 a under the combined actions of the high pressure and the atmospheric pressure the bubble begins to expand during early the expansion stage the bubble approximately maintains spherical form as shown in fig 2 b when the bubble reaches the maximum volume the top surface become little flat owing to the influence of the solid wall as shown in fig 2 c subsequently since the pressure inside the bubble is less than the atmospheric pressure the bubble begins to collapse as shown in fig 2 d as the bubble continues to collapse a local high pressure region is formed underneath the bubble resulting in a bubble jet as shown in fig 2 e with the development of the bubble jet the bubble is going to change from a singly connected domain to the doubly connected domain as shown in fig 2 f when the bubble jet impacts on the opposite surface the numerical simulation will be terminated owing to the non unique velocity potential in order to deal with this problem a vortex ring model in section 2 2 is introduced to compute the toroidal bubble motion after the bubble jet penetrates the opposite surface a local high pressure region is produced above the bubble owing to the impact of high velocity jet with low velocity flow as shown in fig 2 g meanwhile a protrusion is formed due to the drag of the bubble jet subsequently the protrusion continues to grow and extend upward with the development of the bubble jet as shown in fig 2 h as a whole except for the protrusion in the toroidal stage the numerical results are in good agreement with the results from the underwater explosion bubble experiment especially for the bubble motion before the toroidal stage the protrusion in the toroidal stage mainly consists of mixture of gas and liquid where a lot of broken small bubbles are included so it is difficult for the boundary integral method to simulate the mixture of gas and liquid completely in fact in the subsequent study we are primary concerned with the characteristics of bubble jet when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the toroidal bubble motion we do not consider the boundary integral method used to simulate the underwater explosion bubble has also been validated by a large part of researchers li et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2017a so it is appropriate in our paper to use the boundary integral method to study the characteristics of the underwater explosion bubble jet 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 simplified model cases and least square method near the later collapse stage of bubble a high speed liquid jet will be formed towards the solid wall the characteristics of the bubble jet including the jet velocity and the jet shape are significantly associated with the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter here the velocity of the bubble jet impact on the opposite surface is chosen to represent the final velocity of the bubble jet which is denoted by v as the black point in fig 3 a by contrast the bubble jet shape is much more complicated which will be different with the change of the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter in order to better study the bubble jet qualitatively the bubble jet shape needs to be simplified then in the case of the same area of the cross section the bubble jet shape is equivalent to a cylinder with width diameter d and height l as shown in fig 3 b the formation of the bubble jet is mainly dependent on two factors one is the buoyancy and another is the bjerknes forces the buoyancy is associated with the maximum bubble radius determined by the charge weight and the detonated depth the bjerknes forces are associated with the distance between the bubble and the solid wall here the ratio of the distance between the bubble and the solid wall with the maximum radius is used to characterize the influence of the bjerknes forces on the bubble jet where the ratio is expressed as the stand off distance parameter γ 17 γ h h r m the detonated depth in eq 12 is replaced by eq 17 then the relation of the maximum radius with the charge weight the depth of solid wall and the stand off distance parameter is expressed as 18 r m 3 38 w h λ r m 10 1 3 the influences of the stand off distance parameter the charge weight and the detonated depth on the characteristics of the bubble jet including velocity width and height are studied in this paper the stand off distance parameter can intuitively reflect the threat of the bubble jet to the solid wall if the γ is too large the bubble jet velocity will be weakened by the water layer between the bubble with the solid wall liu et al 2018 so the large value of γ is not suitable here the γ is set from 0 65 to 1 5 the charge weight is set from 50 kg to 1000 kg to simulate underwater explosion with a large amount of tnt the depth of the solid wall is set from 50 m to 500 m to simulate explosion in deep water and the detonated depth can be obtained combined with eqs 17 and 18 the detailed initial parameters are displayed in table 2 where the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight are divided into 10 10 and 19 parts respectively together resulting in 1900 combinations the underwater explosion bubble is affected by many factors so it is hard to use an analytical solution to describe the asymmetric bubble dynamics especially for the jet characteristics in nature some kind of inevitable relations exist between many objects so it is very important to seek a scientific method to analyze the implicit relations between different objects here the least square method is adopted to analyze the relations of the bubble jet velocity width and height with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight as follows 1 provide the data 18a x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x l i y i i 1 2 3 m 2 establish the function model s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i 18b s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i k 0 n a k φ k x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i n m 3 solve the function model f a 0 a 1 a n 18c f a 0 a 1 a n i 1 m w i y i s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i 2 where x l i denotes independent variable such as the depth of the solid wall etc l denotes the number of the independent variable y i represents dependent variable such as the jet velocity i represents the i th group data m denotes the total number of the group data a k denotes the k th coefficient φ k denotes the k th subfunction n denotes the total number of a k and φ k w i denotes the i th weight coefficient which is greater than 0 minimize the function f a 0 a 1 a n and solve the coefficients a k k 0 n finally the function s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i is obtained which represents the relations of the bubble jet velocity width and height with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight 4 2 estimate formula for jet velocity the velocity at the bottom pole of bubble surface with time for different depth of the solid wall is shown in fig 4 during the expansion stage the velocity has not too much difference for different depth but during the collapse stage the obvious difference appears where the velocity with time changes more violent when the solid wall is located in the deep water meanwhile the jet velocity in the deep water is greater than in the shallow water usually the bubble jet velocity is closely associated with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight but it is complicated to use the least square method to simultaneously analyze the relation of the bubble jet velocity with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight for simplicity and convenience the number of the independent variables h γ and w should be reduced here the depth of the solid wall is removed and is divided into 10 parts from 50 m to 500 m as shown in table 2 for each part of the depth of the solid wall the bubble jet velocity is just characterized by the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight according to the initial parameters in table 2 for a certain depth of the solid wall the relation of the bubble jet velocity with the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight is described by 190 data before fitting the data it is necessary to analyze the correlation of dependent variable v with independent variables γ and w and then establish the corresponding mathematical model in fig 5 a the bubble jet velocity for different charge weight is displayed where the velocity decreases with the increase of the charge weight and the change of v turns slower for the large w which accords with the characteristic of the power function w a a 0 in fig 5 b the bubble jet velocity for different stand off distance parameter is displayed where an inflection point exists when γ is approximately equal to 0 7 which is more evident in subsequent fig 8 b when γ 0 7 the bubble jet velocity increases with increase of γ however the velocity decreases with increase of γ when γ 0 7 so the relation between the bubble jet velocity and the stand off distance parameter can be described by the polynomial function by comparing a variety of mathematical model an appropriate model is selected as follows 19 v a 1 w 100 a 2 λ a 3 a 4 λ a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 denote the unknown coefficients according to 190 data for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 the unknown coefficients in eq 19 can be solved using the least square method in eq 18 the coefficients for depth of the solid wall are displayed in table 3 after the coefficients in table 3 are obtained the bubble jet velocity for different stand off distance parameter charge weight and depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed using eq 19 in fig 6 for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the whole comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the fitted surface plotted by eq 19 is displayed where the numerical data are interspersed around the fitted surface and the maximum error between them is only 2 0 as a whole the fitted surface is in good agreement with the numerical data the relation of the bubble jet velocity with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter can be obviously distinguished by the color of the fitted surface the large jet velocity is mainly concentrated in the red region with small charge weight and large stand off distance parameter and the small jet velocity is mainly located in the blue region with large charge weight and small stand off distance parameter in order to further verify the accuracy of the fitted surface for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m and 250 m the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the curves from the fitted surface for different charge weight is shown in figs 7 a and fig 8 a respectively where the curves coincide with the numerical data well for the stand off distance parameter γ 0 65 1 0 and 1 5 the local comparison for different stand off distance parameter is also depicted in figs 7 b and fig 8 b respectively where the curves also agree well with the numerical data for the charge weight w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg even though an evident inflection point exists in the numerical data when γ 0 7 in fig 8 b which is also expressed by fitted eq 19 perfectly through the analysis of the bubble jet velocity for a certain depth of the solid wall and charge weight the velocity with the stand off distance parameter is intriguing the velocity does not always decrease with the decrease of the stand off distance parameter but a minimum value emerges when γ 0 7 as the bubble continues to approach to the solid wall the velocity begins to increase this phenomenon is very hard to be discovered in the underwater explosion bubble experiments owing to the opaque of the jet inside the bubble but similar works had been studied by shima et al 1984 tomita and shima 1986 and tomita et al 1983 using the spark generated bubble experiments where the behaviour of the jet and the impulsive pressures induced by a bubble collapse near a solid boundary were discussed combined with results obtained by pressure transducer and photoelastic methods in the works of shima et al 1984 tomita and shima 1986 and tomita et al 1983 when γ 1 2 the bubble jet impact precedes the shock wave induced outward by the bubble at the minimum volume where the impulsive pressure is closely associated with the jet impact the pressure peak at the first bubble collapse appears minimum value when γ is approximately equal to 0 6 for the region γ 0 6 the pressure peak at the first bubble collapse increases with the decrease of γ it is clear that the pressure peak at the first bubble collapse with γ is similar to the bubble jet velocity with γ when the bubble is enough close to the solid wall the reason for this phenomenon can be explained by the water hammer theory tomita and shima 1986 the similar researches also had been done by philipp and lauterborn 1998 using laser produced bubbles the comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the fitted surface for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter has been conducted in order to further validate the accuracy of the fitted surface the comparison for different depth of the solid wall should be implemented the bubble jet velocity for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed by eq 19 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 3 the bubble jet velocity for other depth of the solid wall not included in table 2 can be interpolated by the jet velocity for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 in fig 9 for the charge weight w 500 kg and the stand off distance parameter γ 1 0 the comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the interpolated curves from the fitted surface for different depth of the solid wall is displayed where the velocity increases with the increase of the depth of the solid wall the corresponding error analysis is shown in table 4 where the numerical bubble jet velocity agrees well with the interpolated curves and the maximum error is no more than 1 2 so even though the independent variable h is not included in eq 19 the bubble jet velocity for any depth of the solid wall can also be computed accurately by eq 19 combined with the coefficients in table 2 using the interpolation method by comparing the numerical bubble jet velocity with the fitted result for different charge weight stand off distance parameter and depth of the solid wall it shows that the mathematical model in eq 19 combined with the coefficients in table 3 can represent the bubble jet velocity accurately when w 50 kg 1000 kg γ 0 65 1 5 and h 50 m 500 m 4 3 estimate formula for jet width the bubble jet width is another important characteristic of the liquid jet which denotes the area of the jet impact on the solid wall like the jet velocity the 1900 data for the bubble jet width are separated into 10 parts along the direction of the depth of the solid wall for each certain depth of the solid wall in table 2 the bubble jet width is only controlled by the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter before determining the mathematical model the trend of the bubble jet width with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter should be analyzed respectively in fig 10 a for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the bubble jet width with different charge weight is displayed for γ 0 65 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the width is closely associated with the scale of the bubble so the width increases with the increase of the charge weight the trend of which conforms to the feature of the power function w a but the coefficient a is different from the jet velocity for the jet width the coefficient a is between 0 and 1 in fig 10 b the bubble jet width with different stand off distance parameter is displayed for w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg respectively there are no big differences for all bubble jet widths when γ is from 0 65 to 1 5 here the relation of the bubble jet width with γ is denoted by the polynomial function by comparison a preferable mathematical model is chosen to describe the correlation of the bubble jet width d with w and γ as follows 20 d w 100 a 1 a 2 λ 3 a 3 λ 2 a 4 λ a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 denote the unknown coefficients according to 190 data for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 the unknown coefficients in eq 20 can be solved using the least square method in eq 18 the coefficients for each depth of the solid wall are displayed in table 5 for a certain depth of the solid wall h 50 m the whole comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the fitted surface plotted by eq 20 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 5 is depicted in fig 11 from the point of view of the relative positions between the fitted surface and the numerical data the fitted surface is in good agreement with the numerical data where the maximum error between them is only 1 4 for other certain depth of the solid wall in table 5 the similar accuracy between the fitted surface and the corresponding numerical data also exists which is not displayed here through the distribution of the color on the fitted surface the relation of the bubble jet width with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter is very intuitive the change of the bubble jet width along the direction of the stand off distance parameter is not evident and the large bubble jet width is located in the red region with the large charge weight after the whole comparison is conducted the local comparison between the numerical bubble jet width with the curves from the fitted surface for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter should also be implemented respectively for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m and 250 m the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the curves from the fitted surface for different charge weight is depicted in fig 12 a and fig 13 a respectively where the curves coincide with the numerical data with high accuracy for γ 0 65 1 0 and 1 5 correspondingly the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the curves from the fitted surface for different stand off distance parameter is depicted in figs 12 b and fig 13 b respectively also the curves agree perfectly with the numerical data for w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg so the mathematical model chosen in eq 20 is accurate to express the relation of the bubble jet width with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter in order to further validate the accuracy of eq 20 the comparison along the direction of the depth of the solid wall is implemented the bubble jet width for the depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed by eq 20 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 5 the bubble jet width for other depth of the solid wall not included in table 2 can be interpolated by the bubble jet width for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 in table 6 some new depths of the solid wall are displayed where the corresponding numerical bubble jet widths are computed by the integral boundary equation the comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the curve from the fitted surface for different depth of the solid wall is shown in fig 14 where both agree well with each other evidently the bubble jet width decreases with the increase of the depth of the solid wall the errors between the bubble jet widths interpolated from the curve and the numerical results are shown in table 6 where the maximum error is no more than 1 0 so eq 20 combined with the coefficients in table 6 also has a high accuracy to compute the bubble jet width along the direction of the depth of the solid wall by comparing the fitted values with the numerical bubble jet widths for different charge weight stand off distance parameter and depth of the solid wall it shows that the mathematical model in eq 20 combined with the coefficients in table 6 can compute the bubble jet width accurately when w 50 kg 1000 kg γ 0 65 1 5 and h 50 m 500 m 4 4 estimate formula for jet height the bubble jet height is also a significant feature of the liquid jet which decides the total time of the bubble jet impact on the solid wall the same as the bubble jet velocity and width the 1900 data in table 2 are also divided into 10 parts according to the depth of the solid wall in table 2 for each depth the trend of the bubble jet height is only affected by the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter in fig 15 a for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the bubble jet height with different charge weight is displayed for γ 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the same as the bubble jet width the bubble jet height is also closely associated with the scale of the bubble the relation of the maximum bubble radius with the charge weight is controlled by the power function as shown in eq 12 so the relation of the bubble jet height with the charge weight also meets the characteristic of the power function w a 0 a 1 in fig 15 b the bubble jet height with different stand off distance parameter is displayed for w 50 kg 500 kg and 100 kg respectively the trend of the bubble jet height with γ is similar to the bubble jet width but an evident maximum height exists when γ equals to a certain value for each charge weight here the relation of the bubble jet height with the stand off distance parameter is also denoted by the polynomial function by screening the same mathematic model as the bubble jet width is selected to express the correlation of the bubble jet height with w and γ as follows 21 l w 100 a 1 a 2 λ 3 a 3 λ 2 a 4 λ a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 denote the unknown coefficients according to 190 data for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 the unknown coefficients in eq 21 can be solved using the least square method in eq 18 the coefficients for each depth of the solid wall are displayed in table 7 for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the whole comparison of the numerical bubble jet height from the 190 data in table 2 with the mathematical model in eq 21 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 7 is depicted in fig 16 where the maximum error is only 2 8 as a whole the fitted surface coincides well with the numerical data the bubble jet height and the bubble jet width are both associated with the scale of the bubble but the trends for both with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter have a little difference here the bubble jet height along the direction of the stand off distance parameter has an evident change which can be seen clearly by the color in fig 16 with the increase of the charge weight the maximum bubble jet height for each charge weight moves towards the increasing direction of the stand off distance parameter for the depths of the solid wall h 50 m and 250 m the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet height with the curves from the corresponding fitted surface for different charge weight is depicted in fig 17 a and fig 18 a respectively for γ 0 65 and 1 0 the curves are in good agreement with the numerical data when γ 1 5 the curves deviate with the numerical data for the larger charge weight however through the error analysis the maximum errors only have 2 2 and 3 1 respectively which are acceptable correspondingly the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet height with the curves for different stand off distance parameter is depicted in figs 17 b and fig 18 b respectively for w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg the numerical data are scattered on or around the curves and the trends of the numerical data with γ are also denoted perfectly by the curves after the comparisons of the numerical bubble jet height with eq 21 for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter are conducted the accuracy of the mathematical model in eq 21 with the coefficients in table 7 for different depth of the solid wall should also be validated the same as the bubble jet velocity and width some new numerical bubble jet heights are recomputed using the boundary integral equation where the corresponding depths of the solid wall are shown in table 8 the fitted bubble jet height for the depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed using eq 21 with the corresponding coefficients in table 7 for other depth of the solid wall not included in table 2 the corresponding bubble jet height can be interpolated by the fitted bubble jet height for the depth of the solid wall in table 2 in fig 19 the comparison of the new numerical bubble jet height with the curves from the fitted surface for different depth of the solid wall is depicted where the curve agrees well with the new numerical data and the relation of the bubble jet height with the depth of the solid wall is same as the bubble jet width this is because the bubble jet height and width are closely associated with the scale of the bubble and in deep water the scale of the bubble will decrease as shown in eq 12 the errors between them are displayed in table 8 where the maximum error only has 2 71 so eq 21 with the coefficients in table 7 also has a good accuracy for different depth of the solid wall through comparative analysis eq 21 with the coefficients in table 7 can compute the bubble jet height well when w 50 kg 1000 kg γ 0 65 1 5 and h 50 m 500 m 5 conclusions due to convenience and high efficiency the boundary integral method is used to study the characteristics of bubble jet the bubble jet shape is simplified to a cylindrical shape when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the characteristics of bubble jet are denoted by the cylindrical width the cylindrical height and the jet velocity based on the least square method three estimate formulas with good accuracy are obtained to denote the relations of the bubble jet width the bubble jet height and the bubble jet velocity with the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance when w 50 1000 kg h 50 500 m and γ 0 65 1 5 some detailed conclusions are as follows 1 the bubble jet velocity decreases with the increase of the charge weight which accords with the characteristic of the power function w a a 0 when γ 0 7 the jet velocity increases with increase of γ but decreases with increase of γ when γ 0 7 with the increase of the detonated depth the jet velocity also increases 2 the bubble jet width and the bubble jet height increase with the increase of the charge weight the trends of which conform to the feature of the power function w a 0 a 1 the jet widths are no big differences when γ is from 0 65 to 1 5 but an evident maximum jet height exists when γ equals to a certain value for each charge weight when the detonated depth increases the jet width and the jet height decrease acknowledgments

23207,the underwater explosion bubbles have significant applications in the military but the characteristics of bubble jet near a solid wall are still not very clear due to convenience and high efficiency the boundary integral method is used to study the characteristics of bubble jet in this paper the shape of bubble jet is simplified to a cylindrical shape when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the characteristics of bubble jet are characterized by three parameters including the cylindrical width diameter the cylindrical height and the jet velocity by adjusting the charge weight w the detonated depth h and the stand off distance parameter γ γ h h r m where h is the depth of solid wall and r m is the maximum bubble radius the relations of the bubble jet width height and velocity with them are explored where three appropriate mathematical models are selected finally based on the least square method three estimate formulas for bubble jet width height and velocity are obtained which have good accuracy to predict the bubble jet width height and velocity when w 50 1000 kg h 50 500 m and γ 0 65 1 5 the purpose is to provide a reference for computing the damage of the bubble jet to structures in engineering keywords boundary integral method least square method bubble jet velocity bubble jet width bubble jet height 1 introduction warships submarines and other marine structures as the important military forces may be severely damaged by the explosion of typical weapons such as mines and torpedoes in combat environment after detonation of an underwater explosive charge a shock wave and a secondary wave pulse generated by bubble are created successively cole and weller 1948 besides for the explosion near the structures a high velocity bubble jet will be formed towards the structures during the collapse stage of bubble which may cause extensive damage to the surrounding structures already weakened and damaged by the first shock wave barras et al 2012 cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 the bubble jet is very complicated the characteristics of which such as velocity and shape are determined by a number of factors including the charge weight the detonated depth of the charge the stand off distance parameter etc so far the features of the shock wave and the pulse pressure induced by the underwater explosion bubble have been clearly understood however few literature focus on the characteristics of the bubble jet and the influences of the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter on the bubble jet are still not very clear so it is of great significance to systematically study the relations between them motivated by military necessities since the beginning of the 20th century the underwater explosion has been a research hotspot all over the world cole and weller 1948 made a systematic conclusion on underwater explosion where the semi empirical formulas on the relations of the shock wave the maximum bubble radius and the pulsation cycle of bubble with the charge weight and the detonated depth were conducted rayleigh 1917 established an analytical formula to describe the bubble motion in the infinite incompressible liquid field afterwards the spherical equation is improved with the liquid viscosity compressibility energy dissipation etc geers and hunter 2002 gilmore 1952 hickling and plesset 1964 plesset and prosperetti 1977 however the aforementioned spherical equations are inapplicable to the asymmetrical motion when bubble is near the solid wall for the bubble near the solid wall some analytical formulas are also established chahine and bovis 1983 chahine 1982 van der geld and kuerten 2009 but these formulas are only suitable for the description of very small deformation for the larger deformation of bubble especially for the bubble jet these analytical formulas have too many limitations for the asymmetrical bubble near the solid wall the bubble jet is a part of complex hydrodynamics whose velocity and shape are completely different with the change of the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter so it is impracticable to deduce an analytical formula directly to denote their relations thus it is necessary to explore other approaches to establish their relations the experiment is another important approach to study the underwater explosion the dynamic responses of various structures subjected to underwater explosion loading for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter were studied such as rectangular plates hammond and grzebieta 2000 hung et al 2005 hung and hwangfu 2010 long et al 2017 ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 ramajeyathilagam et al 2000 circular plates klaseboer et al 2005a ming et al 2016 rajendran and narasimhan 2001 submerged cylinders brett and yiannakopolous 2008 stiffened plates zhang et al 2017a ship type box structures wang et al 2014 surface ships zhang et al 2011 etc however few underwater explosion experiments were concerned with the characteristics of the bubble jet or the structural responses subjected to the bubble jet impact brett and yiannakopolous 2008 cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 the interactions of the cylinder with the shock wave the bubble pulse wave the bubble jet and the bubble collapse were studied by brett and yiannakopolous 2008 where the bubble jet impact and the bubble collapse were found to be the most severe structural loads zhang et al 2013 did some researches on the influences of different initial charge shape detonating styles and boundary conditions on the bubble jet direction cui et al 2016 used small charge to analyze the characteristics of the bubble jet near various boundary conditions where the pressure pulses induced by the bubble jet impact on the solid wall and by the collision of the annular jet were also measured those experiments however mainly analyzed the bubble jet phenomenon qualitatively and the relations of the bubble jet velocity and the bubble jet shape with the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter were still rarely studied with the development of computer various numerical methods are developed to study the bubble dynamics and those numerical methods are mainly divided into three categories including boundary integral method brujan et al 2002 jayaprakash et al 2012 klaseboer et al 2005b li et al 2015 2016 ni et al 2015 wang 2014 wang et al 2005 the euler equations or navier stokes equations coupled with interface capture method or interface tracking method barras et al 2012 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 doihara and takahashi 2001 hsu et al 2014 liu et al 2017a 2018 popinet and zaleski 2002 and hybrid numerical approaches hsiao and chahine 2015 hsiao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2017b some researchers had done some works on the characteristics of the bubble jet using those numerical methods but most studies were not systematic on the basis of the boundary integral boundary jayaprakash et al 2012 numerically and experimentally studied the spark generated bubble dynamics near a vertical wall where the characteristics of the bubble jet such as jet velocity jet width jet base radius jet length jet equivalent cylinder radius etc with time or with stand off distance parameter were conducted ni et al 2015 also used the boundary integral method to study the spark generated bubble impact on a solid wall numerically and experimentally where the variations of the time and the jet tip velocity at the moment of impact with different stand off distance parameter were discussed other researchers also done some works on the pressure generated by the bubble jet impact on the solid wall using the boundary integral boundary li et al 2015 wang et al 2005 popinet and zaleski 2002 used the front tracking method to analyze the influence of viscosity on jet formation and evolution where an impact condition that the jet never impacts the other side of the bubble was obtained subsequently the characteristics of bubble jet in the toroidal stage were supplemented by liu et al 2018 and liu et al 2017a using the same method the jet generated by the bubble is usually accompanied with a high velocity so the compressibility of liquid cannot be neglected when the jet impacts on the solid wall hsiao et al 2014 used a hybrid numerical approach to study non spherical bubble dynamics near a sold wall where the bubble dynamics during expansion stage was captured by boundary integral method solver and the bubble jet impact was solved by a compressible finite difference flow solver the similar works were also done by wang et al 2016 using boundary integral method and discontinuous galerkin method for convenience in engineering the bubble jet is usually simplified to a cylindrical shape or other equivalent shapes and then the structural dynamics are computed by the equivalent jet the liquid jets with various shapes were also extensively studied by a large number of researchers foldyna et al 2009 guha et al 2011 hsu et al 2013 kibar et al 2010 as mentioned above the bubble dynamics have been extensively studied using various methods owing to the complexity of the bubble jet the characteristics of the bubble jet and the damage mechanisms of the bubble jet to structure in engineering are still not very clear due to convenience and high efficiency the boundary integral method is used to study the characteristics of the bubble jet in this paper where the shape of bubble jet is simplified to a cylindrical shape when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the characteristics of bubble jet are characterized by three parameters including the cylindrical width diameter the cylindrical height and the jet velocity by adjusting the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter the relations of the bubble jet width height and velocity with them are explored combined with the least square method the purpose is to provide a reference for computing the damage of the bubble jet to structure in engineering 2 numerical model 2 1 boundary integral method after the explosive charge is detonated in water a high pressure will be formed inside the bubble subsequently under the combined action of the high pressure and infinity pressure the bubble expands and collapses with a high reynolds number where the effect of viscosity on the bubble motion can be ignored generally brujan et al 2002 klaseboer et al 2005b the liquid compressibility is also ignored klaseboer et al 2005a 2005b it is assumed that the liquid is undisturbed before bubble expansion and collapse and the motion and deformation of bubble are thought to be axially symmetrical as shown in fig 1 therefore the liquid velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential ϕ in the form of cylindrical coordinates which satisfies laplace s equation 1 2 ϕ 0 based on the green s third identity with the green function g the laplace s equation can be transformed into following the boundary integral equation 2 λ p t ϕ p t s ϕ q t n g p q ϕ q t n g p q d s where p is the field or control point and q is the integral or source point s is the bubble surface as shown in k 1 n denotes the outward normal derivative at the boundary s λ p t is the solid angle g p q is the green function for a bubble near an infinite solid wall which is taken as brujan et al 2002 wang et al 2005 3 g p q 1 p q 1 p q where q is the reflected point of q with regard to the solid wall here we assume the scale of the solid wall is larger than the maximum radius r m so the influence of the solid wall in fig 1 on the bubble dynamics can be simulated by eq 3 the bubble boundary s is discretized into n nodes and n 1 linear elements the ϕ q t inside the elements can be obtained by the linear interpolation of the corresponding endpoint values then the boundary integral equation in discretized form can be expressed as 4 h φ t ψ where h is the n n coefficient matrix which is composed of the left term and the second term on the right side in eq 2 t is also the n n coefficient matrix denoting the first term on the right side in eq 2 φ and ψ are the n 1 column vectors which represents the velocity potential ϕ and its derivative ϕ n respectively in the process of solving the coefficient matrix h and t the strong singularity and the weak singularity will be formed in diagonal elements in h and t respectively which can be avoided very well using some special techniques klaseboer et al 2009 wilkerson 1993 the velocity potential ϕ at the bubble surface s can be updated using the following dynamics boundary condition 5 d ϕ d t 1 2 ϕ 2 p p b ρ σ κ ρ g z where ρ is the density of liquid σ is the surface tension coefficient κ the local surface curvature g the gravitational acceleration p is the infinite pressure at z 0 p b is the internal pressure of bubble which is assumed as uniform distribution and consists of a constant vapor pressure and a volume dependent non condensable gas pressure according to the adiabatic assumption the pressure p b can be expressed as klaseboer et al 2005a 2005b liu et al 2017b 6 p b p v p 0 r 0 r 3 ϑ where p v is the vapor pressure p 0 is the initial non condensable gas pressure at initial bubble radius r 0 r that is the bubble radius varies with bubble motion ϑ is the ratio of specific heats which is taken as 1 25 approximately after the velocity potential ϕ at the bubble surface is obtained the normal velocity ϕ n can be computed using the linear eq 4 and the shear velocity ϕ τ is directly obtained by computing the tangential gradient of ϕ along the surface then the bubble surface position x is updated by the kinematic boundary condition 7 d x d t ϕ in order to make the numerical simulation maintain stable the time step δ t in eq 5 and eq 7 is controlled using the following expression wang et al 2005 8 δ t δ ϕ max 1 2 ϕ 2 p p b ρ σ κ ρ g z 2 2 toroidal bubble model near the later stage of bubble collapse owing to the bjerknes forces crum 1975 pelekasis and tsamopoulos 1993 a high speed liquid jet is formed towards the solid wall the bubble changes from a singly connected domain to the doubly connected domain when the jet penetrates the opposite surface resulting in non unique velocity potential produced for this situation the integral boundary method in section 2 1 will be terminated for the subsequent computation in order to deal with this problem a vortex ring model is introduced to compute subsequent toroidal bubble motion the velocity potential ϕ is divided into two parts the potential ϕ v r induced by the vortex ring and the remnant potential ϕ r e wang et al 2005 9 ϕ ϕ v r ϕ r e the dynamics boundary condition in eq 5 and the kinematic boundary condition in eq 7 can be written in term of ϕ v r and ϕ r e as follows wang et al 2005 10 d ϕ r e d t 1 2 ϕ v r ϕ r e 2 ϕ v r ϕ v r ϕ r e p p b ρ σ κ ρ g z 11 d x d t ϕ v r ϕ r e where the remnant potential ϕ r e is updated in the same manner as the original velocity potential ϕ using the boundary integral method according to the biot savart law the potential ϕ v r is determined by the strength and position of the vortex ring with the assumption that jet impact occurs at one point the vortex ring strength is referred as the jump of potential ϕ across the jet impact points 2 3 initial parameters when the motion of underwater explosion bubble is simulated by updating the node velocity potential and position at the bubble surface using the boundary integral method the initial parameters should be determined first if the charge weight w and the detonated depth h is determined the maximum radius r m the internal pressure p 0 at bubble inception and initial radius r 0 can also be obtained easily by a great quantity of underwater explosion experiments the relation of r m with w and h was summarized as follows cole and weller 1948 12 r m 3 38 w h 10 1 3 where the maximum radius r m increases with the increase of charge weight w and decreases with the increase of the detonated depth h after the charge is detonated the internal pressure p 0 at bubble inception can be expressed as 13 p 0 1 39 10 5 3 4 w π r 0 3 ϑ the determination of the initial bubble radius r 0 should be associated with the rayleigh plesset equation plesset and prosperetti 1977 rayleigh 1917 14 r r 3 2 r 2 1 ρ p v p 0 r 0 r 3 ϑ 2 σ r p for the underwater explosion bubble the surface tension is insignificant in comparison to the internal pressure so the surface tension can be neglected integrate the rayleigh plesset equation from r 0 to r m combined with r 0 when r r 0 and r r m then the internal pressure p 0 is expressed as 15 p 0 p p v 1 ϑ 1 r 0 r m 3 1 r 0 r m 3 ϑ 1 the p 0 in eq 15 is replaced by eq 13 resulting in 16 1 39 10 5 p p v 1 ϑ 1 3 w 4 π r m 3 ϑ 1 r 0 r m 3 ϑ 1 r 0 r m 3 1 on the basis of eq 12 eq 13 and eq 16 the initial radius r 0 and the initial internal pressure p 0 can be obtained once the charge weight w and the detonated depth h are determined 3 verification of numerical model in this section in order to prove the validity of the boundary integral method for underwater explosion bubble an underwater explosion experiment is conducted in a 2m 2m 2m cubic steel water tank filled with tap water the relative position of underwater explosion bubble with solid wall and free surface is shown in fig 1 the charge type the charge weight w the detonated depth h and the depth of the solid wall h are displayed in table 1 the charge is ignited by an electric detonator with room temperature 34 8 c and atmospheric pressure 0 101 m p a and the bubble motion is captured by the phantom v12 1 high speed camera from a 0 4m 0 7 m transparent window at 5000 frames s with an exposure time 199 6 μ s the maximum bubble radius r m approximately equals to 0 265 m and the spatial resolution 1 08 m m per pixel more detailed information about the experimental setup can be found in the work of cui et al 2016 according to eq 12 eq 13 and eq 16 the initial bubble radius r 0 0 0204 m and the initial internal pressure p 0 66 928 m p a for the boundary integral method the influence of the node number n and δ ϕ in eq 8 on bubble motion had been studied in the work of liu et al 2017b where the results is almost convergent when n 70 and δ ϕ 0 01 which is adopted in our computations the comparison of numerical results with underwater explosion bubble experiment is shown in fig 2 after the explosive charge is detonated a high pressure gas surrounded by the liquid is formed as shown in fig 2 a under the combined actions of the high pressure and the atmospheric pressure the bubble begins to expand during early the expansion stage the bubble approximately maintains spherical form as shown in fig 2 b when the bubble reaches the maximum volume the top surface become little flat owing to the influence of the solid wall as shown in fig 2 c subsequently since the pressure inside the bubble is less than the atmospheric pressure the bubble begins to collapse as shown in fig 2 d as the bubble continues to collapse a local high pressure region is formed underneath the bubble resulting in a bubble jet as shown in fig 2 e with the development of the bubble jet the bubble is going to change from a singly connected domain to the doubly connected domain as shown in fig 2 f when the bubble jet impacts on the opposite surface the numerical simulation will be terminated owing to the non unique velocity potential in order to deal with this problem a vortex ring model in section 2 2 is introduced to compute the toroidal bubble motion after the bubble jet penetrates the opposite surface a local high pressure region is produced above the bubble owing to the impact of high velocity jet with low velocity flow as shown in fig 2 g meanwhile a protrusion is formed due to the drag of the bubble jet subsequently the protrusion continues to grow and extend upward with the development of the bubble jet as shown in fig 2 h as a whole except for the protrusion in the toroidal stage the numerical results are in good agreement with the results from the underwater explosion bubble experiment especially for the bubble motion before the toroidal stage the protrusion in the toroidal stage mainly consists of mixture of gas and liquid where a lot of broken small bubbles are included so it is difficult for the boundary integral method to simulate the mixture of gas and liquid completely in fact in the subsequent study we are primary concerned with the characteristics of bubble jet when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the toroidal bubble motion we do not consider the boundary integral method used to simulate the underwater explosion bubble has also been validated by a large part of researchers li et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2017a so it is appropriate in our paper to use the boundary integral method to study the characteristics of the underwater explosion bubble jet 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 simplified model cases and least square method near the later collapse stage of bubble a high speed liquid jet will be formed towards the solid wall the characteristics of the bubble jet including the jet velocity and the jet shape are significantly associated with the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter here the velocity of the bubble jet impact on the opposite surface is chosen to represent the final velocity of the bubble jet which is denoted by v as the black point in fig 3 a by contrast the bubble jet shape is much more complicated which will be different with the change of the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance parameter in order to better study the bubble jet qualitatively the bubble jet shape needs to be simplified then in the case of the same area of the cross section the bubble jet shape is equivalent to a cylinder with width diameter d and height l as shown in fig 3 b the formation of the bubble jet is mainly dependent on two factors one is the buoyancy and another is the bjerknes forces the buoyancy is associated with the maximum bubble radius determined by the charge weight and the detonated depth the bjerknes forces are associated with the distance between the bubble and the solid wall here the ratio of the distance between the bubble and the solid wall with the maximum radius is used to characterize the influence of the bjerknes forces on the bubble jet where the ratio is expressed as the stand off distance parameter γ 17 γ h h r m the detonated depth in eq 12 is replaced by eq 17 then the relation of the maximum radius with the charge weight the depth of solid wall and the stand off distance parameter is expressed as 18 r m 3 38 w h λ r m 10 1 3 the influences of the stand off distance parameter the charge weight and the detonated depth on the characteristics of the bubble jet including velocity width and height are studied in this paper the stand off distance parameter can intuitively reflect the threat of the bubble jet to the solid wall if the γ is too large the bubble jet velocity will be weakened by the water layer between the bubble with the solid wall liu et al 2018 so the large value of γ is not suitable here the γ is set from 0 65 to 1 5 the charge weight is set from 50 kg to 1000 kg to simulate underwater explosion with a large amount of tnt the depth of the solid wall is set from 50 m to 500 m to simulate explosion in deep water and the detonated depth can be obtained combined with eqs 17 and 18 the detailed initial parameters are displayed in table 2 where the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight are divided into 10 10 and 19 parts respectively together resulting in 1900 combinations the underwater explosion bubble is affected by many factors so it is hard to use an analytical solution to describe the asymmetric bubble dynamics especially for the jet characteristics in nature some kind of inevitable relations exist between many objects so it is very important to seek a scientific method to analyze the implicit relations between different objects here the least square method is adopted to analyze the relations of the bubble jet velocity width and height with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight as follows 1 provide the data 18a x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x l i y i i 1 2 3 m 2 establish the function model s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i 18b s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i k 0 n a k φ k x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i n m 3 solve the function model f a 0 a 1 a n 18c f a 0 a 1 a n i 1 m w i y i s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i 2 where x l i denotes independent variable such as the depth of the solid wall etc l denotes the number of the independent variable y i represents dependent variable such as the jet velocity i represents the i th group data m denotes the total number of the group data a k denotes the k th coefficient φ k denotes the k th subfunction n denotes the total number of a k and φ k w i denotes the i th weight coefficient which is greater than 0 minimize the function f a 0 a 1 a n and solve the coefficients a k k 0 n finally the function s n x 1 i x 2 i x 3 i x k i is obtained which represents the relations of the bubble jet velocity width and height with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight 4 2 estimate formula for jet velocity the velocity at the bottom pole of bubble surface with time for different depth of the solid wall is shown in fig 4 during the expansion stage the velocity has not too much difference for different depth but during the collapse stage the obvious difference appears where the velocity with time changes more violent when the solid wall is located in the deep water meanwhile the jet velocity in the deep water is greater than in the shallow water usually the bubble jet velocity is closely associated with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight but it is complicated to use the least square method to simultaneously analyze the relation of the bubble jet velocity with the depth of the solid wall the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight for simplicity and convenience the number of the independent variables h γ and w should be reduced here the depth of the solid wall is removed and is divided into 10 parts from 50 m to 500 m as shown in table 2 for each part of the depth of the solid wall the bubble jet velocity is just characterized by the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight according to the initial parameters in table 2 for a certain depth of the solid wall the relation of the bubble jet velocity with the stand off distance parameter and the charge weight is described by 190 data before fitting the data it is necessary to analyze the correlation of dependent variable v with independent variables γ and w and then establish the corresponding mathematical model in fig 5 a the bubble jet velocity for different charge weight is displayed where the velocity decreases with the increase of the charge weight and the change of v turns slower for the large w which accords with the characteristic of the power function w a a 0 in fig 5 b the bubble jet velocity for different stand off distance parameter is displayed where an inflection point exists when γ is approximately equal to 0 7 which is more evident in subsequent fig 8 b when γ 0 7 the bubble jet velocity increases with increase of γ however the velocity decreases with increase of γ when γ 0 7 so the relation between the bubble jet velocity and the stand off distance parameter can be described by the polynomial function by comparing a variety of mathematical model an appropriate model is selected as follows 19 v a 1 w 100 a 2 λ a 3 a 4 λ a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 denote the unknown coefficients according to 190 data for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 the unknown coefficients in eq 19 can be solved using the least square method in eq 18 the coefficients for depth of the solid wall are displayed in table 3 after the coefficients in table 3 are obtained the bubble jet velocity for different stand off distance parameter charge weight and depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed using eq 19 in fig 6 for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the whole comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the fitted surface plotted by eq 19 is displayed where the numerical data are interspersed around the fitted surface and the maximum error between them is only 2 0 as a whole the fitted surface is in good agreement with the numerical data the relation of the bubble jet velocity with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter can be obviously distinguished by the color of the fitted surface the large jet velocity is mainly concentrated in the red region with small charge weight and large stand off distance parameter and the small jet velocity is mainly located in the blue region with large charge weight and small stand off distance parameter in order to further verify the accuracy of the fitted surface for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m and 250 m the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the curves from the fitted surface for different charge weight is shown in figs 7 a and fig 8 a respectively where the curves coincide with the numerical data well for the stand off distance parameter γ 0 65 1 0 and 1 5 the local comparison for different stand off distance parameter is also depicted in figs 7 b and fig 8 b respectively where the curves also agree well with the numerical data for the charge weight w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg even though an evident inflection point exists in the numerical data when γ 0 7 in fig 8 b which is also expressed by fitted eq 19 perfectly through the analysis of the bubble jet velocity for a certain depth of the solid wall and charge weight the velocity with the stand off distance parameter is intriguing the velocity does not always decrease with the decrease of the stand off distance parameter but a minimum value emerges when γ 0 7 as the bubble continues to approach to the solid wall the velocity begins to increase this phenomenon is very hard to be discovered in the underwater explosion bubble experiments owing to the opaque of the jet inside the bubble but similar works had been studied by shima et al 1984 tomita and shima 1986 and tomita et al 1983 using the spark generated bubble experiments where the behaviour of the jet and the impulsive pressures induced by a bubble collapse near a solid boundary were discussed combined with results obtained by pressure transducer and photoelastic methods in the works of shima et al 1984 tomita and shima 1986 and tomita et al 1983 when γ 1 2 the bubble jet impact precedes the shock wave induced outward by the bubble at the minimum volume where the impulsive pressure is closely associated with the jet impact the pressure peak at the first bubble collapse appears minimum value when γ is approximately equal to 0 6 for the region γ 0 6 the pressure peak at the first bubble collapse increases with the decrease of γ it is clear that the pressure peak at the first bubble collapse with γ is similar to the bubble jet velocity with γ when the bubble is enough close to the solid wall the reason for this phenomenon can be explained by the water hammer theory tomita and shima 1986 the similar researches also had been done by philipp and lauterborn 1998 using laser produced bubbles the comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the fitted surface for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter has been conducted in order to further validate the accuracy of the fitted surface the comparison for different depth of the solid wall should be implemented the bubble jet velocity for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed by eq 19 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 3 the bubble jet velocity for other depth of the solid wall not included in table 2 can be interpolated by the jet velocity for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 in fig 9 for the charge weight w 500 kg and the stand off distance parameter γ 1 0 the comparison of the numerical bubble jet velocity with the interpolated curves from the fitted surface for different depth of the solid wall is displayed where the velocity increases with the increase of the depth of the solid wall the corresponding error analysis is shown in table 4 where the numerical bubble jet velocity agrees well with the interpolated curves and the maximum error is no more than 1 2 so even though the independent variable h is not included in eq 19 the bubble jet velocity for any depth of the solid wall can also be computed accurately by eq 19 combined with the coefficients in table 2 using the interpolation method by comparing the numerical bubble jet velocity with the fitted result for different charge weight stand off distance parameter and depth of the solid wall it shows that the mathematical model in eq 19 combined with the coefficients in table 3 can represent the bubble jet velocity accurately when w 50 kg 1000 kg γ 0 65 1 5 and h 50 m 500 m 4 3 estimate formula for jet width the bubble jet width is another important characteristic of the liquid jet which denotes the area of the jet impact on the solid wall like the jet velocity the 1900 data for the bubble jet width are separated into 10 parts along the direction of the depth of the solid wall for each certain depth of the solid wall in table 2 the bubble jet width is only controlled by the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter before determining the mathematical model the trend of the bubble jet width with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter should be analyzed respectively in fig 10 a for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the bubble jet width with different charge weight is displayed for γ 0 65 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the width is closely associated with the scale of the bubble so the width increases with the increase of the charge weight the trend of which conforms to the feature of the power function w a but the coefficient a is different from the jet velocity for the jet width the coefficient a is between 0 and 1 in fig 10 b the bubble jet width with different stand off distance parameter is displayed for w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg respectively there are no big differences for all bubble jet widths when γ is from 0 65 to 1 5 here the relation of the bubble jet width with γ is denoted by the polynomial function by comparison a preferable mathematical model is chosen to describe the correlation of the bubble jet width d with w and γ as follows 20 d w 100 a 1 a 2 λ 3 a 3 λ 2 a 4 λ a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 denote the unknown coefficients according to 190 data for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 the unknown coefficients in eq 20 can be solved using the least square method in eq 18 the coefficients for each depth of the solid wall are displayed in table 5 for a certain depth of the solid wall h 50 m the whole comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the fitted surface plotted by eq 20 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 5 is depicted in fig 11 from the point of view of the relative positions between the fitted surface and the numerical data the fitted surface is in good agreement with the numerical data where the maximum error between them is only 1 4 for other certain depth of the solid wall in table 5 the similar accuracy between the fitted surface and the corresponding numerical data also exists which is not displayed here through the distribution of the color on the fitted surface the relation of the bubble jet width with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter is very intuitive the change of the bubble jet width along the direction of the stand off distance parameter is not evident and the large bubble jet width is located in the red region with the large charge weight after the whole comparison is conducted the local comparison between the numerical bubble jet width with the curves from the fitted surface for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter should also be implemented respectively for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m and 250 m the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the curves from the fitted surface for different charge weight is depicted in fig 12 a and fig 13 a respectively where the curves coincide with the numerical data with high accuracy for γ 0 65 1 0 and 1 5 correspondingly the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the curves from the fitted surface for different stand off distance parameter is depicted in figs 12 b and fig 13 b respectively also the curves agree perfectly with the numerical data for w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg so the mathematical model chosen in eq 20 is accurate to express the relation of the bubble jet width with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter in order to further validate the accuracy of eq 20 the comparison along the direction of the depth of the solid wall is implemented the bubble jet width for the depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed by eq 20 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 5 the bubble jet width for other depth of the solid wall not included in table 2 can be interpolated by the bubble jet width for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 in table 6 some new depths of the solid wall are displayed where the corresponding numerical bubble jet widths are computed by the integral boundary equation the comparison of the numerical bubble jet width with the curve from the fitted surface for different depth of the solid wall is shown in fig 14 where both agree well with each other evidently the bubble jet width decreases with the increase of the depth of the solid wall the errors between the bubble jet widths interpolated from the curve and the numerical results are shown in table 6 where the maximum error is no more than 1 0 so eq 20 combined with the coefficients in table 6 also has a high accuracy to compute the bubble jet width along the direction of the depth of the solid wall by comparing the fitted values with the numerical bubble jet widths for different charge weight stand off distance parameter and depth of the solid wall it shows that the mathematical model in eq 20 combined with the coefficients in table 6 can compute the bubble jet width accurately when w 50 kg 1000 kg γ 0 65 1 5 and h 50 m 500 m 4 4 estimate formula for jet height the bubble jet height is also a significant feature of the liquid jet which decides the total time of the bubble jet impact on the solid wall the same as the bubble jet velocity and width the 1900 data in table 2 are also divided into 10 parts according to the depth of the solid wall in table 2 for each depth the trend of the bubble jet height is only affected by the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter in fig 15 a for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the bubble jet height with different charge weight is displayed for γ 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively the same as the bubble jet width the bubble jet height is also closely associated with the scale of the bubble the relation of the maximum bubble radius with the charge weight is controlled by the power function as shown in eq 12 so the relation of the bubble jet height with the charge weight also meets the characteristic of the power function w a 0 a 1 in fig 15 b the bubble jet height with different stand off distance parameter is displayed for w 50 kg 500 kg and 100 kg respectively the trend of the bubble jet height with γ is similar to the bubble jet width but an evident maximum height exists when γ equals to a certain value for each charge weight here the relation of the bubble jet height with the stand off distance parameter is also denoted by the polynomial function by screening the same mathematic model as the bubble jet width is selected to express the correlation of the bubble jet height with w and γ as follows 21 l w 100 a 1 a 2 λ 3 a 3 λ 2 a 4 λ a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 denote the unknown coefficients according to 190 data for each depth of the solid wall in table 2 the unknown coefficients in eq 21 can be solved using the least square method in eq 18 the coefficients for each depth of the solid wall are displayed in table 7 for the depth of the solid wall h 50 m the whole comparison of the numerical bubble jet height from the 190 data in table 2 with the mathematical model in eq 21 combined with the corresponding coefficients in table 7 is depicted in fig 16 where the maximum error is only 2 8 as a whole the fitted surface coincides well with the numerical data the bubble jet height and the bubble jet width are both associated with the scale of the bubble but the trends for both with the charge weight and the stand off distance parameter have a little difference here the bubble jet height along the direction of the stand off distance parameter has an evident change which can be seen clearly by the color in fig 16 with the increase of the charge weight the maximum bubble jet height for each charge weight moves towards the increasing direction of the stand off distance parameter for the depths of the solid wall h 50 m and 250 m the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet height with the curves from the corresponding fitted surface for different charge weight is depicted in fig 17 a and fig 18 a respectively for γ 0 65 and 1 0 the curves are in good agreement with the numerical data when γ 1 5 the curves deviate with the numerical data for the larger charge weight however through the error analysis the maximum errors only have 2 2 and 3 1 respectively which are acceptable correspondingly the local comparison of the numerical bubble jet height with the curves for different stand off distance parameter is depicted in figs 17 b and fig 18 b respectively for w 50 kg 500 kg and 1000 kg the numerical data are scattered on or around the curves and the trends of the numerical data with γ are also denoted perfectly by the curves after the comparisons of the numerical bubble jet height with eq 21 for different charge weight and stand off distance parameter are conducted the accuracy of the mathematical model in eq 21 with the coefficients in table 7 for different depth of the solid wall should also be validated the same as the bubble jet velocity and width some new numerical bubble jet heights are recomputed using the boundary integral equation where the corresponding depths of the solid wall are shown in table 8 the fitted bubble jet height for the depth of the solid wall in table 2 can be computed using eq 21 with the corresponding coefficients in table 7 for other depth of the solid wall not included in table 2 the corresponding bubble jet height can be interpolated by the fitted bubble jet height for the depth of the solid wall in table 2 in fig 19 the comparison of the new numerical bubble jet height with the curves from the fitted surface for different depth of the solid wall is depicted where the curve agrees well with the new numerical data and the relation of the bubble jet height with the depth of the solid wall is same as the bubble jet width this is because the bubble jet height and width are closely associated with the scale of the bubble and in deep water the scale of the bubble will decrease as shown in eq 12 the errors between them are displayed in table 8 where the maximum error only has 2 71 so eq 21 with the coefficients in table 7 also has a good accuracy for different depth of the solid wall through comparative analysis eq 21 with the coefficients in table 7 can compute the bubble jet height well when w 50 kg 1000 kg γ 0 65 1 5 and h 50 m 500 m 5 conclusions due to convenience and high efficiency the boundary integral method is used to study the characteristics of bubble jet the bubble jet shape is simplified to a cylindrical shape when the jet impacts on the opposite surface so the characteristics of bubble jet are denoted by the cylindrical width the cylindrical height and the jet velocity based on the least square method three estimate formulas with good accuracy are obtained to denote the relations of the bubble jet width the bubble jet height and the bubble jet velocity with the charge weight the detonated depth and the stand off distance when w 50 1000 kg h 50 500 m and γ 0 65 1 5 some detailed conclusions are as follows 1 the bubble jet velocity decreases with the increase of the charge weight which accords with the characteristic of the power function w a a 0 when γ 0 7 the jet velocity increases with increase of γ but decreases with increase of γ when γ 0 7 with the increase of the detonated depth the jet velocity also increases 2 the bubble jet width and the bubble jet height increase with the increase of the charge weight the trends of which conform to the feature of the power function w a 0 a 1 the jet widths are no big differences when γ is from 0 65 to 1 5 but an evident maximum jet height exists when γ equals to a certain value for each charge weight when the detonated depth increases the jet width and the jet height decrease acknowledgments

23208,offshore platforms are anchored to the ocean floor using moorings to prevent excessive drifting and these moorings need to be monitored for damage an expensive process is it possible to detect a change in moorings stiffness by measuring the motion of the platform under random wave forcing the platform s response is strongly dependent on the wave spectrum and direction of forcing this forcing is random and the measurements are indirect so it seems unlikely to examine the feasibility we examine a much simpler but analogous spring plate table system with table rotation mimicking wave action we find that by using a modal analysis of the underlying system one can unscramble the plate s response and thus determine spring stiffness changes under random forcing however as one would expect the forcing has to have components in an active frequency and direction range in principle the same type of analysis can be used for real moorings whilst the spring plate table system model was developed with moorings in mind such fault detection issues often arise under circumstances in which direct fault detection is impossible but the basic underlying system is known the simple spring plate system examined here is perhaps the simplest non trivial example of this situation keywords moorings inverse modal symmetry faults detection 1 introduction offshore oil platforms and also risers need to remain connected to the well head and so are moored to the ocean bottom to prevent excessive drift under the action of oncoming waves and currents see fig 1 the moorings provide a structural support for the platform which will be compromised if any of the moorings break or are weakened although designed to survive extreme wave events recent data suggests that they regularly fail early in their lifetime through a number of mechanisms morandini et al 2009 fault detection is therefore of critical importance monitoring strategies attempt to catch the early signs of failure with current industry practice being to deploy unmanned vehicles or divers to undertake visual inspection every five years alongside shallow water inspections on a yearly basis morandini et al 2009 renard et al 2006 we propose methods for continuously detecting faults by observing the changed movement of the platform under random wave forcing primarily taut leg platforms will be the focus but the procedures used may be applicable to other moorings types and other forms of external forcing vibrations in the form of sound waves or light rays have been used in the mining industry for the detection of ore bodies in engineering to determine the presence of cracks in metal and bubbles and other flaws in plate glass and in medicine to determine abnormalities in human anatomy see sen and stoffa 2013 duan et al 2016 deng and liu 2011 in these classical inverse problem circumstances the vibrational source is prescribed and the aim is to determine some physical property associated with the underlying system the moorings problem is also an inverse problem but is different in that the vibrational forcing waves is not controllable but the response of the platform moorings system is almost completely known an additional difficulty is that the response of the platform moorings system is strongly direction and frequency dependent so any crude statistical approach will fail we will make use this sensitivity to detect the fault in general terms the vertical vibrational movement of the platform of mass m can be described by an equation of the form m z d z k z f t where z is the vertical displacement of locations on the platform f t represents the vibrational forcing due to waves k is the effective mooring stiffness and d is the damping coefficients the aim to determine the change in k by observing z when f t is random with zero mean in the case of a taut leg platform the moorings are cables anchored some distance from the platform and the effective stiffness for vertical motions is provided by the vertical component of the cable tensions see fig 1 aside of course it is the non vibrational horizontal components of cord tension that act to restore the platform to a central location and some information concerning mooring stiffness can be obtained by observing this translational movement however here we consider vibrational vertical movements caused by waves the system is assumed to be linear so such quasi steady forcing with associated translational motion can be filtered out also although an equation of the above type can be used to describe induced horizontal vibrations it seems unlikely that the forcing and platform response will be consistent enough to enable stiffness calculations of the type described here to be successful there are other moorings types and the applicability of the procedures used here will depend on the circumstances of forcing and restraint see section 4 many issues complicate the fault detection moorings problem see section 4 however the primary difficulties are that the forcing is random and unknown the system s response is highly frequency and direction dependent and the measurements are indirect it was is not clear if detection is possible in principle so an analogous but much simpler system has been examined the simpler system consists of a plate platform mounted by springs cables on a vibrating table the waves see fig 2 in the taut leg mooring situation it is the long waves i e waves of length of the platform or larger that cause the platform to move against gravity causing the platform to vibrate vertically and to pitch and roll in our simpler system the rotating table applies this external forcing causing the rigid plate to translate pitch and roll the direction of the in plane axis of rotation as well as the amplitude and frequency of oscillation may vary randomly to simulate waves impacting the platform at an arbitrary angle the advantage of this plate model is that exact solutions are available so that the fault detection procedures used can be assessed typical inverse approaches in vibrations rely on modal analysis techniques to extract information from resonant peaks in the frequency domain which can be used to reconstruct the mass stiffness and damping of the system schmitz and smith 2011 this is the approach we will take here in section 2 we solve the forward problem under deterministic forcing we then use the results to address the inverse problem in section 3 and we then use simulations to determine the efficacy of the method finally in section 4 we return to discuss the application to real moorings 2 forward problem 2 1 table and plate geometry and dynamics the situation to be examined is that of a plate attached to a vibrating table by supporting springs as shown in fig 2 the vibrating table causes the plate to vibrate the centre of the table is chosen as the origin o through which passes the horizontal datum plane with axes x and y aligned with the sides of the table and with the z axis vertical we will begin by considering the oscillating table and initial spring positions in the absence of the plate shown in fig 3 the table oscillates about an axis passing through o and lying in the plane of the table at an angle γ clockwise to the x axis the table has length 2l and width 2b the equations describing the corner heights of the table z i above the datum plane at time t due to the table oscillation are given by z 1 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 2 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 3 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 4 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l where ω f is the angular frequency of rotation and α 0 the amplitude of rotation of the table and where the small angle approximation sin α 0 α 0 has been used under the assumption that the forcing magnitude is sufficiently small there are four springs attached to the table corners denoted i 1 4 the i t h spring of initial length l i 0 is attached to the table as shown as we are most interested in the effect of mooring integrity on system behaviour spring 3 is allowed to be weaker thus the spring constants k i are k i k for i 1 2 4 k 3 k k the vertical corner displacements of the plate are given by z i t again measured relative to the horizontal datum plane the centre of the plate is denoted by z t since the plate is rigid just three co ordinates are needed to specify its location either z 1 t z 2 t z 3 t or z t θ x t θ y t may be used see fig 4 the determination of the plate s motion due to the table vibrations described by z i t as above is elementary but algebraically complex and is relegated to appendix a in angular co ordinates these equations are given by i x θ x b k b 3 k b sin θ x k l k l sin θ y k k l 0 k k z b k z 1 k z 2 k z 3 k z 4 i y θ y l k b k b sin θ x k l 3 k l sin θ y k k l 0 k k z l k z 1 k z 2 k z 3 k z 4 m z k b k b sin θ x k l k l sin θ y k 3 k z k 3 k l 0 k z 1 k z 2 k z 3 k z 4 and the corresponding equations in cartesians can be obtained using co ordinate transformations presented in appendix a 2 2 scaling and simplification an appropriate scaling is given by x l x y b y z l 0 m g 4 k z z i l 0 m g 4 k z i z i α 0 l z i t t 0 t α α 0 α θ x α 0 θ x θ y α 0 θ y t i m g 4 t i with the dashes denoting the scaled variables and t 0 m 4 k this forces the scaled natural frequency of the pure translational mode to be ω t 1 it is convenient for visualisation to work with the heights above the horizontal plane in terms of which the scaled equations after dropping primes are given by z 1 z 2 z 3 1 4 8 0 1 5 κ 4 12 5 κ 4 0 1 7 κ z 1 z 2 z 3 ψ α 0 7 z 1 z 2 z 4 5 κ z 3 z 1 7 z 2 5 z 4 κ z 3 5 z 1 z 2 z 4 7 κ z 3 recall that the fourth corner displacement can be readily obtained the dimensionless groups that arise and define the problem are the spring constant ratio the aspect ratio and the vertical displacement vs plate length ratio κ k k β l b ψ l k g m in vector form we have z k z f t where k is the stiffness matrix and f t is the forcing term due to table rotation it should be noted that the effect of the table wave forcing on the plate platform is strongly dependent on the axis of rotation wave direction and that is captured in different components of f t which are in turn dependent on the orientation of the table axis wave direction and the frequency and amplitude of vibration wave amplitude it should be noted that a number of conclusions can be drawn already without proceeding to solve the equations notably the natural modes of the system will be governed solely by the magnitude of the spring parameter κ and are independent of the aspect ratio of the plate β this indicates that a square plate will have the same scaled frequency response as a rectangular plate 2 3 the natural modes in the absence of forcing we can solve z k z 0 for the natural response of the plate the normalised eigenvectors m b and corresponding natural frequencies ω b are given in table 1 rather than distinguishing the eigenvectors using enumeration we will use the subscripts t r 1 and r 2 referring to the translational first rotational and second rotational modes the natural response of the system is composed of any linear combination of the three natural modes with eigenvectors m t m r 1 and m r 2 given by z κ t a t m t e j ω t t ϕ t a r 1 m r 1 e j ω r 1 t ϕ r 1 a r 2 m r 2 e j ω r 2 t ϕ r 2 with constants a t a r 1 and a r 2 weighting each mode s contribution and ϕ b being the phase of each mode b this describes the impulse response of the plate which in the moorings context corresponds to excitation due to a solitary wave in the sea as we want to examine the effects of κ on the system s response it is useful to consider deviations from the healthy κ 1 case k k table 2 presents the mode shapes when κ 1 see figs 5 7 while table 3 shows the evolution of the modes as a function of κ 2 3 1 the translational mode t for healthy springs this mode represents the vertical translation this is clearly visible from the equal height profiles when κ 1 in table 3 row t which shows how the mode shape varies as a function of κ both the natural frequency and mode shape change significantly as κ is decreased much more than for the other modes we notice that for small κ corner 3 undergoes very large displacements while corner 1 moves very little this is to be expected as spring 3 is the weak spring the low magnitude of z 1 suggests that the rotation is pivoting about a point close to this corner this is vastly different from the vertical translation in the healthy case as κ decreases below 0 2 corners 1 and 3 no longer move up at the same time with corner 1 dipping below the axis at the intercept itself z 1 does not move and the entire plate pivots about it note that z 2 and z 4 exhibit identical behaviour as the system has no bias about the corner 1 to corner 3 diagonal due to the symmetrical nature of the mode our choice of scaling has ensured that ω t 1 when the springs are healthy κ 1 the evolution towards the pivoting behaviour as κ decreases is accompanied by a decrease in the natural frequency of the mode this agrees with our expectation that a decrease in the overall stiffness will lead to slower vibration 2 3 2 rotational mode 1 r1 κ independent rotation this mode represents rocking about the diagonal line joining corners 1 and 3 consequently corner 3 is stationary making the mode invariant to changes in spring health given the geometric constraints of the system we expect this to be the only possible motion displaying this invariance note the implications of this we can immediately conclude that the vibrations associated with this mode cannot be used to determine κ figures in table 3 row r 1 show the mode shape and natural frequency as a function of κ the invariance can be seen 2 3 3 rotational mode 2 r2 κ dependent rotation for the case of equal spring strength this mode represents rocking about the diagonal joining corners 2 and 4 it is clear that as κ decreases z 3 decreases see table 3 row r 2 while z 1 increases in magnitude κ 1 also introduces motion at corners 2 and 4 though they still move in unison as the symmetry of the system is maintained about the corner 1 to corner 3 diagonal in fact as each corner observes a similar evolution as a function of κ we can consider the weak spring to have introduced a translational component in addition to the rotation this bias towards the negative z direction generates the surprising result that corner 1 moves further than corner 3 weak spring the natural frequency is observed to decrease from 3 when κ 1 to 1 36 when κ 0 when κ 1 the motion is the same as the other rotational mode which rocks about the other diagonal axis 2 3 4 discussion the translational mode and second rotational mode treat z 2 and z 4 equally while in the first rotational mode they have equal magnitude and opposite sign this leads us to conclude that for any possible natural response corners 2 and 4 must have identical magnitude this captures the fact that there is no geometrical preference for the plate s motion either side of the diagonal line joining corners 1 and 3 additionally the translational mode causes large displacements of the weak spring rather than the diagonally opposite healthy spring the effect is the opposite for the second rotational mode although far less exaggerated 2 4 forced solution we will now consider the situation in which the plate is forced by the table oscillating at frequency ω f a forced solution of the form z m f e j ω f t where m f is the forced mode shape is obtained via diagonalisation by removing terms that scale the magnitude we define the shape function h as h ψ m f α 0 β 2 1 the components of which are given by h 1 κ ω f β γ x 1 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 h 2 κ ω f β γ x 2 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 ω f 2 ω r 2 2 h 3 κ ω f β γ x 3 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 h 4 κ ω f β γ x 4 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 ω f 2 ω r 2 2 where x 1 s 12 9 κ 1 12 5 κ 1 ω f 2 x 2 27 κ 1 36 s 48 21 κ 1 s 3 κ 1 s ω f 2 12 s κ 1 s ω f 4 x 3 s 12 9 κ 1 12 7 κ 1 ω f 2 x 4 27 κ 1 36 s 48 21 κ 1 s 3 κ 1 s ω f 2 12 s κ 1 s ω f 4 with s sin γ arctan β and s sin γ arctan β the terms of h are functions of the aspect ratio unlike the natural response κ ω f the forcing direction γ the forcing magnitude α 0 and ψ the vertical displacement vs plate length ratio it is not possible to completely separate the geometry component from the frequency and stiffness component for every corner 2 4 1 normal forcing direction the response for arbitrary γ is complicated so it is useful to examine the simplest case of the forcing direction aligned with the y axis of the coordinate system γ 0 the shape function becomes h 1 κ ω f β 0 β 1 β 2 12 9 κ 1 12 5 κ 1 ω f 2 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 h 2 κ ω f β 0 β 1 β 2 36 27 κ 1 48 18 κ 1 ω f 2 12 κ 1 ω f 4 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 ω f 2 ω r 2 2 h 3 κ ω f β 0 β 1 β 2 12 9 κ 1 12 7 κ

allows the frequency and stiffness contributions to be completely separated from the geometry for all corners as ω t ω r 1 and ω r 2 are functions of κ the response shape is purely a function of the forcing frequency and spring stiffness thus for normal forcing the length and width of the plate do not influence the shape of the response only the magnitude it is therefore logical to analyse the shape of the response in κ ω f space intuitively when the forcing frequency ω f reaches a natural frequency the denominators will become zero and we will get an infinitely large response in the absence of damping referring to eqs 2 4 1 and 2 4 1 we observe that h 2 and h 4 have an extra factor in the denominator corresponding to the first rotational mode this is not present in h 1 and h 3 eq 2 4 1 and 2 4 1 as these corners are never affected by this particular rotational mode as discussed prior in section 2 3 2 fig 8 a d give h as a function of the forcing frequency for various κ values note that negative values are indicative of the relative motion between the corners when corner 4 goes up corner 2 usually goes down if not for the asymmetry introduced by the weak spring they would be reflections of each other the changed response is most clearly observed by the shift in the vertical asymptotes associated with resonant peaks due to the dependence of the translational and second rotational mode on κ the κ 1 resonant peak at ω f 3 is shared by both rotational modes although only corners 2 and 4 are affected by the first rotational mode which remains at ω f 3 regardless of κ for the other resonance frequencies we notice that a decrease in κ causes them to decrease the responses converge to zero in the high frequency limit and as such the behaviour is independent of κ here for corners 2 and 4 this occurs for all κ 3 their degeneracy implying that they should not be looked at in the high frequency range when considering inverse methods for the calculation of κ from observed heights we also note that all curves lie between the κ 1 thick black and κ 0 thin black curves forming an envelope of possible solutions with decreasing κ causing a predictable transition from the κ 1 side of the envelope to the κ 0 side the case of non normal forcing is qualitatively similar except that the magnitude of the corner motion aligning with the forcing direction is increased with corresponding decreases in motion at the unaligned corners 3 inverse problem we first examine a crude procedure for detecting changes in the moorings stiffness and then we go on to use more accurate modal procedures to extract results 3 1 orbital analysis for any arbitrary forcing condition the system exhibits a known range of possible motion we will refer to the full set of locations as the orbit if a plate location is measured that lies outside the orbit we can conclude that κ will have changed a starting point is to plot the range of possible positions for a fit spring κ 1 and a weak spring κ 0 for all possible forcing angles at a particular frequency an example is given in fig 9 for ω f 0 5 the orbits for κ 1 contrast significantly with κ 0 observe the larger displacements in springs 1 and 3 which both lie on the weak diagonal axis although this is the most extreme example a partially weakened spring would produce motion that would not lie on the orbital curves for κ 1 and would be easy to identify this serves as a useful and simple way to identify a potentially weak spring this analysis is made more difficult because the weak spring location is unknown identifying this relies on qualitative observations such as that the low frequency forcing causing large displacements of the weak spring even if the spring is identified correctly this method does not allow us to find κ precisely although it may still be possible to recognise whether replacement is necessary 3 2 forced solution inverse we will now use the forced solution to construct a method for the identification of the spring stiffness ratio for now we will operate under the assumption that the weak spring has been identified although its stiffness is unknown allowing us to specify strong springs at positions 1 2 and 4 with the weak spring at position 3 as presented in the forward model we must first break down the complex forcing state into different frequency components using fourier decomposition to significantly excite the plate the frequency of the forcing must be close enough to the resonance frequencies of the plate and we can filter out frequencies over which the plate s response is invariant to changes in κ we notice that by considering the ratio of diagonally opposed corner displacements λ w k weak spring diagonal and λ s t healthy spring diagonal we can remove the dependence on the forcing magnitude α 0 λ w k κ ω f m 3 f m 1 f 12 9 κ 1 12 7 κ 1 ω f 2 12 9 κ 1 12 5 κ 1 ω f 2 λ s t κ ω f β γ m 4 f m 2 f g s g s where g κ 1 ω f 2 3 ω f 2 sin γ tan 1 β and s 3 12 9 κ 1 7 κ 1 16 ω f 2 4 ω f 4 sin γ tan 1 β note that in the special case of normal forcing for which γ 0 and κ 1 we have λ s t λ w k 1 as the motion is a simple rocking about the y axis with no asymmetry the crucial observation is that λ w k is unaffected by the forcing angle this simplifies things significantly as it means that we can identify the spring strength ratio κ simply by observing the ratios of these two corner heights when the forcing frequency is known additionally this implies that neither the magnitude nor angle of forcing affects this ratio for example the two forcing states in fig 10 would have the same effect on λ w k if their frequencies were the same this result stems from the fact that either side of the 1 3 diagonal the system is symmetric as shown in fig 11 a change in the forcing angle therefore affects these corners equally thus by taking the ratio of the displacements λ w k the effect of the forcing angle is removed as we can find the value of ω f for each forcing state from our fourier decomposition it is therefore a matter of simply solving eq 3 2 for κ in terms of known variables giving κ 3 3 λ w k 5 7 λ w k ω f 2 9 9 λ w k 7 5 λ w k ω f 2 this facilitates direct inverse calculation from observation the system can now be entirely determined assuming that the weak spring location is known in order to visualise this expression we could attempt to explicitly define λ w k ω f pairs that do this however it is more intuitive to show λ w k as a function of κ and ω over the restricted κ range as shown in fig 12 the response domain separates into two zones either side of the resonance if ω f ω t is less than the natural frequency then z 3 z 1 while if ω f ω t then z 1 z 3 simple rocking gives λ w k 1 which can be seen to be the case for higher frequencies and healthy spring systems by the yellow region despite these corners having two potential resonance frequencies ω t and ω r 2 only ω t can be seen in fact when the system is forced near the frequency of the rotational mode changes in forcing frequency affect corners 3 and 1 in a symmetric way and thus their ratio is not altered around the translational resonance frequency the behaviour of the system changes rapidly as the displacements of corners 3 and 1 do not vary at the same rate shown earlier in fig 8 when forced at the resonant frequency itself the ratio is given by the mode shape m t for each particular κ value the resonance slice in fig 12 can be plotted by considering the variation in κ with the forcing frequency continuously adjusted to reach resonance λ w k κ ω f ω t κ shown in fig 13 as κ decreases from 1 the magnitude of z 1 decreases towards a stationary state which it reaches at κ 0 2 causing the formation of an asymptote as κ is decreased further the magnitude of z 1 increases once again reducing λ w k the behaviour of λ s t eq 3 2 varies as a function of the forcing angle this is shown in fig 14 for a number of different γ values with λ w k also shown for comparison unlike λ w k λ s t retains the resonance peak associated with the rotational mode at ω r 2 as there is no symmetry about the corner 2 4 diagonal for non normal forcing when κ 0 in the region between the resonance peaks λ s t changes greatly for the different forcing angles it is immediately obvious that for a given system response the value of λ w k and λ s t will often differ significantly depending on the forcing angle this is particularly evident for the extreme forcing angle of γ π 4 with λ s t approaching 1 for the entire ω f κ space shown by the dark shading in fig 14c there are certainly regions in which the two behave very similarly for most forcing angles for instance high frequency forcing which is generally ineffective in exciting the plate recall that for the inverse problem the location of the weak spring and the angle of forcing are unknown and thus we cannot define a transformation to convert our problem into the standard configuration consider a forcing state with arbitrary forcing angle where the location of the weak spring is not known at this stage we discard the assumption of the forward model that the weak spring was at corner 3 by measurements of the displacement at each corner perhaps indirectly through accelerometers we can construct four diagonal corner ratios λ 13 λ 31 λ 24 and λ 42 where the subscripts indicate the relevant corners with the first number as the numerator and second as the denominator through peak picking in the frequency domain we are able to identify the forcing frequency ω f giving us known pairings ω f λ 13 ω f λ 31 ω f λ 24 ω f λ 42 we can identify which spring is weak by determining which ratio is λ w k for a given ω f we search for theoretical λ w k values matching λ 13 λ 31 λ 24 and λ 42 not all of these values are likely to exist and we may optimistically hope that if our forcing frequency lies in the discernible regions mentioned earlier that only one of our options lies on the line equivalently evaluating eq 3 2 directly to find κ for each ratio and forcing frequency pair will yield only one sensible result in the 0 1 range unless λ w k 1 it is clear that both λ w k and 1 λ w k will be very different making our selection easier let us consider an example of this method suppose that the system is being forced at ω f 1 1 and λ 13 1 43 λ 31 0 7 λ 24 7 39 and λ 42 0 14 λ w k is shown in fig 15 with the relevant values along the line ω f 1 1 in fig 16 of the available possible ratios the only possible solution is that given by λ 31 which is also shown in the figures by the dot drawing a line to the κ axis we see that κ 0 5 is the solution 3 3 frequency inverse in a complex forcing state with some random element it is likely that the plate will often be undergoing an impulse response and that the frequency spectrum would be characterised by the presence of peaks corresponding to the natural modes of the system seemingly regardless of the dominant forcing property a shift in the frequency of this transient response is likely to suggest mooring damage we already know that ω t and ω r 2 are specified uniquely for κ 0 1 shown in fig 17 alongside the constant ω r 1 after the frequencies of vibration have been identified through fourier analysis we seek to find the κ value that most closely matches the analytical solutions in table 1 we can solve for κ numerically through a simple algorithm if ω 0 κ 0 ω ω 0 κ 1 κ such that d ω 0 κ ω is minimised likewise if ω r 2 κ 0 ω ω r 2 κ 1 κ such that d ω r 2 κ ω is minimised equivalently after identifying which constraint is relevant we can find the minimising κ value by trialling all values in the range 0 1 from now on we will refer to this method as the frequency inverse method 3 4 a general procedure the discussion presented in this chapter has illuminated two central plans of attack to calculate κ based on measurements of the corner height we will now summarise a general generic approach consider measurements of the plate corner displacements due to an unknown forcing after transforming our data to the frequency domain we use peak picking techniques to identify the spectral peaks suppose m peaks are identified although we cannot be sure if they are due to an impulsive or forced response for each peak frequency the four diagonal displacement corner ratios are identified and we consider all possible ω λ pairs the elements of each pair are specified by a superscript c associated with peak number c of the spectrum given by ω c λ c we now select a candidate weak spring labelling its location as position 3 and consequently labelling the other corner positions to allow use of our model if our assumption is correct the results will be physically reasonable i e 0 κ 1 all ω c λ w k c pairs are analysed under the forced inverse method to find estimates κ f for the frequencies lying in the potential resonance band the frequency based impulse inverse method is used to find κ n this leads to m estimates of κ f and a maximum of m estimates for κ n see fig 18 if our candidate weak spring selection is correct impulsive responses treated under the impulsive inverse method will produce the correct κ confirmed by the κ estimates of the forced responses treated under the forced inverse method treatments of impulsive responses under the forced inverse method and vice versa will not yield meaningful results backing up on our original assumption the method is carried out again under the assuming that different corner is weak it is important to check all possibilities as there are cases in which the problem is unsolvable with multiple weak spring positions able to generate the observed output 3 5 case studies and numerical modelling in this section we provide an example of how to apply this procedure applying inverse methods to analytical solutions would yield perfect results with none of the practical constraints associated with realistic discrete data sets in light of this we will continue with an equivalent numerical model of the scaled analytical model in matlab the 4th order runge kutta numerical procedure was used with results verified against the scaled analytical description our aim is to examine a version of the system defined by ψ l β under a particular forcing γ α 0 ω f for a range of κ values and compare this with calculations of κ via inverse methods initially the plate is assumed to be stationary and the location of the weak spring is unknown in the absence of damping some of the energy will excite the natural modes and as such we expect a superposition of forced and natural modes we select the parameters ψ 1 β 1 square γ 0 r a d α 0 0 005 r a d and ω f 1 2 with ω f deliberately selected to lie outside of the possible range of resonance frequencies for the system given an arbitrary κ to avoid starting our investigation with a particularly difficult case as the forcing frequency is quite close to the resonance frequencies and we are not extracting energy through damping the wave amplitude α 0 has been selected to be very low to keep the output within the range of motion for which the small angle approximation holds the fourier amplitude spectrum for the case of κ 0 15 is shown in fig 19 let us consider identical systems with different κ values in steps of 0 05 from 0 to 1 applying the inverse procedure under the assumption that the weak spring has already been identified as corner 3 in each instance demonstrating the correctly treated case in practice the analysis would be carried out 4 times to consider every possible weak spring position κ n and κ f are both shown in fig 20 along with the true values we notice that there are a number of points distributed very close to the actual values for both the forced and natural frequency based predictions as demonstrated earlier many of these are due to the inability to distinguish between impulse and forced responses credible results must lie within 0 1 so we can immediately ignore any inverse calculations falling outside this range plotting under this condition in fig 21 strong trends emerge in this case κ n appears to be a slight under estimate while κ f is split between two lines of data of these lines one matches the actual values very closely while the other is shifted slightly above the curve the upper line of points have been treated incorrectly due to analysing an impulse response under the forced framework the close proximity of the natural frequency with ω 1 2 and the comparable magnitudes has lead to a believable result we were fortunate in this case that we would falsely conclude a spring health not drastically dissimilar to the actual value despite the possibility of an incorrect result we should be comforted by the fact that most of the sensible within 0 1 predictions were successful over the entire range of potential κ values in the examples provided above the choice of forcing frequency is convenient lying outside the possible resonance range forcing frequencies within this band lead to considerably more ambiguity as we must consider the possibility that they actually belong to a natural response leading to more false κ n calculations additionally we reiterate that it is not possible to identify the weak spring s stiffness for a given forcing state if we cannot distinguish between λ w k and λ s t in such instances more data from different forcing states will be required 3 6 summary based on observations of the plate s motion over time we have developed a general procedure for identifying a potential weak spring and its stiffness neither the forced or frequency inverse methods depend on the forcing angle γ the forcing magnitude α 0 or the plate s geometry the frequency inverse method uses the dependence of the natural frequencies of vibration on κ to estimate this parameter based on the observed peaks in the fourier amplitude spectrum of the three natural modes of vibration the weak spring is stationary for the mode representing rotation about the line joining the weak spring and diagonally opposite healthy spring as a result it is not affected by κ and should be filtered out from the response the forced inverse approach exploits the symmetry about this line giving a direct expression for κ in terms of the forcing frequency and ratio of the displacements of these springs removing dependence on the forcing direction we speculate that for other geometries the problem can be approached in a similar way by finding the axis that leads to this invariance which may require bisection of the weak spring determining the location of the weak spring is not always possible as there may be multiple potential weak spring locations that are able to generate the same output it is therefore impossible to distinguish between diagonal corner displacement ratios 4 application to moorings in the above work we have established that observations of the movements of the plate under random forcing can be used to determine changes in the support stiffness but the forcing frequency close to a natural mode of the system and the direction has to be in an appropriate range in the moorings case the forcing has to be such as to cause the moorings to actively respond explicitly there needs to be a frequency component close enough to a natural mode and the direction of forcing also has to be appropriate to cause a substantial mooring response since moorings are designed to actively resist motion it is likely that these conditions will be satisfied in the plate case there were just three natural modes and just two of these modes lead to information concerning the changed stiffness information concerning the modal shape the displacement ratios enabled us to determine changes in the system in the moorings case in addition to the modes examined with the plate there will be the platform flexure modes which will be actively excited if the wave forcing is in the right frequency range the presence of several forcing modes certainly complicates the situation but in principle one can separate out the various modal component responses and determine the changed stiffness of one or more of the moorings there are further complications in real moorings the forcing can be due to waves which can cause the mooring to vibrate vertically or horizontally as described above or currents and winds which will primarily cause the mooring to drift the drift can be readily accounted if our linear model is appropriate if the moorings are excessively stretched the system can become non linear and there will be energy exchange between modes so the above procedures would not work of more concern are real wave effects the vibrating table model assumes that the wave is unaffected by the platform s presence and this is likely to be an accurate approximation for long waves in practice some of the incoming wave energy will be reflected and also waves will be generated by the moving platform the latter will cause the platform s motion to be damped but more importantly will preferentially extract vibrational energy in the natural mode range however providing the forcing is sustained the procedure should work but with a modified modal shape the above model would however need to be extended there are various types of moorings and supported structures and evidently the procedure used here will only work if the moorings are tested by the forcing in our case waves taut leg systems use the elastic response of the moorings that are anchored some distance from the platform and so the approaches used here are likely to be effective with catenary moorings it is the weight of the moorings that primarily produces the restoring force so the movement of the platform will provide little or no information about the strength of the mooring also with tense leg platforms the vibrational frequency of the legs are likely to be too high for detection using waves it may be that higher frequency wind bursts can be used appendix a model equations as discussed in section 1 this forcing arrangement is motivated by the moorings setting with springs used to model the moorings capturing the changes in tension as the platform moves under the influence of external loading the plate represents a platform or structure and the oscillating table mirrors ocean wave forcing rectangular geometry is chosen as many offshore structures have a rectangular base and geometry is expected to play a greater role than in the more trivial circular plate equivalent the equations describing the corner positions z i at time t due to an arbitrary forcing state are thus given as z 1 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 2 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 3 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 4 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l where the small angle approximation sin α 0 α 0 has been used under the assumption that the forcing magnitude is sufficiently small a plate with dimensions of length 2 l width 2 b and mass m is supported by the four springs which are attached to each corner of the plate as shown in figure a 22 fig a 22 plate model in the horizontal position fig a 22 the heights of the attachment points above the z 0 plane which coincides with the initial table position are denoted by z i t with the centre of the plate and centre of mass located at z above the initial table position z 0 given by z t z 1 t z 2 t z 3 t z 4 t 4 the table is initially at rest and horizontal supporting the plate this requires that the weak spring be longer than the others as it must compress further to bear a quarter of the plate s weight m g 4 hence l 30 l i 0 for i 1 2 4 the plate s weight provides a compressive force of t 0 negative tension on the springs with t 0 k i l i 0 l 0 where l 0 is the compressed length of all springs when the table oscillates it will excite a response from the plate it is useful to note here that in the case where all springs have the same stiffness k k the natural frequency of vibration associated with vertical translation is given by ω t 4 k m with each spring bearing a quarter of the load the two other modes correspond to rotations about the plate diagonals and are symmetrical prior to the addition of the plate the system was unconstrained and had degree 4 the plate places a constraint on the four corners at z 1 z 2 z 3 and z 4 reducing the degree of the system to 3 and as such z 1 z 2 z 3 provides a complete description of the plate s motion alternatively we can use the centre of the plate and two angles θ x θ y representing angular rotation of the plate around the x and y axis respectively to describe the geometry shown in fig 4 the attachment points on the plate all lie on a plane centred on x y z 0 0 z t and thus the corner locations are given by after dropping primes z 1 z l sin θ y b sin θ x z 2 z l sin θ y b sin θ x z 3 z l sin θ y b sin θ x z 4 z l sin θ y b sin θ x where we have dropped the function of time notation for simplicity the lengths of the springs are given by l i z i z i appendix a 0 1the force and momentum equations as indicated earlier the plate is assumed to be rigid and the motion to first order is vertical we now consider the forces and torques acting on the plate and summarise the plate s initial conditions to do so a general expression for the tension in each spring t i at any time is also required in terms of the current spring length l i recall that l 0 is the compressed length of each spring initially the plate is at rest with the table horizontal so that z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z with 4 t 0 m g and t 0 k i l 0 i l 0 with k 1 k 2 k 4 k and k 3 k subsequently the table rotates with the equations governing the plate s motion given by centre of mass motion t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 m g m z rotational motion l t 4 t 3 t 1 t 2 i x θ x b t 1 t 4 t 2 t 3 i y θ y with i x m b 2 3 i y m l 2 3 and where the spring tensions are given by t i t 0 k i l 0 l i i 1 4 the forcing on the right hand side is due to the table rotation about the axis described earlier in eq appendix a these equations together with the initial conditions completely specify the problem after eliminating the t s and the l s we obtain three ordinary differential equations for θ x θ y z recall that the system is of third order so that just three equations are required to specify the motion i x θ x b k b 3 k b sin θ x k l k l sin θ y k k l 0 k k z b k z 1 k z 2 k z 3 k z 4 i y θ y l k b k b sin θ x k l 3 k l sin θ y k k l 0 k k

above 
23208,offshore platforms are anchored to the ocean floor using moorings to prevent excessive drifting and these moorings need to be monitored for damage an expensive process is it possible to detect a change in moorings stiffness by measuring the motion of the platform under random wave forcing the platform s response is strongly dependent on the wave spectrum and direction of forcing this forcing is random and the measurements are indirect so it seems unlikely to examine the feasibility we examine a much simpler but analogous spring plate table system with table rotation mimicking wave action we find that by using a modal analysis of the underlying system one can unscramble the plate s response and thus determine spring stiffness changes under random forcing however as one would expect the forcing has to have components in an active frequency and direction range in principle the same type of analysis can be used for real moorings whilst the spring plate table system model was developed with moorings in mind such fault detection issues often arise under circumstances in which direct fault detection is impossible but the basic underlying system is known the simple spring plate system examined here is perhaps the simplest non trivial example of this situation keywords moorings inverse modal symmetry faults detection 1 introduction offshore oil platforms and also risers need to remain connected to the well head and so are moored to the ocean bottom to prevent excessive drift under the action of oncoming waves and currents see fig 1 the moorings provide a structural support for the platform which will be compromised if any of the moorings break or are weakened although designed to survive extreme wave events recent data suggests that they regularly fail early in their lifetime through a number of mechanisms morandini et al 2009 fault detection is therefore of critical importance monitoring strategies attempt to catch the early signs of failure with current industry practice being to deploy unmanned vehicles or divers to undertake visual inspection every five years alongside shallow water inspections on a yearly basis morandini et al 2009 renard et al 2006 we propose methods for continuously detecting faults by observing the changed movement of the platform under random wave forcing primarily taut leg platforms will be the focus but the procedures used may be applicable to other moorings types and other forms of external forcing vibrations in the form of sound waves or light rays have been used in the mining industry for the detection of ore bodies in engineering to determine the presence of cracks in metal and bubbles and other flaws in plate glass and in medicine to determine abnormalities in human anatomy see sen and stoffa 2013 duan et al 2016 deng and liu 2011 in these classical inverse problem circumstances the vibrational source is prescribed and the aim is to determine some physical property associated with the underlying system the moorings problem is also an inverse problem but is different in that the vibrational forcing waves is not controllable but the response of the platform moorings system is almost completely known an additional difficulty is that the response of the platform moorings system is strongly direction and frequency dependent so any crude statistical approach will fail we will make use this sensitivity to detect the fault in general terms the vertical vibrational movement of the platform of mass m can be described by an equation of the form m z d z k z f t where z is the vertical displacement of locations on the platform f t represents the vibrational forcing due to waves k is the effective mooring stiffness and d is the damping coefficients the aim to determine the change in k by observing z when f t is random with zero mean in the case of a taut leg platform the moorings are cables anchored some distance from the platform and the effective stiffness for vertical motions is provided by the vertical component of the cable tensions see fig 1 aside of course it is the non vibrational horizontal components of cord tension that act to restore the platform to a central location and some information concerning mooring stiffness can be obtained by observing this translational movement however here we consider vibrational vertical movements caused by waves the system is assumed to be linear so such quasi steady forcing with associated translational motion can be filtered out also although an equation of the above type can be used to describe induced horizontal vibrations it seems unlikely that the forcing and platform response will be consistent enough to enable stiffness calculations of the type described here to be successful there are other moorings types and the applicability of the procedures used here will depend on the circumstances of forcing and restraint see section 4 many issues complicate the fault detection moorings problem see section 4 however the primary difficulties are that the forcing is random and unknown the system s response is highly frequency and direction dependent and the measurements are indirect it was is not clear if detection is possible in principle so an analogous but much simpler system has been examined the simpler system consists of a plate platform mounted by springs cables on a vibrating table the waves see fig 2 in the taut leg mooring situation it is the long waves i e waves of length of the platform or larger that cause the platform to move against gravity causing the platform to vibrate vertically and to pitch and roll in our simpler system the rotating table applies this external forcing causing the rigid plate to translate pitch and roll the direction of the in plane axis of rotation as well as the amplitude and frequency of oscillation may vary randomly to simulate waves impacting the platform at an arbitrary angle the advantage of this plate model is that exact solutions are available so that the fault detection procedures used can be assessed typical inverse approaches in vibrations rely on modal analysis techniques to extract information from resonant peaks in the frequency domain which can be used to reconstruct the mass stiffness and damping of the system schmitz and smith 2011 this is the approach we will take here in section 2 we solve the forward problem under deterministic forcing we then use the results to address the inverse problem in section 3 and we then use simulations to determine the efficacy of the method finally in section 4 we return to discuss the application to real moorings 2 forward problem 2 1 table and plate geometry and dynamics the situation to be examined is that of a plate attached to a vibrating table by supporting springs as shown in fig 2 the vibrating table causes the plate to vibrate the centre of the table is chosen as the origin o through which passes the horizontal datum plane with axes x and y aligned with the sides of the table and with the z axis vertical we will begin by considering the oscillating table and initial spring positions in the absence of the plate shown in fig 3 the table oscillates about an axis passing through o and lying in the plane of the table at an angle γ clockwise to the x axis the table has length 2l and width 2b the equations describing the corner heights of the table z i above the datum plane at time t due to the table oscillation are given by z 1 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 2 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 3 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 4 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l where ω f is the angular frequency of rotation and α 0 the amplitude of rotation of the table and where the small angle approximation sin α 0 α 0 has been used under the assumption that the forcing magnitude is sufficiently small there are four springs attached to the table corners denoted i 1 4 the i t h spring of initial length l i 0 is attached to the table as shown as we are most interested in the effect of mooring integrity on system behaviour spring 3 is allowed to be weaker thus the spring constants k i are k i k for i 1 2 4 k 3 k k the vertical corner displacements of the plate are given by z i t again measured relative to the horizontal datum plane the centre of the plate is denoted by z t since the plate is rigid just three co ordinates are needed to specify its location either z 1 t z 2 t z 3 t or z t θ x t θ y t may be used see fig 4 the determination of the plate s motion due to the table vibrations described by z i t as above is elementary but algebraically complex and is relegated to appendix a in angular co ordinates these equations are given by i x θ x b k b 3 k b sin θ x k l k l sin θ y k k l 0 k k z b k z 1 k z 2 k z 3 k z 4 i y θ y l k b k b sin θ x k l 3 k l sin θ y k k l 0 k k z l k z 1 k z 2 k z 3 k z 4 m z k b k b sin θ x k l k l sin θ y k 3 k z k 3 k l 0 k z 1 k z 2 k z 3 k z 4 and the corresponding equations in cartesians can be obtained using co ordinate transformations presented in appendix a 2 2 scaling and simplification an appropriate scaling is given by x l x y b y z l 0 m g 4 k z z i l 0 m g 4 k z i z i α 0 l z i t t 0 t α α 0 α θ x α 0 θ x θ y α 0 θ y t i m g 4 t i with the dashes denoting the scaled variables and t 0 m 4 k this forces the scaled natural frequency of the pure translational mode to be ω t 1 it is convenient for visualisation to work with the heights above the horizontal plane in terms of which the scaled equations after dropping primes are given by z 1 z 2 z 3 1 4 8 0 1 5 κ 4 12 5 κ 4 0 1 7 κ z 1 z 2 z 3 ψ α 0 7 z 1 z 2 z 4 5 κ z 3 z 1 7 z 2 5 z 4 κ z 3 5 z 1 z 2 z 4 7 κ z 3 recall that the fourth corner displacement can be readily obtained the dimensionless groups that arise and define the problem are the spring constant ratio the aspect ratio and the vertical displacement vs plate length ratio κ k k β l b ψ l k g m in vector form we have z k z f t where k is the stiffness matrix and f t is the forcing term due to table rotation it should be noted that the effect of the table wave forcing on the plate platform is strongly dependent on the axis of rotation wave direction and that is captured in different components of f t which are in turn dependent on the orientation of the table axis wave direction and the frequency and amplitude of vibration wave amplitude it should be noted that a number of conclusions can be drawn already without proceeding to solve the equations notably the natural modes of the system will be governed solely by the magnitude of the spring parameter κ and are independent of the aspect ratio of the plate β this indicates that a square plate will have the same scaled frequency response as a rectangular plate 2 3 the natural modes in the absence of forcing we can solve z k z 0 for the natural response of the plate the normalised eigenvectors m b and corresponding natural frequencies ω b are given in table 1 rather than distinguishing the eigenvectors using enumeration we will use the subscripts t r 1 and r 2 referring to the translational first rotational and second rotational modes the natural response of the system is composed of any linear combination of the three natural modes with eigenvectors m t m r 1 and m r 2 given by z κ t a t m t e j ω t t ϕ t a r 1 m r 1 e j ω r 1 t ϕ r 1 a r 2 m r 2 e j ω r 2 t ϕ r 2 with constants a t a r 1 and a r 2 weighting each mode s contribution and ϕ b being the phase of each mode b this describes the impulse response of the plate which in the moorings context corresponds to excitation due to a solitary wave in the sea as we want to examine the effects of κ on the system s response it is useful to consider deviations from the healthy κ 1 case k k table 2 presents the mode shapes when κ 1 see figs 5 7 while table 3 shows the evolution of the modes as a function of κ 2 3 1 the translational mode t for healthy springs this mode represents the vertical translation this is clearly visible from the equal height profiles when κ 1 in table 3 row t which shows how the mode shape varies as a function of κ both the natural frequency and mode shape change significantly as κ is decreased much more than for the other modes we notice that for small κ corner 3 undergoes very large displacements while corner 1 moves very little this is to be expected as spring 3 is the weak spring the low magnitude of z 1 suggests that the rotation is pivoting about a point close to this corner this is vastly different from the vertical translation in the healthy case as κ decreases below 0 2 corners 1 and 3 no longer move up at the same time with corner 1 dipping below the axis at the intercept itself z 1 does not move and the entire plate pivots about it note that z 2 and z 4 exhibit identical behaviour as the system has no bias about the corner 1 to corner 3 diagonal due to the symmetrical nature of the mode our choice of scaling has ensured that ω t 1 when the springs are healthy κ 1 the evolution towards the pivoting behaviour as κ decreases is accompanied by a decrease in the natural frequency of the mode this agrees with our expectation that a decrease in the overall stiffness will lead to slower vibration 2 3 2 rotational mode 1 r1 κ independent rotation this mode represents rocking about the diagonal line joining corners 1 and 3 consequently corner 3 is stationary making the mode invariant to changes in spring health given the geometric constraints of the system we expect this to be the only possible motion displaying this invariance note the implications of this we can immediately conclude that the vibrations associated with this mode cannot be used to determine κ figures in table 3 row r 1 show the mode shape and natural frequency as a function of κ the invariance can be seen 2 3 3 rotational mode 2 r2 κ dependent rotation for the case of equal spring strength this mode represents rocking about the diagonal joining corners 2 and 4 it is clear that as κ decreases z 3 decreases see table 3 row r 2 while z 1 increases in magnitude κ 1 also introduces motion at corners 2 and 4 though they still move in unison as the symmetry of the system is maintained about the corner 1 to corner 3 diagonal in fact as each corner observes a similar evolution as a function of κ we can consider the weak spring to have introduced a translational component in addition to the rotation this bias towards the negative z direction generates the surprising result that corner 1 moves further than corner 3 weak spring the natural frequency is observed to decrease from 3 when κ 1 to 1 36 when κ 0 when κ 1 the motion is the same as the other rotational mode which rocks about the other diagonal axis 2 3 4 discussion the translational mode and second rotational mode treat z 2 and z 4 equally while in the first rotational mode they have equal magnitude and opposite sign this leads us to conclude that for any possible natural response corners 2 and 4 must have identical magnitude this captures the fact that there is no geometrical preference for the plate s motion either side of the diagonal line joining corners 1 and 3 additionally the translational mode causes large displacements of the weak spring rather than the diagonally opposite healthy spring the effect is the opposite for the second rotational mode although far less exaggerated 2 4 forced solution we will now consider the situation in which the plate is forced by the table oscillating at frequency ω f a forced solution of the form z m f e j ω f t where m f is the forced mode shape is obtained via diagonalisation by removing terms that scale the magnitude we define the shape function h as h ψ m f α 0 β 2 1 the components of which are given by h 1 κ ω f β γ x 1 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 h 2 κ ω f β γ x 2 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 ω f 2 ω r 2 2 h 3 κ ω f β γ x 3 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 h 4 κ ω f β γ x 4 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 ω f 2 ω r 2 2 where x 1 s 12 9 κ 1 12 5 κ 1 ω f 2 x 2 27 κ 1 36 s 48 21 κ 1 s 3 κ 1 s ω f 2 12 s κ 1 s ω f 4 x 3 s 12 9 κ 1 12 7 κ 1 ω f 2 x 4 27 κ 1 36 s 48 21 κ 1 s 3 κ 1 s ω f 2 12 s κ 1 s ω f 4 with s sin γ arctan β and s sin γ arctan β the terms of h are functions of the aspect ratio unlike the natural response κ ω f the forcing direction γ the forcing magnitude α 0 and ψ the vertical displacement vs plate length ratio it is not possible to completely separate the geometry component from the frequency and stiffness component for every corner 2 4 1 normal forcing direction the response for arbitrary γ is complicated so it is useful to examine the simplest case of the forcing direction aligned with the y axis of the coordinate system γ 0 the shape function becomes h 1 κ ω f β 0 β 1 β 2 12 9 κ 1 12 5 κ 1 ω f 2 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 h 2 κ ω f β 0 β 1 β 2 36 27 κ 1 48 18 κ 1 ω f 2 12 κ 1 ω f 4 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 ω f 2 ω r 2 2 h 3 κ ω f β 0 β 1 β 2 12 9 κ 1 12 7 κ 1 ω f 2 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 h 4 κ ω f β 0 β 1 β 2 36 27 κ 1 48 24 κ 1 ω f 2 12 κ 1 ω f 4 ω f 2 ω t 2 ω f 2 ω r 1 2 ω f 2 ω r 2 2 normal forcing is particularly convenient as the perpendicularity allows the frequency and stiffness contributions to be completely separated from the geometry for all corners as ω t ω r 1 and ω r 2 are functions of κ the response shape is purely a function of the forcing frequency and spring stiffness thus for normal forcing the length and width of the plate do not influence the shape of the response only the magnitude it is therefore logical to analyse the shape of the response in κ ω f space intuitively when the forcing frequency ω f reaches a natural frequency the denominators will become zero and we will get an infinitely large response in the absence of damping referring to eqs 2 4 1 and 2 4 1 we observe that h 2 and h 4 have an extra factor in the denominator corresponding to the first rotational mode this is not present in h 1 and h 3 eq 2 4 1 and 2 4 1 as these corners are never affected by this particular rotational mode as discussed prior in section 2 3 2 fig 8 a d give h as a function of the forcing frequency for various κ values note that negative values are indicative of the relative motion between the corners when corner 4 goes up corner 2 usually goes down if not for the asymmetry introduced by the weak spring they would be reflections of each other the changed response is most clearly observed by the shift in the vertical asymptotes associated with resonant peaks due to the dependence of the translational and second rotational mode on κ the κ 1 resonant peak at ω f 3 is shared by both rotational modes although only corners 2 and 4 are affected by the first rotational mode which remains at ω f 3 regardless of κ for the other resonance frequencies we notice that a decrease in κ causes them to decrease the responses converge to zero in the high frequency limit and as such the behaviour is independent of κ here for corners 2 and 4 this occurs for all κ 3 their degeneracy implying that they should not be looked at in the high frequency range when considering inverse methods for the calculation of κ from observed heights we also note that all curves lie between the κ 1 thick black and κ 0 thin black curves forming an envelope of possible solutions with decreasing κ causing a predictable transition from the κ 1 side of the envelope to the κ 0 side the case of non normal forcing is qualitatively similar except that the magnitude of the corner motion aligning with the forcing direction is increased with corresponding decreases in motion at the unaligned corners 3 inverse problem we first examine a crude procedure for detecting changes in the moorings stiffness and then we go on to use more accurate modal procedures to extract results 3 1 orbital analysis for any arbitrary forcing condition the system exhibits a known range of possible motion we will refer to the full set of locations as the orbit if a plate location is measured that lies outside the orbit we can conclude that κ will have changed a starting point is to plot the range of possible positions for a fit spring κ 1 and a weak spring κ 0 for all possible forcing angles at a particular frequency an example is given in fig 9 for ω f 0 5 the orbits for κ 1 contrast significantly with κ 0 observe the larger displacements in springs 1 and 3 which both lie on the weak diagonal axis although this is the most extreme example a partially weakened spring would produce motion that would not lie on the orbital curves for κ 1 and would be easy to identify this serves as a useful and simple way to identify a potentially weak spring this analysis is made more difficult because the weak spring location is unknown identifying this relies on qualitative observations such as that the low frequency forcing causing large displacements of the weak spring even if the spring is identified correctly this method does not allow us to find κ precisely although it may still be possible to recognise whether replacement is necessary 3 2 forced solution inverse we will now use the forced solution to construct a method for the identification of the spring stiffness ratio for now we will operate under the assumption that the weak spring has been identified although its stiffness is unknown allowing us to specify strong springs at positions 1 2 and 4 with the weak spring at position 3 as presented in the forward model we must first break down the complex forcing state into different frequency components using fourier decomposition to significantly excite the plate the frequency of the forcing must be close enough to the resonance frequencies of the plate and we can filter out frequencies over which the plate s response is invariant to changes in κ we notice that by considering the ratio of diagonally opposed corner displacements λ w k weak spring diagonal and λ s t healthy spring diagonal we can remove the dependence on the forcing magnitude α 0 λ w k κ ω f m 3 f m 1 f 12 9 κ 1 12 7 κ 1 ω f 2 12 9 κ 1 12 5 κ 1 ω f 2 λ s t κ ω f β γ m 4 f m 2 f g s g s where g κ 1 ω f 2 3 ω f 2 sin γ tan 1 β and s 3 12 9 κ 1 7 κ 1 16 ω f 2 4 ω f 4 sin γ tan 1 β note that in the special case of normal forcing for which γ 0 and κ 1 we have λ s t λ w k 1 as the motion is a simple rocking about the y axis with no asymmetry the crucial observation is that λ w k is unaffected by the forcing angle this simplifies things significantly as it means that we can identify the spring strength ratio κ simply by observing the ratios of these two corner heights when the forcing frequency is known additionally this implies that neither the magnitude nor angle of forcing affects this ratio for example the two forcing states in fig 10 would have the same effect on λ w k if their frequencies were the same this result stems from the fact that either side of the 1 3 diagonal the system is symmetric as shown in fig 11 a change in the forcing angle therefore affects these corners equally thus by taking the ratio of the displacements λ w k the effect of the forcing angle is removed as we can find the value of ω f for each forcing state from our fourier decomposition it is therefore a matter of simply solving eq 3 2 for κ in terms of known variables giving κ 3 3 λ w k 5 7 λ w k ω f 2 9 9 λ w k 7 5 λ w k ω f 2 this facilitates direct inverse calculation from observation the system can now be entirely determined assuming that the weak spring location is known in order to visualise this expression we could attempt to explicitly define λ w k ω f pairs that do this however it is more intuitive to show λ w k as a function of κ and ω over the restricted κ range as shown in fig 12 the response domain separates into two zones either side of the resonance if ω f ω t is less than the natural frequency then z 3 z 1 while if ω f ω t then z 1 z 3 simple rocking gives λ w k 1 which can be seen to be the case for higher frequencies and healthy spring systems by the yellow region despite these corners having two potential resonance frequencies ω t and ω r 2 only ω t can be seen in fact when the system is forced near the frequency of the rotational mode changes in forcing frequency affect corners 3 and 1 in a symmetric way and thus their ratio is not altered around the translational resonance frequency the behaviour of the system changes rapidly as the displacements of corners 3 and 1 do not vary at the same rate shown earlier in fig 8 when forced at the resonant frequency itself the ratio is given by the mode shape m t for each particular κ value the resonance slice in fig 12 can be plotted by considering the variation in κ with the forcing frequency continuously adjusted to reach resonance λ w k κ ω f ω t κ shown in fig 13 as κ decreases from 1 the magnitude of z 1 decreases towards a stationary state which it reaches at κ 0 2 causing the formation of an asymptote as κ is decreased further the magnitude of z 1 increases once again reducing λ w k the behaviour of λ s t eq 3 2 varies as a function of the forcing angle this is shown in fig 14 for a number of different γ values with λ w k also shown for comparison unlike λ w k λ s t retains the resonance peak associated with the rotational mode at ω r 2 as there is no symmetry about the corner 2 4 diagonal for non normal forcing when κ 0 in the region between the resonance peaks λ s t changes greatly for the different forcing angles it is immediately obvious that for a given system response the value of λ w k and λ s t will often differ significantly depending on the forcing angle this is particularly evident for the extreme forcing angle of γ π 4 with λ s t approaching 1 for the entire ω f κ space shown by the dark shading in fig 14c there are certainly regions in which the two behave very similarly for most forcing angles for instance high frequency forcing which is generally ineffective in exciting the plate recall that for the inverse problem the location of the weak spring and the angle of forcing are unknown and thus we cannot define a transformation to convert our problem into the standard configuration consider a forcing state with arbitrary forcing angle where the location of the weak spring is not known at this stage we discard the assumption of the forward model that the weak spring was at corner 3 by measurements of the displacement at each corner perhaps indirectly through accelerometers we can construct four diagonal corner ratios λ 13 λ 31 λ 24 and λ 42 where the subscripts indicate the relevant corners with the first number as the numerator and second as the denominator through peak picking in the frequency domain we are able to identify the forcing frequency ω f giving us known pairings ω f λ 13 ω f λ 31 ω f λ 24 ω f λ 42 we can identify which spring is weak by determining which ratio is λ w k for a given ω f we search for theoretical λ w k values matching λ 13 λ 31 λ 24 and λ 42 not all of these values are likely to exist and we may optimistically hope that if our forcing frequency lies in the discernible regions mentioned earlier that only one of our options lies on the line equivalently evaluating eq 3 2 directly to find κ for each ratio and forcing frequency pair will yield only one sensible result in the 0 1 range unless λ w k 1 it is clear that both λ w k and 1 λ w k will be very different making our selection easier let us consider an example of this method suppose that the system is being forced at ω f 1 1 and λ 13 1 43 λ 31 0 7 λ 24 7 39 and λ 42 0 14 λ w k is shown in fig 15 with the relevant values along the line ω f 1 1 in fig 16 of the available possible ratios the only possible solution is that given by λ 31 which is also shown in the figures by the dot drawing a line to the κ axis we see that κ 0 5 is the solution 3 3 frequency inverse in a complex forcing state with some random element it is likely that the plate will often be undergoing an impulse response and that the frequency spectrum would be characterised by the presence of peaks corresponding to the natural modes of the system seemingly regardless of the dominant forcing property a shift in the frequency of this transient response is likely to suggest mooring damage we already know that ω t and ω r 2 are specified uniquely for κ 0 1 shown in fig 17 alongside the constant ω r 1 after the frequencies of vibration have been identified through fourier analysis we seek to find the κ value that most closely matches the analytical solutions in table 1 we can solve for κ numerically through a simple algorithm if ω 0 κ 0 ω ω 0 κ 1 κ such that d ω 0 κ ω is minimised likewise if ω r 2 κ 0 ω ω r 2 κ 1 κ such that d ω r 2 κ ω is minimised equivalently after identifying which constraint is relevant we can find the minimising κ value by trialling all values in the range 0 1 from now on we will refer to this method as the frequency inverse method 3 4 a general procedure the discussion presented in this chapter has illuminated two central plans of attack to calculate κ based on measurements of the corner height we will now summarise a general generic approach consider measurements of the plate corner displacements due to an unknown forcing after transforming our data to the frequency domain we use peak picking techniques to identify the spectral peaks suppose m peaks are identified although we cannot be sure if they are due to an impulsive or forced response for each peak frequency the four diagonal displacement corner ratios are identified and we consider all possible ω λ pairs the elements of each pair are specified by a superscript c associated with peak number c of the spectrum given by ω c λ c we now select a candidate weak spring labelling its location as position 3 and consequently labelling the other corner positions to allow use of our model if our assumption is correct the results will be physically reasonable i e 0 κ 1 all ω c λ w k c pairs are analysed under the forced inverse method to find estimates κ f for the frequencies lying in the potential resonance band the frequency based impulse inverse method is used to find κ n this leads to m estimates of κ f and a maximum of m estimates for κ n see fig 18 if our candidate weak spring selection is correct impulsive responses treated under the impulsive inverse method will produce the correct κ confirmed by the κ estimates of the forced responses treated under the forced inverse method treatments of impulsive responses under the forced inverse method and vice versa will not yield meaningful results backing up on our original assumption the method is carried out again under the assuming that different corner is weak it is important to check all possibilities as there are cases in which the problem is unsolvable with multiple weak spring positions able to generate the observed output 3 5 case studies and numerical modelling in this section we provide an example of how to apply this procedure applying inverse methods to analytical solutions would yield perfect results with none of the practical constraints associated with realistic discrete data sets in light of this we will continue with an equivalent numerical model of the scaled analytical model in matlab the 4th order runge kutta numerical procedure was used with results verified against the scaled analytical description our aim is to examine a version of the system defined by ψ l β under a particular forcing γ α 0 ω f for a range of κ values and compare this with calculations of κ via inverse methods initially the plate is assumed to be stationary and the location of the weak spring is unknown in the absence of damping some of the energy will excite the natural modes and as such we expect a superposition of forced and natural modes we select the parameters ψ 1 β 1 square γ 0 r a d α 0 0 005 r a d and ω f 1 2 with ω f deliberately selected to lie outside of the possible range of resonance frequencies for the system given an arbitrary κ to avoid starting our investigation with a particularly difficult case as the forcing frequency is quite close to the resonance frequencies and we are not extracting energy through damping the wave amplitude α 0 has been selected to be very low to keep the output within the range of motion for which the small angle approximation holds the fourier amplitude spectrum for the case of κ 0 15 is shown in fig 19 let us consider identical systems with different κ values in steps of 0 05 from 0 to 1 applying the inverse procedure under the assumption that the weak spring has already been identified as corner 3 in each instance demonstrating the correctly treated case in practice the analysis would be carried out 4 times to consider every possible weak spring position κ n and κ f are both shown in fig 20 along with the true values we notice that there are a number of points distributed very close to the actual values for both the forced and natural frequency based predictions as demonstrated earlier many of these are due to the inability to distinguish between impulse and forced responses credible results must lie within 0 1 so we can immediately ignore any inverse calculations falling outside this range plotting under this condition in fig 21 strong trends emerge in this case κ n appears to be a slight under estimate while κ f is split between two lines of data of these lines one matches the actual values very closely while the other is shifted slightly above the curve the upper line of points have been treated incorrectly due to analysing an impulse response under the forced framework the close proximity of the natural frequency with ω 1 2 and the comparable magnitudes has lead to a believable result we were fortunate in this case that we would falsely conclude a spring health not drastically dissimilar to the actual value despite the possibility of an incorrect result we should be comforted by the fact that most of the sensible within 0 1 predictions were successful over the entire range of potential κ values in the examples provided above the choice of forcing frequency is convenient lying outside the possible resonance range forcing frequencies within this band lead to considerably more ambiguity as we must consider the possibility that they actually belong to a natural response leading to more false κ n calculations additionally we reiterate that it is not possible to identify the weak spring s stiffness for a given forcing state if we cannot distinguish between λ w k and λ s t in such instances more data from different forcing states will be required 3 6 summary based on observations of the plate s motion over time we have developed a general procedure for identifying a potential weak spring and its stiffness neither the forced or frequency inverse methods depend on the forcing angle γ the forcing magnitude α 0 or the plate s geometry the frequency inverse method uses the dependence of the natural frequencies of vibration on κ to estimate this parameter based on the observed peaks in the fourier amplitude spectrum of the three natural modes of vibration the weak spring is stationary for the mode representing rotation about the line joining the weak spring and diagonally opposite healthy spring as a result it is not affected by κ and should be filtered out from the response the forced inverse approach exploits the symmetry about this line giving a direct expression for κ in terms of the forcing frequency and ratio of the displacements of these springs removing dependence on the forcing direction we speculate that for other geometries the problem can be approached in a similar way by finding the axis that leads to this invariance which may require bisection of the weak spring determining the location of the weak spring is not always possible as there may be multiple potential weak spring locations that are able to generate the same output it is therefore impossible to distinguish between diagonal corner displacement ratios 4 application to moorings in the above work we have established that observations of the movements of the plate under random forcing can be used to determine changes in the support stiffness but the forcing frequency close to a natural mode of the system and the direction has to be in an appropriate range in the moorings case the forcing has to be such as to cause the moorings to actively respond explicitly there needs to be a frequency component close enough to a natural mode and the direction of forcing also has to be appropriate to cause a substantial mooring response since moorings are designed to actively resist motion it is likely that these conditions will be satisfied in the plate case there were just three natural modes and just two of these modes lead to information concerning the changed stiffness information concerning the modal shape the displacement ratios enabled us to determine changes in the system in the moorings case in addition to the modes examined with the plate there will be the platform flexure modes which will be actively excited if the wave forcing is in the right frequency range the presence of several forcing modes certainly complicates the situation but in principle one can separate out the various modal component responses and determine the changed stiffness of one or more of the moorings there are further complications in real moorings the forcing can be due to waves which can cause the mooring to vibrate vertically or horizontally as described above or currents and winds which will primarily cause the mooring to drift the drift can be readily accounted if our linear model is appropriate if the moorings are excessively stretched the system can become non linear and there will be energy exchange between modes so the above procedures would not work of more concern are real wave effects the vibrating table model assumes that the wave is unaffected by the platform s presence and this is likely to be an accurate approximation for long waves in practice some of the incoming wave energy will be reflected and also waves will be generated by the moving platform the latter will cause the platform s motion to be damped but more importantly will preferentially extract vibrational energy in the natural mode range however providing the forcing is sustained the procedure should work but with a modified modal shape the above model would however need to be extended there are various types of moorings and supported structures and evidently the procedure used here will only work if the moorings are tested by the forcing in our case waves taut leg systems use the elastic response of the moorings that are anchored some distance from the platform and so the approaches used here are likely to be effective with catenary moorings it is the weight of the moorings that primarily produces the restoring force so the movement of the platform will provide little or no information about the strength of the mooring also with tense leg platforms the vibrational frequency of the legs are likely to be too high for detection using waves it may be that higher frequency wind bursts can be used appendix a model equations as discussed in section 1 this forcing arrangement is motivated by the moorings setting with springs used to model the moorings capturing the changes in tension as the platform moves under the influence of external loading the plate represents a platform or structure and the oscillating table mirrors ocean wave forcing rectangular geometry is chosen as many offshore structures have a rectangular base and geometry is expected to play a greater role than in the more trivial circular plate equivalent the equations describing the corner positions z i at time t due to an arbitrary forcing state are thus given as z 1 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 2 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 3 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l z 4 e j ω f t b 2 l 2 α 0 sin γ arctan b l where the small angle approximation sin α 0 α 0 has been used under the assumption that the forcing magnitude is sufficiently small a plate with dimensions of length 2 l width 2 b and mass m is supported by the four springs which are attached to each corner of the plate as shown in figure a 22 fig a 22 plate model in the horizontal position fig a 22 the heights of the attachment points above the z 0 plane which coincides with the initial table position are denoted by z i t with the centre of the plate and centre of mass located at z above the initial table position z 0 given by z t z 1 t z 2 t z 3 t z 4 t 4 the table is initially at rest and horizontal supporting the plate this requires that the weak spring be longer than the others as it must compress further to bear a quarter of the plate s weight m g 4 hence l 30 l i 0 for i 1 2 4 the plate s weight provides a compressive force of t 0 negative tension on the springs with t 0 k i l i 0 l 0 where l 0 is the compressed length of all springs when the table oscillates it will excite a response from the plate it is useful to note here that in the case where all springs have the same stiffness k k the natural frequency of vibration associated with vertical translation is given by ω t 4 k m with each spring bearing a quarter of the load the two other modes correspond to rotations about the plate diagonals and are symmetrical prior to the addition of the plate the system was unconstrained and had degree 4 the plate places a constraint on the four corners at z 1 z 2 z 3 and z 4 reducing the degree of the system to 3 and as such z 1 z 2 z 3 provides a complete description of the plate s motion alternatively we can use the centre of the plate and two angles θ x θ y representing angular rotation of the plate around the x and y axis respectively to describe the geometry shown in fig 4 the attachment points on the plate all lie on a plane centred on x y z 0 0 z t and thus the corner locations are given by after dropping primes z 1 z l sin θ y b sin θ x z 2 z l sin θ y b sin θ x z 3 z l sin θ y b sin θ x z 4 z l sin θ y b sin θ x where we have dropped the function of time notation for simplicity the lengths of the springs are given by l i z i z i appendix a 0 1the force and momentum equations as indicated earlier the plate is assumed to be rigid and the motion to first order is vertical we now consider the forces and torques acting on the plate and summarise the plate s initial conditions to do so a general expression for the tension in each spring t i at any time is also required in terms of the current spring length l i recall that l 0 is the compressed length of each spring initially the plate is at rest with the table horizontal so that z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z with 4 t 0 m g and t 0 k i l 0 i l 0 with k 1 k 2 k 4 k and k 3 k subsequently the table rotates with the equations governing the plate s motion given by centre of mass motion t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 m g m z rotational motion l t 4 t 3 t 1 t 2 i x θ x b t 1 t 4 t 2 t 3 i y θ y with i x m b 2 3 i y m l 2 3 and where the spring tensions are given by t i t 0 k i l 0 l i i 1 4 the forcing on the right hand side is due to the table rotation about the axis described earlier in eq appendix a these equations together with the initial conditions completely specify the problem after eliminating the t s and the l s we obtain three ordinary differential equations for θ x θ y z recall that the system is of third order so

23209,this paper proposes an improved methodology for handling ships without command by incorporating evidential reasoning and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis in the decision making of emergency responses the kernel of this method is to use evidential reasoning to integrate the influencing factors expressed by incomplete information of each of the involved organizations and to employ the topsis method to make the final decision with the asymmetric information distribution among the involved organizations a ship with main engine failure is considered as the study case to apply the proposed methodology the result demonstrates that the new method is beneficial for handling ships that are not under command keywords ships without command group decision making evidential reasoning topsis uncertainty asymmetric information 1 introduction ship safety under major accidents is the typical scenario used to determine the risk levels in maritime transportation guedes soares and teixeira 2001 however minor accidents in the propulsion system or steering gear failures will turn a ship in a not under command nuc and this may lead to a major accident as discussed in wu et al 2016 when a ship becomes nuc which is a frequently occurring incidental situation and effective handling measure is not adopted a sequence of undesired events can develop leading into major accidents such as grounding mazaheri et al 2014 eventually with bottom damage prestileo et al 2013 oil spill talley et al 2012 krohling and campanharo 2011 and collision silveira et al 2013 ulusçu et al 2009 among others from the definition of the convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs issued in 1972 nuc means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to manoeuvre as required by these rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel the definition means that the nuc ship is restricted in manoeuvrability which will cause an emergent situation in inland waterway transportation and in port approaches according to the statistical data in yangtze river which will be further introduced in the following section a nuc ship is mainly caused by rudder failure 19 main engine failure 68 and black out 8 which means the steering system propulsion system or power related systems is out of work respectively when this incident occurs in a two way traffic and only in a 300 m width channel in yangtze river the nuc ships have to handle such situations very carefully from the abovementioned statistical data there are always four options in nuc ship handling which means the key point in nuc ship handling is to select the best alternative in terms of influencing factors moreover three organizations are involved in the handling of nuc ships which are the nuc ship herself the maritime safety administration msa who is in charge of the maritime safety in yangtze river and the ships passing by in practice though the final handling of a nuc ship is carried out by the nuc herself sometimes with the help of msa the nuc ship must ask for approval of the msa before taking actions in yangtze river the main reason for this requirement is that the handling options of nuc ships will have great impact on the passing by ships in such narrow and high density waterway area even causing congestion in yangtze river zhang et al 2013 therefore the msa has to not only consider the safety of the nuc ship but also the safety of passing by ships and the efficiency of the transportation system in order to solve this problem the influencing factors should first be identified and earlier work can already contribute antao and guedes soares 2008 similarly to an intact ship the handling of a nuc ship is also influenced by wind current visibility balmat et al 2009 li et al 2014 sahin and senol 2015 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 in addition the possible condition of damaged ship will also influence the handling of nuc ships santos and guedes soares 2009 manderbacka and ruponen 2016 hashimoto et al 2017 which requires that the related subsystems should be considered from the viewpoint of a generic ship lois et al 2004 wang and foinikis 2001 the ship length is another important factor balmat et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 that should also be taken into consideration moreover traffic flow and restricted area are another two key factors wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 furthermore evaluation of the necessary available rescue resources should also be carried out the abovementioned factors are assumed to be influencing factors in this decision making problem on the other hand in terms of safety management of maritime transportation zhang et al 2013 the influencing factors are divided into four categories that can be treated as attributes in decision making specifically they are natural environment zhang et al 2013 knapp and van de velden 2011 traffic environment zhang et al 2013 2015 vessel condition balmat et al 2011 hänninen and kujala 2012 and available rescue resources montewka et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 therefore the handling of nuc ship is a typical multiple attribute decision making problem when solving traditional multiple attribute decision making problems fuzzy logic is widely used coşgun et al 2014 ung 2018 perera et al 2012 celik and akyuz 2018 beşikçi et al 2016 owing to its distinguishing features in information fusion yang and wang 2015 specifically this technique provides a tool to deal with the information with fuzziness or vagueness which always exists in nuc ship handling for example when describing the vessel condition the experts always use the linguistic terms such as worst poor average good best however it should be mentioned that fuzzy logic is hard to deal with the uncertainty caused by incompleteness or ignorance yang et al 2006 which is common in decision making for nuc control and the detailed descriptions are given in subsection 2 3 moreover a novel evidential reasoning method which intends to address uncertainties caused both by incompleteness and fuzziness has been developed yang et al 2006 evidential reasoning another widely used method in multiple attribute decision making in maritime transportation mokhtari et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yang 2001 yang et al 2009 wu et al 2017a b xi et al 2017 can be an alternative analytical tool to deal with such uncertainty the difference of fuzzy logic and evidential reasoning are as follows first in the fuzzy logic method there are overlaps in their meanings between the adjacent linguistic terms e g good and very good while in the evidential reasoning method the linguistic terms are distinctive which means there are no overlaps in the meanings of adjacent linguistic terms yang et al 2006 second the fuzzy logic can only be used to deal with the uncertainty caused by fuzziness or vagueness while the evidential reasoning can only be applied to address the problem of incompleteness or ignorance yang et al 2013 note that three combination rule of evidences are developed for evidential reasoning the first one is proposed by yang 2001 which roughly treats the uncertainty as one category in the process of synthesis yang and xu 2002 different from the first rule the second rule treats the uncertainty as two types which are the uncertainty caused by the incomplete information and the uncertainty caused by the weights of attributes yang and xu 2002 though the second rule is a special case with normalized weights which is claimed in their recent research yang et al 2006 the present paper still uses the second rule with normalized weights for simplification the problem of application of evidential reasoning in multiple attribute decision making is that the final decision is made using an interval number in the traditional evidential reasoning method after integrating the influencing variables the final utility values which are the integrated result of the alternatives are interval numbers when considering the uncertainty since two interval numbers can only be compared if they have no overlaps the integrated results of alternatives which are expressed as interval numbers are difficult to be compared the average utility seems to be a solution yang 2001 yang and xu 2002 however when comparing options one interval number in essence is greater than the other with a probability yue 2011a 2012b c 2013a which makes it hard to use traditional decision making method first in the traditional decision making process the decision matrix is described by crisp values the widely used method such as electre na et al 2017 and bayesian network wu et al 2017a b should be improved to address this problem second the traditional method can only take the vagueness into account but it is hard to consider the uncertainty caused by incompleteness therefore a better method should be further developed to overcome this drawback creating a clear decision criterion and deriving the weights by using own algorithm another problem of nuc ship handling is caused by the asymmetric information distribution between the organizations in cooperation which means that these three organizations may have different information sources or assessments on the same variable and the proposed method should be able to integrate the different sources of information therefore in order to solve these two problems in nuc ship handling this paper proposes a multiple attribute group decision making method for nuc ship handling under uncertainty and an improved method is proposed for final decision making by using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis method twice the topsis method is widely used owing to its concept of choosing the alternative by considering both the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution nis from the literature review some novel topsis methods have been developed recently on the basis of this concept zavadskas et al 2016 behzadian et al 2012 and they can be introduced to choose the alternative with decision matrix expressed by interval numbers yue 2013a and intuitionistic fuzzy setting yue 2013b 2014 among others moreover it can also be found from the literature that topsis is also developed to obtain the weights of decision makers multiple information sources for integration different opinions or sources of information xu and da 2008 xu 2007 yue 2011a b 2012a b c in order to achieve this first this paper attempts to employ evidential reasoning for nuc ship handling under uncertainty after establishing the three level decision framework second in order to integrate the information from three different organizations the extended topsis is introduced to determine the weights of these organizations decision maker finally in order to overcome the drawback of final decision making using interval numbers topsis is twice used to select the best alternative for nuc ship handling by using crisp value the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes preliminaries on nuc ship handling including the statistical data of nuc ship handling in yangtze river from 2007 to 2012 and also some concepts and theories section 3 proposes an improved multiple attribute group decision making method by incorporating the evidential reasoning and topsis method afterwards an illustrative example is introduced to verify the proposed decision making method in section 4 discussions are carried out in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 preliminaries on nuc ship handling 2 1 statistical data in yangtze river a nuc ship results from frequently occurring incidents in the jiangsu traffic separation scheme tss waterway which is located in the downstream of yangtze river where two way traffic flow is allowed according to the statistical data of jiangsu msa which is in charge of maritime safety within a specified waterway range about 100 such incidents occurred per year from 2007 to 2012 fig 1 hence the msa has to handle a nuc ship every three days in average which is definitely a challenging work to achieve a well organized nuc ship handling many statistical data have been collected during the abovementioned period the causation factors analysis is carried out to discover the appropriate handling options in different failure modes when the nuc incidents do not occur in the fairways they may have enough time and resources which means that the handling of nuc ships in such situation can take any of the traditionally used options therefore this paper only analysed situations that occurred in the fairway in a total of 764 nuc cases the causation factors of nuc ship can be divided into three main subtypes in terms of failure modes which are main engine 68 rudder 19 and black out 8 the handling options for the nuc ships vary in terms of failure modes there are four options from the statistical data and the handling options in different failure modes are shown in fig 2 it should be mentioned that this data only considers the initial action of the nuc ship which is the most significant issue owing to time pressure for example if the nuc ships are handled by tug assistance after anchoring in the channel they are assumed to have taken the option of anchoring in the channel rather than tug assistance the description of each option is as follows tug assistance operation a1 the nuc ship is assisted and towed by tugs to continue the uncompleted task such as berthing sailing or anchoring beaching or anchoring in outer limit of the fairway a2 beaching means that the nuc ship grounds on purpose in shallow water and anchoring in the outer limit of the fairway means the nuc ship anchors in the outer limit of fairway so that it will not influence the sailing ships in the fairway anchoring in the nearby anchorage a3 the ship anchors in the nearby anchorage by using its own propulsion or tug assistance the key factor to differentiate a3 from a1 is whether the ship stopped the initial task or not the other option is immediate anchoring in the channel a4 the nuc ships grape the bottom of channel to make the ship stop immediately by adopting this option 2 2 decision making for nuc ship handling the problem of selecting the best alternative for nuc ship handling can be described as follows according to the statistical data shown in fig 2 there are four alternatives for nuc ship handling and the objective of this paper is to select the best alternative in different scenarios the influencing factors and attributes are identified in the second paragraph of the introductory section however it is very hard to define the decision makers in this problem in this paper all involved organizations which are the nuc ship itself the passing ships by and the msa are all treated as decision makers for the following two reasons first just as described in the introductory section despite the final handling is carried out by the nuc ship the msa and the ships passing by are all involved and may have different opinions about the handling of the nuc ship and their opinions should be considered in the decision making process specifically the nuc ship may always intend to take the easiest and also the safest option for herself i e immediately anchoring in the channel however the ships passing by may treat this option as the last choice because it will greatly disturb the ships passing by and they prefer the other alternatives more than this one while the msa have to consider both the safety of the nuc ship and the efficiency of traffic flow from this perspective the three involved organizations should be treated as decision makers in the nuc ship handling and in practice they are often requested for advice second the different organizations have different information sources which lead to different information contents and this should be considered and integrated in a comprehensive perspective 2 3 uncertainty in decision making uncertainty is very common in reality and it is properly and accurately modelled with probabilistic theory which is one type of uncertainty that need to be addressed however some linguistic terms e g poor good that describe the influencing factors can also be modelled in a fuzziness or vagueness framework however in this paper only the uncertainty caused by incomplete information for handling nuc ships is discussed many factors may cause the incomplete information in reality the first one discussed here is the fundamental or inherent uncertainty which is caused by the physics meaning that in reality it is very hard to describe something precisely or completely for example the description of wind scale whose value always changes from 3 beaufort scale to 4 with a probability of 0 4 while the wind may also fluctuate with a probability of 0 2 in this case the information of wind scale can only be described as 3 and 4 both with a belief degree of 0 4 while the fluctuation of the wind can be treated as uncertainty with a belief degree of 0 2 since in this case the wind scale cannot be precisely measured in this case the whole assessment on the wind scale is incomplete because 0 4 0 4 1 while the missing 0 2 is defined as degree of ignorance or uncertainty another factor that may cause incomplete information is the statistical method i e the well known statistical uncertainty for example the causation factors of nuc ship are recorded as main engine 68 rudder 19 and black out 8 while the remaining 7 100 68 19 8 7 defined as others in the statistical data should be assumed as incomplete information because no further information can be obtained from the description of others there are also other causation factors of the incomplete information such as expert judgment which will not be further discussed here it should be mentioned that since the three involved organizations may have different information on these variables this will cause the incomplete information of different organizations to be different from each other for example when describing failure mode the nuc ship can make judgments from their past experience but the msa and ships passing by cannot collect such information since they are not familiar with the nuc ship 2 4 evidential reasoning in group decision making the evidential reasoning method can be applied to a generalized three level hierarchy evaluation framework shown in fig 3 following yang and xu 2002 where the influencing factors are expressed with incomplete information some basic definitions should be first given the generalized multiple attribute decision making framework consists of a general criterion at the level for reference a number of basic attributes a a i i 1 2 i at the second level and a set of influencing factors b b j j 1 2 j at the third level w w i i 1 2 i are defined as the weights of the attributes and w w j i j 1 2 j are defined as the weights of the influencing factors where 0 w i 1 i 1 i w i 1 0 w j i 1 and j 1 j w j i 1 suppose there are n distinctive evaluation grades for the general criterion which provides a set of standards for evaluating the attributes and influencing factors the evaluation grades can be written as h h n n 1 2 n where h n is the n th evaluation grade and it is supposed that h n 1 is preferred to h n assume there are a set of alternatives m m k k 1 2 k and the influencing factor b j associated with the i th attribute whose assessment under the k th k 1 2 k alternative is represented as s b j i k h n β n j i k n 1 2 n where β n j i k 0 and n 1 n β n j i k 1 the variable β n j i k means the degree of belief the j th influencing factor under the k th alternative which is assessed by using the reference grades of h n if n 1 n β n j i k 1 the assessment is assumed to have complete information whereas the information is incomplete if n 1 n β n j i k 1 after making some basic definitions the multiple attribute group decision making can be carried out as shown in fig 4 and the detailed process is as follows first the influencing factors can be integrated by using the evidential reasoning combination rule define the e l j i as a subset of the i attribute which consists of the corresponding influencing factors then in the evidential reasoning algorithm yang and xu 2002 the remaining probability mass unassigned to individual grades after all the influencing factors in e l j i have been assessed is divided into two parts one is caused by weights which is written as m h j i the other is caused by the uncertainty of the influencing factors which is written as m h j i and the summation of the uncertainty is defined as m h j i m h j i m h j i let m n j i be the basic probability mass of the j influencing factors which represents to how many degrees this influencing factor supports the hypothesis that the criterion is assigned to the nth grade h n 1 m n j i w j i β n j i k 2 m h j i 1 w j i 3 m h j i w j i 1 n 1 n β n j i k 4 h n m n l j 1 i c l j 1 i m n l j i m n j 1 i m h l j i m n j 1 i m n l j i m h j 1 i 5 m h l j i m h l j i m h l j i 6 h m h l j 1 i c l j 1 i m h l j i m h j 1 i m h l j i m h j 1 i m h l j i m h j 1 i 7 c l j 1 i 1 s 1 n t 1 s t n m s l j i m t j 1 i 1 j 1 2 j 1 moreover after all j assessments have been integrated the uncertainty caused by the weights is reassigned to the individual grades proportionally yang and xu 2002 8 h n β n i k m n l j i 1 m h l j i n 1 2 n 9 h β h i k m n l j i 1 m h l j i second the attributes can be integrated with the same form of integration of influencing factors by using the evidential reasoning combination rule third the information of different decision makers can also be integrated with the same of integration of influencing factors by using evidential reasoning rule last the utility value is introduced for final decision making suppose u h n is the utility of the grade h n since the uncertainty still exists after the integration of the influencing factors the utility of the i th attribute associated with the k th alternative is an interval number and the maximum minimum and average utility can be defined as follows yang and xu 2002 10 u max a i k n 1 n 1 β n i k u h n β n i k β h i k u h n 11 u min a i k β 1 i k β h i k u h 1 n 2 n β n i k u h n 12 u a v g a i k u max a i k u min a i k 2 it can be observed that uncertainty still exists in this evaluation which makes the evaluation to have a maximum value and a minimum value interval number as shown in fig 5 a if the minimum utility of one interval number b is greater than the maximum utility of another interval number a the relationship can be easily observed however if there is an overlap between two interval numbers the relationship is more complicated from the prior research there should be a probability that one interval number is greater than the other yue 2013a therefore it is hard to select the best alternative if only the evidential reasoning method is employed this is also the motivation of the method proposed here incorporating topsis into evidential reasoning for group decision making 2 5 topsis method topsis is a multi criteria decision analysis method which is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the pis and the longest geometric distance from the nis which is first proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 the detailed process of using topsis method is as follows first define the decision matrix in this decision making problem as x a i k i k where i 1 2 i is a set of attributes and k 1 2 k is a set of feasible alternatives second the decision matrix x a i k i k is normalized and defined as r r i k i k third the weighted and normalized decision matrix is calculated and defined as y w i r i k i k where w w i i 1 2 i and i 1 i w i 1 fourth the pis is calculated by using p i s y 1 y 2 y i where y i 1 k k max y i k similarly the nis is calculated by using n i s y 1 y 2 y i where y i 1 k k min y i k last calculate the separation from the pis using s k i 1 i y i k y i 2 1 2 similarly calculate the separation from the nis using s k i 1 i y i k y i 2 1 2 moreover the closeness coefficient of the k t h alternative is defined as c k s k s k s k moreover the principle of this method is further discussed here because the topsis method introduced in the following section is different from the original one specifically the difference is in the way to define pis and nis as shown in fig 6 in the original topsis method the maximum value is defined as the pis while the minimum value is defined as the nis afterwards the best alternative can be selected according to the relative closeness for each alternative with respect to pis 3 use of an improved approach for group decision making 3 1 layout of the proposed methodology the proposed methodology is shown in fig 7 first the influencing factors are integrated using the evidential reasoning method from which the values of attributes with uncertainty are obtained second the weights of attributes are assigned using interval numbers and the topsis method is introduced to determine the weights of the decision makers from the compromised viewpoint third the topsis method is used twice for final decision making with crisp values though the initial motivation of this paper is to overcome the drawback that final decision can only be made by interval numbers rather than crisp values there are also other merits of the proposed methodology that can be summarized as follows first the proposed method uses crisp values to select the best alternative while the original method uses an average utility of the maximum utility and minimum utility which will be ineffective if two alternatives have an overlap between the two interval numbers yue 2011a 2013a second the proposed methodology can determine the weights of the involved organizations decision makers by using topsis approach while the original method can only define crisp value as weights where expert judgments such as analytic hierarchy process should be used saaty 1977 yang and xu 2002 third both crisp value and interval numbers can be assigned as weights of the attributes in decision making while the original approach can only deal with the crisp value 3 2 integration of influencing factors using evidential reasoning algorithm as the influencing factors may be collected as quantitative and qualitative data the different types of data should first be transformed using the rule and utility based method from the prior research yang 2001 a quantitative assessment of the j th influencing factor can be defined as s b j i k h n j γ n j i k n 1 2 n j where the h n j is the n th possible values of the j th influencing factor associated with the i th attribute and γ n j i k is the likelihood of the k th alternative to take this value moreover γ n j i k 0 and n 1 n j γ n j i k 1 for the qualitative assessment the linguistic terms used for evaluation of the attributes or influencing factors can be assumed to be equivalent to the evaluation of grades of the general criterion suppose h j is a set of evaluation grades for the j th influencing factor which can be written as h j h n j n 1 2 n j then the qualitative assessment can be represented as s b j i k h n j γ n j i k n 1 2 n j where γ n j i k 0 and n 1 n j γ n j i k 1 based on the quantitative and qualitative assessment the rule and utility based technique can be used for transforming them to the evaluation grades of the general criterion which are used for the referral values in the assessment however since this paper does not focus on the aggregation of the data and this can be automatically transformed by using the intelligent decision system ids software yang 2001 the detailed transforming techniques are not described in detail in this paper for the detailed rule and utility based method please refer to yang 2001 after integration of influencing factors using evidential reasoning method the attribute values with different alternatives can be expressed as x i k u min a i k u max a i k which can be rewritten as x i k x i k l x i k u for simplification considering that there are multiple involved organizations in the decision making process who have different information and opinions on the situation awareness the above decision matrix for different organizations can be rewritten as eq 13 where c is the number of involved organizations and x i k is the basic element in the decision matrix 13 x c x i k c l x i k c u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i x 11 c l x 11 c u x 12 c l x 12 c u x 1 k c l x 1 k c u x 21 c l x 21 c u x 22 c l x 22 c u x 2 k c l x 2 k c u x i 1 c l x i 1 c u x i 2 c l x i 2 c u x i k c l x i k c u 3 3 normalization of the decision matrix considering that the importance of the attributes may be different the weights of the attributes are defined as w w i c i 1 2 i where w i c can either be crisp value or interval numbers in this paper interval numbers represented as w i c w i c l w i c u are used then the weighted decision matrix can be obtained based on the multiplication theorem for interval values yue 2013a and the basic element y i k c y i k c l y i k c u can be achieved by using equation y i k c l w i c l x i k c l and equation y i k c u w i c u x i k c u moreover the weighted decision matrix should be normalized in two steps yue 2013a the first step is to use the lower boundary of the interval values dividing the maximum value among the sum of all the upper boundaries while the upper boundary is to divide the maximum value among the sum of all the lower boundaries the second normalization can be carried out and expressed as eq 14 14 z c z i k c l z i k c u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i z 11 c l z 11 c u z 12 c l z 12 c u z 1 k c l z 1 k c u z 21 c l x 21 c u z 22 c l z 22 c u z 2 k c l z 2 k c u z i 1 c l z i 1 c u z i 2 c l z i 2 c u z i k c l z i k c u where z i k c l y i k c l k 1 k y i k c l 2 y i k c u 2 z i k c u y i k c u k 1 k y i k c l 2 y i k c u 2 3 4 extended topsis to determine the weights of organizations the key point of determining the weights of the decision makers is the definition of ideal solutions when using the topsis method different from the original topsis method introduced previously there are two nis and one pis in the extended topsis another thing that should be mentioned is that both pis and nis are derived from all decision makers rather than all alternatives specifically as shown in fig 8 the pis is defined as the average value of each actor which is inspired from the perspective of compromise yue 2013a 2014 then the matrix for pis is defined as eq 15 which is the average value among all organizations there are two nis from the viewpoint of compromise and the first one is the minimum value among all organizations which is represented as eq 16 similarly the second nis is the maximum value among all organizations which is expressed as eq 17 the reason why the average value is assumed as pis is because the final decision should be acceptable for all involved organizations and the organizations that have similar information should be assigned more weights 15 z z i k l z i k u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i z 11 l z 11 u z 12 l z 12 u z 1 k l z 1 k u z 21 l x 21 u z 22 l z 22 u z 2

and z i k u max 1 c c z i k c u to obtain the weights of the organizations the separation between the basic element and each ideal solution including both pis and two nis are calculated yue 2013a they are expressed as eq 18 eq 19 and eq 20 respectively 18 s c i 1 i k 1 k z i k c l z i k l 2 z i k c u z i k u 2 19 s c i 1 i k 1 k z i k c l z i k l 2 z i k c u z i k u 2 20 s c i 1 i k 1 k z i k c l z i k l 2 z i k c u z i k u 2 then the relative closeness of each ideal solution can be defined as follows 21 r c min s k s k s k s k s k s k 22 r c max s k s k s k s k s k s k last the weights of the decision makers involved organizations can be calculated by normalizing the relative closeness 23 λ c λ c λ c r c c 1 c r c r c c 1 c r c by obtaining the weights of the decision makers the weighted decision matrix of each decision maker can be rewritten as eq 24 24 v c μ i k c l μ i k c u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i μ 11 c l μ 11 c u μ 12 c l μ 12 c u μ 1 k c l μ 1 k c u μ 21 c l μ 21 c u μ 22 c

handling the elements of the matrix in eq 24 should be rearranged which is shown in eq 25 this step is carried out to define the ideal solutions among all alternatives rather than all decision makers in fact the topsis used here is the original topsis method 25 v k μ i c k l μ i c k u i c d 1 d 2 d c a 1 a 2 a i μ 11 k l μ 11 k u μ 12 k l μ 12 k u μ 1 c k l μ 1 c k u μ 21 k l μ 21 k u μ 22 k l μ 22 k u μ 2 c k l μ 2 c k u μ i 1 k l μ i 1 k u μ i 2 k l μ i 2 k u μ i c k l μ i c k u then the matrix for the pis yue 2013a the maximum value among all the alternatives which is represented as θ θ i c l θ i c u and achieved by equation θ i c l max 1 k k μ i c k l and equation θ i c u max 1 k k μ i c k u the difference between the two topsis methods is that the definition of the ideal solutions is different extended topsis chooses the ideal solutions from the decision makers while this traditional topsis chooses the ideal solutions from the alternatives moreover the extended topsis define one pis and two nis while this topsis only define one pis and one nis the nis which is the minimum value of all the alternatives is represented as θ θ i c l θ i c u and it can be achieved by equation θ i c l min 1 k k μ i c k l and equation θ i c u min 1 k k μ i c k u the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of pis can be calculated by 26 s k i 1 i c 1 c μ i c k l θ i c l 2 μ i c k u θ i c u 2 and the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of nis can be calculated by 27 s k i 1 i c 1 c μ i c k l θ i c l 2 μ i c k u θ i c u 2 last the preference of each alternative can be discovered by the relative closeness which is expressed by 28 r c k s k s k s k it can be easily concluded that the greater the relative closeness the more preference of this alternative 4 an illustrative example 4 1 description of the incidental scenario the illustrative example adapted from a nuc incident occurred at the 71 black buoy in the yangtze river was caused by the main engine failure the detailed ship s particulars are as follows ship type bulk carrier ship length 98 m gross tonnage 3156 t ship draught 5 8 m since three involved organizations have different information sources in this action the collected information varies from each actor the msa and ships passing by were far from the incidental scene and they have less accurate information about the wind current failure mode recovery time and feasibility of outer limit of fairway than nuc ship however they have better information of number of traffic flow distribution of traffic flow and arrival time of tug moreover some of the information collected is incomplete owing to time pressure or the defects of the sensors which has been introduced in section 2 all the information of influencing factors for the three involved organizations is shown in table 1 and the three level decision framework for nuc ship handling is shown in fig 9 4 2 assessment on the influencing factors the rule and utility based method is used for assessment of both qualitative and quantitative data in this case study only the influencing factor of failure mode uses the qualitative data which uses four evaluation grades it can be written as h 8 h 1 8 h 2 8 h 3 8 h 4 8 d c b a where d c b a represents black out main engine failure rudder failure and rudder failure with jury rudder available respectively then the belief degree of the different failure modes can be assigned take the actor of nuc for example which has a totally belief degree of main engine failure the assessment on failure mode can be represented as s b 8 2 k h 2 8 1 however for the organizations of msa and ships passing by they can only use the statistical data for judgment and their assessments are the same and represented as s b 8 1 k s b 8 1 k h 1 8 0 08 h 2 8 0 19 h 3 8 0 68 where an ignorance degree of 0 05 exists since the evaluation grades are not the same with the referral grades of general criteria the matrix of p n i is established to transform the assessments to the referral grades finally the ids software can be used for this transforming process and the transformed result of failure mode for msa is shown in fig 10 which can be indicated as follows s b 8 1 k h 1 0 048 h 2 0 584 h 3 0 318 h 4 h 5 0 p n i 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 0 0 0 4 0 5 0 1 0 for the quantitative data each referral grade is assigned to a corresponding value shown in table 2 it should be mentioned that the assigned values vary in terms of alternatives because different alternatives have different requirements on the influencing factors and the order of the influencing factors is the same with table 1 take the current as an example a1 and a3 have the same evaluation values since they both intend to continue the voyage which have similar requirements on this influencing factor and the evaluation values can be indicated as h n 1 h 1 1 h 2 1 h 3 1 h 4 1 h 5 1 8 7 5 3 1 however a2 has higher requirement because this alternative requires that the nuc ship should well control the heading by itself while the immediately anchoring option a4 has lower requirement on this influencing factor after establishment of the evaluation values the assessment values are transformed based on the linear relationship between the nearby assigned values the ids software is also used and it can easily transform these values the transformed result of wind is shown in fig 11 4 3 evaluation of attributes using the evidential reasoning method after transforming both the qualitative and quantitative data by using the ids software the influencing factors can be integrated by using the evidential reasoning method in this process the influencing factors associated with the same decision attributes are treated equally it should be mentioned that the evaluation result differs from alternatives in terms of involved organizations decision maker which means that there are 12 3 decision maker 4 alternatives evaluation results with different values the interval numbers of the decision attributes can then be achieved by using eq 10 and eq 11 after defining the utility of each evaluation grades in this paper the utility of each grade of the reference is used yang and xu 2002 which is shown as follows then the interval numbers of the decision attribute in terms of alternatives for the involved organizations are shown in table 3 u h 1 u w o r s t 0 u h 2 u p o o r 0 35 u h 3 u a v e r a g e 0 55 u h 4 u g o o d 0 85 u h 5 u b e s t 1 it can be seen from table 3 that the interval numbers of the same alternative vary with decision makers this is caused by the asymmetric information during the cooperation between different organizations it should be confusing in decision making if the decision makers have different information the solution to this problem is to integrate this asymmetric information in a compromised way which means to assign the weights of the decision makers according to their average level of information specifically if the information of one decision maker deviates from the average information too much the weight of this decision maker is assigned less than the others and if the information of the decision maker is close to the average information the decision maker is assigned more weight this is reasonable because in the group decision making the best alternative should be acceptable by both decision makers rather than only by the decision maker who have the maximum information 4 4 acquisition of weights of decision makers as the importance of attributes is different in the decision making process the weights should be assigned before obtaining the weights of decision makers there are many methods to assign the weights however considering that the importance of the vessel condition and rescue resources is greater than the natural environment and traffic environment a simple interval value is assigned to these four attributes which is indicated as 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 2 0 3 and the weighted decision matrix is obtained moreover a second round normalization should also be carried out first the normalization is achieved by dividing the maximum attribute value of all the alternatives for different decision makers second the normalization is carried out by using eq 14 after normalization the normalized result of the weighted decision matrix is shown in table 4 the ideal solutions among all the decision makers are categorized into two types the group decision making is to find the compromised alternative that can be accepted by all involved organizations the first type assumed to be the pis and can be achieved by eq 15 are defined as the average values among all the decision makers while the nis are defined as the maximum value and minimum value which can be obtained by eq 16 and eq 17 respectively the matrixes for the ideal solutions both positive and negative are shown in table 5 afterwards the distance between the decision matrix and pis is calculated by eq 18 similarly the distance between the decision matrix and two nis can be achieved by eq 19 and eq 20 respectively last the relative importance of the decision makers is to calculate the relative closeness of the nis against the pis which are indicated as eq 21 and eq 22 and the weights of the decision makers are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the msa and ships passing by are assigned more weight than the nuc ship which is reasonable because the msa and passing ships by have more similar information however if the topsis method is assumed to have more information rather than similar information the weights of the involved organizations will be changed after normalization the decision matrix with the weights of decision makers can be achieved moreover this decision matrix can be rewritten as eq 25 the result of the transformed decision matrix with the weights of decision makers is shown in table 7 table 7 shows that the evaluation results of the alternatives varies in terms of decision makers the difference of the result is caused by two factors the first factor is the asymmetric information collected by the decision maker and the mean value of the interval numbers can be used to rank these values take a1 for example d 2 is assumed to have greater information on natural information than d 1 and d 3 moreover the second factor is represented as the spacing upper value minus lower value of the interval values in essence this factor is the uncertainty in expressing the influencing factors in decision making 4 5 group decision making with interval numbers the topsis method is introduced to integrate the information judged by different organizations in this second round topsis pis is to maximize the values among all the alternatives while the nis is to minimize the values among all the alternatives this is different from the first round topsis whose objective is to achieve compromised opinions of all the decision makers the matrix for pis and nis is shown in table 8 the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of pis is shown in table 9 by using eq 26 similarly the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of nis is achieved by using eq 27 finally the relative importance is obtained by eq 28 therefore the a2 alternative anchoring in the outer limit of the fairway is the best alternative in this action to nuc ship this alternative was also adopted in reality and the nuc ship is anchored in the outer limit of the fairway the result is reasonable because the a2 alternative has a high probability to be successfully achieved the a1 alternative though the tug can arrive in a short time will influence the passing by ships a lot the alternative a3 is not adopted because of the long distance of the anchorage which reduces the probability of the a3 alternative to be successfully achieved the alternative a4 is always the last choice because of its great influence on the passing by ships and since better options can be selected a2 a4 is not the best in this case study moreover a3 is also reasonable from the following analysis as the two decision attributes vessel condition and available rescue resources are assumed to be more important owing to the weights of these two attributes are greater than the other two attributes a2 who has a better performance on these two factors should be the best alternative for nuc ship handling specifically the available rescue resources attribute is the best among all alternatives as shown in table 4 and the vessel condition ranks second therefore this means that the weights of the attributes are also very important for the final decision making and it should be carefully handled in practice 5 discussion in the previous work yang 2001 yang and xu 2002 yang et al 2009 evidential reasoning has been proved to be a powerful tool to deal with incomplete information in decision making however the main deficiency is that the final decision will be made by using interval numbers rather than crisp values if only this method is employed therefore in this paper the topsis method is incorporated into group decision making and consequently the constraints encountered in the traditional method can be minimized with the newly proposed method in this paper only three people who represent the three involved organizations have participated in this group decision making as this paper focuses on the integration of asymmetric information among multiple organizations the integration of multiple decision makers in one organization is ignored though this is also a serious concern in the group decision making process from the literature sahin and yip 2017 xu and chen 2008 the reason of only using one decision maker for each organization is as follows first as this paper focuses on the emergency decision making which is time limited if there are too many decision makers the decision making process will cost a lot of time and cannot obtain a feasible result second for each organization there will be a commander e g in the ship is the captain who is in charge of the decision making process and the commander will take the other options into consideration and make decisions for this organization 6 conclusions the main contribution of this paper is the development of an improved multiple attribute group decision making method for nuc ship handling by incorporation of evidential reasoning and topsis the advantages of the proposed method are as follows first this method can deal with incomplete information with uncertainty second the weights of the decision makers can be automatically obtained third the weights of the attributes can not only be crisp values but also interval numbers the case study result demonstrates that the proposed method is useful for nuc ship handling with uncertain information however this paper manages to obtain the weights of the decision makers from the perspective of compromise the topsis method can be modified to obtain different weights of decision makers form other perspectives e g most accurate information therefore this method can not only be directly applied to the multiple attribute group decision making but also applied after modification according to the requirements of the decision making however it should also be mentioned that the evidential reasoning method should be used with caution if the information provided by the three organizations are totally in conflict which requires other useful information e g expert

23209,this paper proposes an improved methodology for handling ships without command by incorporating evidential reasoning and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis in the decision making of emergency responses the kernel of this method is to use evidential reasoning to integrate the influencing factors expressed by incomplete information of each of the involved organizations and to employ the topsis method to make the final decision with the asymmetric information distribution among the involved organizations a ship with main engine failure is considered as the study case to apply the proposed methodology the result demonstrates that the new method is beneficial for handling ships that are not under command keywords ships without command group decision making evidential reasoning topsis uncertainty asymmetric information 1 introduction ship safety under major accidents is the typical scenario used to determine the risk levels in maritime transportation guedes soares and teixeira 2001 however minor accidents in the propulsion system or steering gear failures will turn a ship in a not under command nuc and this may lead to a major accident as discussed in wu et al 2016 when a ship becomes nuc which is a frequently occurring incidental situation and effective handling measure is not adopted a sequence of undesired events can develop leading into major accidents such as grounding mazaheri et al 2014 eventually with bottom damage prestileo et al 2013 oil spill talley et al 2012 krohling and campanharo 2011 and collision silveira et al 2013 ulusçu et al 2009 among others from the definition of the convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs issued in 1972 nuc means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to manoeuvre as required by these rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel the definition means that the nuc ship is restricted in manoeuvrability which will cause an emergent situation in inland waterway transportation and in port approaches according to the statistical data in yangtze river which will be further introduced in the following section a nuc ship is mainly caused by rudder failure 19 main engine failure 68 and black out 8 which means the steering system propulsion system or power related systems is out of work respectively when this incident occurs in a two way traffic and only in a 300 m width channel in yangtze river the nuc ships have to handle such situations very carefully from the abovementioned statistical data there are always four options in nuc ship handling which means the key point in nuc ship handling is to select the best alternative in terms of influencing factors moreover three organizations are involved in the handling of nuc ships which are the nuc ship herself the maritime safety administration msa who is in charge of the maritime safety in yangtze river and the ships passing by in practice though the final handling of a nuc ship is carried out by the nuc herself sometimes with the help of msa the nuc ship must ask for approval of the msa before taking actions in yangtze river the main reason for this requirement is that the handling options of nuc ships will have great impact on the passing by ships in such narrow and high density waterway area even causing congestion in yangtze river zhang et al 2013 therefore the msa has to not only consider the safety of the nuc ship but also the safety of passing by ships and the efficiency of the transportation system in order to solve this problem the influencing factors should first be identified and earlier work can already contribute antao and guedes soares 2008 similarly to an intact ship the handling of a nuc ship is also influenced by wind current visibility balmat et al 2009 li et al 2014 sahin and senol 2015 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 in addition the possible condition of damaged ship will also influence the handling of nuc ships santos and guedes soares 2009 manderbacka and ruponen 2016 hashimoto et al 2017 which requires that the related subsystems should be considered from the viewpoint of a generic ship lois et al 2004 wang and foinikis 2001 the ship length is another important factor balmat et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 that should also be taken into consideration moreover traffic flow and restricted area are another two key factors wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 furthermore evaluation of the necessary available rescue resources should also be carried out the abovementioned factors are assumed to be influencing factors in this decision making problem on the other hand in terms of safety management of maritime transportation zhang et al 2013 the influencing factors are divided into four categories that can be treated as attributes in decision making specifically they are natural environment zhang et al 2013 knapp and van de velden 2011 traffic environment zhang et al 2013 2015 vessel condition balmat et al 2011 hänninen and kujala 2012 and available rescue resources montewka et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 therefore the handling of nuc ship is a typical multiple attribute decision making problem when solving traditional multiple attribute decision making problems fuzzy logic is widely used coşgun et al 2014 ung 2018 perera et al 2012 celik and akyuz 2018 beşikçi et al 2016 owing to its distinguishing features in information fusion yang and wang 2015 specifically this technique provides a tool to deal with the information with fuzziness or vagueness which always exists in nuc ship handling for example when describing the vessel condition the experts always use the linguistic terms such as worst poor average good best however it should be mentioned that fuzzy logic is hard to deal with the uncertainty caused by incompleteness or ignorance yang et al 2006 which is common in decision making for nuc control and the detailed descriptions are given in subsection 2 3 moreover a novel evidential reasoning method which intends to address uncertainties caused both by incompleteness and fuzziness has been developed yang et al 2006 evidential reasoning another widely used method in multiple attribute decision making in maritime transportation mokhtari et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yang 2001 yang et al 2009 wu et al 2017a b xi et al 2017 can be an alternative analytical tool to deal with such uncertainty the difference of fuzzy logic and evidential reasoning are as follows first in the fuzzy logic method there are overlaps in their meanings between the adjacent linguistic terms e g good and very good while in the evidential reasoning method the linguistic terms are distinctive which means there are no overlaps in the meanings of adjacent linguistic terms yang et al 2006 second the fuzzy logic can only be used to deal with the uncertainty caused by fuzziness or vagueness while the evidential reasoning can only be applied to address the problem of incompleteness or ignorance yang et al 2013 note that three combination rule of evidences are developed for evidential reasoning the first one is proposed by yang 2001 which roughly treats the uncertainty as one category in the process of synthesis yang and xu 2002 different from the first rule the second rule treats the uncertainty as two types which are the uncertainty caused by the incomplete information and the uncertainty caused by the weights of attributes yang and xu 2002 though the second rule is a special case with normalized weights which is claimed in their recent research yang et al 2006 the present paper still uses the second rule with normalized weights for simplification the problem of application of evidential reasoning in multiple attribute decision making is that the final decision is made using an interval number in the traditional evidential reasoning method after integrating the influencing variables the final utility values which are the integrated result of the alternatives are interval numbers when considering the uncertainty since two interval numbers can only be compared if they have no overlaps the integrated results of alternatives which are expressed as interval numbers are difficult to be compared the average utility seems to be a solution yang 2001 yang and xu 2002 however when comparing options one interval number in essence is greater than the other with a probability yue 2011a 2012b c 2013a which makes it hard to use traditional decision making method first in the traditional decision making process the decision matrix is described by crisp values the widely used method such as electre na et al 2017 and bayesian network wu et al 2017a b should be improved to address this problem second the traditional method can only take the vagueness into account but it is hard to consider the uncertainty caused by incompleteness therefore a better method should be further developed to overcome this drawback creating a clear decision criterion and deriving the weights by using own algorithm another problem of nuc ship handling is caused by the asymmetric information distribution between the organizations in cooperation which means that these three organizations may have different information sources or assessments on the same variable and the proposed method should be able to integrate the different sources of information therefore in order to solve these two problems in nuc ship handling this paper proposes a multiple attribute group decision making method for nuc ship handling under uncertainty and an improved method is proposed for final decision making by using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis method twice the topsis method is widely used owing to its concept of choosing the alternative by considering both the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution pis and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution nis from the literature review some novel topsis methods have been developed recently on the basis of this concept zavadskas et al 2016 behzadian et al 2012 and they can be introduced to choose the alternative with decision matrix expressed by interval numbers yue 2013a and intuitionistic fuzzy setting yue 2013b 2014 among others moreover it can also be found from the literature that topsis is also developed to obtain the weights of decision makers multiple information sources for integration different opinions or sources of information xu and da 2008 xu 2007 yue 2011a b 2012a b c in order to achieve this first this paper attempts to employ evidential reasoning for nuc ship handling under uncertainty after establishing the three level decision framework second in order to integrate the information from three different organizations the extended topsis is introduced to determine the weights of these organizations decision maker finally in order to overcome the drawback of final decision making using interval numbers topsis is twice used to select the best alternative for nuc ship handling by using crisp value the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes preliminaries on nuc ship handling including the statistical data of nuc ship handling in yangtze river from 2007 to 2012 and also some concepts and theories section 3 proposes an improved multiple attribute group decision making method by incorporating the evidential reasoning and topsis method afterwards an illustrative example is introduced to verify the proposed decision making method in section 4 discussions are carried out in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 preliminaries on nuc ship handling 2 1 statistical data in yangtze river a nuc ship results from frequently occurring incidents in the jiangsu traffic separation scheme tss waterway which is located in the downstream of yangtze river where two way traffic flow is allowed according to the statistical data of jiangsu msa which is in charge of maritime safety within a specified waterway range about 100 such incidents occurred per year from 2007 to 2012 fig 1 hence the msa has to handle a nuc ship every three days in average which is definitely a challenging work to achieve a well organized nuc ship handling many statistical data have been collected during the abovementioned period the causation factors analysis is carried out to discover the appropriate handling options in different failure modes when the nuc incidents do not occur in the fairways they may have enough time and resources which means that the handling of nuc ships in such situation can take any of the traditionally used options therefore this paper only analysed situations that occurred in the fairway in a total of 764 nuc cases the causation factors of nuc ship can be divided into three main subtypes in terms of failure modes which are main engine 68 rudder 19 and black out 8 the handling options for the nuc ships vary in terms of failure modes there are four options from the statistical data and the handling options in different failure modes are shown in fig 2 it should be mentioned that this data only considers the initial action of the nuc ship which is the most significant issue owing to time pressure for example if the nuc ships are handled by tug assistance after anchoring in the channel they are assumed to have taken the option of anchoring in the channel rather than tug assistance the description of each option is as follows tug assistance operation a1 the nuc ship is assisted and towed by tugs to continue the uncompleted task such as berthing sailing or anchoring beaching or anchoring in outer limit of the fairway a2 beaching means that the nuc ship grounds on purpose in shallow water and anchoring in the outer limit of the fairway means the nuc ship anchors in the outer limit of fairway so that it will not influence the sailing ships in the fairway anchoring in the nearby anchorage a3 the ship anchors in the nearby anchorage by using its own propulsion or tug assistance the key factor to differentiate a3 from a1 is whether the ship stopped the initial task or not the other option is immediate anchoring in the channel a4 the nuc ships grape the bottom of channel to make the ship stop immediately by adopting this option 2 2 decision making for nuc ship handling the problem of selecting the best alternative for nuc ship handling can be described as follows according to the statistical data shown in fig 2 there are four alternatives for nuc ship handling and the objective of this paper is to select the best alternative in different scenarios the influencing factors and attributes are identified in the second paragraph of the introductory section however it is very hard to define the decision makers in this problem in this paper all involved organizations which are the nuc ship itself the passing ships by and the msa are all treated as decision makers for the following two reasons first just as described in the introductory section despite the final handling is carried out by the nuc ship the msa and the ships passing by are all involved and may have different opinions about the handling of the nuc ship and their opinions should be considered in the decision making process specifically the nuc ship may always intend to take the easiest and also the safest option for herself i e immediately anchoring in the channel however the ships passing by may treat this option as the last choice because it will greatly disturb the ships passing by and they prefer the other alternatives more than this one while the msa have to consider both the safety of the nuc ship and the efficiency of traffic flow from this perspective the three involved organizations should be treated as decision makers in the nuc ship handling and in practice they are often requested for advice second the different organizations have different information sources which lead to different information contents and this should be considered and integrated in a comprehensive perspective 2 3 uncertainty in decision making uncertainty is very common in reality and it is properly and accurately modelled with probabilistic theory which is one type of uncertainty that need to be addressed however some linguistic terms e g poor good that describe the influencing factors can also be modelled in a fuzziness or vagueness framework however in this paper only the uncertainty caused by incomplete information for handling nuc ships is discussed many factors may cause the incomplete information in reality the first one discussed here is the fundamental or inherent uncertainty which is caused by the physics meaning that in reality it is very hard to describe something precisely or completely for example the description of wind scale whose value always changes from 3 beaufort scale to 4 with a probability of 0 4 while the wind may also fluctuate with a probability of 0 2 in this case the information of wind scale can only be described as 3 and 4 both with a belief degree of 0 4 while the fluctuation of the wind can be treated as uncertainty with a belief degree of 0 2 since in this case the wind scale cannot be precisely measured in this case the whole assessment on the wind scale is incomplete because 0 4 0 4 1 while the missing 0 2 is defined as degree of ignorance or uncertainty another factor that may cause incomplete information is the statistical method i e the well known statistical uncertainty for example the causation factors of nuc ship are recorded as main engine 68 rudder 19 and black out 8 while the remaining 7 100 68 19 8 7 defined as others in the statistical data should be assumed as incomplete information because no further information can be obtained from the description of others there are also other causation factors of the incomplete information such as expert judgment which will not be further discussed here it should be mentioned that since the three involved organizations may have different information on these variables this will cause the incomplete information of different organizations to be different from each other for example when describing failure mode the nuc ship can make judgments from their past experience but the msa and ships passing by cannot collect such information since they are not familiar with the nuc ship 2 4 evidential reasoning in group decision making the evidential reasoning method can be applied to a generalized three level hierarchy evaluation framework shown in fig 3 following yang and xu 2002 where the influencing factors are expressed with incomplete information some basic definitions should be first given the generalized multiple attribute decision making framework consists of a general criterion at the level for reference a number of basic attributes a a i i 1 2 i at the second level and a set of influencing factors b b j j 1 2 j at the third level w w i i 1 2 i are defined as the weights of the attributes and w w j i j 1 2 j are defined as the weights of the influencing factors where 0 w i 1 i 1 i w i 1 0 w j i 1 and j 1 j w j i 1 suppose there are n distinctive evaluation grades for the general criterion which provides a set of standards for evaluating the attributes and influencing factors the evaluation grades can be written as h h n n 1 2 n where h n is the n th evaluation grade and it is supposed that h n 1 is preferred to h n assume there are a set of alternatives m m k k 1 2 k and the influencing factor b j associated with the i th attribute whose assessment under the k th k 1 2 k alternative is represented as s b j i k h n β n j i k n 1 2 n where β n j i k 0 and n 1 n β n j i k 1 the variable β n j i k means the degree of belief the j th influencing factor under the k th alternative which is assessed by using the reference grades of h n if n 1 n β n j i k 1 the assessment is assumed to have complete information whereas the information is incomplete if n 1 n β n j i k 1 after making some basic definitions the multiple attribute group decision making can be carried out as shown in fig 4 and the detailed process is as follows first the influencing factors can be integrated by using the evidential reasoning combination rule define the e l j i as a subset of the i attribute which consists of the corresponding influencing factors then in the evidential reasoning algorithm yang and xu 2002 the remaining probability mass unassigned to individual grades after all the influencing factors in e l j i have been assessed is divided into two parts one is caused by weights which is written as m h j i the other is caused by the uncertainty of the influencing factors which is written as m h j i and the summation of the uncertainty is defined as m h j i m h j i m h j i let m n j i be the basic probability mass of the j influencing factors which represents to how many degrees this influencing factor supports the hypothesis that the criterion is assigned to the nth grade h n 1 m n j i w j i β n j i k 2 m h j i 1 w j i 3 m h j i w j i 1 n 1 n β n j i k 4 h n m n l j 1 i c l j 1 i m n l j i m n j 1 i m h l j i m n j 1 i m n l j i m h j 1 i 5 m h l j i m h l j i m h l j i 6 h m h l j 1 i c l j 1 i m h l j i m h j 1 i m h l j i m h j 1 i m h l j i m h j 1 i 7 c l j 1 i 1 s 1 n t 1 s t n m s l j i m t j 1 i 1 j 1 2 j 1 moreover after all j assessments have been integrated the uncertainty caused by the weights is reassigned to the individual grades proportionally yang and xu 2002 8 h n β n i k m n l j i 1 m h l j i n 1 2 n 9 h β h i k m n l j i 1 m h l j i second the attributes can be integrated with the same form of integration of influencing factors by using the evidential reasoning combination rule third the information of different decision makers can also be integrated with the same of integration of influencing factors by using evidential reasoning rule last the utility value is introduced for final decision making suppose u h n is the utility of the grade h n since the uncertainty still exists after the integration of the influencing factors the utility of the i th attribute associated with the k th alternative is an interval number and the maximum minimum and average utility can be defined as follows yang and xu 2002 10 u max a i k n 1 n 1 β n i k u h n β n i k β h i k u h n 11 u min a i k β 1 i k β h i k u h 1 n 2 n β n i k u h n 12 u a v g a i k u max a i k u min a i k 2 it can be observed that uncertainty still exists in this evaluation which makes the evaluation to have a maximum value and a minimum value interval number as shown in fig 5 a if the minimum utility of one interval number b is greater than the maximum utility of another interval number a the relationship can be easily observed however if there is an overlap between two interval numbers the relationship is more complicated from the prior research there should be a probability that one interval number is greater than the other yue 2013a therefore it is hard to select the best alternative if only the evidential reasoning method is employed this is also the motivation of the method proposed here incorporating topsis into evidential reasoning for group decision making 2 5 topsis method topsis is a multi criteria decision analysis method which is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the pis and the longest geometric distance from the nis which is first proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 the detailed process of using topsis method is as follows first define the decision matrix in this decision making problem as x a i k i k where i 1 2 i is a set of attributes and k 1 2 k is a set of feasible alternatives second the decision matrix x a i k i k is normalized and defined as r r i k i k third the weighted and normalized decision matrix is calculated and defined as y w i r i k i k where w w i i 1 2 i and i 1 i w i 1 fourth the pis is calculated by using p i s y 1 y 2 y i where y i 1 k k max y i k similarly the nis is calculated by using n i s y 1 y 2 y i where y i 1 k k min y i k last calculate the separation from the pis using s k i 1 i y i k y i 2 1 2 similarly calculate the separation from the nis using s k i 1 i y i k y i 2 1 2 moreover the closeness coefficient of the k t h alternative is defined as c k s k s k s k moreover the principle of this method is further discussed here because the topsis method introduced in the following section is different from the original one specifically the difference is in the way to define pis and nis as shown in fig 6 in the original topsis method the maximum value is defined as the pis while the minimum value is defined as the nis afterwards the best alternative can be selected according to the relative closeness for each alternative with respect to pis 3 use of an improved approach for group decision making 3 1 layout of the proposed methodology the proposed methodology is shown in fig 7 first the influencing factors are integrated using the evidential reasoning method from which the values of attributes with uncertainty are obtained second the weights of attributes are assigned using interval numbers and the topsis method is introduced to determine the weights of the decision makers from the compromised viewpoint third the topsis method is used twice for final decision making with crisp values though the initial motivation of this paper is to overcome the drawback that final decision can only be made by interval numbers rather than crisp values there are also other merits of the proposed methodology that can be summarized as follows first the proposed method uses crisp values to select the best alternative while the original method uses an average utility of the maximum utility and minimum utility which will be ineffective if two alternatives have an overlap between the two interval numbers yue 2011a 2013a second the proposed methodology can determine the weights of the involved organizations decision makers by using topsis approach while the original method can only define crisp value as weights where expert judgments such as analytic hierarchy process should be used saaty 1977 yang and xu 2002 third both crisp value and interval numbers can be assigned as weights of the attributes in decision making while the original approach can only deal with the crisp value 3 2 integration of influencing factors using evidential reasoning algorithm as the influencing factors may be collected as quantitative and qualitative data the different types of data should first be transformed using the rule and utility based method from the prior research yang 2001 a quantitative assessment of the j th influencing factor can be defined as s b j i k h n j γ n j i k n 1 2 n j where the h n j is the n th possible values of the j th influencing factor associated with the i th attribute and γ n j i k is the likelihood of the k th alternative to take this value moreover γ n j i k 0 and n 1 n j γ n j i k 1 for the qualitative assessment the linguistic terms used for evaluation of the attributes or influencing factors can be assumed to be equivalent to the evaluation of grades of the general criterion suppose h j is a set of evaluation grades for the j th influencing factor which can be written as h j h n j n 1 2 n j then the qualitative assessment can be represented as s b j i k h n j γ n j i k n 1 2 n j where γ n j i k 0 and n 1 n j γ n j i k 1 based on the quantitative and qualitative assessment the rule and utility based technique can be used for transforming them to the evaluation grades of the general criterion which are used for the referral values in the assessment however since this paper does not focus on the aggregation of the data and this can be automatically transformed by using the intelligent decision system ids software yang 2001 the detailed transforming techniques are not described in detail in this paper for the detailed rule and utility based method please refer to yang 2001 after integration of influencing factors using evidential reasoning method the attribute values with different alternatives can be expressed as x i k u min a i k u max a i k which can be rewritten as x i k x i k l x i k u for simplification considering that there are multiple involved organizations in the decision making process who have different information and opinions on the situation awareness the above decision matrix for different organizations can be rewritten as eq 13 where c is the number of involved organizations and x i k is the basic element in the decision matrix 13 x c x i k c l x i k c u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i x 11 c l x 11 c u x 12 c l x 12 c u x 1 k c l x 1 k c u x 21 c l x 21 c u x 22 c l x 22 c u x 2 k c l x 2 k c u x i 1 c l x i 1 c u x i 2 c l x i 2 c u x i k c l x i k c u 3 3 normalization of the decision matrix considering that the importance of the attributes may be different the weights of the attributes are defined as w w i c i 1 2 i where w i c can either be crisp value or interval numbers in this paper interval numbers represented as w i c w i c l w i c u are used then the weighted decision matrix can be obtained based on the multiplication theorem for interval values yue 2013a and the basic element y i k c y i k c l y i k c u can be achieved by using equation y i k c l w i c l x i k c l and equation y i k c u w i c u x i k c u moreover the weighted decision matrix should be normalized in two steps yue 2013a the first step is to use the lower boundary of the interval values dividing the maximum value among the sum of all the upper boundaries while the upper boundary is to divide the maximum value among the sum of all the lower boundaries the second normalization can be carried out and expressed as eq 14 14 z c z i k c l z i k c u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i z 11 c l z 11 c u z 12 c l z 12 c u z 1 k c l z 1 k c u z 21 c l x 21 c u z 22 c l z 22 c u z 2 k c l z 2 k c u z i 1 c l z i 1 c u z i 2 c l z i 2 c u z i k c l z i k c u where z i k c l y i k c l k 1 k y i k c l 2 y i k c u 2 z i k c u y i k c u k 1 k y i k c l 2 y i k c u 2 3 4 extended topsis to determine the weights of organizations the key point of determining the weights of the decision makers is the definition of ideal solutions when using the topsis method different from the original topsis method introduced previously there are two nis and one pis in the extended topsis another thing that should be mentioned is that both pis and nis are derived from all decision makers rather than all alternatives specifically as shown in fig 8 the pis is defined as the average value of each actor which is inspired from the perspective of compromise yue 2013a 2014 then the matrix for pis is defined as eq 15 which is the average value among all organizations there are two nis from the viewpoint of compromise and the first one is the minimum value among all organizations which is represented as eq 16 similarly the second nis is the maximum value among all organizations which is expressed as eq 17 the reason why the average value is assumed as pis is because the final decision should be acceptable for all involved organizations and the organizations that have similar information should be assigned more weights 15 z z i k l z i k u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i z 11 l z 11 u z 12 l z 12 u z 1 k l z 1 k u z 21 l x 21 u z 22 l z 22 u z 2

and z i k u max 1 c c z i k c u to obtain the weights of the organizations the separation between the basic element and each ideal solution including both pis and two nis are calculated yue 2013a they are expressed as eq 18 eq 19 and eq 20 respectively 18 s c i 1 i k 1 k z i k c l z i k l 2 z i k c u z i k u 2 19 s c i 1 i k 1 k z i k c l z i k l 2 z i k c u z i k u 2 20 s c i 1 i k 1 k z i k c l z i k l 2 z i k c u z i k u 2 then the relative closeness of each ideal solution can be defined as follows 21 r c min s k s k s k s k s k s k 22 r c max s k s k s k s k s k s k last the weights of the decision makers involved organizations can be calculated by normalizing the relative closeness 23 λ c λ c λ c r c c 1 c r c r c c 1 c r c by obtaining the weights of the decision makers the weighted decision matrix of each decision maker can be rewritten as eq 24 24 v c μ i k c l μ i k c u i k m 1 m 2 m k a 1 a 2 a i μ 11 c l μ 11 c u μ 12 c l μ 12 c u μ 1 k c l μ 1 k c u μ 21 c l μ 21 c u μ 22 c

handling the elements of the matrix in eq 24 should be rearranged which is shown in eq 25 this step is carried out to define the ideal solutions among all alternatives rather than all decision makers in fact the topsis used here is the original topsis method 25 v k μ i c k l μ i c k u i c d 1 d 2 d c a 1 a 2 a i μ 11 k l μ 11 k u μ 12 k l μ 12 k u μ 1 c k l μ 1 c k u μ 21 k l μ 21 k u μ 22 k l μ 22 k u μ 2 c k l μ 2 c k u μ i 1 k l μ i 1 k u μ i 2 k l μ i 2 k u μ i c k l μ i c k u then the matrix for the pis yue 2013a the maximum value among all the alternatives which is represented as θ θ i c l θ i c u and achieved by equation θ i c l max 1 k k μ i c k l and equation θ i c u max 1 k k μ i c k u the difference between the two topsis methods is that the definition of the ideal solutions is different extended topsis chooses the ideal solutions from the decision makers while this traditional topsis chooses the ideal solutions from the alternatives moreover the extended topsis define one pis and two nis while this topsis only define one pis and one nis the nis which is the minimum value of all the alternatives is represented as θ θ i c l θ i c u and it can be achieved by equation θ i c l min 1 k k μ i c k l and equation θ i c u min 1 k k μ i c k u the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of pis can be calculated by 26 s k i 1 i c 1 c μ i c k l θ i c l 2 μ i c k u θ i c u 2 and the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of nis can be calculated by 27 s k i 1 i c 1 c μ i c k l θ i c l 2 μ i c k u θ i c u 2 last the preference of each alternative can be discovered by the relative closeness which is expressed by 28 r c k s k s k s k it can be easily concluded that the greater the relative closeness the more preference of this alternative 4 an illustrative example 4 1 description of the incidental scenario the illustrative example adapted from a nuc incident occurred at the 71 black buoy in the yangtze river was caused by the main engine failure the detailed ship s particulars are as follows ship type bulk carrier ship length 98 m gross tonnage 3156 t ship draught 5 8 m since three involved organizations have different information sources in this action the collected information varies from each actor the msa and ships passing by were far from the incidental scene and they have less accurate information about the wind current failure mode recovery time and feasibility of outer limit of fairway than nuc ship however they have better information of number of traffic flow distribution of traffic flow and arrival time of tug moreover some of the information collected is incomplete owing to time pressure or the defects of the sensors which has been introduced in section 2 all the information of influencing factors for the three involved organizations is shown in table 1 and the three level decision framework for nuc ship handling is shown in fig 9 4 2 assessment on the influencing factors the rule and utility based method is used for assessment of both qualitative and quantitative data in this case study only the influencing factor of failure mode uses the qualitative data which uses four evaluation grades it can be written as h 8 h 1 8 h 2 8 h 3 8 h 4 8 d c b a where d c b a represents black out main engine failure rudder failure and rudder failure with jury rudder available respectively then the belief degree of the different failure modes can be assigned take the actor of nuc for example which has a totally belief degree of main engine failure the assessment on failure mode can be represented as s b 8 2 k h 2 8 1 however for the organizations of msa and ships passing by they can only use the statistical data for judgment and their assessments are the same and represented as s b 8 1 k s b 8 1 k h 1 8 0 08 h 2 8 0 19 h 3 8 0 68 where an ignorance degree of 0 05 exists since the evaluation grades are not the same with the referral grades of general criteria the matrix of p n i is established to transform the assessments to the referral grades finally the ids software can be used for this transforming process and the transformed result of failure mode for msa is shown in fig 10 which can be indicated as follows s b 8 1 k h 1 0 048 h 2 0 584 h 3 0 318 h 4 h 5 0 p n i 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 0 0 0 4 0 5 0 1 0 for the quantitative data each referral grade is assigned to a corresponding value shown in table 2 it should be mentioned that the assigned values vary in terms of alternatives because different alternatives have different requirements on the influencing factors and the order of the influencing factors is the same with table 1 take the current as an example a1 and a3 have the same evaluation values since they both intend to continue the voyage which have similar requirements on this influencing factor and the evaluation values can be indicated as h n 1 h 1 1 h 2 1 h 3 1 h 4 1 h 5 1 8 7 5 3 1 however a2 has higher requirement because this alternative requires that the nuc ship should well control the heading by itself while the immediately anchoring option a4 has lower requirement on this influencing factor after establishment of the evaluation values the assessment values are transformed based on the linear relationship between the nearby assigned values the ids software is also used and it can easily transform these values the transformed result of wind is shown in fig 11 4 3 evaluation of attributes using the evidential reasoning method after transforming both the qualitative and quantitative data by using the ids software the influencing factors can be integrated by using the evidential reasoning method in this process the influencing factors associated with the same decision attributes are treated equally it should be mentioned that the evaluation result differs from alternatives in terms of involved organizations decision maker which means that there are 12 3 decision maker 4 alternatives evaluation results with different values the interval numbers of the decision attributes can then be achieved by using eq 10 and eq 11 after defining the utility of each evaluation grades in this paper the utility of each grade of the reference is used yang and xu 2002 which is shown as follows then the interval numbers of the decision attribute in terms of alternatives for the involved organizations are shown in table 3 u h 1 u w o r s t 0 u h 2 u p o o r 0 35 u h 3 u a v e r a g e 0 55 u h 4 u g o o d 0 85 u h 5 u b e s t 1 it can be seen from table 3 that the interval numbers of the same alternative vary with decision makers this is caused by the asymmetric information during the cooperation between different organizations it should be confusing in decision making if the decision makers have different information the solution to this problem is to integrate this asymmetric information in a compromised way which means to assign the weights of the decision makers according to their average level of information specifically if the information of one decision maker deviates from the average information too much the weight of this decision maker is assigned less than the others and if the information of the decision maker is close to the average information the decision maker is assigned more weight this is reasonable because in the group decision making the best alternative should be acceptable by both decision makers rather than only by the decision maker who have the maximum information 4 4 acquisition of weights of decision makers as the importance of attributes is different in the decision making process the weights should be assigned before obtaining the weights of decision makers there are many methods to assign the weights however considering that the importance of the vessel condition and rescue resources is greater than the natural environment and traffic environment a simple interval value is assigned to these four attributes which is indicated as 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 2 0 3 and the weighted decision matrix is obtained moreover a second round normalization should also be carried out first the normalization is achieved by dividing the maximum attribute value of all the alternatives for different decision makers second the normalization is carried out by using eq 14 after normalization the normalized result of the weighted decision matrix is shown in table 4 the ideal solutions among all the decision makers are categorized into two types the group decision making is to find the compromised alternative that can be accepted by all involved organizations the first type assumed to be the pis and can be achieved by eq 15 are defined as the average values among all the decision makers while the nis are defined as the maximum value and minimum value which can be obtained by eq 16 and eq 17 respectively the matrixes for the ideal solutions both positive and negative are shown in table 5 afterwards the distance between the decision matrix and pis is calculated by eq 18 similarly the distance between the decision matrix and two nis can be achieved by eq 19 and eq 20 respectively last the relative importance of the decision makers is to calculate the relative closeness of the nis against the pis which are indicated as eq 21 and eq 22 and the weights of the decision makers are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the msa and ships passing by are assigned more weight than the nuc ship which is reasonable because the msa and passing ships by have more similar information however if the topsis method is assumed to have more information rather than similar information the weights of the involved organizations will be changed after normalization the decision matrix with the weights of decision makers can be achieved moreover this decision matrix can be rewritten as eq 25 the result of the transformed decision matrix with the weights of decision makers is shown in table 7 table 7 shows that the evaluation results of the alternatives varies in terms of decision makers the difference of the result is caused by two factors the first factor is the asymmetric information collected by the decision maker and the mean value of the interval numbers can be used to rank these values take a1 for example d 2 is assumed to have greater information on natural information than d 1 and d 3 moreover the second factor is represented as the spacing upper value minus lower value of the interval values in essence this factor is the uncertainty in expressing the influencing factors in decision making 4 5 group decision making with interval numbers the topsis method is introduced to integrate the information judged by different organizations in this second round topsis pis is to maximize the values among all the alternatives while the nis is to minimize the values among all the alternatives this is different from the first round topsis whose objective is to achieve compromised opinions of all the decision makers the matrix for pis and nis is shown in table 8 the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of pis is shown in table 9 by using eq 26 similarly the distance between the decision matrix and the matrix of nis is achieved by using eq 27 finally the relative importance is obtained by eq 28 therefore the a2 alternative anchoring in the outer limit of the fairway is the best alternative in this action to nuc ship this alternative was also adopted in reality and the nuc ship is anchored in the outer limit of the fairway the result is reasonable because the a2 alternative has a high probability to be successfully achieved the a1 alternative though the tug can arrive in a short time will influence the passing by ships a lot the alternative a3 is not adopted because of the long distance of the anchorage which reduces the probability of the a3 alternative to be successfully achieved the alternative a4 is always the last choice because of its great influence on the passing by ships and since better options can be selected a2 a4 is not the best in this case study moreover a3 is also reasonable from the following analysis as the two decision attributes vessel condition and available rescue resources are assumed to be more important owing to the weights of these two attributes are greater than the other two attributes a2 who has a better performance on these two factors should be the best alternative for nuc ship handling specifically the available rescue resources attribute is the best among all alternatives as shown in table 4 and the vessel condition ranks second therefore this means that the weights of the attributes are also very important for the final decision making and it should be carefully handled in practice 5 discussion in the previous work yang 2001 yang and xu 2002 yang et al 2009 evidential reasoning has been proved to be a powerful tool to deal with incomplete information in decision making however the main deficiency is that the final decision will be made by using interval numbers rather than crisp values if only this method is employed therefore in this paper the topsis method is incorporated into group decision making and consequently the constraints encountered in the traditional method can be minimized with the newly proposed method in this paper only three people who represent the three involved organizations have participated in this group decision making as this paper focuses on the integration of asymmetric information among multiple organizations the integration of multiple decision makers in one organization is ignored though this is also a serious concern in the group decision making process from the literature sahin and yip 2017 xu and chen 2008 the reason of only using one decision maker for each organization is as follows first as this paper focuses on the emergency decision making which is time limited if there are too many decision makers the decision making process will cost a lot of time and cannot obtain a feasible result second for each organization there will be a commander e g in the ship is the captain who is in charge of the decision making process and the commander will take the other options into consideration and make decisions for this organization 6 conclusions the main contribution of this paper is the development of an improved multiple attribute group decision making method for nuc ship handling by incorporation of evidential reasoning and topsis the advantages of the proposed method are as follows first this method can deal with incomplete information with uncertainty second the weights of the decision makers can be automatically obtained third the weights of the attributes can not only be crisp values but also interval numbers the case study result demonstrates that the proposed method is useful for nuc ship handling with uncertain information however this paper manages to obtain the weights of the decision makers from the perspective of compromise the topsis method can be modified to obtain different weights of decision makers form other perspectives e g most accurate information therefore this method can not only be directly applied to the multiple attribute group decision making but also applied after modification according to the requirements of the decision making however it should also be mentioned that the evidential reasoning method should be used with caution if the information provided by the three organizations are totally in conflict which requires other useful information e g expert
