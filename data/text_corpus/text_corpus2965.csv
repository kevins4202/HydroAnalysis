14825,trace levels of antibiotics were frequently found in drinking water leading a growing concern that drinking water is an important exposure source to antibiotics in humans in this study we investigated antibiotics in tap water and well water in two rural residential areas in eastern china to assess the related human health exposure risks in drinking water twenty seven antibiotics were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms the average daily dose add and the health risk quotient hrq for exposure to antibiotics in humans were evaluated using 10000 times of monte carlo simulations ten antibiotics were detected in drinking water samples with the maximum concentrations of antibiotic mixture of 8 29 ng l in tap water and 2 95 ng l in well water respectively macrolides and sulfonamides were the predominant contaminants and showed the seasonality azithromycin had the highest detection frequencies 79 71 100 followed by roxithromycin 25 71 100 and erythromycin 21 43 86 96 the estimated add and hrq for human exposure to antibiotic mixture through drinking water was less than 0 01 μg kg day and 0 01 respectively which varied over sites water types seasons and sex ingestion route was more important than dermal contact route 10 6 to 10 4 μg kg day magnitude vs 10 11 to 10 8 μg kg day magnitude macrolides also contributed mainly to health exposure risks to antibiotics through drinking water whose hrq accounted for 46 to 67 of the total hrqs although the individual antibiotic and their combined effects contributed to acceptable health risks for human the long term exposure patterns to low dose antibiotics in drinking water should not be ignored keywords antibiotics seasonal variation health risk drinking water eastern china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are a group of intrinsically bio active chemicals used in humans and animals for disease treatment prevention and growth promotion ferri et al 2017 which have contributed to the aquatic environment contaminations worldwide in recent years due to continuous and extensive discharges from municipal hospital agricultural and industrial effluents carvalho and santos 2016 these contaminations induce environmental antibiotic resistant bacteria earb and then promote the horizontal gene transfer hgt between earb and pathogenic antibiotic resistance parb marti et al 2014 moreover direct intake or inadvertent exposure to antibiotics may disturb the human intestinal microbiome and develop the antibiotic resistance abr even accumulate toxicity in target organs and lead to immune or metabolic related diseases posing serious public health risks liu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 tadić et al 2021 in the past several decades multiple antibiotics have been generally monitored in major chinese surface water basins li et al 2018 dujuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 it deserves our attention that antibiotic residues were also detected in some chinese urban drinking water due to their incomplete removal by conventional technologies in drinking water treatment plants dwtps he et al 2022 wang et al 2016 feng et al 2020 ben et al 2020 moreover the limited infrastructures lead to a poorer treatment for drinking water in the majority of rural areas meng et al 2021 well water is an important source of drinking water supply in rural china and is usually used as raw water without any treatment compared with surface water there is a relatively higher degree of protection for groundwater but it is difficult to recover once contaminated li et al 2020 although most of these pollutants are present at the level of nanograms liter ng l some antibiotics like sulfonamides and macrolides may persist for a long time in aquatic environment larsson 2014 so far china has not yet implemented the standard limits for antibiotics in drinking water therefore there is a growing concern that drinking water might be an important exposure source to antibiotics inducing potential health risks it is supposed that consuming or contacting different types of drinking water may contribute to different exposure profiles of antibiotics risk assessment has been widely applied for identify the influences and hazards of pollutants in humans based on the intensity and duration of exposure to some pollutants in environmental media the uncertainty in the process of risk assessment can be addressed by a method of monte carlo simulation chowdhury et al 2009 in general humans are mainly exposed to antibiotics in drinking water via two routes direct ingestion and dermal contact only a few studies have focused on human exposure to antibiotics via drinking water and reported that the estimated exposure level ranged from ng kg day to μg kg day he et al 2022 wang et al 2016 feng et al 2020 ben et al 2020 meng et al 2021 but ignored the relevant risks via dermal absorption so the actual human exposure and health risk of antibiotic residues in drinking water might have been underestimated eastern china is one of the most economically developed regions in china with dense populations intensive livestock breeding industries and extensive antibiotic use based on market survey and mathematical modeling it has been revealed that the emission density of antibiotics in river basins in eastern china was 6 fold higher than that in western china zhang et al 2015 which made this region become the hot spot of controlling antibiotic use and abr cheng et al 2013 chen et al 2020 in this study two rural residential areas were selected from zhejiang province site a and jiangsu province site b located in yangtze river delta of eastern china twenty seven antibiotics were monitored in all sampling sites over different seasons this study attempted to offer some evidence for better understanding the occurrence seasonal variation and human exposure risk of antibiotics in drinking water in rural eastern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and drinking water sampling this study is a part of the research item impacts of antibiotic residues in the environment on bacterial resistance and human health in eastern china cai et al 2022 sampling site a and b were located in the rural areas of zhejiang and jiangsu province respectively in yangtze river delta of eastern china both sites were economically comparable and differences between them were antibiotic use patterns poultry and aquaculture practices and local regulations they were selected to facilitate the use of existing epidemiology study population cohorts to explore the potential long term effects of antibiotic use as well as exposure to environmental antibiotic residues and abr detailed information on study sites has been described in previous studies cai et al 2022 xu et al 2022 drinking and cooking water for residents is mostly via tap water in site a while via tap and well water in site b in addition given that the relatively low detection rates and concentrations of antibiotics in bottled water and barreled water the concentrations were less than 0 001 ng l wang et al 2016 and low consumption rate of these two kinds of drinking water less than 1 of residents tap water and well water samples were collected as drinking water for this study tap water in the communities of both sites is supplied by the local centralized water plants wp a in site a wp b in site b the raw water is derived from an artificial reservoir in the west of the city for wp a while yangtze river for wp b the water supply capacity of wp a and wp b is 182 thousand m3 d and 200 thousand m3 d respectively both occupy methods of chlorine dioxide disinfection and ozone activated carbon depth treatment to treat water with the automation control at present the factory water reaches the standard of direct drinking water and all water quality indicators are fully in line with the standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 national health commission of the people s republic of china 2022 the detailed information of quality inspection report of effluent water in wp a and wp b during the sampling periods were shown in table s1 ten households per site were selected randomly as the sampling sites using the global position system gps fig 1 tap water and well water samples from the nearest location were collected from each household two sampling campaigns were carried out for over seven consecutive days in august 2020 summer and january 2021 winter respectively which are considered as wet and dry seasons in the study areas tap water samples in site a are grouped as at s summer and at w winter while tap and well water samples in site b are grouped as bt s summer and bt w winter as well as bw s summer and bw w winter respectively a bottle of 2 liter 2l drinking water sample was collected around 9 a m to 10 a m before each collection the sampling bottles were cleaned at least three times by flowing tap water or well water to avoid possible contamination during sampling wang et al 2016 all samples were kept in 20 and pre treated within two days a total of 388 drinking water samples including 278 tap water and 110 well water samples were collected while 4 water samples were lost in the progress of sampling 2 2 study subjects in this study one rural community per study site was randomly sampled from the population cohorts previously established in zhejiang and jiangsu province all adults living in this community for more than 6 months and having no plan to move out were eligible for recruitment cai et al 2022 those with serious psychiatric disorders or body diseases such as tumors or unable to move conveniently were excluded the sample size of subjects was calculated according to the method of the cross sectional study the proportion of antibiotic use in clinic was set as p 25 and the other parameters were set as α 0 05 d 0 1p respectively it was estimated that a total of 1200 subjects were required n z 1 α 2 d 2 p 1 p 400 1 p p p 25 α 0 05 d 0 1 p in fact a total of 1521 adults were enrolled in this study each subject was required to complete a questionnaire interview and have a physical examination finally we assessed the health exposure risk to antibiotics in drinking water based on data of the 1447 adults with complete information of questionnaires and the response rate was 95 1 written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the data collection this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of fudan university school of public health number 2019 03 0733 date 2019 03 18 a flow chart of this study is presented in figure s1 2 3 selection and analysis for antibiotics evidence suggests that antibiotics mainly macrolides quinolones and sulfonamides have been frequently detected in samples of livestock and poultry products aquatic products vegetables and drinking water wang et al 2017 lyu et al 2020 the results of biological surveillance using urine and fecal samples further confirmed that children pregnant women and other populations are widely exposed to the risk of multiple antibiotics especially veterinary antibiotics such as enrofloxacin and florfenicol wang et al 2018 2017 2021 as a result based on the detection frequencies of antibiotics in drinking water in previous studies wang et al 2016 lyu et al 2020 and the categories detected before in food samples wang et al 2017 and human urines samples wang et al 2018 2017 2021 a total of 27 antibiotics of 5 categories were selected for analysis including four tetracyclines tetracycline oxytetracycline chlortetracycline and doxycycline eight fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin ofloxacin norfloxacin pefloxacin enrofloxacin danofloxacin difloxacin and lomefloxacin six macrolides azithromycin roxithromycin clarithromycin erythromycin tilmicosin and spiramycin six sulfonamides and their metabolites trimethoprim sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine acetylated sulfamethoxazole and acetylated sulfamethazine and three phenicols chloramphenicol thiamphenicol and florfenicol according to the related management requirements zhejiang commission of health 2022 jiangsu commission of health 2022 ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2022 these 27 antibiotics were further categorized into four human antibiotics exclusively used in human has six veterinary antibiotics exclusively used in animals vas and seventeen human veterinary antibiotics used in both human and animals h vas a total of 6 isotopically labeled internal standards is were used for the quantification of target antibiotics a full list of categories abbreviation usage and is for each antibiotic is provided in table s2 a method of ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms was occupied to measure 27 antibiotics in 388 drinking water samples zang et al 2023 twenty seven antibiotic standard materials and 6 isotopically labeled internal standards is from dr ehrenstorfer augsburg germany were used after 200 ml water were added by 6 isotopically labeled antibiotics and adjusted to ph 6 5 8 5 with formic acid water samples were passed through 3 ml solid phase extraction spe cartridges packed with 60 mg of hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb resin at a flow rate of less than 5 ml min the hlb cartridges were preconditioned with 2 ml methanol and 2 ml of pure water after extraction the cartridge was washed with 2 ml pure water and then vacuumed for 30 minutes the retained antibiotics on the spe cartridge were eluted with 4 ml of methanol the eluate was concentrated to dryness at 40 c with a weak nitrogen flow the residue was reconstituted in 0 5 ml of 20 methanol water solution for uplc ms ms analysis the best separation and organic purge were achieved using 2 3 methanol acetonitrile mobile phase a and 0 2 formic acid water mobile phase b strong and weak needle washes were selected to compliment the system the injection volume was 10 μl via a partial loop injection the best results in terms of system pressure peak separation and peak shape were determined at 0 35 ml min the linear elution program of a for 27 antibiotics was as follows from 0 to 1 0 min 10 a from 1 0 to 7 0 min increased to 98 a from 7 0 to 9 5 min 98 a 9 5 9 8 min decreased to 10 a 9 8 11 5 min 10 a twenty four antibiotics were measured in positive ion mode and 3 phenicols were measured in negative ion mode nitrogen was used as the nebulising and desolvation gas and argon as the collision gas the method detection limits mdls ranged from 0 004 to 0 296 ng l the recoveries of 27 antibiotics varied between 70 0 and 120 8 table s3 no interference was found in field or solvent blanks details on the analysis methods for 27 antibiotics are shown in supplementary materials 2 4

low medium and high health risk respectively li et al 2014 2 6 statistical analysis according to the principle of maximum risk control the maximum detection concentration of each antibiotic was assumed as the contamination level in each drinking water type in the prediction of human exposure so as to avoid possible underestimation feng et al 2020 the detection frequencies and percentile contents of 27 antibiotics in drinking water were described separately according to study sites water types and sampling seasons the adds and the hrqs of detected antibiotics were also respectively provided in males and females according to the site and sex specific exposure parameters considering the uncertainties of the variation in the model parameters of health risk assessments a probabilistic exposure assessment based on 10000 times of monte carlo simulations was performed by the software crystal ball 11 1 oracle inc usa thomaidi et al 2017 chi square test and wilcoxon test were respectively used to examine the seasonal variations in detection frequencies and the residual contents of antibiotics wilcoxon test was occupied to evaluate the sex differences in the exposure risk to antibiotics through tap water all analyses were performed using r program version 4 0 4 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria the level of statistical significance was defined as α 0 05 of two side probability 3 results 3 1 occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of antibiotics in drinking water 3 1 1 occurrence a total of 10 out of 27 antibiotics were detected in the drinking water samples including five macrolides three sulfonamides one phenicols and one fluoroquinolones with a sum of residual concentration for the antibiotic mixture ranged from not detected nd to 8 29 ng l in tap water and ranged from nd to 2 95 ng l in well water respectively at least one targeted antibiotic was detected in 44 29 to 100 samples in study sites overall detection frequency and concentration range for antibiotics in each sampling groups are demonstrated at fig 2 and in table 1 in general macrolides and sulfonamides were the predominant contaminations azithromycin showed the highest detection frequencies 79 71 100 in drinking water samples from all study sites followed by roxithromycin 25 71 100 and erythromycin 21 43 86 96 sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine and their acetylated metabolites as well as thiamphenicol were also frequently detected in drinking water with detection frequencies ranged from 20 29 to 40 58 the highest detection concentration of 2 ng l was seen for 6 out of 10 detected antibiotics with the maximum concentration reaching 6 59 ng l for tilmicosin followed by 3 99 ng l for azithromycin fig 2 compared with the has and h vas the vas showed lower detection frequency among which thiamphenicol was the relative frequently detected vas table 1 3 1 2 spatiotemporal variation there was no significant difference in antibiotic residues between all samples in the same sample group over seven consecutive days p 0 05 noticeable seasonality was observed for all drinking water samples p 0 05 spatiotemporal trends of average antibiotic concentrations classified into detected individual antibiotic category and usage of antibiotic are presented at fig 3 winter tap water in site a at w showed the highest overall concentration as up to 1 81 ng l mainly due to the contributions of macrolides and sulfonamides fig 3a and b macrolides were the most prevalent antibiotics detected in summer and their overall average concentrations ranged from 0 49 to 1 81 ng l among which bt s showed most erythromycin in particular was seen only in summer with the highest detection frequency of 86 96 and the average concentration of 0 77 ng l seen in bt s azithromycin were detectable in all summer samples in site b bt s and bw s with the average concentration of 0 89 ng l and 1 03 ng l respectively and in approximately 80 of samples in at w with the average concentration of 1 04 ng l roxithromycin was also monitored in all samples in bt s with a lower average level of 0 15 ng l and presented the comparable level in the winter samples bt w clarithromycin was only detected in fewer than 20 of summer tap water samples in site a at s and at a trace level average concentration 0 07 ng l regardless of sporadic detection tilmicosin presented consistently in two sampling campaigns in site a at s and at w noticeable seasonality was observed for sulfonamides and phenicols including sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine and their acetylated metabolites as well as thiamphenicol which were only presented in winter and showed the highest overall average concentration of 0 62 ng l in at w as the unique fluoroquinolones detected danofloxacin was found in 90 74 of samples in bw s fig 3a and b in each sampling season similar antibiotics were found consistently across tap and well water in site b but the corresponding detection frequencies and concentrations were not comparable in winter samples for example azithromycin was detected at an average level of 0 17 ng l in bt w nearly 17 fold higher than that in bw w 0 01 ng l p 0 001 table 1 distinctive antibiotic usage patterns were found in the two sites fig 3c although the has accounted for around half of detected antibiotics in each sample group the overall average concentration of has was higher in winter than that in summer in site a while showed the adverse trends in site b 3 2 risk assessment for human exposure to antibiotic residues in drinking water 3 2 1 characteristics and water use habits of study subjects characteristics and water use habits for subjects have been performed subdivided by site and sex table 2 the mean age was 61 21 12 99 years for 677 subjects in site a and 63 74 12 52 years for 770 subjects in site b respectively the proportion of males was higher in site a n 313 46 2 than that in site b n 314 40 8 water ingestion rate varied considerably across study sites sex and seasons p 0 001 subjects drunk more water in summer than in winter with the mean of ingr ranging from 1 69 0 49 l day to 2 43 0 76 l day in summer and 1 38 0 33 l day to 1 87 0 49 l day in winter respectively 3 2 2 estimates of average daily dose add μg kg day adds for residual antibiotics through drinking water were assessed individually in different exposure scenarios figs 4 and 5 based on 10000 times of monte carlo simulations detailed parameters used for monte carlo simulations were shown in table s4 and table s5 the probability distributions indicated that the estimated add for human exposure to a mixture of antibiotic residues through drinking water was less than 0 01 μg kg day and varied by sites water types seasons and sex p 0 001 fig 4 and table s6 in general males showed higher add levels compared to females in all scenarios as a result of higher ingr in males than females which mainly due to the contributions of ingestion exposure route adding from 10 6 to 10 4 μg kg day magnitude tables s7 instead of dermal contact route addder from 10 11 to 10 8 μg kg day magnitude tables s7 consistent with the residual levels of antibiotics in drinking water samples the subjects in site a were exposed to significantly less dose of antibiotics in summer than in winter p 0 001 while the subjects in site b were exposed more dose in summer p 0 001 it thus appeared that males were exposed most based on at w scenario with the add for 95 males was less than 7 67 10 4 μg kg day fig 4 in details the estimated adds for individual antibiotic residue in drinking water and comparisons between different scenarios were presented at fig 5 subjects were most frequently exposed to azithromycin with the median add of 1 12 10 4 μg kg day highest for males on at w scenario the exposure levels of both roxithromycin and erythromycin were highest in males on bt s scenario and the median add was 3 34 10 5 μg kg day and 1 10 10 4 μg kg day respectively 3 2 3 estimates of health risk quotient hrq hrqs from residual antibiotics through drinking water were assessed individually in different exposure scenarios figs 6 and 7 compared with subjects on other scenarios both males and females experienced a higher exposure risk based on at s scenario with the average hrqs of 5 35 10 4 for males and 4 47 10 4 for females respectively table s8 the macrolides contributed mainly to the health risk hrq for roxithromycin and tilmicosin accounted for approximately half 48 vs 46 of the total hrqs on at s and at w scenario respectively hrq for erythromycin accounted for 57 and 53 of the total hrqs on bt s and bw s scenario and roxithromycin accounted for 61 and 67 of the total hrqs on bt w and bw w scenario 4 discussions 4 1 occurrence and season variation of antibiotics in tap water concerns have been raised about antibiotic residues at trace levels ng l which have been frequently detected in drinking water compared with a short term consumption to high level antibiotics used for clinical treatment humans are more susceptible to a long term but low level exposure mode in daily life which might lead to potential health risks in this study conducted in two rural residential areas of eastern china from 2020 to 2021 of twenty seven selected antibiotics five macrolides three sulfonamides one phenicols and one fluoroquinolones were detected in drinking water samples with a sum of residual concentrations for the antibiotic mixture ranged from not detected nd to 8 29 ng l in tap water and ranged from nd to 2 95 ng l in well water respectively our results were much lower than those in major drinking water sources in eastern china with the residual levels ranged from nd to 90 10 ng l in nanjing liu et al 2020 from nd to 229 14 ng l in shanghai cui et al 2018 and from 19 68 ng l to 497 00 ng l in the reservoir nearby yangtze river hu et al 2021 respectively a higher level of antibiotic residues with a range of nd to 368 21 ng l was also monitored in tap water in rural southern china meng et al 2021 however there is no antibiotic limit in the current chinese standards for drinking water ministry of health of the people s republic of china standardization administration of china 2022 generally the occurrence of antibiotic residues in drinking water primarily results from the excretions following their applications as anti infection medicines or veterinary drugs and the related removal technologies especially in the circumstances of dense population and intensive breeding industry li et al 2016 similar to the results in our study macrolides and sulfonamides have been frequently detected in chinese drinking water sources feng et al 2020 liu et al 2020 due to their considerable consumption in china and well persistence in the environment yuan et al 2022 huang et al 2022 a recent study estimated the average consumption level of two macrolides azithromycin and roxithromycin and three sulfonamides sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine in major chinese cities through the method of wastewater based epidemiology with a range of 0 4 to 428 2 mg 1000 inh day and 1 8 to 2437 7 mg 1000 inh day respectively han et al 2022 of five macrolides detected in our study azithromycin was the predominant contaminant in drinking water in both sites showing the highest detection frequency ranged from 79 71 to 100 and the maximum concentration ranged from 2 34 to 3 99 ng l lower than the maximum level in the drinking water sources in nanjing 19 28 ng l liu et al 2020 azithromycin is a second generation macrolides that is primarily used as a first line drugs to treat respiratory tract genital tract as well as skin and soft tissue infections retsema et al 1987 roxithromycin and erythromycin were also frequently detected in both sites the former is for human use only while the latter is mainly used as human antibiotics but also have limited usage in animals wang et al 2021 the maximum detected concentration of roxithromycin was 2 86 ng l slight higher than that in tianjin 2 4 ng l song et al 2019 but far below that in large scale drinking water sources in chongqing 31 4 ng l feng et al 2020 the maximum concentration of erythromycin 1 80 ng l was also lower than that in chongqing 9 2 ng l feng et al 2020 and shanghai 37 4 ng l jiang et al 2018 comparable average concentration was observed for roxithromycin in study sites by contrast erythromycin was widely detected in drinking water in site b and its level was evidently higher than that in site a data from china antimicrobial resistance surveillance system carss has revealed that jiangsu province had the highest rate of amr to erythromycin compared with other provinces in china china antimicrobial resistance surveillance system 2022 tilmicosin was detected in both summer and winter tap samples in site a albeit at lower detection frequency timicosin as widely used in farm animals especially for the treatment of mycoplasma infections in chickens was used to cultivate small scale poultry for self consumption in site a cai et al 2022 improper administration or misuse of tilmicosin may also result in elevated residues in animal derived foods ji et al 2019 sulfonamides were detected across sites in only winter not summer suggesting that their pollution emissions were relatively concentrated usage patterns may correspond to disease seasonality holton et al 2022 sulfonamides are a class of broad spectrum anti inflammatory drugs widely used in humans and animals the total usage of sulfonamides in 2013 was estimated to as high as 2270 tons in eastern china zhang et al 2015 as active metabolites of sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine respectively acetylated sulfamethoxazole and acetylated sulfamethazine was the predominant sulfonamides pollutants in winter samples that was somewhat expected as sulfonamides are difficult to biodegrade and mainly excreted as acetylated metabolites sulfonamides and their metabolites have ever been detected in human urine samples in shanghai wang et al 2018 2017 2021 sulfamethoxazole was also detected as parent compound in winter well water in site b ranged not exceeding 0 40 ng l which approximately 5 fold lower than the level of acetylated sulfamethoxazole in tap water and far below that in national groundwater samples median 0 66 ng l maximum 56 ng l li et al 2020 indicating that groundwater in site b may be less susceptible to contamination than others of other categories of antibiotics detected both danofloxacin and thiamphenicol were detectable in water samples in site b presumably due to the contributions from veterinary settings such as pig and sheep farming notably danofloxacin and thiamphenicol are listed as restricted drugs in other food animals in china ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china moa 2022 we observed a significantly higher overall detection frequency and average concentration in winter 89 86 1 81 ng l than that in summer 44 29 0 49 ng l in site a in general the seasonal variation for antibiotics in aquatic environments manifests that higher level of antibiotics in winter than summer and similar phenomenon has been observed in previous studies liu et al 2020 cui et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 it might be due to weakened dilution and degradation of antibiotics caused by the reduced water storage and low temperature in winter dry season while the rich flow volume high temperature and strong sunlight promoted its dilution and degradation in summer wet season parolo et al 2008 adamek et al 2016 however it should be noted that the macrolides showed higher level in summer than winter in site b which might be explained by the distinctive usage patterns of antibiotics in different seasons and the sewage discharge from pharmaceutical plants 4 2 health risk assessment based on the parameters of volume for drinking water consumed and time for water related activities spent the exposure dose of antibiotics through drinking water in different exposure scenarios were estimated by monte carlo simulations the estimated exposure dose for a mixture of antibiotic residue was less than 0 01 μg kg day and varied by study sites water types seasons and sex p 0 001 the add ranged from 1 68 10 5 to 2 20 10 3 μg kg day for males and ranged from 1 66 10 5 to 1 98 10 3 μg kg day for females respectively higher than that estimated for shanghai children wang et al 2016 and lower than that estimated for residents in southern coastal city ben et al 2020 given that the selected percentiles of daily exposure dose to antibiotics via ingestion were well matched with the overall exposure level ingestion route was found to be the primary mode of exposure to antibiotic residues in drinking water in our study which was similar to a previous study song et al 2019 in this study the estimated hrqs for a mixture of antibiotic residues in tap water were less than or equal to 10 3 level which were much lower than 1 indicating acceptable exposure risks of antibiotic trough drinking water song et al 2019 these risks were lower than those in drinking water sources in nanjing liu et al 2020 and in tap water in several cites from major chinese river basins lyu et al 2021 in addition the hrq for macrolides including roxithromycin erythromycin and tilmicosin accounted for 46 to 67 of the total hrqs on the corresponding scenarios which associated with their higher residual levels and lower acceptable daily intakes adis leung et al 2013 joint fao who expert committee on food additives jecfa 2009 similarly roxithromycin was also the main component of health exposure risks to antibiotics reported in previous studies lyu et al 2021 4 3 strengths and limitations the strengths of this study included samples collected for seven consecutive days in both wet season summer and dry season winter and a uplc ms ms methods with low method detection limits used for detection of 27 antibiotics also the monte carlo simulations considering the probability distributions of variables provided more accurate estimates compared to conventional estimation method based on uniform parameters there were several limitations in this study firstly the degradation of antibiotics during cooking processes was not considered which might overestimate the true effects of antibiotic residues on human health secondly the time spent on water related activities was derived from references so there might introduce an uncertainty in dermal exposure assessments thirdly the amount of drinking water consumed was collected through questionnaire instead of the method of daily monitoring so there might be some measurements errors in summary considering the long term risks caused by low dose antibiotics in drinking water our study provides evidence for public health decision making 5 conclusions ten of twenty seven selected antibiotics were detected in drinking water samples in two rural residential areas in zhejiang and jiangsu province eastern china macrolides and sulfonamides were the predominant contaminants and sulfonamides showed the significant seasonality azithromycin was detected most frequently followed by roxithromycin and erythromycin the average daily dose for human exposure to a mixture of antibiotic residues varied across study sites water types seasons and sex although the individual antibiotic and their combined effects contributed to acceptable health risks for human the long term exposure patterns to low dose antibiotics in drinking water should not be ignored it is necessary to establish the use specification and emission standard of antibiotics at national levels so as to control the antibiotic use and the prevalence of abr in china credit authorship contribution statement yingying wang conceptualization investigation methodology formal analysis data curation writing

14825,trace levels of antibiotics were frequently found in drinking water leading a growing concern that drinking water is an important exposure source to antibiotics in humans in this study we investigated antibiotics in tap water and well water in two rural residential areas in eastern china to assess the related human health exposure risks in drinking water twenty seven antibiotics were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms the average daily dose add and the health risk quotient hrq for exposure to antibiotics in humans were evaluated using 10000 times of monte carlo simulations ten antibiotics were detected in drinking water samples with the maximum concentrations of antibiotic mixture of 8 29 ng l in tap water and 2 95 ng l in well water respectively macrolides and sulfonamides were the predominant contaminants and showed the seasonality azithromycin had the highest detection frequencies 79 71 100 followed by roxithromycin 25 71 100 and erythromycin 21 43 86 96 the estimated add and hrq for human exposure to antibiotic mixture through drinking water was less than 0 01 μg kg day and 0 01 respectively which varied over sites water types seasons and sex ingestion route was more important than dermal contact route 10 6 to 10 4 μg kg day magnitude vs 10 11 to 10 8 μg kg day magnitude macrolides also contributed mainly to health exposure risks to antibiotics through drinking water whose hrq accounted for 46 to 67 of the total hrqs although the individual antibiotic and their combined effects contributed to acceptable health risks for human the long term exposure patterns to low dose antibiotics in drinking water should not be ignored keywords antibiotics seasonal variation health risk drinking water eastern china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are a group of intrinsically bio active chemicals used in humans and animals for disease treatment prevention and growth promotion ferri et al 2017 which have contributed to the aquatic environment contaminations worldwide in recent years due to continuous and extensive discharges from municipal hospital agricultural and industrial effluents carvalho and santos 2016 these contaminations induce environmental antibiotic resistant bacteria earb and then promote the horizontal gene transfer hgt between earb and pathogenic antibiotic resistance parb marti et al 2014 moreover direct intake or inadvertent exposure to antibiotics may disturb the human intestinal microbiome and develop the antibiotic resistance abr even accumulate toxicity in target organs and lead to immune or metabolic related diseases posing serious public health risks liu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 tadić et al 2021 in the past several decades multiple antibiotics have been generally monitored in major chinese surface water basins li et al 2018 dujuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 it deserves our attention that antibiotic residues were also detected in some chinese urban drinking water due to their incomplete removal by conventional technologies in drinking water treatment plants dwtps he et al 2022 wang et al 2016 feng et al 2020 ben et al 2020 moreover the limited infrastructures lead to a poorer treatment for drinking water in the majority of rural areas meng et al 2021 well water is an important source of drinking water supply in rural china and is usually used as raw water without any treatment compared with surface water there is a relatively higher degree of protection for groundwater but it is difficult to recover once contaminated li et al 2020 although most of these pollutants are present at the level of nanograms liter ng l some antibiotics like sulfonamides and macrolides may persist for a long time in aquatic environment larsson 2014 so far china has not yet implemented the standard limits for antibiotics in drinking water therefore there is a growing concern that drinking water might be an important exposure source to antibiotics inducing potential health risks it is supposed that consuming or contacting different types of drinking water may contribute to different exposure profiles of antibiotics risk assessment has been widely applied for identify the influences and hazards of pollutants in humans based on the intensity and duration of exposure to some pollutants in environmental media the uncertainty in the process of risk assessment can be addressed by a method of monte carlo simulation chowdhury et al 2009 in general humans are mainly exposed to antibiotics in drinking water via two routes direct ingestion and dermal contact only a few studies have focused on human exposure to antibiotics via drinking water and reported that the estimated exposure level ranged from ng kg day to μg kg day he et al 2022 wang et al 2016 feng et al 2020 ben et al 2020 meng et al 2021 but ignored the relevant risks via dermal absorption so the actual human exposure and health risk of antibiotic residues in drinking water might have been underestimated eastern china is one of the most economically developed regions in china with dense populations intensive livestock breeding industries and extensive antibiotic use based on market survey and mathematical modeling it has been revealed that the emission density of antibiotics in river basins in eastern china was 6 fold higher than that in western china zhang et al 2015 which made this region become the hot spot of controlling antibiotic use and abr cheng et al 2013 chen et al 2020 in this study two rural residential areas were selected from zhejiang province site a and jiangsu province site b located in yangtze river delta of eastern china twenty seven antibiotics were monitored in all sampling sites over different seasons this study attempted to offer some evidence for better understanding the occurrence seasonal variation and human exposure risk of antibiotics in drinking water in rural eastern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and drinking water sampling this study is a part of the research item impacts of antibiotic residues in the environment on bacterial resistance and human health in eastern china cai et al 2022 sampling site a and b were located in the rural areas of zhejiang and jiangsu province respectively in yangtze river delta of eastern china both sites were economically comparable and differences between them were antibiotic use patterns poultry and aquaculture practices and local regulations they were selected to facilitate the use of existing epidemiology study population cohorts to explore the potential long term effects of antibiotic use as well as exposure to environmental antibiotic residues and abr detailed information on study sites has been described in previous studies cai et al 2022 xu et al 2022 drinking and cooking water for residents is mostly via tap water in site a while via tap and well water in site b in addition given that the relatively low detection rates and concentrations of antibiotics in bottled water and barreled water the concentrations were less than 0 001 ng l wang et al 2016 and low consumption rate of these two kinds of drinking water less than 1 of residents tap water and well water samples were collected as drinking water for this study tap water in the communities of both sites is supplied by the local centralized water plants wp a in site a wp b in site b the raw water is derived from an artificial reservoir in the west of the city for wp a while yangtze river for wp b the water supply capacity of wp a and wp b is 182 thousand m3 d and 200 thousand m3 d respectively both occupy methods of chlorine dioxide disinfection and ozone activated carbon depth treatment to treat water with the automation control at present the factory water reaches the standard of direct drinking water and all water quality indicators are fully in line with the standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 national health commission of the people s republic of china 2022 the detailed information of quality inspection report of effluent water in wp a and wp b during the sampling periods were shown in table s1 ten households per site were selected randomly as the sampling sites using the global position system gps fig 1 tap water and well water samples from the nearest location were collected from each household two sampling campaigns were carried out for over seven consecutive days in august 2020 summer and january 2021 winter respectively which are considered as wet and dry seasons in the study areas tap water samples in site a are grouped as at s summer and at w winter while tap and well water samples in site b are grouped as bt s summer and bt w winter as well as bw s summer and bw w winter respectively a bottle of 2 liter 2l drinking water sample was collected around 9 a m to 10 a m before each collection the sampling bottles were cleaned at least three times by flowing tap water or well water to avoid possible contamination during sampling wang et al 2016 all samples were kept in 20 and pre treated within two days a total of 388 drinking water samples including 278 tap water and 110 well water samples were collected while 4 water samples were lost in the progress of sampling 2 2 study subjects in this study one rural community per study site was randomly sampled from the population cohorts previously established in zhejiang and jiangsu province all adults living in this community for more than 6 months and having no plan to move out were eligible for recruitment cai et al 2022 those with serious psychiatric disorders or body diseases such as tumors or unable to move conveniently were excluded the sample size of subjects was calculated according to the method of the cross sectional study the proportion of antibiotic use in clinic was set as p 25 and the other parameters were set as α 0 05 d 0 1p respectively it was estimated that a total of 1200 subjects were required n z 1 α 2 d 2 p 1 p 400 1 p p p 25 α 0 05 d 0 1 p in fact a total of 1521 adults were enrolled in this study each subject was required to complete a questionnaire interview and have a physical examination finally we assessed the health exposure risk to antibiotics in drinking water based on data of the 1447 adults with complete information of questionnaires and the response rate was 95 1 written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the data collection this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of fudan university school of public health number 2019 03 0733 date 2019 03 18 a flow chart of this study is presented in figure s1 2 3 selection and analysis for antibiotics evidence suggests that antibiotics mainly macrolides quinolones and sulfonamides have been frequently detected in samples of livestock and poultry products aquatic products vegetables and drinking water wang et al 2017 lyu et al 2020 the results of biological surveillance using urine and fecal samples further confirmed that children pregnant women and other populations are widely exposed to the risk of multiple antibiotics especially veterinary antibiotics such as enrofloxacin and florfenicol wang et al 2018 2017 2021 as a result based on the detection frequencies of antibiotics in drinking water in previous studies wang et al 2016 lyu et al 2020 and the categories detected before in food samples wang et al 2017 and human urines samples wang et al 2018 2017 2021 a total of 27 antibiotics of 5 categories were selected for analysis including four tetracyclines tetracycline oxytetracycline chlortetracycline and doxycycline eight fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin ofloxacin norfloxacin pefloxacin enrofloxacin danofloxacin difloxacin and lomefloxacin six macrolides azithromycin roxithromycin clarithromycin erythromycin tilmicosin and spiramycin six sulfonamides and their metabolites trimethoprim sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine acetylated sulfamethoxazole and acetylated sulfamethazine and three phenicols chloramphenicol thiamphenicol and florfenicol according to the related management requirements zhejiang commission of health 2022 jiangsu commission of health 2022 ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2022 these 27 antibiotics were further categorized into four human antibiotics exclusively used in human has six veterinary antibiotics exclusively used in animals vas and seventeen human veterinary antibiotics used in both human and animals h vas a total of 6 isotopically labeled internal standards is were used for the quantification of target antibiotics a full list of categories abbreviation usage and is for each antibiotic is provided in table s2 a method of ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms was occupied to measure 27 antibiotics in 388 drinking water samples zang et al 2023 twenty seven antibiotic standard materials and 6 isotopically labeled internal standards is from dr ehrenstorfer augsburg germany were used after 200 ml water were added by 6 isotopically labeled antibiotics and adjusted to ph 6 5 8 5 with formic acid water samples were passed through 3 ml solid phase extraction spe cartridges packed with 60 mg of hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb resin at a flow rate of less than 5 ml min the hlb cartridges were preconditioned with 2 ml methanol and 2 ml of pure water after extraction the cartridge was washed with 2 ml pure water and then vacuumed for 30 minutes the retained antibiotics on the spe cartridge were eluted with 4 ml of methanol the eluate was concentrated to dryness at 40 c with a weak nitrogen flow the residue was reconstituted in 0 5 ml of 20 methanol water solution for uplc ms ms analysis the best separation and organic purge were achieved using 2 3 methanol acetonitrile mobile phase a and 0 2 formic acid water mobile phase b strong and weak needle washes were selected to compliment the system the injection volume was 10 μl via a partial loop injection the best results in terms of system pressure peak separation and peak shape were determined at 0 35 ml min the linear elution program of a for 27 antibiotics was as follows from 0 to 1 0 min

assumed as the contamination level in each drinking water type in the prediction of human exposure so as to avoid possible underestimation feng et al 2020 the detection frequencies and percentile contents of 27 antibiotics in drinking water were described separately according to study sites water types and sampling seasons the adds and the hrqs of detected antibiotics were also respectively provided in males and females according to the site and sex specific exposure parameters considering the uncertainties of the variation in the model parameters of health risk assessments a probabilistic exposure assessment based on 10000 times of monte carlo simulations was performed by the software crystal ball 11 1 oracle inc usa thomaidi et al 2017 chi square test and wilcoxon test were respectively used to examine the seasonal variations in detection frequencies and the residual contents of antibiotics wilcoxon test was occupied to evaluate the sex differences in the exposure risk to antibiotics through tap water all analyses were performed using r program version 4 0 4 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria the level of statistical significance was defined as α 0 05 of two side probability 3 results 3 1 occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of antibiotics in drinking water 3 1 1 occurrence a total of 10 out of 27 antibiotics were detected in the drinking water samples including five macrolides three sulfonamides one phenicols and one fluoroquinolones with a sum of residual concentration for the antibiotic mixture ranged from not detected nd to 8 29 ng l in tap water and ranged from nd to 2 95 ng l in well water respectively at least one targeted antibiotic was detected in 44 29 to 100 samples in study sites overall detection frequency and concentration range for antibiotics in each sampling groups are demonstrated at fig 2 and in table 1 in general macrolides and sulfonamides were the predominant contaminations azithromycin showed the highest detection frequencies 79 71 100 in drinking water samples from all study sites followed by roxithromycin 25 71 100 and erythromycin 21 43 86 96 sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine and their acetylated metabolites as well as thiamphenicol were also frequently detected in drinking water with detection frequencies ranged from 20 29 to 40 58 the highest detection concentration of 2 ng l was seen for 6 out of 10 detected antibiotics with the maximum concentration reaching 6 59 ng l for tilmicosin followed by 3 99 ng l for azithromycin fig 2 compared with the has and h vas the vas showed lower detection frequency among which thiamphenicol was the relative frequently detected vas table 1 3 1 2 spatiotemporal variation there was no significant difference in antibiotic residues between all samples in the same sample group over seven consecutive days p 0 05 noticeable seasonality was observed for all drinking water samples p 0 05 spatiotemporal trends of average antibiotic concentrations classified into detected individual antibiotic category and usage of antibiotic are presented at fig 3 winter tap water in site a at w showed the highest overall concentration as up to 1 81 ng l mainly due to the contributions of macrolides and sulfonamides fig 3a and b macrolides were the most prevalent antibiotics detected in summer and their overall average concentrations ranged from 0 49 to 1 81 ng l among which bt s showed most erythromycin in particular was seen only in summer with the highest detection frequency of 86 96 and the average concentration of 0 77 ng l seen in bt s azithromycin were detectable in all summer samples in site b bt s and bw s with the average concentration of 0 89 ng l and 1 03 ng l respectively and in approximately 80 of samples in at w with the average concentration of 1 04 ng l roxithromycin was also monitored in all samples in bt s with a lower average level of 0 15 ng l and presented the comparable level in the winter samples bt w clarithromycin was only detected in fewer than 20 of summer tap water samples in site a at s and at a trace level average concentration 0 07 ng l regardless of sporadic detection tilmicosin presented consistently in two sampling campaigns in site a at s and at w noticeable seasonality was observed for sulfonamides and phenicols including sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine and their acetylated metabolites as well as thiamphenicol which were only presented in winter and showed the highest overall average concentration of 0 62 ng l in at w as the unique fluoroquinolones detected danofloxacin was found in 90 74 of samples in bw s fig 3a and b in each sampling season similar antibiotics were found consistently across tap and well water in site b but the corresponding detection frequencies and concentrations were not comparable in winter samples for example azithromycin was detected at an average level of 0 17 ng l in bt w nearly 17 fold higher than that in bw w 0 01 ng l p 0 001 table 1 distinctive antibiotic usage patterns were found in the two sites fig 3c although the has accounted for around half of detected antibiotics in each sample group the overall average concentration of has was higher in winter than that in summer in site a while showed the adverse trends in site b 3 2 risk assessment for human exposure to antibiotic residues in drinking water 3 2 1 characteristics and water use habits of study subjects characteristics and water use habits for subjects have been performed subdivided by site and sex table 2 the mean age was 61 21 12 99 years for 677 subjects in site a and 63 74 12 52 years for 770 subjects in site b respectively the proportion of males was higher in site a n 313 46 2 than that in site b n 314 40 8 water ingestion rate varied considerably across study sites sex and seasons p 0 001 subjects drunk more water in summer than in winter with the mean of ingr ranging from 1 69 0 49 l day to 2 43 0 76 l day in summer and 1 38 0 33 l day to 1 87 0 49 l day in winter respectively 3 2 2 estimates of average daily dose add μg kg day adds for residual antibiotics through drinking water were assessed individually in different exposure scenarios figs 4 and 5 based on 10000 times of monte carlo simulations detailed parameters used for monte carlo simulations were shown in table s4 and table s5 the probability distributions indicated that the estimated add for human exposure to a mixture of antibiotic residues through drinking water was less than 0 01 μg kg day and varied by sites water types seasons and sex p 0 001 fig 4 and table s6 in general males showed higher add levels compared to females in all scenarios as a result of higher ingr in males than females which mainly due to the contributions of ingestion exposure route adding from 10 6 to 10 4 μg kg day magnitude tables s7 instead of dermal contact route addder from 10 11 to 10 8 μg kg day magnitude tables s7 consistent with the residual levels of antibiotics in drinking water samples the subjects in site a were exposed to significantly less dose of antibiotics in summer than in winter p 0 001 while the subjects in site b were exposed more dose in summer p 0 001 it thus appeared that males were exposed most based on at w scenario with the add for 95 males was less than 7 67 10 4 μg kg day fig 4 in details the estimated adds for individual antibiotic residue in drinking water and comparisons between different scenarios were presented at fig 5 subjects were most frequently exposed to azithromycin with the median add of 1 12 10 4 μg kg day highest for males on at w scenario the exposure levels of both roxithromycin and erythromycin were highest in males on bt s scenario and the median add was 3 34 10 5 μg kg day and 1 10 10 4 μg kg day respectively 3 2 3 estimates of health risk quotient hrq hrqs from residual antibiotics through drinking water were assessed individually in different exposure scenarios figs 6 and 7 compared with subjects on other scenarios both males and females experienced a higher exposure risk based on at s scenario with the average hrqs of 5 35 10 4 for males and 4 47 10 4 for females respectively table s8 the macrolides contributed mainly to the health risk hrq for roxithromycin and tilmicosin accounted for approximately half 48 vs 46 of the total hrqs on at s and at w scenario respectively hrq for erythromycin accounted for 57 and 53 of the total hrqs on bt s and bw s scenario and roxithromycin accounted for 61 and 67 of the total hrqs on bt w and bw w scenario 4 discussions 4 1 occurrence and season variation of antibiotics in tap water concerns have been raised about antibiotic residues at trace levels ng l which have been frequently detected in drinking water compared with a short term consumption to high level antibiotics used for clinical treatment humans are more susceptible to a long term but low level exposure mode in daily life which might lead to potential health risks in this study conducted in two rural residential areas of eastern china from 2020 to 2021 of twenty seven selected antibiotics five macrolides three sulfonamides one phenicols and one fluoroquinolones were detected in drinking water samples with a sum of residual concentrations for the antibiotic mixture ranged from not detected nd to 8 29 ng l in tap water and ranged from nd to 2 95 ng l in well water respectively our results were much lower than those in major drinking water sources in eastern china with the residual levels ranged from nd to 90 10 ng l in nanjing liu et al 2020 from nd to 229 14 ng l in shanghai cui et al 2018 and from 19 68 ng l to 497 00 ng l in the reservoir nearby yangtze river hu et al 2021 respectively a higher level of antibiotic residues with a range of nd to 368 21 ng l was also monitored in tap water in rural southern china meng et al 2021 however there is no antibiotic limit in the current chinese standards for drinking water ministry of health of the people s republic of china standardization administration of china 2022 generally the occurrence of antibiotic residues in drinking water primarily results from the excretions following their applications as anti infection medicines or veterinary drugs and the related removal technologies especially in the circumstances of dense population and intensive breeding industry li et al 2016 similar to the results in our study macrolides and sulfonamides have been frequently detected in chinese drinking water sources feng et al 2020 liu et al 2020 due to their considerable consumption in china and well persistence in the environment yuan et al 2022 huang et al 2022 a recent study estimated the average consumption level of two macrolides azithromycin and roxithromycin and three sulfonamides sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine in major chinese cities through the method of wastewater based epidemiology with a range of 0 4 to 428 2 mg 1000 inh day and 1 8 to 2437 7 mg 1000 inh day respectively han et al 2022 of five macrolides detected in our study azithromycin was the predominant contaminant in drinking water in both sites showing the highest detection frequency ranged from 79 71 to 100 and the maximum concentration ranged from 2 34 to 3 99 ng l lower than the maximum level in the drinking water sources in nanjing 19 28 ng l liu et al 2020 azithromycin is a second generation macrolides that is primarily used as a first line drugs to treat respiratory tract genital tract as well as skin and soft tissue infections retsema et al 1987 roxithromycin and erythromycin were also frequently detected in both sites the former is for human use only while the latter is mainly used as human antibiotics but also have limited usage in animals wang et al 2021 the maximum detected concentration of roxithromycin was 2 86 ng l slight higher than that in tianjin 2 4 ng l song et al 2019 but far below that in large scale drinking water sources in chongqing 31 4 ng l feng et al 2020 the maximum concentration of erythromycin 1 80 ng l was also lower than that in chongqing 9 2 ng l feng et al 2020 and shanghai 37 4 ng l jiang et al 2018 comparable average concentration was observed for roxithromycin in study sites by contrast erythromycin was widely detected in drinking water in site b and its level was evidently higher than that in site a data from china antimicrobial resistance surveillance system carss has revealed that jiangsu province had the highest rate of amr to erythromycin compared with other provinces in china china antimicrobial resistance surveillance system 2022 tilmicosin was detected in both summer and winter tap samples in site a albeit at lower detection frequency timicosin as widely used in farm animals especially for the treatment of mycoplasma infections in chickens was used to cultivate small scale poultry for self consumption in site a cai et al 2022 improper administration or misuse of tilmicosin may also result in elevated residues in animal derived foods ji et al 2019 sulfonamides were detected across sites in only winter not summer suggesting that their pollution emissions were relatively concentrated usage patterns may correspond to disease seasonality holton et al 2022 sulfonamides are a class of broad spectrum anti inflammatory drugs widely used in humans and animals the total usage of sulfonamides in 2013 was estimated to as high as 2270 tons in eastern china zhang et al 2015 as active metabolites of sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine respectively acetylated sulfamethoxazole and acetylated sulfamethazine was the predominant sulfonamides pollutants in winter samples that was somewhat expected as sulfonamides are difficult to biodegrade and mainly excreted as acetylated metabolites sulfonamides and their metabolites have ever been detected in human urine samples in shanghai wang et al 2018 2017 2021 sulfamethoxazole was also detected as parent compound in winter well water in site b ranged not exceeding 0 40 ng l which approximately 5 fold lower than the level of acetylated sulfamethoxazole in tap water and far below that in national groundwater samples median 0 66 ng l maximum 56 ng l li et al 2020 indicating that groundwater in site b may be less susceptible to contamination than others of other categories of antibiotics detected both danofloxacin and thiamphenicol were detectable in water samples in site b presumably due to the contributions from veterinary settings such as pig and sheep farming notably danofloxacin and thiamphenicol are listed as restricted drugs in other food animals in china ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china moa 2022 we observed a significantly higher overall detection frequency and average concentration in winter 89 86 1 81 ng l than that in summer 44 29 0 49 ng l in site a in general the seasonal variation for antibiotics in aquatic environments manifests that higher level of antibiotics in winter than summer and similar phenomenon has been observed in previous studies liu et al 2020 cui et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 it might be due to weakened dilution and degradation of antibiotics caused by the reduced water storage and low temperature in winter dry season while the rich flow volume high temperature and strong sunlight promoted its dilution and degradation in summer wet season parolo et al 2008 adamek et al 2016 however it should be noted that the macrolides showed higher level in summer than winter in site b which might be explained by the distinctive usage patterns of antibiotics in different seasons and the sewage discharge from pharmaceutical plants 4 2 health risk assessment based on the parameters of volume for drinking water consumed and time for water related activities spent the exposure dose of antibiotics through drinking water in different exposure scenarios were estimated by monte carlo simulations the estimated exposure dose for a mixture of antibiotic residue was less than 0 01 μg kg day and varied by study sites water types seasons and sex p 0 001 the add ranged from 1 68 10 5 to 2 20 10 3 μg kg day for males and ranged from 1 66 10 5 to 1 98 10 3 μg kg day for females respectively higher than that estimated for shanghai children wang et al 2016 and lower than that estimated for residents in southern coastal city ben et al 2020 given that the selected percentiles of daily exposure dose to antibiotics via ingestion were well matched with the overall exposure level ingestion route was found to be the primary mode of exposure to antibiotic residues in drinking water in our study which was similar to a previous study song et al 2019 in this study the estimated hrqs for a mixture of antibiotic residues in tap water were less than or equal to 10 3 level which were much lower than 1 indicating acceptable exposure risks of antibiotic trough drinking water song et al 2019 these risks were lower than those in drinking water sources in nanjing liu et al 2020 and in tap water in several cites from major chinese river basins lyu et al 2021 in addition the hrq for macrolides including roxithromycin erythromycin and tilmicosin accounted for 46 to 67 of the total hrqs on the corresponding scenarios which associated with their higher residual levels and lower acceptable daily intakes adis leung et al 2013 joint fao who expert committee on food additives jecfa 2009 similarly roxithromycin was also the main component of health exposure risks to antibiotics reported in previous studies lyu et al 2021 4 3 strengths and limitations the strengths of this study included samples collected for seven consecutive days in both wet season summer and dry season winter and a uplc ms ms methods with low method detection limits used for detection of 27 antibiotics also the monte carlo simulations considering the probability distributions of variables provided more accurate estimates compared to conventional estimation method based on uniform parameters there were several limitations in this study firstly the degradation of antibiotics during cooking processes was not considered which might overestimate the true effects of antibiotic residues on human health secondly the time spent on water related activities was derived from references so there might introduce an uncertainty in dermal exposure assessments thirdly the amount of drinking water consumed was collected through questionnaire instead of the method of daily monitoring so there might be some measurements errors in summary considering the long term risks caused by low dose antibiotics in drinking water our study provides evidence for public health decision making 5 conclusions ten of twenty seven selected antibiotics were detected in drinking water samples in two rural residential areas in zhejiang and jiangsu province eastern china macrolides and sulfonamides were the predominant contaminants and sulfonamides showed the significant seasonality azithromycin was detected most frequently followed by roxithromycin and erythromycin the average daily dose for human exposure to a mixture of antibiotic residues varied across study sites water types seasons and sex although the individual antibiotic and their combined effects contributed to acceptable health risks for human the long term exposure patterns to low dose antibiotics in drinking water should not be ignored it is necessary to establish the use specification and emission standard of antibiotics at national levels so as to control the antibiotic use and the prevalence of abr in china credit authorship contribution statement yingying wang conceptualization investigation methodology formal analysis data curation writing

14826,metal sulfide precipitation is a viable technology for high yield metal recovery from hydrometallurgical streams with the potential to streamline the process design a single stage elemental sulfur s0 reducing and metal sulfide precipitating process can optimize the operational and capital costs associated with this technology boosting the competitiveness of this technology for wider industrial application however limited research is available on biological sulfur reduction at high temperature and low ph frequent conditions of hydrometallurgical process waters here we assessed the sulfidogenic activity of an industrial granular sludge previously shown to reduce s0 under hot 60 80 c and acidic conditions ph 3 6 a 4 l gas lift reactor was operated for 206 days and fed continuously with culture medium and copper during the reactor operation we explored the effect of the hydraulic retention time copper loading rates temperature and h2 and co2 flow rates on the volumetric sulfide production rates vspr a maximum vspr of 274 6 mg l 1 d 1 was reached a 3 9 fold increase of the vspr previously reported with this inoculum in batch operation interestingly the

require an increasing metal recovery yield from ores that are currently discarded in waste rocks and mining tailings falagán et al 2017 sulfidogenic technologies increase the recovery yield of base metals from complex mineral ores by exploiting differences in metal sulfide solubility across a wide ph range while benefiting from a concentrated metal sludge that requires less downstream processing than metal oxy hydroxide precipitation methods adams et al 2008 kieu et al 2011 sulfidogenesis for metal recovery is available in the market the canadian company bqe water and the dutch paques b v have branded sulfidogenic systems successfully commissioned for the hydrometallurgical industry johnson and santos 2020 nonetheless sulfidogenic systems are not widespread in the hydrometallurgical industry for the operational and capital costs restrain the industry interest so less efficient metal recovery technologies are still favored florentino et al 2015 sanchez andrea et al 2016 current biological sulfidogenic systems are compartmentalized into two stages comprising a biological and a chemical unit johnson and santos 2020 sulfur is reduced in the biological unit under optimal controlled conditions commonly opposed to the extreme temperature and ph conditions of the hydrometallurgical stream this process separation further allows tailoring the bioreactor performance to fit the process s specific requirements johnson and hallberg 2005 the biologically produced hydrogen sulfide h2s is transported into the chemical unit by an innocuous carrier gas e g n2 florentino et al 2016b where it reacts with the metals in the process waters the transportation of h2s into the chemical contactor and the process compartmentalization contribute to the cost increase of current sulfidogenic systems florentino et al 2016b holanda and johnson 2020 a single stage sulfidogenic system in which sulfur reduction occurs in the hydrometallurgical process waters is a cost effective flow scheme compared to two stage systems simplifying the operation to a single stage process reduces manpower decreases operating and maintenance costs and maintains a homogeneous distribution of h2s inside the bioreactor johnson et al 2006 villa gomez et al 2011 drastically reducing the operational and capital costs the bottleneck of this technology jameson et al 2010 kumar et al 2021 s0 reduction is preferred over sulfate reduction as it decreases by 4 fold the electron donor consumption florentino et al 2016b moreover s0 reduction is a common trait in thermoacidophilic microorganisms crucial to cope with the conditions of hydrometallurgical process waters which are commonly hot 40 90 c acidic ph 4 and contain inhibitory metal and metalloid concentrations falagán et al 2017 hedrich et al 2018 holanda and johnson 2020 kaksonen et al 2003 ňancucheo et al 2017 retka et al 2020 sulfidogenic capable microorganisms also exhibit an increased tolerance to high metal concentrations hedderich et al 1998 increasing the feasibility of a one stage process we previously reported autotrophic s0 reduction using mesophile microorganisms from a granular sludge as inoculum in a 4 l gas lift bioreactor operated in batch we documented vspr up to 70 10 mg l 1 d 1 using this inoculum under hot 80 c acidic ph 3 5 and high metal concentrations up to 1143 mg l 1 cu2 hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 2020 we extend our previous work with this inoculum investigating the sulfidogenic activity of these microorganisms in a gas lift reactor continuously fed with mineral medium under high temperature 60 80 c and acidic ph 3 6 conditions we investigated the effect on the vspr of critical parameters such as h2 and co2 flow rate hydraulic retention time hrt copper loading rate clr and temperature finally we identified the microbial community involved in reducing s0 in our system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation we inoculated a glass gas lift reactor with a working volume of 4 l fig 1 with granular wet sludge originating from a sulfate reducing bioreactor with low methane production at the industrial park getec formerly emmtec located in emmen nl the granular sludge henceforth emmen sludge originated from an anaerobic uasb type bioreactor fed with ethanol as the sole electron and carbon donor the gas lift reactor was continuously fed with mineral medium and cu2 through independent influents fig 1 cu2 was loaded to the reactor as a cuso4 5h2o at a constant solution flow rate of 73 3 ml d 1 the cu2 solution concentration was adjusted to regulate the cu2 loading rate clr the influent vessel was continuously sparged with n2 o2 0 5 ppmv linde gas benelux b v nl to preserve the anoxic conditions of the influent settleable solids in the effluent were retained in an external glass settler and recirculated to the reactor the reactor ph was maintained using a 0 1 m naoh solution the reactor was fed with h2 99 999 linde gas benelux b v and co2 99 99 linde gas benelux b v as sole electron and carbon donors the gas was recirculated to the reactor at a rate of 50 80 l h 1 to enhance gas transfer and mixture free h2s was stripped from the effluent gas in a 5 m naoh solution equipment specifications are listed in the supplementary information s i 1 mineral medium 3 l was added to the reactor two hours prior to inoculation and the reactor temperature was set to 80 c low phosphate mineral medium described by hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 was used during the reactor operation tungsten a basal micronutrient for some extremophiles and initially absent from the medium composition was included as na2wo4 2h2o 0 1 µm on day 70 of operation yeast extract 0 1 g l 1 was added as an additional carbon source during the reactor inoculation the medium in the reactor was sparged with n2 25 ml s 1 1 h the gas influent was then changed to a mixture of h2 2 8 l h 1 and co2 0 7 l h 1 simultaneously 400 g of the emmen sludge 25 g dry weight was suspended in 500 ml of demineralized water the ph of the sludge suspension was corrected to 4 0 with a 1 m h2so4 solution and subsequently sparged with n2 25 ml s 1 0 5 h afterward biological s0 10 g l 1 s0 was suspended in the reactor and the reactor was inoculated with the sludge suspension the s0 used was originated from a sulfide s2 oxidizing reactor from a food waste digester soluble impurities in the s0 were removed using multiple 2 1 extractions with demineralized water the s0 water suspension was manually agitated for 3 min centrifuged at 3620 g for 5 min and the resulting pellet recovered the procedure was repeated until the suspension reached a conductivity 80 µs cm 1 the recovered s0 30 g was resuspended in 50 ml falcon tubes with demineralized water and the elemental composition of the suspension was determined through icp oes s0 was supplied to the reactor in batches on periods of 1 to 4 days estimating the mass of s0 consumed from the mass of h2s produced in that period the reactor operation lasted 206 days under acidic ph 3 6 and hot 80 60 c conditions the effects of different regimes of clr hrt temperature and h2 and co2 influent flow rates on the volumetric sulfide production rates vspr were examined during the reactor operation compartmentalized into five phases including a start up phase each phase started after the steady state criteria was met in the preceding phase steady state was considered reached when the standard deviation of the vspr recorded over ten consecutive days was 10 the vspr expressed per liter of

after inoculation the reactor was operated in batch and subsequently fed continuously with mineral medium maintaining an initial hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 3 days during this phase we started the supplementation of cu2 into the influent feed maintaining an initial clr of 29 1 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 day 32 in phase i days 68 101 the clr was increased to 113 4 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 day 68 and the h2 flow rate was then raised to 5 6 l d 1 day 81 possible micronutrient deficiency was evaluated by increasing 10 of the micronutrient content in the medium days 84 91 in phase ii day 101 124 the hrt was decreased to 1 5 0 1 d day 101 on day 111 the h2 influent flow rate was decreased to 4 0 l h 1 and the co2 influent flow rate was increased to 1 0 l h 1 we explored thiosulfate as a possible electron acceptor during this phase by adding 4 5 g nas2o3 5h2o to the reactor in phase iii days 124 175 the h2 and co2 influent flow rates were restored to 2 8 and 0 7 l h 1 respectively and the temperature was decreased to 60 c day 124 in phase iv days 175 206 the clr was increased to 509 11 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 supplying a 10 molar excess of cu2 relative to the vspr in the previous steady state an overview

analyzed using gas chromatography thorough equipment descriptions and sample preservation adhere to those found in hidalgo ulloa et al 2020 3 results 3 1 sulfidogenic performance during operation at 80 c the vspr appeared unaffected by changes in operating parameters a vspr of 74 6 mg l 1 d 1 s2 was reached during the steady state at the end of the start up phase days 58 68 and remained unchanged by the subsequent changes induced in phase i and ii table 1 a clear influence of temperature was observed upon the transition from 80 c to 60 c in phase iii in which an average steady state vspr of 235 22 mg l 1 d 1 s2 was reached days 155 175 the maximum vspr was observed upon the increase of the clr in phase iv from 107 0 to 509 11 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 days 175 206 respectively resulting in an increase in the vspr to 274 6 mg l 1 d 1 s2 days 185 206 fig 2 at this vspr 99 96 of the cu2 precipitated despite the 10 molar excess of cu2 in the influent relative to the h2s produced during phase iii in phases i and ii the concentration of free dissolved h2s in the reactor remained 0 3 mg l 1 an increase in the free dissolved h2s in the reactor up to 12 mg l 1 occurred with the increasing sulfidogenic activity in phase iii the clr increase in phase iv resulted in a lower free dissolved h2s remaining below loq 0 2 mg l 1 in this phase the reactor ph rose from 3 8 to 5 1 after inoculation due to the alkalinity of the sludge 49 7 mghco3 gdry sludge 1 the ph was gradually decreased to 4 2 0 1 day 3 fig 3 at which point continuous culture media feeding began the acidity of the medium further lowered the reactor ph to 3 7 0 1 day 18 operational conditions were maintained except when interruptions in operation occurred supplementary information s i 2 interruptions in operation interfered with maintaining a stable ph on days 21 32 fig 3 cu2 feeding began on day 32 with an initial clr of 29 1 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 fig 2 upon the start of cu2 loading the ph stabilized at 3 6 0 1 until the completion of the experiment fig 3 the oxidation reduction potential orp in the reactor remained in a reductive state except in phase iv when the orp increased averaging 235 23 mv during steady state fig 3 xrd analysis of the precipitates at the end of every steady state revealed covellite cus as the sole copper sulfur precipitate formed throughout the reactor operation supplementary information s i 3 no evidence of an amorphous phase was found in the diffractograms of the precipitates suggesting that no amorphous copper precipitates were formed this finding was further supported by the mass balance of naoh for ph maintenance in the reactor covellite formation generates two protons per mole of copper precipitated whereas chalcocite cu2s formation produces one proton per mole of copper precipitated the molar flow rate of naoh throughout the reactor operation based on the volume and concentration of naoh consumed to maintain the reactor ph yielded a ratio of 1 93 mol of naoh per mole of copper precipitated supplementary information s i 3 this ratio aligns with the identification of covellite by the xrd analysis conclusively demonstrating the formation of covellite as the sole copper sulfide precipitate consequently the vspr eq 1 during the periods of cu2 addition accounted the sulfide content in the copper sulfide precipitates based on a 1 1 cu s ratio total sulfur concentration in the reactor exhibited variations throughout the operation and appeared to be independent of the hydraulic retention time supplementary information s i 4 while s0 tended to foam and accumulate at the water gas interface of the reactor at the effluent height this decreased after the initiation of cu2 loading supplementary information s i 5 sem edx analysis revealed that cus fines adhered to the surface of the sulfur crystals supplementary information s i 6 during phases i to iv changes in the total sulfur concentration in the reactor were concurrent with variations in the total copper concentration notably no observable sedimentation of solids occurred within the reactor however copper sulfide precipitates were observed to accumulate at the bottom of the settler these precipitates would periodically detach from the settler and reintegrate into the reactor subsequently influencing the total sulfur concentration in the reactor 3 2 reduction of other sulfur species and nutrient analysis the so4 2 supplied during reactor operation in the mineral medium and as cuso4 5h2o could serve as an additional electron acceptor for sulfidogenesis however no significant differences in the so4 2 concentration in the influent and effluent were found during steady state in phases i to iv fig 4 in addition to so4 2 reduction we evaluated the viability of s2o3 2 as electron acceptor under phase ii conditions by supplying 4 5 g nas2o3 5h2o dissolved in 50 ml of demineralized water on day 119 on day 122 the s2o3 2 concentration in the reactor liquor was under the limit of quantification loq 0 1 mg l 1 the decrease in s2o3 2 concentration was not accompanied by variations in the vspr the consumption of nh4 and accumulation of total nitrogen served as an indicator for biomass growth the concentration of nh4 in the reactor effluent and influent significantly differed over the initial 68 days of operation precluding the assessment of biomass growth during this period the nh4 uptake rate did not vary significantly between phases i and ii remaining at 0 71 0 13 and 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 table 1 respectively the nh4 uptake rate increased with the increasing vspr in phases iii and iv reaching 1 2 0 3 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 during phase iii and 2 4 0 1 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 in phase iv a similar trend in the accumulation of tn was noted showing an increasing trend during the reactor operation however the differences in tn among the initial three phases were not significant preventing the estimation of nitrogen accumulated in these phases table 1 the significant increase in the tn concentration throughout phases iii and iv allowed the quantification of nitrogen accumulation in the reactor liquor with tn concentrations of 52 7 1 2 and 70 9 4 2 mg l 1 during the steady state of these phases respectively micronutrient concentrations in the mineral medium were below loq 0 1 mg l 1 and therefore could not be tracked during the reactor operation the micronutrient concentration in the mineral media was increased by 10 days 84 91 to identify potential micronutrient limitations despite the increased micronutrient concentration during this period no significant changes in the vspr 69 1 mg l 1 d 1 s2 were found from day 70 until the end of the operation 0 1 µm of tungsten was added to the mineral media as na2wo4 2h2o however this did not result in immediate quantifiable effects on the vspr fig 2 during the reactor operation ch4 alcohols c1 c6 and vfas c2 c8 were analyzed to determine the metabolization of other microbial products other than h2s however no other microbial metabolite other than sulfide was found 3 3 microbial community in the samples after quality control and filtering of the sequenced 16s rrna amplicons between 3687 and 475 998 reads remained per reactor sample and 12 reads for the negative dna extraction control supplementary information s i 7 in the steady state at 80 c day 101 ralstonia 46 9 8 8 and an unknown genus from the family alicyclobacillaceae 22 6 8 4 were the dominant genera detected in the sequence reads fig 5 in samples from the steady state at 60 c reads ascribed to the genus desulfurella accounted for 74 0 9 3 and 72 5 4 3 on days 159 and 175 respectively whereas thermoanaerobacterium accounted for 18 5 12 0 and 26 1 4 5 of reads on subsequent timepoints a low number of reads was assigned to ralstonia 3 8 3 8 and 1 1 0 0 respectively fig 5 it should be noted that ralstonia and bifidobacterium were also detected among the 12 reads from the negative control that remained after filtering not shown dna extraction from the reactor samples yielded low amounts of dna 1 ng ul 1 in 50 ul elution volume and concentrations after pcr amplification from day 101 samples were low 1 ng ul 1 compared to those from days 159 1 6 ng ul 1 and 175 13 3 16 7 ng ul 1 supplementary information s i 7 the presence of contaminants in samples from day 101 could have a disproportionate effect on microbial community composition 4 discussion 4 1 temperature effect on the sulfidogenic activity and microbial composition the steady vspr and nh4 consumption rates during phases i and ii despite the changes in hrt micronutrient concentration and electron and carbon donor input suggest that these parameters were not limiting the vspr under these conditions the vspr throughout phases i and ii table 1 were comparable to the vspr previously reported in batch experiments using the same inoculum 70 mg l 1 d 1 s2 under similar ph 3 1 3 5 and temperature 80 c conditions hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 2020 although the solubility of s0 h2 and co2 in the reactor liquor is affected by the decrease in temperature the high temperature conditions appear to be the main limiting factor in the microbial development in the phases at 80 c the increase in vspr nh4 uptake rate and tn accumulation in the reactor in response to the temperature decrease in phase iii support our hypothesis the temperature decrease in phase iii induced a higher microbial activity with tn concentration in the reactor increasing by 1 2 fold and the nh4 consumption rate increasing by 2 3 fold relative to that in phase ii suggesting an increase in microbial growth during this phase the dominant taxa detected shifted from ralstonia and an unknown genus from the family alicyclobacillaceae during operation at 80 c phase ii day 101 to desulfurella and thermoanaerobacterium during steady state at 60 c phase iii day 159 and 175 while ralstonia and alicyclobacillaceae species have been reported in natural environments where other sulfur reducing thermoacidophile microorganisms are encountered hedrich and schippers 2020 so far the capacity for s0 reduction has not been reported within these genera at 60 c more than 70 of the amplicon sequence reads were assigned to the genus desulfurella desulfurella species are capable of s0 reduction with d amilsii as a versatile species active in moderately thermoacidophilic environments ph 3 8 6 9 optimum t 50 c and capable of heterotrophic and autotrophic growth florentino et al 2016a this versatility is reflected in the dominance of desulfurella in s0 reducing enrichments florentino et al 2015 and reactors guo et al 2021 2019 operated at heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions and at neutral and acidic ph the other dominant taxon detected the genus thermoanaerobacterium is not known for s0 reduction rather thermoanaerobacterium species described to date are chemoorganotrophs capable of reducing s2o3 2 to s0 or h2s growing at an optimum temperature between 55 and 70 c and a broad ph range between 3 2 to 8 5 onyenwoke and wiegel 2009 the changes in community composition upon the decrease in temperature combined with the increasing vspr nh4 and tn accumulation aforementioned indicate that the extreme temperature conditions were the main limiting factor s0 bioavailability is proposed to be a limiting factor in biological s0 reduction zhang et al 2018 due to the low solubility of s0 in water 430 nm s0 at 28 c kamyshny 2009 s0 solubility increases with temperature increasing s0 bioavailability s0 solubility in water is 3824 nm at 80 c two fold higher than s0 solubility at 60 c kamyshny 2009 thus the temperature decrease from 80 to 60 c in phase iii would then have decreased the s0 bioavailability limiting the maximum reachable vspr nevertheless the increase in vspr after the temperature decrease in spite of the decrease in s0 solubility in phase iii suggests that this was not that case similarly temperature determines the bioavailability of electron and carbon donors in the system by affecting the saturation concentrations of h2 and co2 of which co2 is particularly temperature dependent at 60 c henry s law constant yields saturation concentrations of h2 and co2 of 0 0012 and 0 64 g l 1 at 1 atm respectively and 0 0011 and 0 43 g l 1 at 80 c sander 2019 although the increased saturation concentration of h2 and co2 in phase iii would decrease electron and carbon donor limitations the increase in h2 and co2 solubility is unlikely to be the sole basis for the increase in vspr during this phase the increase of the h2 flow rate while maintaining the co2 flow rate during phase i resulted in a 45 decrease in the partial pressure of co2 in the influent gas the decrease in co2 partial pressure proportionately reduces the co2 saturation concentration in the liquor restricting the transference rate of co2 to the reactor liquor in favor of h2 this would constrain microbial growth in case of co2 limitations or enhance it in case of h2 limitations in either case the vspr would be impacted however no alterations in the vspr were found during this period days 81 101 furthermore in the case of h2 and co2 limitations in the phases at 80 c the increase in vspr at 60 c during phase iii would have been confined by the concentration increase of its limiting reagents however this was not the case although the molar saturation concentrations of h2 and co2 at 60 c are 1 1 and 1 5 fold higher than at 80 c respectively the molar vspr rise at 60 c was 3 3 fold higher than the vspr in the phases at 80 c consequently the compounding of these results suggests that the vspr at 80 c was not limited by electron and carbon donor availability 4 2 metal effect in the vspr interestingly while the initial increase in cu2 in phase i had no effect on the vspr in phase iv the vspr increased 1 2 fold after the clr was raised to exceed 10 of the h2s productivity in the previous phase we hypothesize that the increase in vspr during phase iv is a result of the orp increase from 181 9 mv to 235 23 mv caused by the excess cu2 relative to the vspr in this phase these results are consistent with our prior reporting with this inoculum in batch experiments in which a higher standard redox potential driven by different metals in the medium resulted in an increase of the vspr hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 in high concentrations metals accumulate in the cells disrupting the intracellular redox balance and producing free radicals harmful to the genetic material of the cell li et al 2022 the synthesis of thiol groups has been posited as a homeostatic mechanism in anaerobes li et al 2022 and aerobes banerjee 2012 for instance intracellular redox imbalances are countered by synthesizing sulfhydryl molecules such as glutathione in the outer membrane proteins balancing the intracellular redox potential maintaining the sulfhydryl side chain of cysteine on the surface proteins in a reduced state and trapping free radicals brimblecombe 2013 furthermore the synthesis of thiol groups in the outer membrane proteins has also been proposed as a possible pathway for s0 reducing microorganisms to anchor s0 in their respiratory metabolism florentino et al 2019 additionally the oxidation to disulfides of synthesized sulfhydryl molecules in the outer membrane proteins may result in s0 reduction not coupled to a respiratory mechanism eq 2 rabus et al 2013 2 2 rsh s 0 rssr h 2 s therefore the increase in vspr during phase iv may be the result of a increased s0 uptake and h2s generation through persulfide formation from the oxidation of thiol groups in the outer membrane proteins with s0 or b metal sulfide formation from the reaction with thiol groups synthesized in the outer membrane proteins fig 6 though the understanding of the mechanics of microbial s0 cleavage is beyond the scope of this work this hypothesis merits further research as understanding the stimulatory effects of increased metal concentrations on s0 reducing microorganisms could ultimately lead to feasible strategies to enhance the vspr for process optimization the addition of cu2 to the sulfidogenic reactor would lessen the potential inhibitory effects of sulfide over the microbial community in the reactor allowing further development of the vspr free dissolved h2s can inhibit microbial growth by binding with metals causing metallo enzyme deactivation or protein alteration disrupting the formation of native disulfide bonds in proteins mendes et al 2021 the inhibitory effects of h2s are lessened through its precipitation with cu2 as metal sulfides which are not predicted to interfere with the microbial biochemical reactions at the ph of this experiment utgikar et al 2002 to assess the possible inhibitory effects of h2s we increased the clr from 29 1 to 113 4 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 on day 68 of operation fig 2 the increase in clr precipitated 84 of the h2s produced during phases i and ii as cus lessening the possible h2s inhibitory effects although only 16 of the produced h2s would persist unbounded to cu2 in phase i and ii the vspr remained invariable during this period 74 8 mg l 1 d 1 days 68 124 furthermore inhibitory effects on the activity of this inoculum were previously shown to start at 203 1 mg l 1 at a ph of 3 5 and 80 c hidalgo ulloa et al 2020 which is significantly higher than the highest free dissolved h2s concentrations encountered during the reactor operation phase iii 12 mg l 1 of free soluble h2s consequently averting sulfide inhibition through cus precipitation is unlikely the underlying cause behind the vspr increase during phase iv 4 3 nutrient effect in the vspr the determination of soluble so4 2 po4 3 and nh4 concentrations in the effluent suggests these macronutrients were not limiting during reactor operation fig 4 micronutrient concentrations in the influent were below the loq and therefore micronutrient limitations could not be quantified essential metals involved in fundamental cell processes and the development of metalloproteins and metalloenzymes such as copper nickel or cobalt are likely unavailable in sulfide rich anoxic environments due to precipitation with h2s as metal sulfides anbar and knoll 2002 constraints on micronutrient bioavailability may restrict microbial development in a sulfidogenic system hence limiting the vspr however research from high throughput sulfidogenic systems suggests that h2s production does not hinder microbial growth of sulfidogenic microorganisms by micronutrient limitation bijmans et al 2010 reported high throughput sulfidogenic so4 2 reduction rates of 14 5 g l 1 d 1 in a membrane bioreactor operated at ph 4 without h2s scavenging from the reactor liquor and an equivalent micronutrient composition to that utilized in this work these results suggest that micronutrient limitations owing to h2s precipitation do not constitute a limiting factor for sulfidogenic microbial activity in acidic environments these observations are in agreement with the vspr development in this study where no changes in vspr were observed following a 10 increase in the micronutrient concentration in the influent days 84 91 furthermore despite the increased soluble h2s concentration during phase iii the increased vspr nh4 consumption rate and tn buildup indicates that micronutrient bioavailability due to h2s precipitation was not a limiting factor throughout phases i and ii tungsten is a basal micronutrient missing from the original medium composition during the initial 70 days of operation due to the extreme selective pressure of sulfidogenic environments it has been proposed that sulfidogenic microorganisms evolved metalloenzymes with lower thiophilic trace metals such as tungsten or manganese maia et al 2016 on day 70 tungsten was included in the influent media however no effect on the vspr or nh4 consumption rate was determined suggesting tungsten absence was not constraining sulfidogenic microbial activity though tungsten is an essential micronutrient for extremophilic microorganisms sulfidogenic extremophiles have developed other strategies to survive without this element for instance the archaeon pyrodictium abyssi capable of s0 reduction with h2 possesses an enzyme complex composed of hydrogenase and sulfur reductase containing heme groups and fe s clusters without tungsten or molybdenum hedderich et al 1998 desulfurella amilsii is also found to contain rhodanese like sulfur transferases with no mo oxidoreductases detected under low ph conditions florentino et al 2019 4 4 so4 2 and s2o3 2 as alternate electron acceptors despite the presence of so4 2 throughout the reactor operation no quantifiable differences in the so4 2 concentrations in the effluent and influent were found during steady state periods discarding a contribution of so4 2 reduction to the vspr this is in agreement with the lack of thermoacidophilic so4 2 reducing microorganisms described to date in addition so4 2 reducing activity was observed to decrease significantly in reactor experiments below ph 4 bijmans et al 2010 johnson and santos 2020 and consistent with and in our prior reporting with this inoculum where no so4 2 reduction at ph 2 0 3 6 was found hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 2020 cu2 acts as a h2s scavenger thermodynamically enabling s0 disproportionation we previously reported disproportionation of s0 using the same inoculum when cu2 was supplied in excess to the h2s produced accounting for up to 50 of the h2s produced to precipitate the metal hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 despite the similarities in reactor configuration media inoculum ph and temperature conditions to our prior reporting no so4 2 accumulation as proxy for s0 disproportionation was found although desulfurella species have been reported to grow through s0 disproportionation florentino et al 2016a the mechanism by which disproportionation metabolism is triggered is yet unclear we explored the possibility of s2o3 2 as a possible terminal electron acceptor under the conditions of our system s2o3 2 respiration is also encountered in non so4 2 reducing bacterial species such as microorganisms of the genus shewanella making the s2o3 2 reduction a more widespread metabolism than so4 2 reduction simon and kroneck 2013 species from the genus thermoanaerobacterium are also reported capable of s2o3 2 reduction lee et al 1993 additionally thermoacidophilic microorganisms such as moorella mulderi have been reported to autotrophically reduce s2o3 2 to h2s under acidic ph 5 5 and high temperature 70 c conditions balk et al 2003 nevertheless we found no effect in the vspr or so4 2 concentration in the reactor after the addition of s2o3 2 to the reactor on day 119 suggesting that the subsequent decrease of s2o3 2 concentration in the reactor was the result of s2o3 2 washout or reduction to s0 4 5 s0 suspensibility s0 formed a metastable foam of polyhedral structure prior to the start of cu2 loading to the reactor days 0 32 accumulating in clusters in the reactor headspace or precipitating in the reactor bottom the foaming and clustering of s0 is driven by the hydrophobicity of s0 in water causing loss of reactor contents via the gas effluent and reducing the surface area of s0 crystals thereby limiting the transfer rate between the solid and liquid phases kleinjan et al 2006 steudel 2020 in prior experiments with s0 and metals unpublished we observed that the addition of metals reduced foaming and s0 clustering therefore the addition of cu2 during the start up phase was partly intended as foaming control with positive results supplementary information s i 5 we hypothesized that the improved s0 suspensibility after metal addition was due to physical hindrance caused by cus attachment to the s0 surface masking the hydrophobic properties of s0 after the cu2 addition in the reactor cu2 reacted swiftly with h2s forming cus as sole copper and sulfide precipitate for metal sulfides with low solubility products such as cus the localized and high level of supersaturation results in fines formation lewis and van hille 2006 the formed cus fines accumulated on the surface of the s0 crystals supplementary information s i 6 and thus most likely hindered the hydrophobic properties of s0 causing improved suspensibility of the s0 crystals physical hindrance of the s0 crystals with cus could result in s0 passivation preventing access to the electron acceptor and thus constraining sulfidogenic microbial activity when physical contact between s0 and the cells was prevented in a dialysis membrane reactor with desulfurella amilsii a half fold decrease in the sulfidogenic activity was observed indicating that microbial attachment to the s0 surface is beneficial for sulfur uptake yet not essential florentino et al 2019 with the decrease in temperature and subsequent increase in clr in phases iii and iv we observed an increase in vspr compared to the previous phases therefore s0 passivation is unlikely to have limited the s0 bioavailability in this experiment nevertheless s0 passivation due to metal sulfide formation is a critical parameter to consider when optimizing a single stage sulfidogenic and metal precipitation process for the potential limitations in s0 availability due to passivation thus optimization of s0 feeding strategies must be considered in the operation of s0 reducing systems targeting the recovery of metals in a single unit 5 conclusion this work established a continuous single stage thermoacidophilic s0 reducing and metal sulfide precipitating process temperature rather than electron donor acceptor or nutrient availability was an important limiting factor as shown by the 3 2 fold increase in vspr upon a decrease from 80 c to 60 c the maximum vspr of 274 6 mg l 1 d 1 was reached in the phases where copper loading rates were higher than the sulfidogenic production rates indicating metal stimulation of the microbial s0 reduction metabolism the inclusion of copper in the reactor improved s0 suspensibility likely through physical hindrance with cus and therefore s0 feeding strategies should be considered in the process optimization this study serves as a crucial first step in the development of a novel single stage s0 reducing and metal sulfide precipitating process for metal recovery from hydrometallurgical streams the vspr in this study remains one order of magnitude lower than that of currently available sulfidogenic technologies future research should aim to optimize the process to fully understand its economic implications as well as to explore the challenges and advantages of a single

14826,metal sulfide precipitation is a viable technology for high yield metal recovery from hydrometallurgical streams with the potential to streamline the process design a single stage elemental sulfur s0 reducing and metal sulfide precipitating process can optimize the operational and capital costs associated with this technology boosting the competitiveness of this technology for wider

require an increasing metal recovery yield from ores that are currently discarded in waste rocks and mining tailings falagán et al 2017 sulfidogenic technologies increase the recovery yield of base metals from complex mineral ores by exploiting differences in metal sulfide solubility across a wide ph range while benefiting from a concentrated metal sludge that requires less downstream processing than metal oxy hydroxide precipitation methods adams et al 2008 kieu et al 2011 sulfidogenesis for metal recovery is available in the market the canadian company bqe water and the dutch paques b v have branded sulfidogenic systems successfully commissioned for the hydrometallurgical industry johnson and santos 2020 nonetheless sulfidogenic systems are not widespread in the hydrometallurgical industry for the operational and capital costs restrain the industry interest so less efficient metal recovery technologies are still favored florentino et al 2015 sanchez andrea et al 2016 current biological sulfidogenic systems are compartmentalized into two stages comprising a biological and a chemical unit johnson and santos 2020 sulfur is reduced in the biological unit under optimal controlled conditions commonly opposed to the extreme temperature and ph conditions of the hydrometallurgical stream this process separation further allows tailoring the bioreactor performance to fit the process s specific requirements johnson and hallberg 2005 the biologically produced hydrogen sulfide h2s is transported into the chemical unit by an innocuous carrier gas e g n2 florentino et al 2016b where it reacts with the metals in the process waters the transportation of h2s into the chemical contactor and the process compartmentalization contribute to the cost increase of current sulfidogenic systems florentino et al 2016b holanda and johnson 2020 a single stage sulfidogenic system in which sulfur reduction occurs in the hydrometallurgical process waters is a cost effective flow scheme compared to two stage systems simplifying the operation to a single stage process reduces manpower decreases operating and maintenance costs and maintains a homogeneous distribution of h2s inside the bioreactor johnson et al 2006 villa gomez et al 2011 drastically reducing the operational and capital costs the bottleneck of this technology jameson et al 2010 kumar et al 2021 s0 reduction is preferred over sulfate reduction as it decreases by 4 fold the electron donor consumption florentino et al 2016b moreover s0 reduction is a common trait in thermoacidophilic microorganisms crucial to cope with the conditions of hydrometallurgical process waters which are commonly hot 40 90 c acidic ph 4 and contain inhibitory metal and metalloid concentrations falagán et al 2017 hedrich et al 2018 holanda and johnson 2020 kaksonen et al 2003 ňancucheo et al 2017 retka et al 2020 sulfidogenic capable microorganisms also exhibit an increased tolerance to high metal concentrations hedderich et al 1998 increasing the feasibility of a one stage process we previously reported autotrophic s0 reduction using mesophile microorganisms from a granular sludge as inoculum in a 4 l gas lift bioreactor operated in batch we documented vspr up to 70 10 mg l 1 d 1 using this inoculum under hot 80 c acidic ph 3 5 and high metal concentrations up to 1143 mg l 1 cu2 hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 2020 we extend our previous work with this inoculum investigating the sulfidogenic activity of these microorganisms in a gas lift reactor continuously fed with mineral medium under high temperature 60 80 c and acidic ph 3 6 conditions we investigated the effect on the vspr of critical parameters such as h2 and co2 flow rate hydraulic retention time hrt copper loading rate clr and temperature finally we identified the microbial community involved in reducing s0 in our system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation we inoculated a glass gas lift reactor with a working volume of 4 l fig 1 with granular wet sludge originating from a sulfate reducing bioreactor with low methane production at the industrial park getec formerly emmtec located in emmen nl the granular sludge henceforth emmen sludge originated from an anaerobic uasb type bioreactor fed with ethanol as the sole electron and carbon donor the gas lift reactor was continuously fed with mineral medium and cu2 through independent influents fig 1 cu2 was loaded to the reactor as a cuso4 5h2o at a constant solution flow rate of 73 3 ml d 1 the cu2 solution concentration was adjusted to regulate the cu2 loading rate clr the influent vessel was continuously sparged with n2 o2 0 5 ppmv linde gas benelux b v nl to preserve the anoxic conditions of the influent settleable

benelux b v and co2 99 99 linde gas benelux b v as sole electron and carbon donors the gas was recirculated to the reactor at a rate of 50 80 l h 1 to enhance gas transfer and mixture free h2s was stripped from the effluent gas in a 5 m naoh solution equipment specifications are listed in the supplementary information s i 1 mineral medium 3 l was added to the reactor two hours prior to inoculation and the reactor temperature was set to 80 c low phosphate mineral medium described by hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 was used during the reactor operation tungsten a basal micronutrient for some extremophiles and initially absent from the medium composition was included as na2wo4 2h2o 0 1 µm on day 70 of operation yeast extract 0 1 g l 1 was added as an additional carbon source during the reactor inoculation the medium in the reactor was sparged with n2 25 ml s 1 1 h the gas influent was then changed to a mixture of h2 2 8 l h 1 and co2 0 7 l h 1 simultaneously 400 g of the emmen sludge 25 g dry weight was suspended in 500 ml of demineralized water the ph of the sludge suspension was corrected to 4 0 with a 1 m h2so4 solution and subsequently sparged with n2 25 ml s 1 0 5 h afterward biological s0 10 g l 1 s0 was suspended in the reactor and the reactor was inoculated with the sludge suspension the s0 used was originated from a sulfide s2 oxidizing reactor from a food waste digester soluble impurities in the s0 were removed using multiple 2 1 extractions with demineralized water the s0 water suspension was manually agitated for 3 min centrifuged at 3620 g for 5 min and the resulting pellet recovered the procedure was repeated until the suspension reached a conductivity 80 µs cm 1 the recovered s0 30 g was resuspended in 50 ml falcon tubes with demineralized water and the elemental composition of the suspension was determined through icp oes s0 was supplied to the reactor in batches on periods of 1 to 4 days estimating the mass of s0 consumed from the mass of h2s produced in that period the reactor operation lasted 206 days under acidic ph 3 6 and hot 80 60 c conditions the effects of different regimes of clr hrt temperature and h2 and co2 influent flow rates on the volumetric sulfide production rates vspr were examined during the reactor operation compartmentalized into five phases including a start up phase each phase started after the steady

the supplementation of cu2 into the influent feed maintaining an initial clr of 29 1 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 day 32 in phase i days 68 101 the clr was increased to 113 4 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 day 68 and the h2 flow rate was then raised to 5 6 l d 1 day 81 possible micronutrient deficiency was evaluated by increasing 10 of the micronutrient content in the medium days 84 91 in phase ii day 101 124 the hrt was decreased to 1 5 0 1 d day 101 on day 111 the h2 influent flow rate was decreased to 4 0 l h 1 and the co2 influent flow rate was increased to 1 0 l h 1 we explored thiosulfate as a possible electron acceptor during this phase by adding 4 5 g nas2o3 5h2o to the reactor in phase iii days 124 175 the h2 and co2 influent flow rates were restored to 2 8 and 0 7 l h 1 respectively and the temperature

80 c the vspr appeared unaffected by changes in operating parameters a vspr of 74 6 mg l 1 d 1 s2 was reached during the steady state at the end of the start up phase days 58 68 and remained unchanged by the subsequent changes induced in phase i and ii table 1 a clear influence of temperature was observed upon the transition from 80 c to 60 c in phase iii in which an average steady state vspr of 235 22 mg l 1 d 1 s2 was reached days 155 175 the maximum vspr was observed upon the increase of the clr in phase iv from 107 0 to 509 11 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 days 175 206 respectively resulting in an

sulfidogenic activity in phase iii the clr increase in phase iv resulted in a lower free dissolved h2s remaining below loq 0 2 mg l 1 in this phase the reactor ph rose from 3 8 to 5 1 after

medium further lowered the reactor ph to 3 7 0 1 day 18 operational conditions were maintained except when interruptions in operation occurred supplementary information s i 2 interruptions in operation interfered with maintaining a stable ph on days 21 32 fig 3 cu2 feeding began on day 32 with an initial clr of 29 1 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 fig 2 upon the start of cu2 loading the ph stabilized at 3 6 0 1 until the completion of the experiment fig 3 the oxidation reduction potential orp in the reactor remained in a reductive state except in phase iv when the orp increased averaging 235 23 mv during steady state fig 3 xrd analysis of the precipitates at the end of every steady state revealed covellite cus as the sole copper sulfur precipitate formed throughout the reactor operation supplementary information s i 3 no evidence of an amorphous phase was found in the diffractograms of the precipitates suggesting that no amorphous copper precipitates were formed this finding was further supported by the mass balance of naoh for ph maintenance in the reactor covellite formation generates two protons per mole of copper precipitated whereas chalcocite cu2s formation produces one proton per mole of copper precipitated the molar flow rate of naoh throughout the reactor operation based on the volume and concentration of naoh consumed to maintain the reactor ph yielded a ratio of 1 93 mol of naoh per mole of copper precipitated supplementary information s i 3 this ratio aligns with the identification of covellite by the xrd analysis conclusively demonstrating the formation of covellite as the sole copper sulfide precipitate consequently the vspr eq 1 during the periods of cu2 addition accounted the sulfide content in the copper sulfide precipitates based on a 1 1 cu s ratio total sulfur concentration in the reactor exhibited variations throughout the operation and appeared to be independent of the hydraulic retention time supplementary information s i 4 while s0 tended to foam and accumulate at the water gas interface of the reactor at the effluent height this decreased after the initiation of cu2 loading supplementary information s i 5 sem edx analysis revealed that cus fines adhered to the surface of the sulfur crystals supplementary information s i 6 during phases i to iv changes in the total sulfur concentration in the reactor were concurrent with variations in the total copper concentration notably no observable sedimentation of solids occurred within the reactor however copper sulfide precipitates were observed to accumulate at the bottom of the settler these precipitates would periodically detach from the settler and reintegrate into the reactor subsequently influencing the total sulfur concentration in the reactor 3 2 reduction of other sulfur species and nutrient analysis the so4 2 supplied during reactor operation in the mineral medium and as cuso4 5h2o could serve as an additional electron acceptor for sulfidogenesis however no significant differences in the so4 2 concentration in the influent and effluent were found during steady state in phases i to iv fig 4 in addition to so4 2 reduction we evaluated the viability of s2o3 2 as electron acceptor under phase ii conditions by supplying 4 5 g nas2o3 5h2o dissolved in 50 ml of demineralized water on day 119 on day 122 the s2o3 2 concentration in the reactor liquor was under the limit of quantification loq 0 1 mg l 1 the decrease in s2o3 2 concentration was not accompanied by variations in the vspr the consumption of nh4 and accumulation of total nitrogen served as an indicator for biomass growth the concentration of nh4 in the reactor effluent and influent significantly differed over the initial 68 days of operation precluding the assessment of biomass growth during this period the nh4 uptake rate did not vary significantly between phases i and ii remaining at 0 71 0 13 and 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 table 1 respectively the nh4 uptake rate increased with the increasing vspr in phases iii and iv reaching 1 2 0 3 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 during phase iii and 2 4 0 1 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 in phase iv a similar trend in the accumulation of tn was noted showing an increasing trend during the reactor operation however the differences in tn among the initial three phases were not significant preventing the estimation of nitrogen accumulated in these phases table 1 the significant increase in the tn concentration throughout phases iii and iv allowed the quantification of nitrogen accumulation in the reactor liquor with tn concentrations of 52 7 1 2 and 70 9 4 2 mg l 1 during the steady state of these phases respectively micronutrient concentrations in the mineral medium were below loq 0 1 mg l 1 and therefore could not be tracked during the reactor operation the micronutrient concentration in the mineral media was increased by 10 days 84 91 to identify potential micronutrient limitations despite the increased micronutrient concentration during this period no significant changes in the vspr 69 1 mg l 1 d 1 s2 were found from day 70 until the end of the operation 0 1 µm of tungsten was added to the mineral media as na2wo4 2h2o however this did not result in immediate quantifiable effects on the vspr fig 2 during the reactor operation ch4 alcohols c1 c6 and vfas c2 c8 were analyzed to determine the metabolization of other microbial products other than h2s however no other microbial metabolite other than sulfide was found 3 3 microbial community in the samples after quality control and filtering of the sequenced 16s rrna amplicons between 3687 and 475 998 reads remained per reactor sample and 12 reads for the negative dna extraction control supplementary information s i 7 in the steady state at 80 c day 101 ralstonia 46 9 8 8 and an unknown genus from the family alicyclobacillaceae 22 6 8 4 were the dominant genera detected in the sequence reads fig 5 in samples from the steady state at 60 c reads ascribed to the genus desulfurella accounted for 74 0 9 3 and 72 5 4 3 on days 159 and 175 respectively whereas thermoanaerobacterium accounted for 18 5 12 0 and 26 1 4 5 of reads on subsequent timepoints a low number of reads was assigned to ralstonia 3 8 3 8 and 1 1 0 0 respectively fig 5 it should be noted that ralstonia and bifidobacterium were also detected among the 12 reads from the negative control that remained after filtering not shown dna extraction from the reactor samples yielded low amounts of dna 1 ng ul 1 in 50 ul elution volume and concentrations after pcr amplification from day 101 samples were low 1 ng ul 1 compared to those from days 159 1 6 ng ul 1 and 175 13 3 16 7 ng ul 1 supplementary information s i 7 the presence of contaminants in samples from day 101 could have a disproportionate effect on microbial community composition 4 discussion 4 1 temperature effect on the sulfidogenic activity and microbial composition the steady vspr and nh4 consumption rates during phases i and ii despite the changes in hrt micronutrient concentration and electron and carbon donor input suggest that these parameters were not limiting the vspr under these conditions the vspr throughout phases i and ii table 1 were comparable to the vspr previously reported in batch experiments using the same inoculum 70 mg l 1 d 1 s2 under similar ph 3 1 3 5 and temperature 80 c conditions hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 2020 although the solubility of s0 h2 and co2 in the reactor liquor is affected by the decrease in temperature the high temperature conditions appear to be the main limiting factor in the microbial development in the phases at 80 c the increase in vspr nh4 uptake rate and tn accumulation in the reactor in response to the temperature decrease in phase iii support our hypothesis the temperature decrease in phase iii induced a higher microbial activity with tn concentration in the reactor increasing by 1 2 fold and the nh4 consumption rate increasing by 2 3 fold relative to that in phase ii suggesting an increase in microbial growth during this phase the dominant taxa detected shifted from ralstonia and an unknown genus from the family alicyclobacillaceae during operation at 80 c phase ii day 101 to desulfurella and thermoanaerobacterium during steady state at 60 c phase iii day 159 and 175 while ralstonia and alicyclobacillaceae species have been reported in natural environments where other sulfur reducing thermoacidophile microorganisms are encountered hedrich and schippers 2020 so far the capacity for s0 reduction has not been reported within these genera at 60 c more than 70 of the amplicon sequence reads were assigned to the genus desulfurella desulfurella species are capable of s0 reduction with d amilsii as a versatile species active in moderately thermoacidophilic environments ph 3 8 6 9 optimum t 50 c and capable of heterotrophic and autotrophic growth florentino et al 2016a this versatility is reflected in the dominance of desulfurella in s0 reducing enrichments florentino et al 2015 and reactors guo et al 2021 2019 operated at heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions and at neutral and acidic ph the other dominant taxon detected the genus thermoanaerobacterium is not known for s0 reduction rather thermoanaerobacterium species described to date are chemoorganotrophs capable of reducing s2o3 2 to s0 or h2s growing at an optimum temperature between 55 and 70 c and a broad ph range between 3 2 to 8 5 onyenwoke and wiegel 2009 the changes in community composition upon the decrease in temperature combined with the increasing vspr nh4 and tn accumulation aforementioned indicate that the extreme temperature conditions were the main limiting factor s0 bioavailability is proposed to be a limiting factor in biological s0 reduction zhang et al 2018 due to the low solubility of s0 in water 430 nm s0 at 28 c kamyshny 2009 s0 solubility increases with temperature increasing s0 bioavailability s0 solubility in water is 3824 nm at 80 c two fold higher than s0 solubility at 60 c kamyshny 2009 thus the temperature decrease from 80 to 60 c in phase iii would then have decreased the s0 bioavailability limiting the maximum reachable vspr nevertheless the increase in vspr after the temperature decrease in spite of the decrease in s0 solubility in phase iii suggests that this was not that case similarly temperature determines the bioavailability of electron and carbon donors in the system by affecting the saturation concentrations of h2 and co2 of which co2 is particularly temperature dependent at 60 c henry s law constant yields saturation concentrations of h2 and co2 of 0 0012 and 0 64 g l 1 at 1 atm respectively and 0 0011 and 0 43 g l 1 at 80 c sander 2019 although the increased saturation concentration of h2 and co2 in phase iii would decrease electron and carbon donor limitations the increase in h2 and co2 solubility is unlikely to be the sole basis for the increase in vspr during this phase the increase of the h2 flow rate while maintaining the co2 flow rate during phase i resulted in a 45 decrease in the partial pressure of co2 in the influent gas the decrease in co2 partial pressure proportionately reduces the co2 saturation concentration in the liquor restricting the transference rate of co2 to the reactor liquor in favor of h2 this would constrain microbial growth in case of co2 limitations or enhance it in case of h2 limitations in either case the vspr would be impacted however no alterations in the vspr were found during this period days 81 101 furthermore in the case of h2 and co2 limitations in the phases at 80 c the increase in vspr at 60 c during phase iii would have been confined by the concentration increase of its limiting reagents however this was not the case although the molar saturation concentrations of h2 and co2 at 60 c are 1 1 and 1 5 fold higher than at 80 c respectively the molar vspr rise at 60 c was 3 3 fold higher than the vspr in the phases at 80 c consequently the compounding of these results suggests that the vspr at 80 c was not limited by electron and carbon donor availability 4 2 metal effect in the vspr interestingly while the initial increase in cu2 in phase i had no effect on the vspr in phase iv the vspr increased 1 2 fold after the clr was raised to exceed 10 of the h2s productivity in the previous phase we hypothesize that the increase in vspr during phase iv is a result of the orp increase from 181 9 mv to 235 23 mv caused by the excess cu2 relative to the vspr in this phase these results are consistent with our prior reporting with this inoculum in batch experiments in which a higher standard redox potential driven by different metals in the medium resulted in an increase of the vspr hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 in high concentrations metals accumulate in the cells disrupting the intracellular redox balance and producing free radicals harmful to the genetic material of the cell li et al 2022 the synthesis of thiol groups has been posited as a homeostatic mechanism in anaerobes li et al 2022 and aerobes banerjee 2012 for instance intracellular redox imbalances are countered by synthesizing sulfhydryl molecules such as glutathione in the outer membrane proteins balancing the intracellular redox potential maintaining the sulfhydryl side chain of cysteine on the surface proteins in a reduced state and trapping free radicals brimblecombe 2013 furthermore the synthesis of thiol groups in the outer membrane proteins has also been proposed as a possible pathway for s0 reducing microorganisms to anchor s0 in their respiratory metabolism florentino et al 2019 additionally the oxidation to disulfides of synthesized sulfhydryl molecules in the outer membrane proteins may result in s0 reduction not coupled to a respiratory mechanism eq 2 rabus et al 2013 2 2 rsh s 0 rssr h 2 s therefore the increase in vspr during phase iv may be the result of a increased s0 uptake and h2s generation through persulfide formation from the oxidation of thiol groups in the outer membrane proteins with s0 or b metal sulfide formation from the reaction with thiol groups synthesized in the outer membrane proteins fig 6 though the understanding of the mechanics of microbial s0 cleavage is beyond the scope of this work this hypothesis merits further research as understanding the stimulatory effects of increased metal concentrations on s0 reducing microorganisms could ultimately lead to feasible strategies to enhance the vspr for process optimization the addition of cu2 to the sulfidogenic reactor would lessen the potential inhibitory effects of sulfide over the microbial community in the reactor allowing further development of the vspr free dissolved h2s can inhibit microbial growth by binding with metals causing metallo enzyme deactivation or protein alteration disrupting the formation of native disulfide bonds in proteins mendes et al 2021 the inhibitory effects of h2s are lessened through its precipitation with cu2 as metal sulfides which are not predicted to interfere with the microbial biochemical reactions at the ph of this experiment utgikar et al 2002 to assess the possible inhibitory effects of h2s we increased the clr from 29 1 to 113 4 mg l 1 d 1 cu2 on day 68 of operation fig 2 the increase in clr precipitated 84 of the h2s produced during phases i and ii as cus lessening the possible h2s inhibitory effects although only 16 of the produced h2s would persist unbounded to cu2 in phase i and ii the vspr remained invariable during this period 74 8 mg l 1 d 1 days 68 124 furthermore inhibitory effects on the activity of this inoculum were previously shown to start at 203 1 mg l 1 at a ph of 3 5 and 80 c hidalgo ulloa et al 2020 which is significantly higher than the highest free dissolved h2s concentrations encountered during the reactor operation phase iii 12 mg l 1 of free soluble h2s consequently averting sulfide inhibition through cus precipitation is unlikely the underlying cause behind the vspr increase during phase iv 4 3 nutrient effect in the vspr the determination of soluble so4 2 po4 3 and nh4 concentrations in the effluent suggests these macronutrients were not limiting during reactor operation fig 4 micronutrient concentrations in the influent were below the loq and therefore micronutrient limitations could not be quantified essential metals involved in fundamental cell processes and the development of metalloproteins and metalloenzymes such as copper nickel or cobalt are likely unavailable in sulfide rich anoxic environments due to precipitation with h2s as metal sulfides anbar and knoll 2002 constraints on micronutrient bioavailability may restrict microbial development in a sulfidogenic system hence limiting the vspr however research from high throughput sulfidogenic systems suggests that h2s production does not hinder microbial growth of sulfidogenic microorganisms by micronutrient limitation bijmans et al 2010 reported high throughput sulfidogenic so4 2 reduction rates of 14 5 g l 1 d 1 in a membrane bioreactor operated at ph 4 without h2s scavenging from the reactor liquor and an equivalent micronutrient composition to that utilized in this work these results suggest that micronutrient limitations owing to h2s precipitation do not constitute a limiting factor for sulfidogenic microbial activity in acidic environments these observations are in agreement with the vspr development in this study where no changes in vspr were observed following a 10 increase in the micronutrient concentration in the influent days 84 91 furthermore despite the increased soluble h2s concentration during phase iii the increased vspr nh4 consumption rate and tn buildup indicates that micronutrient bioavailability due to h2s precipitation was not a limiting factor throughout phases i and ii tungsten is a basal micronutrient missing from the original medium composition during the initial 70 days of operation due to the extreme selective pressure of sulfidogenic environments it has been proposed that sulfidogenic microorganisms evolved metalloenzymes with lower thiophilic trace metals such as tungsten or manganese maia et al 2016 on day 70 tungsten was included in the influent media however no effect on the vspr or nh4 consumption rate was determined suggesting tungsten absence was not constraining sulfidogenic microbial activity though tungsten is an essential micronutrient for extremophilic microorganisms sulfidogenic extremophiles have developed other strategies to survive without this element for instance the archaeon pyrodictium abyssi capable of s0 reduction with h2 possesses an enzyme complex composed of hydrogenase and sulfur reductase containing heme groups and fe s clusters without tungsten or molybdenum hedderich et al 1998 desulfurella amilsii is also found to contain rhodanese like sulfur transferases with no mo oxidoreductases detected under low ph conditions florentino et al 2019 4 4 so4 2 and s2o3 2 as alternate electron acceptors despite the presence of so4 2 throughout the reactor operation no quantifiable differences in the so4 2 concentrations in the effluent and influent were found during steady state periods discarding a contribution of so4 2 reduction to the vspr this is in agreement with the lack of thermoacidophilic so4 2 reducing microorganisms described to date in addition so4 2 reducing activity was observed to decrease significantly in reactor experiments below ph 4 bijmans et al 2010 johnson and santos 2020 and consistent with and in our prior reporting with this inoculum where no so4 2 reduction at ph 2 0 3 6 was found hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 2020 cu2 acts as a h2s scavenger thermodynamically enabling s0 disproportionation we previously reported disproportionation of s0 using the same inoculum when cu2 was supplied in excess to the h2s produced accounting for up to 50 of the h2s produced to precipitate the metal hidalgo ulloa et al 2022 despite the similarities in reactor configuration media inoculum ph and temperature conditions to our prior reporting no so4 2 accumulation as proxy for s0 disproportionation was found although desulfurella species have been reported to grow through s0 disproportionation florentino et al 2016a the mechanism by which disproportionation metabolism is triggered is yet unclear we explored the possibility of s2o3 2 as a possible terminal electron acceptor under the conditions of our system s2o3 2 respiration is also encountered in non so4 2 reducing bacterial species such as microorganisms of the genus shewanella making the s2o3 2 reduction a more widespread metabolism than so4 2 reduction simon and kroneck 2013 species from the genus thermoanaerobacterium are also reported capable of s2o3 2 reduction lee et al 1993 additionally thermoacidophilic microorganisms such as moorella mulderi have been reported to autotrophically reduce s2o3 2 to h2s under acidic ph 5 5 and high temperature 70 c conditions balk et al 2003 nevertheless we found no effect in the vspr or so4 2 concentration in the reactor after the addition of s2o3 2 to the reactor on day 119 suggesting that the subsequent decrease of s2o3 2 concentration in the reactor was the result of s2o3 2 washout or reduction to s0 4 5 s0 suspensibility s0 formed a metastable foam of polyhedral structure prior to the start of cu2 loading to the reactor days 0 32 accumulating in clusters in the reactor headspace or precipitating in the reactor bottom the foaming and clustering of s0 is driven by the hydrophobicity of s0 in water causing loss of reactor contents via the gas effluent and reducing the surface area of s0 crystals thereby limiting the transfer rate between the solid and liquid phases kleinjan et al 2006 steudel 2020 in prior experiments with s0 and metals unpublished we observed that the addition of metals reduced foaming and s0 clustering therefore the addition of cu2 during the start up phase was partly intended as foaming control with positive results supplementary information s i 5 we hypothesized that the improved s0 suspensibility after metal addition was due to physical hindrance caused by cus attachment to the s0 surface masking the hydrophobic properties of s0 after the cu2 addition in the reactor cu2 reacted swiftly with h2s forming cus as sole copper and sulfide precipitate for metal sulfides with low solubility products such as cus the localized and high level of supersaturation results in fines formation lewis and van hille 2006 the formed cus fines accumulated on the surface of the s0 crystals supplementary information s i 6 and thus most likely hindered the hydrophobic properties of s0 causing improved suspensibility of the s0 crystals physical hindrance of the s0 crystals with cus could result in s0 passivation preventing access to the electron acceptor and thus constraining sulfidogenic microbial activity when physical contact between s0 and the cells was prevented in a dialysis membrane reactor with desulfurella amilsii a half fold decrease in the sulfidogenic activity was observed indicating that microbial attachment to the s0 surface is beneficial for sulfur uptake yet not essential florentino et al 2019 with the decrease in temperature and subsequent increase in clr in phases iii and iv we observed an increase in vspr compared to the previous phases therefore s0 passivation is unlikely to have limited the s0 bioavailability in this experiment nevertheless s0 passivation due to metal sulfide formation is a critical parameter to consider when optimizing a single stage sulfidogenic and metal precipitation process for the potential limitations in s0 availability due to passivation thus optimization of s0 feeding strategies must be considered in the operation of s0 reducing systems targeting the recovery of metals in a single unit 5 conclusion this work established a continuous single stage thermoacidophilic s0 reducing and metal sulfide precipitating process temperature rather than electron donor acceptor or nutrient availability was an important limiting factor as shown by the 3 2 fold increase in vspr upon a decrease from 80 c to 60 c the maximum vspr of 274 6 mg l 1 d 1 was reached in the phases where copper loading rates were higher than the sulfidogenic production rates indicating metal stimulation of the microbial s0 reduction metabolism the inclusion of copper in the reactor improved s0 suspensibility likely through physical hindrance with cus and therefore s0 feeding strategies should be considered in the process optimization this study serves as a crucial first step in the development of a novel single stage s0 reducing and metal sulfide precipitating process for metal recovery from hydrometallurgical streams the vspr in this study remains one order of magnitude lower than that of currently available sulfidogenic technologies future research should aim to optimize the process to fully understand its economic implications as well as to explore the challenges and advantages of a single

14827,as a promising wastewater treatment technology aerobic granular sludge ags process is still hindered by slow granule formation and easy disintegration in the application while nitrate one of the target pollutants in wastewater showed a potential effect on ags granulation process herein this study attempted to reveal the role of nitrate in ags granulation by adding exogenous nitrate 10 mg l 1 the ags formation was markedly improved and accomplished at 63 d while the control group achieved ags formation at 87 d however a disintegration was observed under a long term nitrate feeding a positive correlation was observed among granule size extracellular polymeric substances eps and intracellular c di gmp level in both formation and disintegration phases the subsequent static biofilm assays indicated that nitrate might upregulate c di gmp via denitrification derived no and c di gmp further upregulated eps thereby promoting ags formation however excessive no probably caused disintegration by downregulating c di gmp and eps microbial community showed that nitrate favored the enrichment of denitrifiers and eps producing microbes which were responsible for the regulation of no c di gmp and eps metabolomics analysis showed that amino acid metabolism was the most affected metabolism by nitrate some amino acids such as arg his and asp were upregulated in the granule formation phase and downregulated in the disintegration phase indicating the potential contribution to eps biosynthesis this study provides metabolic insight into how nitrate promotes inhibits granulation which may contribute to unwrapping the mystery of granulation and overcoming the limitations of ags application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge ags nitrate c di gmp extracellular polymeric substances eps nitric oxide data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been highly regarded as a promising alternative to conventional activated sludge process because of good settling properties high biomass retention effective pollutants removal smaller land footprint and lower costs wang et al 2017 purba et al 2020 granules are self immobilized microspheres of mixed microorganisms it usually takes a long period tens of days or longer to develop the granules while sometimes granules are not stable enough and easy to collapse verawaty et al 2012 at present slow granule formation and easy disintegration are still bottlenecks affecting the large scale application of ags in wastewater treatment sarma and tay 2018 lin et al 2020 accumulated studies have shown that extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix secreted by microbes is an important component of ags and plays a major role in the process of granulation shi et al 2017 lin et al 2020 a high level of eps promotes the formation of ags whereas the reduction of eps in ags may lead to granule loosening and even disintegration liu et al 2021 eps is mainly composed of proteins pn polysaccharides ps and a small amount of extracellular nucleic acids lipids and humus pn is mostly hydrophobic which is conducive to the aggregation of microbes therefore pn has been considered as a key factor affecting the formation and stability of ags shi et al 2017 ps has strong adhesion ability and contains multiple functional groups which promotes cell cell adhesion and maintains the structure of granules wang et al 2017 li et al 2020 further studies showed that bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp a ubiquitous second signal molecule in bacteria was closely related to eps biosynthesis granule formation and disintegration wang et al 2017 rinaldo et al 2018 it is synthesized by diguanylate cyclase dgc with guanosine 5 triphosphate gtp and degraded into either linear 5 phosphoguanylyl 3 5 guanosine pgpg or guanosine 5 monophosphate gmp by phosphodiesterase pde high levels of intracellular c di gmp positively modulate the biosynthesis of pn and ps in eps and favor granulation whereas low levels of c di gmp promote disintegration through the reduction of eps matrix wu et al 2015 shi et al 2017 wille and coenye 2020 yang et al 2021 further metabolomics analysis showed that some amino acids such as phenylalanine phe leucine leu alanine ala and others were involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular pn and some sugar metabolites such as fructose 6 phosphate and glucose 6 phosphate were precursors of ps biosynthesis zhao et al 2018 recent study indicated that upregulation of c di gmp induced an increase of fructose 6 phosphate and udp n acetyl d glucosamine as well as an increase of amino acids to promote the biosynthesis of eps guo et al 2017 recently nitrate has been recognized to affect c di gmp and thus affect the life cycle of biofilm nitrate resulted in a high c di gmp level 1 3 10 4 fmol cell through denitrification to enhance the biofilm of comamonas testosteroni wu et al 2015 however nitrate was also reported to inhibit burkholderia pseudomallei biofilm by reducing the intracellular concentration of c di gmp mangalea et al 2017 further consideration was that denitrification derived nitric oxide no might behave as a more direct regulatory factor for the formation or dispersal of biofilm schlag et al 2007 rinaldo et al 2018 although the mechanism is still unclear no concentration is likely to be one of the important factors affecting the activity of dgc and or pde thereby affecting the level of c di gmp carlson et al 2010 park et al 2020 increasing evidence revealed that the tight relationship between nitrate and biofilm seems beyond simple nutrient utilization our previous research found that feeding nitrate in synthetic wastewater significantly promoted ags formation but the ags was more likely to disintegrate under a long term effect of nitrate it was speculated that this phenomenon might be related to the regulation of intracellular c di gmp and eps by nitrate but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unclear although a few studies showed that nitrate accelerated biofilm and ags formation wan and sperandio 2009 suja et al 2015 wu et al 2015 there were few reports about nitrate affecting the whole process of ags formation and disintegration nitrate is one of the target pollutants in wastewater treatment plants which not only comes from the influent directly but also is produced by bacteria through nitrogen conversion in view of the widespread existence of nitrate and the promising prospects of ags it is particularly necessary to reveal the role of nitrate in ags process which may potentially contribute to breaking the bottleneck of slow granule formation and easy disintegration therefore this study focused on understanding the effect of nitrate on ags granulation and interpreting the inherent mechanisms using quantitative detection microbial community analysis and metabolomics biotechnology 2 materials and methods 2 1 ags setup and operation two identical sequential batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 1 7 l were operated the sbrs had a volume exchange ratio of 50 an internal diameter of 6 cm and a height of 65 cm one reactor re was fed with synthetic wastewater containing additional nitrate 10 mg l 1 while the other control reactor rc was only fed with synthetic wastewater the seed sludge was collected from ji guan shi wastewater treatment plant chongqing china the suspended solids ss volatile suspended solids vss and sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 of the seed sludge were 11 42 g l 1 5 24 g l 1 and 56 94 l g 1 respectively the sludge was aerated for 48 h initially and then seeded to sbrs to maintain ss at 4 g l 1 each reactor was operated in a cycle of 6 h which consisted of feeding 5 min static period 25 min aeration 307 324 min settling period 20 3 min and effluent drawing period 3 min the settling time was decreased from 20 min to 3 min with the remaining being aeration period to promote sludge granulation the sludge retention time was kept at about 20 days during aeration period air was introduced via a fine bubble diffuser at the bottom of the reactor with a flowrate of 2 5 3 0 l min 1 to ensure good mixing and shear force in the reactor yilmaz et al 2008 the dissolved oxygen concentration was not controlled

then were ground with a mortar and pestle the homogeneous samples were further extracted by ultrasonication and methanol acetonitrile 1 1 v v extraction lc ms ms analysis for determining intracellular

ionization probe details were presented in text s2 2 7 static biofilm assay to investigate the role of nitrate in biofilm formation static biofilm assays were applied to cultivate the biofilms in the presence of nitrate 10 mg l 1 c di gmp 10 μg l 1 and sodium nitroprusside snp no producer 50 μg l 1 respectively barraud et al 2009 suja et al 2015 meanwhile mncl2 c di gmp inhibitor 1 m wang et al 2017 and nω nitro l arginine l nna no inhibitor 0 03 m idrizaj et al 2022 were used to eliminate the effect of c di gmp and snp respectively besides biofilms were also cultivated under 10 120 240 500 and 1000 μg l 1 of snp to investigate the effect of no concentration on biofilm formation for biofilms cultivation mixtures 200 μl of activated sludge 4 g l 1 and synthetic wastewater 1 1 v v

eps and c di gmp were determined as described in section 2 4 and 2 6 respectively each group contained at least six parallel samples 2 8 microbial community analysis the ags samples in sbrs were

in the granule formation phase affected by nitrate the ags samples at 63 d and 87 d in re were collected to understand the metabolomic differences in the granule disintegration phase affected by nitrate intracellular metabolites were extracted by methanol 80 extraction and ultrasonication untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed using vanquish horizon system coupled to q exactive hf x

projection vip analysis orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis opls da and kegg pathway enrichment for the statistical test student s t test was conducted in stats r 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of nitrate on ags granulation the ags was cultivated in two sbrs re and rc re was fed with synthetic wastewater containing additional nitrate 10 mg l 1 while rc was only fed with synthetic wastewater the mean granule size and biomass in re and rc were shown in fig 1 a in a general meaning the diameter of 200 μm is a threshold value to differentiate granular and floccular sludge dai et al 2020 the sludge becomes dominated with granules when 50 of sludge with granule size more than 200 μm the granule formation is achieved when 90 of sludge with granule size more than 200 μm pishgar et al 2019 granule size in re sustained rapid growth so that the sludge dominated with granules was observed at 21 d and ags formation was achieved at 63 d with a mean granule size of 557 6 μm subsequently a decrease in mean granule size was observed reaching 245 8 mm at 87 d in contrast the granule size in rc remained stable initially until the sludge dominated with granules was observed at 55 d with a mean granule size of 226 7 μm with granule size stepwise increased rc achieved granule formation at 87 d and the mean granule size was 397 6 μm consistent with the trend of granule size vss in re significantly increased to approximately 11 3 g l 1 at 63 d and then gradually decreased during the disintegration period whereas vss in rc presented an increasing trend after 55 d and reached 8 5 g l 1 at 87 d the granule morphologies of the two reactors at 21 d 63 d and 87 d were shown in fig 1b which more clearly illustrated the granulation process especially the formation of larger granules at 63 d and the disintegration at 87 d in re it was shown from fig 1c that there were dead cells in the two reactors in the early granulation 21 d speculating that these dead cells or their fragments might act as a core for granulation wang et al 2017 at 87 d large numbers of dead cells were observed in re further implying the granule disintegration in re from the granulation process and morphological changes it can be concluded that the addition of low concentration nitrate significantly promoted the formation of ags but the ags was more likely to disintegrate under a long term effect of nitrate wan and sperandio 2009 reported that nitrate improved ags formation and acted as a good alternative electron acceptor to reduce energy demand suja et al 2015 further investigated the positive role of nitrate on ags granulation similarly nitrate significantly enhanced comamonas testosteroni biofilm and reduced cell detachment from the biofilm wu et al 2015 in contrast mangalea et al 2017 found that nitrate inhibited the biofilm formation of burkholderia pseudomallei to date there were only a few reports addressing the promotion effect of nitrate on ags formation and even fewer reports describing the disintegration due to nitrate in view of the widespread existence of nitrate in wastewater treatment system and the application prospects of ags the role of nitrate in ags granulation is worthy of concern 3 2 ags performance the pollutants removal efficiency and settling property were shown in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency in re was basically stabilized at about 97 3 98 4 while in rc was mainly around 95 2 96 8 before 55 d and eventually increased to 97 7 fig 2a this result indicated that rapid ags formation slightly improved stability of cod removal although re appeared to disintegrate in the later period of operation the removal of cod was still unaffected this might be because the vss in re was still at a high level of 9 3 g l 1 during the disintegration period fig 1a the influent nh4 n concentration in the two reactors was maintained at 100 mg l 1 almost all the nh4 n was effectively removed in re while the effluent nh4 n in rc increased to 9 7 mg l 1 during the initial 30 days and then gradually decreased fig 2b in rc the concentration of nox n no3 n no2 n in effluent was high especially no2 n with a maximum concentration of 32 2 mg l 1 the accumulation of nox n was mainly due to the inefficient denitrification morales et al 2013 long et al 2014 in re with the addition of nitrate the effluent nox n concentration decreased it was shown that re always presented higher denitrification rates than rc from the beginning fig s2 indicating that the addition of nitrate in re enhanced the denitrification process and thus decreased the accumulation of nox n therefore high tn removal ability was achieved in re ranging from 80 5 to 94 2 while the tn removal efficiency in rc was between 53 5 and 83 4 this result showed that the tn removal efficiency in re was significantly p 0 001 anova improved due to the addition of nitrate with the rapid ags formation the svi30 in re was as low as 31 ml g 1 during 35 67 d which was lower than that in rc fig 2c however the svi30 exhibited an obvious upward trend during the disintegration period in re while remained relatively stable in rc this phenomenon indicated that the disintegration of granules would lead to poor settleability the above results showed that the main effect of nitrate on the effluent was to reduce the accumulation of nox n and improve the removal efficiency of tn in general tn removal efficiencies of gas ranged between 50 and 80 morales et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 pishgar et al 2019 ran et al 2022 the enhancement of tn removal efficiency was mainly attributed to the promotion of denitrification by nitrate moreover the rapid growth of granules due to the addition of nitrate was also conducive to maintaining a favorable environment for denitrification on the other hand the changes in granules also affected settling performance especially the granule disintegration caused by long term effect of nitrate might result in a poor settleability therefore nitrate exhibited an important effect on wastewater treatment using ags system understanding the role of nitrate is of great significance in practical application to maintain excellent effluent quality and stable settleability 3 3 eps in response to nitrate eps contains multiple microbial metabolites that plays a major role in ags granulation shi et al 2017 li et al 2020 liu et al 2021 therefore it was inevitable to investigate the variation of eps in re and rc the eps content in re markedly increased from 22 9 to 110 7 mg g 1 vss during 0 55 d and then decreased whereas the eps content in rc increased slowly from 23 1 to 87 7 mg g 1 vss during 0 87 d fig 3 a this result indicated that the addition of nitrate stimulated but also decreased eps secretion the pn ps ratio exceeded 2 in both re and rc fig 3a indicating that pn was the main component of eps and probably the principal reason for granulation shi et al 2017 liu et al 2021 interestingly the content of ps decreased during the disintegration period in re fig 3a suggesting that ps contributed to granule structure li et al 2020 from the distribution of pn and ps on the granular surface fig 3b it was shown that pn dominated on the surface of ags in the early granulation while ps dominantly distributed on the surface of ags after granule formation at 63 d in re and 87 d in rc respectively moreover the distribution of ps almost dispersed at 87 d in re these results further demonstrated that pn contributed to promoting granule formation and ps played an important role in maintaining granule structure 3 4 c di gmp in response to nitrate the granulation is also likely related to the regulation of c di gmp which is a second messenger in bacterial communication wu et al 2015 mangalea et al 2017 wang et al 2017 therefore quantification of intracellular c di gmp was conducted fig 4 a the concentration of c di gmp in re markedly increased during 0 49 d reaching the maximum level of 60 μg l 1 and then decreased during 49 87 d reaching the minimum level of 21 μg l 1 in contrast the concentration of c di gmp in rc continuously increased to 45 μg l 1 at 87 d the above results indicated that nitrate triggered higher levels of intracellular c di gmp but also resulted in lower levels of c di gmp it was considered that c di gmp affected the granulation process possibly by regulating eps wang et al 2017 in this study spearman analysis showed that c di gmp had a close correlation with eps and granule size in both reactors especially in re fig 4b therefore it was speculated that c di gmp was likely to regulate eps and subsequent granulation and nitrate enhanced this correlation how nitrate interacted with c di gmp was further investigated by static biofilm assays fig 5 a in group i compared with the control group nitrate markedly improved the growth of biofilm confirming that nitrate played a positive role in biofilm formation in group ii c di gmp markedly improved biofilm growth while mn2 a c di gmp inhibitor decreased the biofilm growth by inhibiting the c di gmp level confirming that biofilm formation was regulated by the level of c di gmp in group iii snp a no producer improved the growth of biofilm while lnna a no inhibitor inhibited biofilm growth suggesting that no might also participate in the regulation of biofilm formation furthermore the variation of c di gmp and eps in the biofilms treated by these different reagents was determined higher levels of c di gmp and eps were observed in the biofilms promoted by nitrate c di gmp and no and vice versa lower levels of c di gmp and eps were presented in the inhibited biofilms conclusively biofilm formation was possibly promoted by high levels of eps which was regulated by high levels of c di gmp considering that nitrate no and c di gmp were equally facilitative to biofilm formation and with the fact that higher denitrification rates were observed in re fig s2 no rather than nitrate was likely to be a more direct regulator a limited amount of no was reported to facilitate the biofilm formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa park et al 2020 similarly no produced from snp showed a promotion effect on the formation of ags suja et al 2015 however conflicts showed that 500 nm of snp resulted in about 80 biofilm dispersal of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10 μm of snp reduced approximately 60 of staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm mass barraud et al 2006 barraud et al 2009 no is a signaling molecule able to influence the level of c di gmp which may decrease c di gmp level after activation of pde or inhibition of dgc and is also hypothesized to activate dgc or inhibit pde to increase c di gmp level rinaldo et al 2018 park et al 2020 whether increase or decrease in c di gmp level was probably related to the homeostatic levels of no park et al 2020 with the increase of snp concentrations fig 5b both c di gmp and biofilm showed a trend of rising first and then decreasing demonstrating that no level regulated formation and dispersal through regulating c di gmp level more specifically as shown in fig 5c nitrate resulted in an increase of no level through denitrification pathway within an appropriate concentration range increasing no concentration upregulated the level of c di gmp then stimulated the secretion of eps and favored biofilm formation however excessive no resulted in the downregulation of c di gmp level and thus reduced the secretion of eps which led to biofilm dispersal the addition of nitrate increased the level of no in re but under a long term effect of nitrate it might cause excessive no changes in the concentrations of no in re were likely to be partly a reason for promoting formation and causing disintegration of ags in fig 1a 3 5 microbial community response to nitrate to evaluate the effect of nitrate on microorganisms the microbial communities of seed sludge ss re and rc were analyzed by high throughput sequencing a total of 310 586 otus were found and the coverage of each sample was more than 99 6 indicating adequate sequencing depth principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distances of otus showed that re was markedly different from rc and ss pc1 31 19 fig s3 re had a higher value than rc in chao and shannon index table s1 indicating that re had a more diversified and abundant microbial community the detailed bacterial structure and relative abundance at phylum and genus levels were further clarified re and rc had similar structures at phylum level but differed in abundance fig s4 the dominant phyla were patescibacteria proteobacteria actinobacteriota and bacteroidota in the two reactors it seems that the addition of nitrate increased the abundance of bacteroidota and actinobacteriota but decreased the abundance of patescibacteria and proteobacteria at genus level tm7a microbacterium micropruina and amaricoccus were genera with high abundance in both two reactors fig 6 a in depth analysis was further carried out by the lefse algorithm to illustrate the main difference in genus level fig 6b and the biomarkers were found at a linear discriminant analysis lda score of 3 5 fig 6c the result showed that re contained more biomarkers in which paracoccus was reported to be an important denitrifier responsible for denitrification wang et al 2021 and devosia flavobacterium and micropuina were related to eps production huang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 the above results indicated that nitrate mainly helped ags to enrich denitrifying microbes and eps producing microbes therefore the abundance of denitrifying bacteria expressing nir genes was further quantitatively determined and the result showed that the abundance of denitrifying bacteria in re was always much higher than that in rc fig 7 a this result was consistent with the result that the tn removal efficiency in re was higher than that in rc fig 2b the nir genes are responsible for the reduction of nitrite to no park et al 2020 the presence of denitrifying bacteria expressing nir genes demonstrated the production of no in the two reactors and the higher abundance in re indicated that the concentration of no in re might be always higher than that in rc this result provided an extra evidence for the role of no in ags granulation on the other hand the picrust2 fig 7b functional forecast showed that more functional enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis appeared in re compared with rc at 21d such as the functional enzymes related to the synthesis of arginine arg glutamate glu glutamine gln histidine his and proline pro meanwhile the abundance of functional enzymes relating to glucose mannose galactose glucose 6 phosphate and fructose 6 phosphate also increased in re this result further indicated that nitrate might induce the increase of eps producing microbes which were responsible for the production of pn and ps in eps under the regulation of c di gmp 3 6 metabolomics response to nitrate untargeted metabolomics was conducted to reveal more instant details of ags in response to nitrate a total of 998 metabolites were detected mainly including amino acids lipids sugars and nucleotides opls da analysis was applied to assess metabolic changes in the granule formation phase fig s5 and disintegration phase fig s6 affected by nitrate the clear separation of re and rc indicated a significant difference in metabolites expression differentially expressed metabolites were normalized and hierarchically clustered by vip score the results suggested that 23 metabolites with statistically significant differences vip 1 p 0 05 were identified between re and rc at 21 d and 63 d in which 18 metabolites were upregulated and 5 metabolites were downregulated in re fig 8 such dominant upregulation indicated that nitrate exerted promoting influence on microbial metabolism during granule formation phase by comparing the metabolic differences between the formation phase 63 d and the disintegration phase 87 d in re 28 metabolites with statistically significant differences vip 1 p 0 05 were identified in which 25 metabolites were downregulated and 3 metabolites were upregulated at 87 d fig 9 indicating that nitrate exerted repressing influence on microbial metabolism during the disintegration phase kegg enrichment analysis showed that nitrate significantly affected 15 metabolic pathways involved in amino acid metabolism lipid metabolism biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites metabolism of other amino acids translation and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins figs 8 9 the detailed information of metabolites and their related pathways were shown in the supplementary information table s2 s4 in the ags formation process amino acid metabolism was the most affected metabolism by nitrate at 21 d aspartate asp and ornithine orn were significantly upregulated in re which were derived from alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and arginine biosynthesis respectively fig 8a b at 63 d arg derived from arginine biosynthesis and his derived from histidine metabolism were significantly upregulated in re fig 8c d in addition glu gln pro methionine met isoleucine ile asparagine asn tryptophan trp phe and tyrosine tyr also showed higher abundance in re than those in rc fig 10 meanwhile some sugar metabolites involved in the metabolism of galactose glucose 6 phosphate and fructose 6 phosphate also showed higher abundance during the ags formation phase fig 10 in this study the amino acids upregulated in re were the twenty building block amino acids of pn except for orn but the upregulation of orn contributed to the biosynthesis of arg through urea cycle previous study showed that phe leu ala threonine thr glycine gly glu and valine val contributed to the biosynthesis of extracellular pn and fructose 6 phosphate and glucose 6 phosphate were the precursor substances in the biosynthesis of ps in anammox aggregates zhao et al 2018 the biosynthesis of his was reported to have a major impact on the biofilm formation of staphylococcus xylosus zhou et al 2018 therefore the upregulated amino acids and sugar metabolites in re were likely to be essential for promoting the biosynthesis of pn and ps in eps of ags fig 10 furthermore it was reported that high levels of c di gmp induced the increase of fructose 6 phosphate udp n acetyl d glucosamine and some amino acids guo et al 2017 thus these upregulated amino acids and sugar metabolites in re might result from the upregulation of c di gmp by nitrate moreover as indicated by picrust2 functional forecast much more functional enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and sugar metabolism appeared in re compared with rc fig 7b therefore c di gmp might probably promote eps biosynthesis by activating functional enzymes to upregulate certain amino acids and sugar metabolites on the other hand arg was reported to be possibly involved in c di gmp metabolism mills et al 2015 barrientos moreno et al 2020 therefore the upregulation of arg might possibly in turn contribute to increasing intracellular level of c di gmp together with no rinaldo et al 2018 nitrate also affected lipid metabolism in the granule formation phase fig 8 sphingolipid metabolism with its related metabolites n palmitoylsphingosine ceramide and 2s 3r 2 aminooctadecane 1 3 diol sphinganine were downregulated cetin suberine and wax biosynthesis with its related metabolite 16 hydroxyhexadecanoic acid hha were upregulated it was suggested that hha was probably a sign of biofilm formation chao et al 2010 for the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites flavin mononucleotide fmn in riboflavin metabolism was also upregulated which not only participated in c di gmp production but also had an important role in biofilm cell respiration de vriendt et al 2005 bordeleau et al 2010 during the disintegration phase in re most of the metabolisms in the disintegrated ags at 87 d were downregulated compared with the intact ags at 63 d fig 9 with the decrease of c di gmp arginine biosynthesis alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism histidine metabolism lysine biosynthesis arginine and proline metabolism were markedly downregulated in re causing a significant decrease in arg his serine ser orn and asp besides glu gln met trp phe asn and pro also showed lower abundance at 87 d than those at 63 d fig s7 these results further demonstrated that the decrease of c di gmp might result in the decrease of pn in eps besides saccharopine and l 2 aminoadipic acid which were involved in lysine biosynthesis were downregulated in lipid metabolism many metabolites in cutin suberin and wax biosynthesis were downregulated taurine and l cysteic acid were downregulated in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism l dopa which was involved in betalain metabolism was downregulated in re the downregulation of l dopa was believed to inhibit biofilm formation alhumaidi et al 2020 3 7 significance of this study to the best of our knowledge this work might be the first attempt to reveal the contradictory role of nitrate in ags granulation nitrate was likely to facilitate granule formation but also result in disintegration under a long term effect the intracellular second messenger c di gmp signaling system played a significant role in this process this signaling pathway was modulated by nitrate via denitrification derived no and caused deep metabolic changes which ultimately promoted granule formation or led to disintegration this study provides insights for revealing the complex relationship between nitrate and ags and guides studies for further understanding the mechanism of ags granulation this study is also meaningful to provide new thought for the development of ags technology in practical application the slow ags formation and unpredictable disintegration are bottlenecks of this technology which ultimately affect the effluent quality and settleability by regulating the signaling system through nitrate in wastewater ags formation would be promoted and the disintegration caused by nitrate would be possibly avoided by adjusting operation strategies the concentration of nitrate or more accurately no might be the key to modulate formation or disintegration further investigations will be expected to identify threshold concentrations of nitrate or evaluate the effect of pulse rather than continuous dosing on granulation 4 conclusions nitrate facilitated the formation of ags but also caused disintegration under a long term effect this was because no derived from nitrate denitrification within an appropriate concentration range upregulated the level of c di gmp which then stimulated the secretion of eps and promoted ags formation under a long term effect of nitrate however excessive no resulted in the downregulation of c di gmp level and thus reduced the secretion of eps which led to disintegration nitrate significantly improved tn removal efficiency but the disintegration resulted in a decrease of settleability with the addition of nitrate denitrifiers and eps producing bacteria were enriched which were responsible for the regulation of no c di gmp and eps metabolomics analysis showed that some amino acids such as arg his and asp were upregulated in the formation phase and downregulated in the disintegration phase suggesting the potential contribution to eps biosynthesis credit authorship contribution statement danqing wu investigation data curation

14827,as a promising wastewater treatment technology aerobic granular sludge ags process is still hindered by slow granule formation and easy disintegration in the application while nitrate one of the target pollutants in wastewater showed a potential effect on ags granulation process herein this study attempted to reveal the role of nitrate in ags granulation by adding exogenous nitrate 10 mg l 1 the ags formation was markedly improved and accomplished at 63 d while the control group achieved ags formation at 87 d however a disintegration was observed under a long term nitrate feeding a positive correlation was observed among granule size extracellular polymeric substances eps and intracellular c di gmp level in both formation and disintegration phases the subsequent static biofilm assays indicated that nitrate might upregulate c di gmp via denitrification derived no and c di gmp further upregulated eps thereby promoting ags formation however excessive no probably caused disintegration by downregulating c di gmp and eps microbial community showed that nitrate favored the enrichment of denitrifiers and eps producing microbes which were responsible for the regulation of no c di gmp and eps metabolomics analysis showed that amino acid metabolism was the most affected metabolism by nitrate some amino acids such as arg his and asp were upregulated in the granule formation phase and downregulated in the disintegration phase indicating the potential contribution to eps biosynthesis this study provides metabolic insight into how nitrate promotes inhibits granulation which may contribute to unwrapping the mystery of granulation and overcoming the limitations of ags application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge ags nitrate c di gmp extracellular polymeric substances eps nitric oxide data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been highly regarded as a promising alternative to conventional activated sludge process because of good settling properties high biomass retention effective pollutants removal smaller land footprint and lower costs wang et al 2017 purba et al 2020 granules are self immobilized microspheres of mixed microorganisms it usually takes a long period tens of days or longer to develop the granules while sometimes granules are not stable enough and easy to collapse verawaty et al 2012 at present slow granule formation and easy disintegration are still bottlenecks affecting the large scale application of ags in wastewater treatment sarma and tay 2018 lin et al 2020 accumulated studies have shown that extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix secreted by microbes is an important component of ags and plays a major role in the process of granulation shi et al 2017 lin et al 2020 a high level of eps promotes the formation of ags whereas the reduction of eps in ags may lead to granule loosening and even disintegration liu et al 2021 eps is mainly composed of proteins pn polysaccharides ps and a small amount of extracellular nucleic acids lipids and humus pn is mostly hydrophobic which is conducive to the aggregation of microbes therefore pn has been considered as a key factor affecting the formation and stability of ags shi et al 2017 ps has strong adhesion ability and contains multiple functional groups which promotes cell cell adhesion and maintains the structure of granules wang et al 2017 li et al 2020 further studies showed that bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp a ubiquitous second signal molecule in bacteria was closely related to eps biosynthesis granule formation and disintegration wang et al 2017 rinaldo et al 2018 it is synthesized by diguanylate cyclase dgc with guanosine 5 triphosphate gtp and degraded into either linear 5 phosphoguanylyl 3 5 guanosine pgpg or guanosine 5 monophosphate gmp by phosphodiesterase pde high levels of intracellular c di gmp positively modulate the biosynthesis of pn and ps in eps and favor granulation whereas low levels of c di gmp promote disintegration through the reduction of eps matrix wu et al 2015 shi et al 2017 wille and coenye 2020 yang et al 2021 further metabolomics analysis showed that some amino acids such as phenylalanine phe leucine leu alanine ala and others were involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular pn and some sugar metabolites such as fructose 6 phosphate and glucose 6 phosphate were precursors of ps biosynthesis zhao et al 2018 recent study indicated that upregulation of c di gmp induced an increase of fructose 6 phosphate and udp n acetyl d glucosamine as well as an increase of amino acids to promote the biosynthesis of eps guo et al 2017 recently nitrate has been recognized to affect c di gmp and thus affect the life cycle of biofilm nitrate resulted in a high c di gmp level 1 3 10 4 fmol cell through denitrification to enhance the biofilm of comamonas testosteroni wu et al 2015 however nitrate was also reported to inhibit burkholderia pseudomallei biofilm by reducing the intracellular concentration of c di gmp mangalea et al 2017 further consideration was that denitrification derived nitric oxide no might behave as a more direct regulatory factor for the formation or dispersal of biofilm schlag et al 2007 rinaldo et al 2018 although the mechanism is still unclear no concentration is likely to be one of the important factors affecting the activity of dgc and or pde thereby affecting the level of c di gmp carlson et al 2010 park et al 2020 increasing evidence revealed that the tight relationship between nitrate and biofilm seems beyond simple nutrient utilization our previous research found that feeding nitrate in synthetic wastewater significantly promoted ags formation but the ags was more likely to disintegrate under a long term effect of nitrate it was speculated that this phenomenon might be related to the regulation of intracellular c di gmp and eps by nitrate but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unclear although a few studies showed that nitrate accelerated biofilm and ags formation wan and sperandio 2009 suja et al 2015 wu et al 2015 there were few reports about nitrate affecting the whole process of ags formation and disintegration nitrate is one of the target pollutants in wastewater treatment plants which not only comes from the influent directly but also is produced by bacteria through nitrogen conversion in view of the widespread existence of nitrate and the promising prospects of ags it is particularly necessary to reveal the role of nitrate in ags process which may potentially contribute to breaking the bottleneck of slow granule formation and easy disintegration therefore this study focused on understanding the effect of nitrate on ags granulation and interpreting the inherent mechanisms using quantitative detection microbial community analysis and metabolomics biotechnology 2 materials and methods 2 1 ags setup and operation two identical sequential batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 1 7 l were operated the sbrs had a volume exchange ratio of 50

min to 3 min with the remaining being aeration period to promote sludge granulation the sludge retention time was kept at about 20 days during aeration period air was introduced via a fine bubble

anova was applied to assess the difference of tn removal efficiency between re and rc 2 4 eps extraction and determination the extraction of eps was conducted by the cation exchange resin cer method according to zhang et al 2015 the content of eps included pn and ps the pn content was determined by bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit solarbio china the ps content was determined by anthrone sulfate colorimetric method gaudy 1962 2 5 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm clsm was employed to reveal the distribution of live cells dead cells pn and ps in ags the ags samples were collected at 21 d 63 d and 87 d respectively the ags was washed twice in phosphate buffer solution pbs 0 01 m ph 7 0 and fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde for 24 h after that the ags was dehydrated in a mixture of pbs and anhydrous ethanol 1 1 v v for 15 min and this step was repeated for several times to obtain dehydrated ags furthermore the dehydrated ags was embedded in optimal cutting temperature oct compound sakura usa and then sliced at 100 μm intervals by a cryotome nx50 thermofisher usa live and dead cells in the slices were stained using calcein am pi double staining kit solarbio china pn and

460 nm the fitc was detected by excitation at 488 nm and emission at 500 550 nm 2 6 intracellular c di gmp extraction and quantification the extraction and determination of intracellular c di gmp was referred to guo et al 2017 with modification the ags samples 25 ml were obtained from sbrs at the end of aeration period the samples were centrifugated 8000 g 10 min 4 c to remove the supernatant and then were ground with a mortar and pestle the homogeneous samples were further extracted by ultrasonication and methanol acetonitrile 1 1 v v extraction lc ms ms analysis for determining intracellular c di gmp concentration was conducted using a dionex ultimate 3000 uplc system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lcmsms 8060 shimadzu japan and equipped with heated electrospray ionization probe details were presented in text s2 2 7 static biofilm assay to investigate the role of nitrate in biofilm formation static biofilm assays were applied to cultivate the biofilms in the presence of nitrate 10 mg l 1 c di gmp 10 μg l 1 and sodium nitroprusside snp no producer 50 μg l 1 respectively barraud et al 2009 suja et al 2015 meanwhile mncl2 c di gmp inhibitor 1 m wang et al 2017 and nω nitro l arginine l nna no inhibitor 0 03 m idrizaj et al 2022 were used to eliminate the effect of c di gmp and snp respectively besides biofilms were also cultivated under 10 120 240 500 and 1000 μg l 1 of snp to investigate the effect of no concentration on biofilm formation for biofilms cultivation mixtures 200 μl of activated sludge 4 g l 1 and synthetic wastewater 1 1 v v containing different reagents were added into 96 well plates and cultivated in an incubator 25 c for 6 12 h biofilms were determined by the crystal violet staining as depicted by merritt et al 2005 eps and c di gmp were determined as described in section 2 4 and 2 6 respectively each group contained at least six parallel samples 2 8 microbial community analysis the ags samples in sbrs were

discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to identify the statistically different microbes between re and rc 2 9 untargeted metabolomics analysis metabolomics analysis was conducted to give deep insights into the metabolomics response of ags to nitrate the ags samples at 21 d and 63 d in the two reactors at the end of aeration period were collected to compare the metabolomic differences in the granule formation phase affected by nitrate the ags samples at 63 d and 87 d in re were collected to understand the metabolomic differences in the granule disintegration phase affected by nitrate intracellular metabolites were extracted by methanol 80 extraction and ultrasonication untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed using vanquish horizon system coupled to q exactive hf x

projection vip analysis orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis opls da and kegg pathway enrichment for the statistical test student s t test was conducted in stats r 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of nitrate on ags granulation the ags was cultivated in two sbrs re and rc re was fed with synthetic wastewater containing additional nitrate 10 mg l 1 while rc was only fed with synthetic wastewater the mean granule size and biomass in re and rc were shown in fig 1 a in a general meaning the diameter of 200 μm is a threshold value to differentiate granular and floccular sludge dai et al 2020 the sludge becomes dominated with granules when 50 of sludge with granule size more than 200 μm the granule formation is achieved when 90 of sludge with granule size more than 200 μm pishgar et al 2019 granule size in re sustained rapid growth so that the sludge dominated with granules was observed at 21 d and ags formation was achieved at 63 d with a mean granule size of 557 6 μm subsequently a decrease in mean granule size was observed reaching 245 8 mm at 87 d in contrast the granule size in rc remained stable initially until the sludge dominated with granules was observed at 55 d with a mean granule size of 226 7 μm with granule size stepwise increased rc achieved granule formation at 87 d and the mean granule size was 397 6 μm consistent with the trend of granule size vss in re significantly increased to approximately 11 3 g l 1 at 63 d and then gradually decreased during the disintegration period whereas vss in rc presented an increasing trend after 55 d and reached 8 5 g l 1 at 87 d the granule morphologies of the two reactors at 21 d 63 d and 87 d were shown in fig 1b which more clearly illustrated the granulation process especially the formation of larger granules at 63 d and the disintegration at 87 d in re it was shown from fig 1c that there were dead cells in the two reactors in the early granulation 21 d speculating that these dead cells or their fragments might act as a core for granulation wang et al 2017 at 87 d large numbers of dead cells were observed in re further implying the granule disintegration in re from the granulation process and morphological changes it can be concluded that the addition of low concentration nitrate significantly promoted the formation of ags but the ags was more likely to disintegrate under a long term effect of nitrate wan and sperandio 2009 reported that nitrate improved ags formation and acted as a good alternative electron acceptor to reduce energy demand suja et al 2015 further investigated the positive role of nitrate on ags granulation similarly nitrate significantly enhanced comamonas testosteroni biofilm and reduced cell detachment from the biofilm wu et al 2015 in contrast mangalea et al 2017 found that nitrate inhibited the biofilm formation of burkholderia pseudomallei to date there were only a few reports addressing the promotion effect of nitrate on ags formation and even fewer reports describing the disintegration due to nitrate in view of the widespread existence of nitrate in wastewater treatment system and the application prospects of ags the role of nitrate in ags granulation is worthy of concern 3 2 ags performance the pollutants removal efficiency and settling property were shown in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency in re was basically stabilized at about 97 3 98 4 while in rc was mainly around 95 2 96 8 before 55 d and eventually increased to 97 7 fig 2a this result indicated that rapid ags formation slightly improved stability of cod removal although re appeared to disintegrate in the later period of operation the removal of cod was still unaffected this might be because the vss in re was still at a high level of 9 3 g l 1 during the disintegration period fig 1a the influent nh4 n concentration in the two reactors was maintained at 100 mg l 1 almost all the nh4 n was effectively removed in re while the effluent nh4 n in rc increased to 9 7 mg l 1 during the initial 30 days and then gradually decreased fig 2b in rc the concentration of nox n no3 n no2 n in effluent was high especially no2 n with a maximum concentration of 32 2 mg l 1 the accumulation of nox n was mainly due to the inefficient denitrification morales et al 2013 long et al 2014 in re with the addition of nitrate the effluent nox n concentration decreased it was shown that re always presented higher denitrification rates than rc from the beginning fig s2 indicating that the addition of nitrate in re enhanced the denitrification process and thus decreased the accumulation of nox n therefore high tn removal ability was achieved in re ranging from 80 5 to 94 2 while the tn removal efficiency in rc was between 53 5 and 83 4 this result showed that the tn removal efficiency in re was significantly p 0 001 anova improved due to the addition of nitrate with the rapid ags formation the svi30 in re was as low as 31 ml g 1 during 35 67 d which was lower than that in rc fig 2c however the svi30 exhibited an obvious upward trend during the disintegration period in re while remained relatively stable in rc this phenomenon indicated that the disintegration of granules would lead to poor settleability the above results showed that the main effect of nitrate on the effluent was to reduce the accumulation of nox n and improve the removal efficiency of tn in general tn removal efficiencies of gas ranged between 50 and 80 morales et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 pishgar et al 2019 ran et al 2022 the enhancement of tn removal efficiency was mainly attributed to the promotion of denitrification by nitrate moreover the rapid growth of granules due to the addition of nitrate was also conducive to maintaining a favorable environment for denitrification on the other hand the changes in granules also affected settling performance especially the granule disintegration caused by long term effect of nitrate might result in a poor settleability therefore nitrate exhibited an important effect on wastewater treatment using ags system understanding the role of nitrate is of great significance in practical application to maintain excellent effluent quality and stable settleability 3 3 eps in response to nitrate eps contains multiple microbial metabolites that plays a major role in ags granulation shi et al 2017 li et al 2020 liu et al 2021 therefore it was inevitable to investigate the variation of eps in re and rc the eps content in re markedly increased from 22 9 to 110 7 mg g 1 vss during 0 55 d and then decreased whereas the eps content in rc increased slowly from 23 1 to 87 7 mg g 1 vss during 0 87 d fig 3 a this result indicated that the addition of nitrate stimulated but also decreased eps secretion the pn ps ratio exceeded 2 in both re and rc fig 3a indicating that pn was the main component of eps and probably the principal reason for granulation shi et al 2017 liu et al 2021 interestingly the content of ps decreased during the disintegration period in re fig 3a suggesting that ps contributed to granule structure li et al 2020 from the distribution of pn and ps on the granular surface fig 3b it was shown that pn dominated on the surface of ags in the early granulation while ps dominantly distributed on the surface of ags after granule formation at 63 d in re and 87 d in rc respectively moreover the distribution of ps almost dispersed at 87 d in re these results further demonstrated that pn contributed to promoting granule formation and ps played an important role in maintaining granule structure 3 4 c di gmp in response to nitrate the granulation is also likely related to the regulation of c di gmp which is a second messenger in bacterial communication wu et al 2015 mangalea et al 2017 wang et al 2017 therefore quantification of intracellular c di gmp was conducted fig 4 a the concentration of c di gmp in re markedly increased during 0 49 d reaching the maximum level of 60 μg l 1 and then decreased during 49 87 d reaching the minimum level of 21 μg l 1 in contrast the concentration of c di gmp in rc continuously increased to 45 μg l 1 at 87 d the above results indicated that nitrate triggered higher levels of intracellular c di gmp but also resulted in lower levels of c di gmp it was considered that c di gmp affected the granulation process possibly by regulating eps wang et al 2017 in this study spearman analysis showed that c di gmp had a close correlation with eps and granule size in both reactors especially in re fig 4b therefore it was speculated that c di gmp was likely to regulate eps and subsequent granulation and nitrate enhanced this correlation how nitrate interacted with c di gmp was further investigated by static biofilm assays fig 5 a in group i compared with the control group nitrate markedly improved the growth of biofilm confirming that nitrate played a positive role in biofilm formation in group ii c di gmp markedly improved biofilm growth while mn2 a c di gmp inhibitor decreased the biofilm growth by inhibiting the c di gmp level confirming that biofilm formation was regulated by the level of c di gmp in group iii snp a no producer improved the growth of biofilm while lnna a no inhibitor inhibited biofilm growth suggesting that no might also participate in the regulation of biofilm formation furthermore the variation of c di gmp and eps in the biofilms treated by these different reagents was determined higher levels of c di gmp and eps were observed in the biofilms promoted by nitrate c di gmp and no and vice versa lower levels of c di gmp and eps were presented in the inhibited biofilms conclusively biofilm formation was possibly promoted by high levels of eps which was regulated by high levels of c di gmp considering that nitrate no and c di gmp were equally facilitative to biofilm formation and with the fact that higher denitrification rates were observed in re fig s2 no rather than nitrate was likely to be a more direct regulator a limited amount of no was reported to facilitate the biofilm formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa park et al 2020 similarly no produced from snp showed a promotion effect on the formation of ags suja et al 2015 however conflicts showed that 500 nm of snp resulted in about 80 biofilm dispersal of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10 μm of snp reduced approximately 60 of staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm mass barraud et al 2006 barraud et al 2009 no is a signaling molecule able to influence the level of c di gmp which may decrease c di gmp level after activation of pde or inhibition of dgc and is also hypothesized to activate dgc or inhibit pde to increase c di gmp level rinaldo et al 2018 park et al 2020 whether increase or decrease in c di gmp level was probably related to the homeostatic levels of no park et al 2020 with the increase of snp concentrations fig 5b both c di gmp and biofilm showed a trend of rising first and then decreasing demonstrating that no level regulated formation and dispersal through regulating c di gmp level more specifically as shown in fig 5c nitrate resulted in an increase of no level through denitrification pathway within an appropriate concentration range increasing no concentration upregulated the level of c di gmp then stimulated the secretion of eps and favored biofilm formation however excessive no resulted in the downregulation of c di gmp level and thus reduced the secretion of eps which led to biofilm dispersal the addition of nitrate increased the level of no in re but under a long term effect of nitrate it might cause excessive no changes in the concentrations of no in re were likely to be partly a reason for promoting formation and causing disintegration of ags in fig 1a 3 5 microbial community response to nitrate to evaluate the effect of nitrate on microorganisms the microbial communities of seed sludge ss re and rc were analyzed by high throughput sequencing a total of 310 586 otus were found and the coverage of each sample was more than 99 6 indicating adequate sequencing depth principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distances of otus showed that re was markedly different from rc and ss pc1 31 19 fig s3 re had a higher value than rc in chao and shannon index table s1 indicating that re had a more diversified and abundant microbial community the detailed bacterial structure and relative abundance at phylum and genus levels were further clarified re and rc had similar structures at phylum level but differed in abundance fig s4 the dominant phyla were patescibacteria proteobacteria actinobacteriota and bacteroidota in the two reactors it seems that the addition of nitrate increased the abundance of bacteroidota and actinobacteriota but decreased the abundance of patescibacteria and proteobacteria at genus level tm7a microbacterium micropruina and amaricoccus were genera with high abundance in both two reactors fig 6 a in depth analysis was further carried out by the lefse algorithm to illustrate the main difference in genus level fig 6b and the biomarkers were found at a linear discriminant analysis lda score of 3 5 fig 6c the result showed that re contained more biomarkers in which paracoccus was reported to be an important denitrifier responsible for denitrification wang et al 2021 and devosia flavobacterium and micropuina were related to eps production huang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 the above results indicated that nitrate mainly helped ags to enrich denitrifying microbes and eps producing microbes therefore the abundance of denitrifying bacteria expressing nir genes was further quantitatively determined and the result showed that the abundance of denitrifying bacteria in re was always much higher than that in rc fig 7 a this result was consistent with the result that the tn removal efficiency in re was higher than that in rc fig 2b the nir genes are responsible for the reduction of nitrite to no park et al 2020 the presence of denitrifying bacteria expressing nir genes demonstrated the production of no in the two reactors and the higher abundance in re indicated that the concentration of no in re might be always higher than that in rc this result provided an extra evidence for the role of no in ags granulation on the other hand the picrust2 fig 7b functional forecast showed that more functional enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis appeared in re compared with rc at 21d such as the functional enzymes related to the synthesis of arginine arg glutamate glu glutamine gln histidine his and proline pro meanwhile the abundance of functional enzymes relating to glucose mannose galactose glucose 6 phosphate and fructose 6 phosphate also increased in re this result further indicated that nitrate might induce the increase of eps producing microbes which were responsible for the production of pn and ps in eps under the regulation of c di gmp 3 6 metabolomics response to nitrate untargeted metabolomics was conducted to reveal more instant details of ags in response to nitrate a total of 998 metabolites were detected mainly including amino acids lipids sugars and nucleotides opls da analysis was applied to assess metabolic changes in the granule formation phase fig s5 and disintegration phase fig s6 affected by nitrate the clear separation of re and rc indicated a significant difference in metabolites expression differentially expressed metabolites were normalized and hierarchically clustered by vip score the results suggested that 23 metabolites with statistically significant differences vip 1 p 0 05 were identified between re and rc at 21 d and 63 d in which 18 metabolites were upregulated and 5 metabolites were downregulated in re fig 8 such dominant upregulation indicated that nitrate exerted promoting influence on microbial metabolism during granule formation phase by comparing the metabolic differences between the formation phase 63 d and the disintegration phase 87 d in re 28 metabolites with statistically significant differences vip 1 p 0 05 were identified in which 25 metabolites were downregulated and 3 metabolites were upregulated at 87 d fig 9 indicating that nitrate exerted repressing influence on microbial metabolism during the disintegration phase kegg enrichment analysis showed that nitrate significantly affected 15 metabolic pathways involved in amino acid metabolism lipid metabolism biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites metabolism of other amino acids translation and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins figs 8 9 the detailed information of metabolites and their related pathways were shown in the supplementary information table s2 s4 in the ags formation process amino acid metabolism was the most affected metabolism by nitrate at 21 d aspartate asp and ornithine orn were significantly upregulated in re which were derived from alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and arginine biosynthesis respectively fig 8a b at 63 d arg derived from arginine biosynthesis and his derived from histidine metabolism were significantly upregulated in re fig 8c d in addition glu gln pro methionine met isoleucine ile asparagine asn tryptophan trp phe and tyrosine tyr also showed higher abundance in re than those in rc fig 10 meanwhile some sugar metabolites involved in the metabolism of galactose glucose 6 phosphate and fructose 6 phosphate also showed higher abundance during the ags formation phase fig 10 in this study the amino acids upregulated in re were the twenty building block amino acids of pn except for orn but the upregulation of orn contributed to the biosynthesis of arg through urea cycle previous study showed that phe leu ala threonine thr glycine gly glu and valine val contributed to the biosynthesis of extracellular pn and fructose 6 phosphate and glucose 6 phosphate were the precursor substances in the biosynthesis of ps in anammox aggregates zhao et al 2018 the biosynthesis of his was reported to have a major impact on the biofilm formation of staphylococcus xylosus zhou et al 2018 therefore the upregulated amino acids and sugar metabolites in re were likely to be essential for promoting the biosynthesis of pn and ps in eps of ags fig 10 furthermore it was reported that high levels of c di gmp induced the increase of fructose 6 phosphate udp n acetyl d glucosamine and some amino acids guo et al 2017 thus these upregulated amino acids and sugar metabolites in re might result from the upregulation of c di gmp by nitrate moreover as indicated by picrust2 functional forecast much more functional enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and sugar metabolism appeared in re compared with rc fig 7b therefore c di gmp might probably promote eps biosynthesis by activating functional enzymes to upregulate certain amino acids and sugar metabolites on the other hand arg was reported to be possibly involved in c di gmp metabolism mills et al 2015 barrientos moreno et al 2020 therefore the upregulation of arg might possibly in turn contribute to increasing intracellular level of c di gmp together with no rinaldo et al 2018 nitrate also affected lipid metabolism in the granule formation phase fig 8 sphingolipid metabolism with its related metabolites n palmitoylsphingosine ceramide and 2s 3r 2 aminooctadecane 1 3 diol sphinganine were downregulated cetin suberine and wax biosynthesis with its related metabolite 16 hydroxyhexadecanoic acid hha were upregulated it was suggested that hha was probably a sign of biofilm formation chao et al 2010 for the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites flavin mononucleotide fmn in riboflavin metabolism was also upregulated which not only participated in c di gmp production but also had an important role in biofilm cell respiration de vriendt et al 2005 bordeleau et al 2010 during the disintegration phase in re most of the metabolisms in the disintegrated ags at 87 d were downregulated compared with the intact ags at 63 d fig 9 with the decrease of c di gmp arginine biosynthesis alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism histidine metabolism lysine biosynthesis arginine and proline metabolism were markedly downregulated in re causing a significant decrease in arg his serine ser orn and asp besides glu gln met trp phe asn and pro also showed lower abundance at 87 d than those at 63 d fig s7 these results further demonstrated that the decrease of c di gmp might result in the decrease of pn in eps besides saccharopine and l 2 aminoadipic acid which were involved in lysine biosynthesis were downregulated in lipid metabolism many metabolites in cutin suberin and wax biosynthesis were downregulated taurine and l cysteic acid were downregulated in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism l dopa which was involved in betalain metabolism was downregulated in re the downregulation of l dopa was believed to inhibit biofilm formation alhumaidi et al 2020 3 7 significance of this study to the best of our knowledge this work might be the first attempt to reveal the contradictory role of nitrate in ags granulation nitrate was likely to facilitate granule formation but also result in disintegration under a long term effect the intracellular second messenger c di gmp signaling system played a significant role in this process this signaling pathway was modulated by nitrate via denitrification derived no and caused deep metabolic changes which ultimately promoted granule formation or led to disintegration this study provides insights for revealing the complex relationship between nitrate and ags and guides studies for further understanding the mechanism of ags granulation this study is also meaningful to provide new thought for the development of ags technology in practical application the slow ags formation and unpredictable disintegration are bottlenecks of this technology which ultimately affect the effluent quality and settleability by regulating the signaling system through nitrate in wastewater ags formation would be promoted and the disintegration caused by nitrate would be possibly avoided by adjusting operation strategies the concentration of nitrate or more accurately no might be the key to modulate formation or disintegration further investigations will be expected to identify threshold concentrations of nitrate or evaluate the effect of pulse rather than continuous dosing on granulation 4 conclusions nitrate facilitated the formation of ags but also caused disintegration under a long term effect this was because no derived from nitrate denitrification within an appropriate concentration range upregulated the level of c di gmp which then stimulated the secretion of eps and promoted ags formation under a long term effect of nitrate however excessive no resulted in the downregulation of c di gmp level and thus reduced the secretion of eps which led to disintegration nitrate significantly improved tn removal efficiency but the disintegration resulted in a decrease of settleability with the addition of nitrate denitrifiers and eps producing bacteria were enriched which were responsible for the regulation of no c di gmp and eps metabolomics analysis showed that some amino acids such as arg his and asp were upregulated in the formation phase and downregulated in the disintegration phase suggesting the potential contribution to eps biosynthesis credit authorship contribution statement danqing wu investigation data curation

14828,mulch film microplastics mps could act as a vector for agricultural chemicals due to their long term presence in farmland environments as a result this study focuses on the adsorption mechanism of three neonicotinoids on two typical agricultural film mps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp as well as the effects of neonicotinoids on the mps transport in quartz sand saturated porous media the findings revealed that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on pe and pp was a combination of physical and chemical processes including hydrophobic electrostatic and hydrogen bonding acidity and appropriate ionic strength is were favorable conditions for neonicotinoid adsorption of on mps the results of column experiments showed that the presence of neonicotinoids particularly at low concentrations 0 5 mmol l 1 could promote the transport of pe and pp in the column by improving the electrostatic interaction and hydrophilic repulsion of particles the neonicotinoids would be adsorbed on mps through hydrophobic action preferentially whereas excessive neonicotinoids could cover the hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of mps neonicotinoids reduced the response of pe and pp transport behavior to ph changes 0 005 mol l 1 nacl ameliorated the migration of mps by increasing their stability because of its highest hydration ability and the bridging effect of mg2 na had the most prominent transport promoting effect on pe and pp in mps neonicotinoid this study shows that the increased environmental risk caused by the coexistence of microplastic particles and agricultural chemicals is unneglectable graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agricultural film microplastics neonicotinoid hydrophobic interaction transport electrostatic interaction hydrophilic repulsion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic film mulching is now an important technology for increasing agricultural production in many parts of the world li et al 2022 the use of mulch film exceeded 1 36 million tons in 2020 with a coverage area of 17 38 million hm division of rural socio economic survey 2021 the residual waste still accumulates in the farmland environment because of the characteristics that are difficult to remove from the field and cannot be reused yang et al 2022 the plastic film that enters the environment will be broken down by a series of biological and abiotic processes producing smaller microplastics mps particles with a diameter of less than 5 mm jiang et al 2021 thompson et al 2004 mps are very easy to penetrate the underground environment or accumulate in organisms causing stress to the health of plants animals and even humans as well as a broader range of ecological and environmental problems due to plastic migration to deep soil and even groundwater bhagat et al 2020 a 10 µm thick film shaped plastic remaining in a farmland soil could possibly be more easily broken and decomposed li et al 2022 polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp are commonly used as agricultural film materials due to their ease of manufacture better chemical stability durability elasticity and odorless which are also more residual components in cultivated soil somanathan et al 2022 nevertheless because of their good hydrophilicity and controllable size and shape polystyrene ps mps are the focus of most existing research zhou et al 2022 similar to nano colloids particle properties e g particle size and hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity media properties roughness biofilm iron containing oxides clay minerals and humus and solution chemical conditions ph salinity and chemical pollutants all influence mps transport behavior fei et al 2022 he et al 2020 ren et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 however research on the classic components of agricultural films pe and pp mps focuses on the adsorption of pollutants rather than the transport behavior neonicotinoids are a new class of neurotoxic insecticides because of their high efficiency strong persistence low toxicity to mammals and environmental stability these products have gradually replaced traditional insecticides and their scope of use has been expanding aregahegn et al 2018 liu et al 2021 like those of other emerging pollutants these characteristics make neonicotinoids transportable in the environment and their environmental fate challenging to predict rohrbacher et al 2021 neonicotinoids have been found in waterways worldwide hladik et al 2018 fortunately some studies have gradually paid attention to the environmental hazards of neonicotinoids and their effective degradation in wastewater by engineering materials chen et al 2022 real et al 2022 mps can adsorb and transport inorganic and organic pollutants over long distances using mechanisms such as hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction pore filling van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and π π interaction torres et al 2021 because of the key mechanism of hydrophobic action hydrophobic organics tend to adsorb on non polar mps carbery et al 2018 according to one study the main mechanisms of triclosan adsorption on pvc mps were diffusive transport and hydrophobic interaction ma et al 2019 triazole fungicides were adsorbed on ps mps primarily through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and adsorption capacity was found to be positively correlated with the bactericide logkow fang et al 2019 conversely cotransported pollutants can also impact the transport of mps while microplastic mp particles serve as carriers surfactants in the water improved particle suspension in the transport process to varying degrees after adhering to the surface of mps via hydrophobic action sun et al 2022 lead and urea in the solution can simultaneously reduce the zeta potential of mps and the surface of the media increasing mps deposition in porous media rong et al 2022 xi et al 2022 natural organic matters and biofilm which are ubiquitous in the environment could change the transport of mps in porous media through interaction with mps humic acid and fulvic acid provided steric hindrance between particles and between particles and quartz sand and further enhanced the transport capacity of mps li et al 2021 rong et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the covered biofilm increased the roughness of the quartz sand surface and the extracellular polymer on the biofilm was conducive to the deposition of mps he et al 2020 gram e coli and gram b subtilis in the solution could also affect the migration of mps in the media by forming mps bacteria clusters he et al 2021 it has been confirmed that the adsorption capacity of organic molecules on the mps would be affected by ph ionic strength is and coexisting cations in the solution zhao et al 2022 when these factors are enough to simultaneously act on the adsorption capacity of contaminants on the mps and the transport of the mps themselves how the mobility of the mps will be controlled by the attached contaminants remains to be explained through experiments the studies cited above demonstrate that the ubiquitous chemicals found in farmland will inevitably affect the transport and fate of mps based on this plastic film mps and neonicotinoids will almost certainly coexist in the same space time as will the use of insecticide sustained release films which will cause invisible environmental problems the issues investigated and discussed in this study include the adsorption mode of plastic film mps pe and pp and neonicotinoids acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram batch adsorption experiments and the impact of neonicotinoids on the transport of mps column experiments table s1 shows the information of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and characterization all the experiments involved in this work used pe and pp mps in pristine powder form 2000 mesh which were provided by china united plastics and chemical co ltd dongguan china we focused on the sem images specific surface area and porosity of pe and pp as well as the ftir xps spectra and static contact angle before and after the adsorption of neonicotinoids the information on the tested materials and the characterization methods of the samples are shown in s1 in the supporting information 2 2 batch adsorption experiments the interaction of neonicotinoids on pe and pp mps were investigated by batch adsorption experiments isothermal kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption experiments were experimented by regulating the concentration of neonicotinoids in an aqueous solution the various contact times between the mps and neonicotinoids and the adsorption temperature the adsorption isotherm experiments were carried out by mixing 10 mg pe or pp mps with 10 ml 10 20 40 60 80 100 200 and 300 mg l 1 neonicotinoids respectively and shaking at 180 rpm for 1440 min the ph of the solution was maintained at 6 5 and the is was 0 001 mol l 1 throughout the experiment the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics were in progress under the same experimental conditions as isothermal adsorption in brief adsorption kinetic experiments were performed using the mps samples 10 mg and 10 ml of neonicotinoid solutions which were mixed in glass vials and rotated on a rotary shaker the suspension was sampled after 10 20 30 60 120 240 360 720 1440 min the adsorption thermodynamics was conducted by setting the adsorption temperature 278 318 k of neonicotinoids on mps furthermore the effects of ph 3 5 9 5 cation na k nh4 and mg2 and is 0 001 0 005 0 01 and 0 1 mol l 1 on the adsorption of neonicotinoids by mps were also studied the detailed model equations involved in batch adsorption experiments are shown in s2 2 3 column experiments the preparation of quartz sand and the packing process before column experiments are shown in s3 this study involves three parts of experiments namely the effect of neonicotinoids concentration on the transport of mps and the effect of solution ph and electrolyte is on the transport of pe and pp in the coexistence system of mps neonicotinoid firstly the effects of various concentrations 0 0 5 1 0 and 2 5 mmol l 1 of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on the transport of pe and pp were studied specifically two kinds of mps 300 mg l 1 and three kinds of neonicotinoids were mixed and ultrasonic dispersed respectively and then pumped into the packed column 3 4 pvs pore volume the sand column was then immediately flushed with the background solution until no mps flowed out the pumping flow rate was maintained at 2 ml min 1 the ph of mps dispersion and background solution was 6 5 and the is of nacl was 0 001 mol l 1 during the whole experimental process the experiments in the second and third parts were realized by changing the ph 4 6 5 and 9 of the mps neonicotinoid dispersion system cmps 300 mg l 1 cneonicotinoid 1 0 mmol l 1 and background solution and the is 0 001 0 005 0 01 and 0 1 mol l 1 of electrolyte nacl kcl nh4cl and mgcl2 respectively in all column experiments samples were collected every 2 5 ml from the beginning of mps dispersion injection the mps concentration was determined by measuring the light attenuation au at a wavelength of 500 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 fig s1 the light attenuation method based on sample turbidity is listed as a standard method for determining the concentration of suspended particles in natural water body in u s techniques of water resources investigations anderson 2005 all of the column experiments were repeated twice as shown in tables 1 and s2 2 4 mathematical model and equation an advection dispersion equation model was used to simulate the transport of mps to help explain pe and pp retention in sand columns jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2013 the adhesion tension of neonicotinoids on the surface of pe and pp was calculated by the young equation szymczyk et al 2014 the carbonyl index provides an indication of polymer aging based on changes resulting from oxidation and the degree of plastic you et al 2021 the detailed model equations and calculation formulas are shown in s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and structural characterization the sem micrograph in fig 1 a b shows the particle morphology and surface of pe and pp mps the particles of the two kinds of mps are similar and showed irregular shapes with cracks and pores the eds spectra of pe and pp show the basic constituent elements c and o of the two mp particles and the oxygen content of pp is evidently higher than that of pe table s3 compared with pe the isotherm of pp shows a higher quantity absorbed in the high relative pressure p p0 range fig 1c with the bet surface area of pp being 17 12 m2 g 1 which is higher than that of pe 2 34 m2 g 1 the reason for this difference is that pp has a smaller average pore diameter 6 9544 nm and larger pore volume 0 0751 cm3 g 1 than pe 23 9135 nm 0 0216 cm3 g 1 several studies we retrieved indicated that the specific surface area of pe and pp mps were 0 17 1 0159 m2 g 1 and 0 15 0 6477 m2 g 1 respectively and the pore volume were 0 0005 0 0260 cm3 g 1 and 0 0003 0 0011 cm3 g 1 respectively the specific surface area and pore volume of the pe and pp mps involved in our experiment may be larger than those of the actual environmental mps reported in other reports because they use larger particles for adsorption or toxicology experiments fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2012 lan et al 2022 li et al 2021 miao et al 2022 3 2 adsorption behavior 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the adsorption process of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on the surface of pe and pp mps fig 2 and table s4 provide all fitting curves and parameters the results showed that neonicotinoids were beneficial to the adsorption process of mps and the adsorption would be enhanced with the increase of neonicotinoid concentration in the solution the adsorption process of the three neonicotinoids on pe was more consistent with the langmuir model by comparing the correlation coefficient r2 0 97 this means that the adsorption was monolayer adsorption with a uniform particle surface and equal energy of each adsorption center and the interaction between neonicotinoid molecules could be ignored zhou et al 2022 the strong hydrophobicity of the pe surface might be the reason for the phenomenon jiang et al 2022 the adsorption capacities of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pe were 17 18 32 36 and 7 00 mg kg 1 respectively which were lower than those on pp 27 03 43 10 and 14 75 mg kg 1 the freundlich model can also better fit the adsorption data of three neonicotinoids on pp r2 0 93 because of the surface unevenness caused by the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pp the n value in the freundlich model has been used to determine the type of adsorption process in this part the n values of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram were greater than 1 indicating the existence of a physical adsorption process in the interaction between the three neonicotinoids and pe mps li et al 2021 the smaller n value indicated that the pore filling domain of pp contributes more to the adsorption than that of pe bakir et al 2012 which was consistent with the results of pore size distribution 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics the equilibrium adsorption capacity of three neonicotinoids on pe and pp increased rapidly in the first 1 h and then the adsorption rate gradually decreased the adsorption capacity did not change significantly after 6 h and reached equilibrium pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and two constant models all provided the fitting of adsorption kinetics fig s2 and the parameters are shown in table s5 the calculation of the pseudo second order model was closer to the experimental data indicating that the adsorption reaction took place through a multi step mechanism including external surface diffusion intraparticle diffusion and the interaction between adsorbate and active sites which was not a separate physical or chemical adsorption ji et al 2011 3 2 3 adsorption thermodynamics the relationship between 1 t and lnkd is shown in fig s3 the adsorption thermodynamic parameters are listed in table s6 δg was negative and increased with the temperature which indicated that the adsorption of the three neonicotinoids on the surface of pe and pp was spontaneous the positive δh value indicated that the adsorption processes of the three neonicotinoids on the surface of the mps were endothermic reactions it must be noted that the δh values of the adsorption of dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pe and pp ranged from 22 85 to 25 60 kj mol 1 and the adsorption of acetamiprid on pp was 19 43 kj mol 1 all close to 20 9 kj mol 1 s2 3 combined with the results of kinetic adsorption we did not consider that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mps was a single physical or chemical process but a combination arabkhani and asfaram 2020 wang et al 2020 the increase of chaos δs 0 in all systems also indicated that the adsorption processes were spontaneous 3 2 4 effect of ph and cation on adsorption as shown in fig 3 a b the adsorption capacity of the neonicotinoids decreased with the ph from 3 5 to 9 5 obviously the pka values of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram were 0 44 3 24 and 2 64 respectively table s1 which were all less than 3 5 when the ph pka the dissociation state of the three neonicotinoids played a dominant role in the solution not all appeared in molecular form consequently the effect of the increase of ph on the neonicotinoids was to increase the degree of dissociation and the negative charge the pe and pp surfaces showed negative potential in the experimental ph range and the number of negative charges on the mp particles surface increased with the ph value table 1 alkalinity can promote the weakening of the relative strength of hydrogen bonds between molecules and on the adsorbent surface and further aggravate the dissociation of organic molecules resulting in the increase of electrostatic repulsion between mps and anionic components which has become an important factor to inhibit adsorption fan et al 2017 fig 3c d shows that when the nacl is of the solution increased from 0 001 to 0 005 mol l 1 the adsorption capacities of the neonicotinoids increased this indicated that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mp particles was improved by the appropriate increase of is one of the reasons is that the is increased the n octanol water partition coefficient of the three neonicotinoids fig s4 inorganic salts can reduce the solubility of especially nonpolar and weakly polar organic compounds thereby transferring the adsorption equilibrium of neonicotinoids to the organic phase ma et al 2019 this salting out effect is an important mechanism affecting the adsorption of organic matter by non polar solid particles another reason is that the na positive charge content of the diffusion layer in the electric double layer of mps was increased by the introduction of nacl into the solution thus weakening the electrostatic repulsion between mps and neonicotinoids table s7 vilar et al 2005 these results confirmed that hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force were the important parts of the adsorption of three neonicotinoids on pe and pp when the is increased to 0 1 mol l 1 the adsorption capacities of the three neonicotinoids on pe and pp decreased salt concentration affected the aggregation of particles by compressing the electric double layer and reducing the repulsive force between particles which would effectively reduce the adsorption sites on the surface of mp particles jiang et al 2021 it is obvious that when the is of nacl in the solution reached the maximum in this experiment the compressed electric double layer was the limiting reason for the adsorption of neonicotinoids onto mps under the same is the adsorption laws of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pe and pp always followed na k nh4 mg2 fig s5a f this was related to the salting out ability of cations fig s6 the smaller the radius of cations the stronger the salting out ability and the stronger the hydrophobic interaction between mps and neonicotinoids li et al 2021 the bridging effect of the multivalent cation mg2 and the more obvious compression of the electric double layer led to the extremely limited adsorption sites of neonicotinoids on the surface of the mps jiang et al 2021 3 2 5 adsorption mechanism the results of the previous batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mps involved a complex mechanism rather than a single process the results of survey xps spectra fig s7 and sem mapping fig s8 showed that n or cl appeared on pe and pp after the adsorption of neonicotinoids in addition the signal intensity of the o element in pp mps was significantly stronger than that of pe the high resolution xps spectra of experimental samples before and after adsorption are shown in figs 4 and s9 in the c 1s region of pe fig 4a three peaks at 284 82 285 13 and 288 90 ev were attributed to c c c o and c o by comparing the binding energies of the mps c 1s and o 1s before and after adsorption the binding energy of the c o bond shifts to a higher position while the peak of c o and o 1s shifts to lower binding energy for instance the peak value of the c o bond decreased by 0 16 0 16 and 0 14 after the adsorption of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pp this indicates that the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of the mps participated in the adsorption and formed a chemical interaction with neonicotinoids in the n 1s region of acetamiprid fig 4c four peaks at binding energies of 397 54 398 49 399 17 and 405 06 ev were assigned to sp2 bonded nitrogen to carbon c n c nitrogen in tertiary nitrogen groups n c 3 cyano groups cn and pyridine aromatic structure owing to the charging between stacked interlayers respectively in the n 1s region of dinotefuran and nitenpyram fig 4d e two types of the peak at binding energies of 399 69 and 399 47 405 68 and 404 25 ev were assigned to n c n c and nitro groups no2 chen et al 2022 the binding energy of cn and no2 peaks shifted to a higher level and their strength were significantly weakened after the neonicotinoids were adsorbed on the surface of mps this appearance indicates that a new chemical bond or hydrogen bond was formed between cn no2 and mps and neonicotinoids can be adsorbed on mps through nitrogen containing functional groups the response of characteristic element cl of acetamiprid at different mps etching depths was investigated by xps ar ion etching technique the cl 2p spectra of the mps surface and etching depth at 5 nm 10 nm and 15 nm reflected the possibility of neonicotinoids entering the mps interior through cracks and pores fig s9c d jiang et al 2022 the results showed that the peak signal of cl 2p was the strongest on the surface of mps and then weakened with the increase of pores depth at the same depth the signal of cl 2p in pp pores was stronger than that of pe which indicates that the adsorption of acetamiprid on pp was more easily affected by mps cracks or pores jiang et al 2022 this difference was consistent with the results of adsorption isotherms and pore size distribution of mps several studies have shown that under the same particle size conditions the adsorption capacity of contaminants onto degradable mps maybe greater than that of pe and pp non degradable mps guo et al 2023 zuo et al 2019 this difference was related to the hydrophilicity and adsorption mechanism of the mps themselves therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to the role of polar functional groups of mps in adsorption and the contribution of various adsorption mechanisms in future research 3 3 effect of ph on transport pe and pp recoveries through the column were only 18 54 20 73 and 36 11 37 21 respectively when mp particles were transported separately under the conditions of solution ph 6 5 fig 5 and table 1 because of mps low density and strong hydrophobicity pe and pp were difficult to transport in the media the static contact angle of pp was smaller than that of pe fig s10 indicating that pp was more hydrophilic the ftir carbonyl index clearly show that pp has more oxygen containing functional groups than pe fig s11 these were the reasons for better pp suspension dispersion and pp transport capacity in saturated porous media was greater than pe fig 5 depicts the pe and pp penetration curves in saturated porous media at ph 4 0 6 5 and 9 0 when pe and pp mp particles were transported separately the recoveries increased with the ph value this was comparable to the transport behavior of colloidal particles in various media yin et al 2019 under alkaline conditions h would dissociate from oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of mp particles resulting in an increase in negatively charged functional groups and surface potential table 1 under acidic conditions the zeta potential of mp particles and quartz sand surface were the lowest table s8 because the electrostatic repulsion between the media and the particles was weak the pe and pp mps tended to deposit in the sand column when the ph of the solution was 4 the recoveries of pe and pp were promoted by 2 27 2 91 and 2 60 2 53 6 13 and 0 24 respectively owing to the presence of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram however at ph 9 the recoveries of pe and pp were reduced by 4 68 5 87 and 10 82 12 55 7 20 and 17 68 this phenomenon implied that the adsorbed neonicotinoids weakened the mps transport behavior s response to ph the adsorption experiment revealed that as ph increased the adsorption capacity of neonicotinoids on the surface of mps decreased owing to the surface of mps tending to deprotonate and the dissociation and polarity of neonicotinoids increasing in conclusion while alkaline conditions ph 9 could increase the electrostatic repulsive force between mps and media promoting the transport of pe and pp in the column they also reduce the adsorption capacity and surface charge of mps table 1 that is the negative charge on the mps surface was shielded by neonicotinoids obviously ph was a major factor in the former namely electrostatic repulsion between particles and media compared with the absence of neonicotinoids acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram in the solution reduced the zeta potential of pe from 29 72 mv to 25 49 mv 26 56 mv and 25 32 mv respectively under acidic conditions ph 4 however weak repulsion inhibited mp dispersion and transport but the adsorbent had the strongest adsorption capacity for neonicotinoids at this time acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram increased the zeta potential of pp from 7 88 mv to 9 79 mv 11 65 mv and 9 31 mv respectively this meant that the negative charge on the mps surface was supplemented by the adsorption of neonicotinoids as a result the presence of neonicotinoids slightly aided the transport of pe and pp under this condition the above results showed that compared with the control group without neonicotinoids ph affected the surface charge of particles by adjusting the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mps thereby weakened the response of mps transport to ph 3 4 effect of is on transport similar to the transport behavior of graphene oxide and biochar colloid the recoveries of pe and pp decreased continuously as the is of nacl in the solution increased from 0 001 to 0 1 mol l 1 when the is was 0 1 mol l 1 the two mp particles could barely flow out fig 6 and table s2 because hydrophobic particles do not form a hydration film on the surface which reduces the thickness of the electric double layer they are more susceptible to the influence of is than hydrophilic colloids manilo et al 2019 in contrast to single transport when pe and pp were transported with the three neonicotinoids the transport amount increased first and then decreased as the is of the solution increased fig 6 the recoveries of pe and pp increased by 12 66 9 73 and 9 23 7 82 8 69 and 7 95 respectively under the influence of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram when the is increased from 0 001 to 0 005 mol l 1 this meant that the transport capacity of mps was improved by the presence of neonicotinoids when the is of the solution was 0 005 mol l 1 at this time the zeta potential of pe and pp were slightly increased table s7 which was not only conducive to the transport of the two kinds of mps but also might indicate that the adsorption capacity of neonicotinoids on the mps was increased the results of adsorption study demonstrated that neonicotinoids could combine with mps via hydrophobic action and that the appropriate is of the solution can enhance the adsorption effect more cations brought by the increase of is could compete with neonicotinoids for binding water reducing the solubility of pollutants in solvents wang et al 2020 in this study pe and pp mps served as neonicotinoid carriers during transport because hydrophobic interaction is not a strong binding force the binding mode will change with the solubility of the neonicotinoid at 0 005 mol l 1 is it is obvious that the stability of mp particles was enhanced by stronger hydrophobic interaction and more surface negative charges resulting in easier movement of pe and pp in the media when the is continued to rise to 0 01 mol l 1 35 06 31 61 and 16 24 41 727 43 17 and 38 66 were the recoveries of pe and pe in the mps neonicotinoid coexistence system respectively and the highest recoveries were not more than 3 38 when the is finally increased to 0 1 mol l 1 this is because excess counterions in the solution compressed the electric double layer of the two types of mps and the zeta potential of pe and pp particles was significantly reduced making the mps more prone to agglomeration the above results showed that the low is 0 005 mol l 1 promoted the transport of mps due to the increase of the adsorption capacity of the neonicotinoids on the mps and the surface charge of the particles however when the is of the solution was greater than 0 005 mol l 1 the leading role was the inhibition of is on the transport of mps 3 5 effect of cation on transport other monovalent cations k nh4 had a similar effect on the cotransport of mps and neonicotinoids as na all recoveries increased first then decreased as is increased when the repulsion force between mps was significantly enhanced by the increase of is 0 005 mol l 1 the transport amount of pe and pp was all promoted when they were cotransported with acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram figs s12 and s13 and table s2 because of the difference in cation hydration ability the effect of monovalent cations on the recoveries of pe and pp when the is 0 01 mol l 1 follows the rule of na k nh4 this is consistent with the pp and pe adsorption conclusion however the hydration ability of the high valence cations was greater than that of the monovalent cations but mg2 did not improve the transport ability of the two mps indicating that the bridging effect of the multivalent cations cannot be ignored fig s14 and table s2 the zeta potential data in table s7 strongly support this phenomenon the zeta potential of mp particles under the mg2 action was smaller under the same is 3 6 promotional effect of neonicotinoids on transport of pe and pp mps the above transport experiments showed that the behavior of pe and pp mps transported separately was similar to that of engineering nanomaterials but the existence of neonicotinoids in the solution caused unexpected changes in the migration of mps in order to explore how neonicotinoids affect the migration behavior of mps in the media we carried out the cotransport experiment of pe and pp with acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram at various concentrations under the condition of constant ph 6 5 and is 0 001 mol l 1 the mobility of pe and pp mp particles was improved in all treatments when pe and pp were transported with the three neonicotinoids fig 7 the promotion effect of mp particle transportation always followed the order dinotefuran acetamiprid nitenpyram at the same neonicotinoid concentration the zeta potential of the particles in the system increased to different degrees after the addition of neonicotinoids compared with a single pe or pp suspension table 1 for instance the zeta potential of pe dispersion was 14 19 mv however the zeta potential of the dispersion was 19 54 mv and 20 87 mv when the addition concentration of dinotefuran was 0 5 and 1 0 mmol l 1 respectively the enhancement of zeta potential was not only conducive to the dispersion between particles but also strengthened the electrostatic repulsion between mps and media which were beneficial to transport significantly the effect of different concentrations of neonicotinoids on the zeta potential of pe and pp mps had a good correlation with the mobility of the mps themselves that is the greater the zeta potential the higher the migration of particles this also showed that neonicotinoids promoted the transport of mps first by increasing the surface charge of mps the static contact angle of ultrapure water on the surface of mps adsorbed with different neonicotinoids was measured to investigate the change in hydrophilicity of pe and pp after the adsorption of neonicotinoids fig s10 the contact angle of the droplets on the surface of the mps adsorbed with neonicotinoids was smaller than that of the sample before adsorption indicating that the mp particles gained stronger hydrophilicity after neonicotinoids adsorption and thus these three neonicotinoids could promote mps transport however the essential reason why neonicotinoids promoted the transport of pe and pp by improving the hydrophilicity of mps was that neonicotinoids enhanced the polarity of particles thus causing stronger hydrophilic repulsion between particles of the same kind this stronger hydrophilic repulsion was firstly due to the fact that the mps adsorbed with neonicotinoids could repel each other through lewis acid base force at this time the attraction of mps to water molecules was stronger than the lewis acid base cohesive attraction between water molecules in other words the value of the polar free energy of repulsion was greater than the hydrophobic attraction energy which led to the formation of a layer of water shell on the surface of mps van oss 2003 secondly adsorption expanded the gap of electron accepticity and electron donicity between hydrophilic surfaces and water van oss 1997 table 1 depicts the static contact angles of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram droplets at the concentrations of 0 5 1 0 and 2 5 mmol l 1 on pe and pp tablets the young equation was used to calculate the adhesion tension of various neonicotinoids on pe and pp surfaces fig s15 the adhesive tension of the neonicotinoids on the surface of the two plastics was dinotefuran acetamiprid nitenpyram at the same concentration this meant that the higher the adhesive tension of the neonicotinoid on the surface of the mps the stronger the neonicotinoid s polarity modification ability on the mps and ultimately the higher the recovery of the mp particles after passing through the sand column however as the neonicotinoid concentration increased from 0 5 to 2 5 mmol l 1 the recoveries of pe and pp increased first and then decreased when neonicotinoid concentrations were increased to 1 0 mmol l 1 pe and pp recoveries also increased to 29 29 37 37 and 29 63 46 12 53 37 and 46 47 respectively fig 7 and table 1 neonicotinoid promotion of pe and pp transport at low concentrations is ascribed to the fact that mp particles could combine with organic neonicotinoids through hydrophobic interaction that is the hydrophobic end of these three neonicotinoids pointed to mp particles and the hydrophilic end pointed to dispersants which undoubtedly increased the polarity of mps in the dispersion system wang et al 2020 nevertheless when the neonicotinoid concentration was increased from 1 0 to 2 5 mmol l 1 the above promotion effect was inhibited and the recoveries of pe and pp were reduced to 25 38 32 78 and 24 64 40 98 47 56 and 40 89 respectively fig 7 and table 1 previous research confirmed that the adsorption capacity of a surfactant or surfactant like molecule on colloidal particles increased with the surfactant concentration implying that the higher the surfactant concentration the stronger the hydrophilic modification of particles the hydrophilic modification was no longer boosted until the surfactant molecules reached the critical micelle concentration and became saturated on the particle surface sun et al 2022 acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram had critical micelle concentrations of 14 9 22 8 and 32 3 mmol l 1 respectively which were much higher than the concentrations used in the experiment fig s16 as a result combined with the results of the adsorption experiments we confirmed that when the concentration of neonicotinoids was less than 1 0 mmol l 1 they adsorbed on the surface of mps preferentially via hydrophobic interaction when the concentration was greater than 1 0 mmol l 1 the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of the mps formed chemisorption or hydrogen bonding with a portion of the neonicotinoids the hydrophilic functional groups were shielded at this point and the stability of the mp particles was reduced once more the zeta potential results can support the preceding conclusion the pe and pp zeta potentials were lower at 2 5 mmol l 1 neonicotinoid than at 0 5 and 1 0 mmol l 1 neonicotinoid respectively in conclusion we believe that the neonicotinoids adsorbed on the surface of the mps had caused two effects first the collision probability between particles and between particles and media was reduced by increasing the surface charge of the mps electrostatic interaction second the attached neonicotinoids enhanced the hydrophilic repulsion between particles undoubtedly both of these two effects made the mps obtain better dispersion and transport capacity equally important the advection dispersion equation model accurately simulates experimental data indicating that the transport of pe and pp mps in porous media has colloidal characteristics the r2 and smax values in tables 1 and s2 indicate high goodness of fit for example the smax value was the smallest when pe was cotransported with 1 0 mmol l 1 concentration of dinotefuran indicating that pe was easier to transport in the media and the retention amount was lower under this condition 4 conclusions in the farmland environment neonicotinoids can be spontaneously adsorbed on agricultural film mps via oxygen containing functional groups on mps the cyano group on acetamiprid and the nitro group on dinotefuran and nitenpyram this process involves chemical interaction hydrogen bond hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction and other mechanisms the adsorption capacity of mps was also affected by their surface properties and pores as demonstrated by pe and pp in this study chemical solution conditions are likely to influence neonicotinoid adsorption on agricultural film mps and their transport in the underground environment because of the non polar properties of the mulching film mps it is possible to change their hydrophilicity via hydrophobic interaction with the neonicotinoids adsorbed on their surfaces therefore the resulting environmental risks cannot be ignored this research could aid in understanding the interaction between mulch film mps and neonicotinoids during cotransport in an agricultural environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

14828,mulch film microplastics mps could act as a vector for agricultural chemicals due to their long term presence in farmland environments as a result this study focuses on the adsorption mechanism of three neonicotinoids on two typical agricultural film mps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp as well as the effects of neonicotinoids on the mps transport in quartz sand saturated porous media the findings revealed that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on pe and pp was a combination of physical and chemical processes including hydrophobic electrostatic and hydrogen bonding acidity and appropriate ionic strength is were favorable conditions for neonicotinoid adsorption of on mps the results of column experiments showed that the presence of neonicotinoids particularly at low concentrations 0 5 mmol l 1 could promote the transport of pe and pp in the column by improving the electrostatic interaction and hydrophilic repulsion of particles the neonicotinoids would be adsorbed on mps through hydrophobic action preferentially whereas excessive neonicotinoids could cover the hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of mps neonicotinoids reduced the response of pe and pp transport behavior to ph changes 0 005 mol l 1 nacl ameliorated the migration of mps by increasing their stability because of its highest hydration ability and the bridging effect of mg2 na had the most prominent transport promoting effect on pe and pp in mps neonicotinoid this study shows that the increased environmental risk caused by the coexistence of microplastic particles and agricultural chemicals is unneglectable graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agricultural film microplastics neonicotinoid hydrophobic interaction transport electrostatic interaction hydrophilic repulsion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic film mulching is now an important technology for increasing agricultural production in many parts of the world li et al 2022 the use of mulch film exceeded 1 36 million tons in 2020 with a coverage area of 17 38 million hm division of rural socio economic survey 2021 the residual waste still accumulates in the farmland environment because of the characteristics that are difficult to remove from the field and cannot be reused yang et al 2022 the plastic film that enters the environment will be broken down by a series of biological and abiotic processes producing smaller microplastics mps particles with a diameter of less than 5 mm jiang et al 2021 thompson et al 2004 mps are very easy to penetrate the underground environment or accumulate in organisms causing stress to the health of plants animals and even humans as well as a broader range of ecological and environmental problems due to plastic migration to deep soil and even groundwater bhagat et al 2020 a 10 µm thick film shaped plastic remaining in a farmland soil could possibly be more easily broken and decomposed li et al 2022 polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp are commonly used as agricultural film materials due to their ease of manufacture better chemical stability durability elasticity and odorless which are also more residual components in cultivated soil somanathan et al 2022 nevertheless because of their good hydrophilicity and controllable size and shape polystyrene ps mps are the focus of most existing research zhou et al 2022 similar to nano colloids particle properties e g particle size and hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity media properties roughness biofilm iron containing oxides clay minerals and humus and solution chemical conditions ph salinity and chemical pollutants all influence mps transport behavior fei et al 2022 he et al 2020 ren et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 however research on the classic components of agricultural films pe and pp mps focuses on the adsorption of pollutants rather than the transport behavior neonicotinoids are a new class of neurotoxic insecticides because of their high efficiency strong persistence low toxicity to mammals and environmental stability these products have gradually replaced traditional insecticides and their scope of use has been expanding aregahegn et al 2018 liu et al 2021 like those of other emerging pollutants these characteristics make neonicotinoids transportable in the environment and their environmental fate challenging to predict rohrbacher et al 2021 neonicotinoids have been found in waterways worldwide hladik et al 2018 fortunately some studies have gradually paid attention to the environmental hazards of neonicotinoids and their effective degradation in wastewater by engineering materials chen et al 2022 real et al 2022 mps can adsorb and transport inorganic and organic pollutants over long distances using mechanisms such as hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction pore filling van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and π π interaction torres et al 2021 because of the key mechanism of hydrophobic action hydrophobic organics tend to adsorb on non polar mps carbery et al 2018 according to one study the main mechanisms of triclosan adsorption on pvc mps were diffusive transport and hydrophobic interaction ma et al 2019 triazole fungicides were adsorbed on ps mps primarily through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and adsorption capacity was found to be positively correlated with the bactericide logkow fang et al 2019 conversely cotransported pollutants can also impact the transport of mps while microplastic mp particles serve as carriers surfactants in the water improved particle suspension in the transport process to varying degrees after adhering to the surface of mps via hydrophobic action sun et al 2022 lead and urea in the solution can simultaneously reduce the zeta potential of mps and the surface of the media increasing mps deposition in porous media rong et al 2022 xi et al 2022 natural organic matters and biofilm which are ubiquitous in the environment could change the transport of mps in porous media through interaction with mps humic acid and fulvic acid provided steric hindrance between particles and between particles and quartz sand and further enhanced the transport capacity of mps li et al 2021 rong et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the covered biofilm increased the roughness of the quartz sand surface and the extracellular polymer on the biofilm was conducive to the deposition of mps he et al 2020 gram e coli and gram b subtilis in the solution could also affect the migration of mps in the media by forming mps bacteria clusters he et al 2021 it has been confirmed that the adsorption capacity of organic molecules on the mps would be affected by ph ionic strength is and coexisting cations in the solution zhao et al 2022 when these factors are enough to simultaneously act on the adsorption capacity of contaminants on the mps and the transport of the mps themselves how the mobility of the mps will be controlled by the attached contaminants remains to be explained through experiments the studies cited above demonstrate that the ubiquitous chemicals found in farmland will inevitably affect the transport and fate of mps based on this plastic film mps and neonicotinoids will almost certainly coexist in the same space time as will the use of insecticide sustained release films which will cause invisible environmental problems the issues investigated and discussed in this study include the adsorption mode of plastic film mps pe and pp and neonicotinoids acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram batch adsorption experiments and the impact of neonicotinoids on the transport of mps column experiments table s1 shows the information of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and characterization all the experiments involved in this work used pe and pp mps in pristine powder form 2000 mesh which were provided by china united plastics and chemical co ltd dongguan china we focused on the sem images specific surface area and porosity of pe and pp as well as the ftir xps spectra and static contact angle before and after the adsorption of neonicotinoids the information on the tested materials and the characterization methods of the samples are shown in s1 in the supporting information 2 2 batch adsorption experiments the interaction of neonicotinoids on pe and pp mps were investigated by batch adsorption experiments isothermal kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption experiments were experimented by regulating the concentration of neonicotinoids in an aqueous solution the various contact times between the mps and neonicotinoids and the adsorption temperature the adsorption isotherm experiments were carried out by mixing 10 mg pe or pp mps with 10 ml 10 20 40 60 80 100 200 and 300 mg l 1 neonicotinoids respectively and shaking at 180 rpm for 1440 min the ph of the solution was maintained at 6 5 and the is was 0 001 mol l 1 throughout the experiment the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics were in progress under the same experimental conditions as isothermal adsorption in brief adsorption kinetic experiments were performed using the mps samples 10 mg and 10 ml of neonicotinoid solutions which were mixed in glass vials and rotated on a rotary shaker the suspension was sampled after 10 20 30 60 120 240 360 720 1440 min the adsorption thermodynamics was conducted by setting the adsorption temperature 278 318 k of neonicotinoids on mps furthermore the effects of ph 3 5 9 5 cation na k nh4 and mg2 and is 0 001 0 005 0 01 and 0 1 mol l 1 on the adsorption of neonicotinoids by mps were also studied the detailed model equations involved in batch adsorption experiments are shown in s2 2 3 column experiments the preparation of quartz sand and the packing process before column experiments are shown in s3 this study involves three parts of experiments namely the effect of neonicotinoids concentration on the transport of mps and the effect of solution ph and electrolyte is on the transport of pe and pp in the coexistence system of mps neonicotinoid firstly the effects of various concentrations 0 0 5 1 0 and 2 5 mmol l 1 of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on the transport of pe and pp were studied specifically two kinds of mps 300 mg l 1 and three kinds of neonicotinoids were mixed and ultrasonic dispersed respectively and then pumped into the packed column 3 4 pvs pore volume the sand column was then immediately flushed with the background solution until no mps flowed out the pumping flow rate was maintained at 2 ml min 1 the ph of mps dispersion and background solution was 6 5 and the is of nacl was 0 001 mol l 1 during the whole experimental process the experiments in the second and third parts were realized by changing the ph 4 6 5 and 9 of the mps neonicotinoid dispersion system cmps 300 mg l 1 cneonicotinoid 1 0 mmol l 1 and background solution and the is 0 001 0 005 0 01 and 0 1 mol l 1 of electrolyte nacl kcl nh4cl and mgcl2 respectively in all column experiments samples were collected every 2 5 ml from the beginning of mps dispersion injection the mps concentration was determined by measuring the light attenuation au at a wavelength of 500 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 fig s1 the light attenuation method based on sample turbidity is listed as a standard method for determining the concentration of suspended particles in natural water body in u s techniques of water resources investigations anderson 2005 all of the column experiments were repeated twice as shown in tables 1 and s2 2 4 mathematical model and equation an advection dispersion equation model was used to simulate the transport of mps to help explain pe and pp retention in sand columns jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2013 the adhesion tension of neonicotinoids on the surface of pe and pp was calculated by the young equation szymczyk et al 2014 the carbonyl index provides an indication of polymer aging based on changes resulting from oxidation and the degree of plastic you et al 2021 the detailed model equations and calculation formulas are shown in s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and structural characterization the sem micrograph in fig 1 a b shows the particle morphology and surface of pe and pp mps the particles of the two kinds of mps are similar and showed irregular shapes with cracks and pores the eds spectra of pe and pp show the basic constituent elements c and o of the two mp particles and the oxygen content of pp is evidently higher than that of pe table s3 compared with pe the isotherm of pp shows a higher quantity absorbed in the high relative pressure p p0 range fig 1c with the bet surface area of pp being 17 12 m2 g 1 which is higher than that of pe 2 34 m2 g 1 the reason for this difference is that pp has a smaller average pore diameter 6 9544 nm and larger pore volume 0 0751 cm3 g 1 than pe 23 9135 nm 0 0216 cm3 g 1 several studies we retrieved indicated that the specific surface area of pe and pp mps were 0 17 1 0159 m2 g 1 and 0 15 0 6477 m2 g 1 respectively and the pore volume were 0 0005 0 0260 cm3 g 1 and 0 0003 0 0011 cm3 g 1 respectively the specific surface area and pore volume of the pe and pp mps involved in our experiment may be larger than those of the actual environmental mps reported in other reports because they use larger particles for adsorption or toxicology experiments fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2012 lan et al 2022 li et al 2021 miao et al 2022 3 2 adsorption behavior 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the adsorption process of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on the surface of pe and pp mps fig 2 and table s4 provide all fitting curves and parameters the results showed that neonicotinoids were beneficial to the adsorption process of mps and the adsorption would be enhanced with the increase of neonicotinoid concentration in the solution the adsorption process of the three neonicotinoids on pe was more consistent with the langmuir model by comparing the correlation coefficient r2 0 97 this means that the adsorption was monolayer adsorption with a uniform particle surface and equal energy of each adsorption center and the interaction between neonicotinoid molecules could be ignored zhou et al 2022 the strong hydrophobicity of the pe surface might be the reason for the phenomenon jiang et al 2022 the adsorption capacities of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pe were 17 18 32 36 and 7 00 mg kg 1 respectively which were lower than those on pp 27 03 43 10 and 14 75 mg kg 1 the freundlich model can also better fit the adsorption data of three neonicotinoids on pp r2 0 93 because of the surface unevenness caused by the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pp the n value in the freundlich model has been used to determine the type of adsorption process in this part the n values of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram were greater than 1 indicating the existence of a physical adsorption process in the interaction between the three neonicotinoids and pe mps li et al 2021 the smaller n value indicated that the pore filling domain of pp contributes more to the adsorption than that of pe bakir et al 2012 which was consistent with the results of pore size distribution 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics the equilibrium adsorption capacity of three neonicotinoids on pe and pp increased rapidly in the first 1 h and then the adsorption rate gradually decreased the adsorption capacity did not change significantly after 6 h and reached equilibrium pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and two constant models all provided the fitting of adsorption kinetics fig s2 and the parameters are shown in table s5 the calculation of the pseudo second order model was closer to the experimental data indicating that the adsorption reaction took place through a multi step mechanism including external surface diffusion intraparticle diffusion and the interaction between adsorbate and active sites which was not a separate physical or chemical adsorption ji et al 2011 3 2 3 adsorption thermodynamics the relationship between 1 t and lnkd is shown in fig s3 the adsorption thermodynamic parameters are listed in table s6 δg was negative and increased with the temperature which indicated that the adsorption of the three neonicotinoids on the surface of pe and pp was spontaneous the positive δh value indicated that the adsorption processes of the three neonicotinoids on the surface of the mps were endothermic reactions it must be noted that the δh values of the adsorption of dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pe and pp ranged from 22 85 to 25 60 kj mol 1 and the adsorption of acetamiprid on pp was 19 43 kj mol 1 all close to 20 9 kj mol 1 s2 3 combined with the results of kinetic adsorption we did not consider that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mps was a single physical or chemical process but a combination arabkhani and asfaram 2020 wang et al 2020 the increase of chaos δs 0 in all systems also indicated that the adsorption processes were spontaneous 3 2 4 effect of ph and cation on adsorption as shown in fig 3 a b the adsorption capacity of the neonicotinoids decreased with the ph from 3 5 to 9 5 obviously the pka values of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram were 0 44 3 24 and 2 64 respectively table s1 which were all less than 3 5 when the ph pka the dissociation state of the three neonicotinoids played a dominant role in the solution not all appeared in molecular form consequently the effect of the increase of ph on the neonicotinoids was to increase the degree of dissociation and the negative charge the pe and pp surfaces showed negative potential in the experimental ph range and the number of negative charges on the mp particles surface increased with the ph value table 1 alkalinity can promote the weakening of the relative strength of hydrogen bonds between molecules and on the adsorbent surface and further aggravate the dissociation of organic molecules resulting in the increase of electrostatic repulsion between mps and anionic components which has become an important factor to inhibit adsorption fan et al 2017 fig 3c d shows that when the nacl is of the solution increased from 0 001 to 0 005 mol l 1 the adsorption capacities of the neonicotinoids increased this indicated that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mp particles was improved by the appropriate increase of is one of the reasons is that the is increased the n octanol water partition coefficient of the three neonicotinoids fig s4 inorganic salts can reduce the solubility of especially nonpolar and weakly polar organic compounds thereby transferring the adsorption equilibrium of neonicotinoids to the organic phase ma et al 2019 this salting out effect is an important mechanism affecting the adsorption of organic matter by non polar solid particles another reason is that the na positive charge content of the diffusion layer in the electric double layer of mps was increased by the introduction of nacl into the solution thus weakening the electrostatic repulsion between mps and neonicotinoids table s7 vilar et al 2005 these results confirmed that hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force were the important parts of the adsorption of three neonicotinoids on pe and pp when the is increased to 0 1 mol l 1 the adsorption capacities of the three neonicotinoids on pe and pp decreased salt concentration affected the aggregation of particles by compressing the electric double layer and reducing the repulsive force between particles which would effectively reduce the adsorption sites on the surface of mp particles jiang et al 2021 it is obvious that when the is of nacl in the solution reached the maximum in this experiment the compressed electric double layer was the limiting reason for the adsorption of neonicotinoids onto mps under the same is the adsorption laws of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pe and pp always followed na k nh4 mg2 fig s5a f this was related to the salting out ability of cations fig s6 the smaller the radius of cations the stronger the salting out ability and the stronger the hydrophobic interaction between mps and neonicotinoids li et al 2021 the bridging effect of the multivalent cation mg2 and the more obvious compression of the electric double layer led to the extremely limited adsorption sites of neonicotinoids on the surface of the mps jiang et al 2021 3 2 5 adsorption mechanism the results of the previous batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mps involved a complex mechanism rather than a single process the results of survey xps spectra fig s7 and sem mapping fig s8 showed that n or cl appeared on pe and pp after the adsorption of neonicotinoids in addition the signal intensity of the o element in pp mps was significantly stronger than that of pe the high resolution xps spectra of experimental samples before and after adsorption are shown in figs 4 and s9 in the c 1s region of pe fig 4a three peaks at 284 82 285 13 and 288 90 ev were attributed to c c c o and c o by comparing the binding energies of the mps c 1s and o 1s before and after adsorption the binding energy of the c o bond shifts to a higher position while the peak of c o and o 1s shifts to lower binding energy for instance the peak value of the c o bond decreased by 0 16 0 16 and 0 14 after the adsorption of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram on pp this indicates that the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of the mps participated in the adsorption and formed a chemical interaction with neonicotinoids in the n 1s region of acetamiprid fig 4c four peaks at binding energies of 397 54 398 49 399 17 and 405 06 ev were assigned to sp2 bonded nitrogen to carbon c n c nitrogen in tertiary nitrogen groups n c 3 cyano groups cn and pyridine aromatic structure owing to the charging between stacked interlayers respectively in the n 1s region of dinotefuran and nitenpyram fig 4d e two types of the peak at binding energies of 399 69 and 399 47 405 68 and 404 25 ev were assigned to n c n c and nitro groups no2 chen et al 2022 the binding energy of cn and no2 peaks shifted to a higher level and their strength were significantly weakened after the neonicotinoids were adsorbed on the surface of mps this appearance indicates that a new chemical bond or hydrogen bond was formed between cn no2 and mps and neonicotinoids can be adsorbed on mps through nitrogen containing functional groups the response of characteristic element cl of acetamiprid at different mps etching depths was investigated by xps ar ion etching technique the cl 2p spectra of the mps surface and etching depth at 5 nm 10 nm and 15 nm reflected the possibility of neonicotinoids entering the mps interior through cracks and pores fig s9c d jiang et al 2022 the results showed that the peak signal of cl 2p was the strongest on the surface of mps and then weakened with the increase of pores depth at the same depth the signal of cl 2p in pp pores was stronger than that of pe which indicates that the adsorption of acetamiprid on pp was more easily affected by mps cracks or pores jiang et al 2022 this difference was consistent with the results of adsorption isotherms and pore size distribution of mps several studies have shown that under the same particle size conditions the adsorption capacity of contaminants onto degradable mps maybe greater than that of pe and pp non degradable mps guo et al 2023 zuo et al 2019 this difference was related to the hydrophilicity and adsorption mechanism of the mps themselves therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to the role of polar functional groups of mps in adsorption and the contribution of various adsorption mechanisms in future research 3 3 effect of ph on transport pe and pp recoveries through the column were only 18 54 20 73 and 36 11 37 21 respectively when mp particles were transported separately under the conditions of solution ph 6 5 fig 5 and table 1 because of mps low density and strong hydrophobicity pe and pp were difficult to transport in the media the static contact angle of pp was smaller than that of pe fig s10 indicating that pp was more hydrophilic the ftir carbonyl index clearly show that pp has more oxygen containing functional groups than pe fig s11 these were the reasons for better pp suspension dispersion and pp transport capacity in saturated porous media was greater than pe fig 5 depicts the pe and pp penetration curves in saturated porous media at ph 4 0 6 5 and 9 0 when pe and pp mp particles were transported separately the recoveries increased with the ph value this was comparable to the transport behavior of colloidal particles in various media yin et al 2019 under alkaline conditions h would dissociate from oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of mp particles resulting in an increase in negatively charged functional groups and surface potential table 1 under acidic conditions the zeta potential of mp particles and quartz sand surface were the lowest table s8 because the electrostatic repulsion between the media and the particles was weak the pe and pp mps tended to deposit in the sand column when the ph of the solution was 4 the recoveries of pe and pp were promoted by 2 27 2 91 and 2 60 2 53 6 13 and 0 24 respectively owing to the presence of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram however at ph 9 the recoveries of pe and pp were reduced by 4 68 5 87 and 10 82 12 55 7 20 and 17 68 this phenomenon implied that the adsorbed neonicotinoids weakened the mps transport behavior s response to ph the adsorption experiment revealed that as ph increased the adsorption capacity of neonicotinoids on the surface of mps decreased owing to the surface of mps tending to deprotonate and the dissociation and polarity of neonicotinoids increasing in conclusion while alkaline conditions ph 9 could increase the electrostatic repulsive force between mps and media promoting the transport of pe and pp in the column they also reduce the adsorption capacity and surface charge of mps table 1 that is the negative charge on the mps surface was shielded by neonicotinoids obviously ph was a major factor in the former namely electrostatic repulsion between particles and media compared with the absence of neonicotinoids acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram in the solution reduced the zeta potential of pe from 29 72 mv to 25 49 mv 26 56 mv and 25 32 mv respectively under acidic conditions ph 4 however weak repulsion inhibited mp dispersion and transport but the adsorbent had the strongest adsorption capacity for neonicotinoids at this time acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram increased the zeta potential of pp from 7 88 mv to 9 79 mv 11 65 mv and 9 31 mv respectively this meant that the negative charge on the mps surface was supplemented by the adsorption of neonicotinoids as a result the presence of neonicotinoids slightly aided the transport of pe and pp under this condition the above results showed that compared with the control group without neonicotinoids ph affected the surface charge of particles by adjusting the adsorption of neonicotinoids on mps thereby weakened the response of mps transport to ph 3 4 effect of is on transport similar to the transport behavior of graphene oxide and biochar colloid the recoveries of pe and pp decreased continuously as the is of nacl in the solution increased from 0 001 to 0 1 mol l 1 when the is was 0 1 mol l 1 the two mp particles could barely flow out fig 6 and table s2 because hydrophobic particles do not form a hydration film on the surface which reduces the thickness of the electric double layer they are more susceptible to the influence of is than hydrophilic colloids manilo et al 2019 in contrast to single transport when pe and pp were transported with the three neonicotinoids the transport amount increased first and then decreased as the is of the solution increased fig 6 the recoveries of pe and pp increased by 12 66 9 73 and 9 23 7 82 8 69 and 7 95 respectively under the influence of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram when the is increased from 0 001 to 0 005 mol l 1 this meant that the transport capacity of mps was improved by the presence of neonicotinoids when the is of the solution was 0 005 mol l 1 at this time the zeta potential of pe and pp were slightly increased table s7 which was not only conducive to the transport of the two kinds of mps but also might indicate that the adsorption capacity of neonicotinoids on the mps was increased the results of adsorption study demonstrated that neonicotinoids could combine with mps via hydrophobic action and that the appropriate is of the solution can enhance the adsorption effect more cations brought by the increase of is could compete with neonicotinoids for binding water reducing the solubility of pollutants in solvents wang et al 2020 in this study pe and pp mps served as neonicotinoid carriers during transport because hydrophobic interaction is not a strong binding force the binding mode will change with the solubility of the neonicotinoid at 0 005 mol l 1 is it is obvious that the stability of mp particles was enhanced by stronger hydrophobic interaction and more surface negative charges resulting in easier movement of pe and pp in the media when the is continued to rise to 0 01 mol l 1 35 06 31 61 and 16 24 41 727 43 17 and 38 66 were the recoveries of pe and pe in the mps neonicotinoid coexistence system respectively and the highest recoveries were not more than 3 38 when the is finally increased to 0 1 mol l 1 this is because excess counterions in the solution compressed the electric double layer of the two types of mps and the zeta potential of pe and pp particles was significantly reduced making the mps more prone to agglomeration the above results showed that the low is 0 005 mol l 1 promoted the transport of mps due to the increase of the adsorption capacity of the neonicotinoids on the mps and the surface charge of the particles however when the is of the solution was greater than 0 005 mol l 1 the leading role was the inhibition of is on the transport of mps 3 5 effect of cation on transport other monovalent cations k nh4 had a similar effect on the cotransport of mps and neonicotinoids as na all recoveries increased first then decreased as is increased when the repulsion force between mps was significantly enhanced by the increase of is 0 005 mol l 1 the transport amount of pe and pp was all promoted when they were cotransported with acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram figs s12 and s13 and table s2 because of the difference in cation hydration ability the effect of monovalent cations on the recoveries of pe and pp when the is 0 01 mol l 1 follows the rule of na k nh4 this is consistent with the pp and pe adsorption conclusion however the hydration ability of the high valence cations was greater than that of the monovalent cations but mg2 did not improve the transport ability of the two mps indicating that the bridging effect of the multivalent cations cannot be ignored fig s14 and table s2 the zeta potential data in table s7 strongly support this phenomenon the zeta potential of mp particles under the mg2 action was smaller under the same is 3 6 promotional effect of neonicotinoids on transport of pe and pp mps the above transport experiments showed that the behavior of pe and pp mps transported separately was similar to that of engineering nanomaterials but the existence of neonicotinoids in the solution caused unexpected changes in the migration of mps in order to explore how neonicotinoids affect the migration behavior of mps in the media we carried out the cotransport experiment of pe and pp with acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram at various concentrations under the condition of constant ph 6 5 and is 0 001 mol l 1 the mobility of pe and pp mp particles was improved in all treatments when pe and pp were transported with the three neonicotinoids fig 7 the promotion effect of mp particle transportation always followed the order dinotefuran acetamiprid nitenpyram at the same neonicotinoid concentration the zeta potential of the particles in the system increased to different degrees after the addition of neonicotinoids compared with a single pe or pp suspension table 1 for instance the zeta potential of pe dispersion was 14 19 mv however the zeta potential of the dispersion was 19 54 mv and 20 87 mv when the addition concentration of dinotefuran was 0 5 and 1 0 mmol l 1 respectively the enhancement of zeta potential was not only conducive to the dispersion between particles but also strengthened the electrostatic repulsion between mps and media which were beneficial to transport significantly the effect of different concentrations of neonicotinoids on the zeta potential of pe and pp mps had a good correlation with the mobility of the mps themselves that is the greater the zeta potential the higher the migration of particles this also showed that neonicotinoids promoted the transport of mps first by increasing the surface charge of mps the static contact angle of ultrapure water on the surface of mps adsorbed with different neonicotinoids was measured to investigate the change in hydrophilicity of pe and pp after the adsorption of neonicotinoids fig s10 the contact angle of the droplets on the surface of the mps adsorbed with neonicotinoids was smaller than that of the sample before adsorption indicating that the mp particles gained stronger hydrophilicity after neonicotinoids adsorption and thus these three neonicotinoids could promote mps transport however the essential reason why neonicotinoids promoted the transport of pe and pp by improving the hydrophilicity of mps was that neonicotinoids enhanced the polarity of particles thus causing stronger hydrophilic repulsion between particles of the same kind this stronger hydrophilic repulsion was firstly due to the fact that the mps adsorbed with neonicotinoids could repel each other through lewis acid base force at this time the attraction of mps to water molecules was stronger than the lewis acid base cohesive attraction between water molecules in other words the value of the polar free energy of repulsion was greater than the hydrophobic attraction energy which led to the formation of a layer of water shell on the surface of mps van oss 2003 secondly adsorption expanded the gap of electron accepticity and electron donicity between hydrophilic surfaces and water van oss 1997 table 1 depicts the static contact angles of acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram droplets at the concentrations of 0 5 1 0 and 2 5 mmol l 1 on pe and pp tablets the young equation was used to calculate the adhesion tension of various neonicotinoids on pe and pp surfaces fig s15 the adhesive tension of the neonicotinoids on the surface of the two plastics was dinotefuran acetamiprid nitenpyram at the same concentration this meant that the higher the adhesive tension of the neonicotinoid on the surface of the mps the stronger the neonicotinoid s polarity modification ability on the mps and ultimately the higher the recovery of the mp particles after passing through the sand column however as the neonicotinoid concentration increased from 0 5 to 2 5 mmol l 1 the recoveries of pe and pp increased first and then decreased when neonicotinoid concentrations were increased to 1 0 mmol l 1 pe and pp recoveries also increased to 29 29 37 37 and 29 63 46 12 53 37 and 46 47 respectively fig 7 and table 1 neonicotinoid promotion of pe and pp transport at low concentrations is ascribed to the fact that mp particles could combine with organic neonicotinoids through hydrophobic interaction that is the hydrophobic end of these three neonicotinoids pointed to mp particles and the hydrophilic end pointed to dispersants which undoubtedly increased the polarity of mps in the dispersion system wang et al 2020 nevertheless when the neonicotinoid concentration was increased from 1 0 to 2 5 mmol l 1 the above promotion effect was inhibited and the recoveries of pe and pp were reduced to 25 38 32 78 and 24 64 40 98 47 56 and 40 89 respectively fig 7 and table 1 previous research confirmed that the adsorption capacity of a surfactant or surfactant like molecule on colloidal particles increased with the surfactant concentration implying that the higher the surfactant concentration the stronger the hydrophilic modification of particles the hydrophilic modification was no longer boosted until the surfactant molecules reached the critical micelle concentration and became saturated on the particle surface sun et al 2022 acetamiprid dinotefuran and nitenpyram had critical micelle concentrations of 14 9 22 8 and 32 3 mmol l 1 respectively which were much higher than the concentrations used in the experiment fig s16 as a result combined with the results of the adsorption experiments we confirmed that when the concentration of neonicotinoids was less than 1 0 mmol l 1 they adsorbed on the surface of mps preferentially via hydrophobic interaction when the concentration was greater than 1 0 mmol l 1 the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of the mps formed chemisorption or hydrogen bonding with a portion of the neonicotinoids the hydrophilic functional groups were shielded at this point and the stability of the mp particles was reduced once more the zeta potential results can support the preceding conclusion the pe and pp zeta potentials were lower at 2 5 mmol l 1 neonicotinoid than at 0 5 and 1 0 mmol l 1 neonicotinoid respectively in conclusion we believe that the neonicotinoids adsorbed on the surface of the mps had caused two effects first the collision probability between particles and between particles and media was reduced by increasing the surface charge of the mps electrostatic interaction second the attached neonicotinoids enhanced the hydrophilic repulsion between particles undoubtedly both of these two effects made the mps obtain better dispersion and transport capacity equally important the advection dispersion equation model accurately simulates experimental data indicating that the transport of pe and pp mps in porous media has colloidal characteristics the r2 and smax values in tables 1 and s2 indicate high goodness of fit for example the smax value was the smallest when pe was cotransported with 1 0 mmol l 1 concentration of dinotefuran indicating that pe was easier to transport in the media and the retention amount was lower under this condition 4 conclusions in the farmland environment neonicotinoids can be spontaneously adsorbed on agricultural film mps via oxygen containing functional groups on mps the cyano group on acetamiprid and the nitro group on dinotefuran and nitenpyram this process involves chemical interaction hydrogen bond hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction and other mechanisms the adsorption capacity of mps was also affected by their surface properties and pores as demonstrated by pe and pp in this study chemical solution conditions are likely to influence neonicotinoid adsorption on agricultural film mps and their transport in the underground environment because of the non polar properties of the mulching film mps it is possible to change their hydrophilicity via hydrophobic interaction with the neonicotinoids adsorbed on their surfaces therefore the resulting environmental risks cannot be ignored this research could aid in understanding the interaction between mulch film mps and neonicotinoids during cotransport in an agricultural environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

14829,excessive nutrients have disrupted pathways of microbial mediated nitrogen n cycle in urban rivers and caused bioavailable n to accumulate in sediments while remedial actions sometimes fail to recover degraded river ecosystems even when environmental quality has been improved it is not sufficient to revert the ecosystem to its original healthy state by restoring the pre degradation environmental conditions as explained by alternative stable states theory understanding the recovery of disrupted n cycle pathways from the perspective of alternative stable states theory can benefit effective river remediation previous studies have found alternative microbiota states in rivers however the existence and implications of alternative stable states in microbial mediated n cycle pathway remain unclear here high throughput sequencing and n related enzyme activities measurement were combined in the field investigation to provide empirical evidence for the bi stability in microbially mediated n cycle pathways according to the behavior of bistable ecosystems the existence of alternative stable states in microbial mediated n cycle pathway have been shown and nutrient loading mainly total nitrogen and total phosphorus were identified as key driver of regime shifts in addition potential analysis revealed that reducing nutrient loading shifted the n cycle pathway to a desirable state characterized by high ammonification and nitrification probably avoiding the accumulation of ammonia and organic n it should be noted that the improvement of microbiota status can facilitate the recovery of the desirable pathway state according to the relationship between microbiota states and n cycle pathway states keystone species including rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were discerned by network analysis and the increase in their relative abundance may facilitate the improvement of microbiota status the obtained results suggested that the nutrient reduction should be combined with microbiota management to benefit the bioavailable n removal in urban rivers therefore providing a new insight into alleviating adverse effects of the nutrient loading on urban rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords alternative stable states theory microbial mediated nitrogen cycle sediment nutrients effective river restoration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the management of urban rivers has long received public attention because they provide various ecosystem services but are vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance best 2018 with the rapid urbanization large amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorous p has been discharged into urban rivers leading to the degradation of river ecosystems bush et al 2017 diamond et al 2021 it has been investigated that river ecosystems have multi stability under similar conditions diamond et al 2021 shang et al 2021 tauro 2021 suggesting that the degradation of urban rivers is likely to be a catastrophic shift accompanied by the abrupt and radical loss of ecosystem structure and functioning scheffer et al 2001 various remediation measures have been implemented to restore structure and functioning of urban river ecosystems while these measures sometimes failed to make achievements even though water quality has been improved liu et al 2020a 2020b which could be attributed to the existence of alternative stable states in river ecosystems under similar environmental conditions scheffer et al 2001 classical examples of this phenomenon come from shallow lakes which exhibit either a clear water state or a turbid water state under similar nutrient loading reducing nutrient loading to the pre degradation level is insufficient to revert lakes from a turbid water state to a clear water state due to hysteresis dakos et al 2019 scheffer et al 2001 therefore understanding alternative stable states and the state recovery trajectory in river ecosystems is crucial for urban river management agencies to implement effective remediation strategies most nutrients in urban rivers are deposited in sediments which are inhabited by abundant and diverse microorganisms that play an essential role in influencing the functioning of river ecosystems such as biogeochemical cycling and energy flow yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b changes in nutrient loading in sediment can alter other environmental factors and thus reshape benthic microbial communities xuan et al 2022 reducing nutrient loading has been shown to improve the anoxic conditions in overlying water thereby increasing the abundance of aerobic microbes and undermining the dominance of anaerobic microbes bush et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in addition it has been found that microbial communities changed markedly when nutrient loading was reduced to a critical threshold liu et al 2020a attractively a recent study has demonstrated that benthic microbes were bistable and the improvement in sediment quality drove the regime shift in microbial communities accompanied by an increase in biodiversity shang et al 2021 therefore a reduction in the nutrient loading an important evaluation index of sediment quality may also lead to the regime shift in benthic microbial communities however whether the reduction of nutrient loading drives the regime shift in benthic microbiota status and the impact of such shift on the ecosystem functioning remain open questions the n cycle is significant in maintaining the biogeochemical balance of urban rivers excessive nutrient inputs have affected n cycle pathways and caused the accumulation of bioavailable n e g ammonium and organic n in river sediments leading to hypoxia black odorous rivers and other environmental problems aalto et al 2018 wu et al 2019 considering n cycle in urban rivers are mainly mediated by microorganisms regime shifts in benthic microbes driven by reduced nutrient loading probably alter n cycle pathways therefore avoiding the accumulation of bioavailable n previous studies have found that reducing nutrient loading will benefit microbial nitrification and ammonification by increasing the oxygen content of the overlying water sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 consequently facilitating the removal of ammonium liu et al 2022 however it remains unclear whether the regime shift in the benthic microbial community signifies an alteration in the n cycling pathway and whether such an alternation avoids the accumulation of bioavailable n over the past decades many studies have been conducted to investigate regime shift and alternative stable states in ecosystems berdugo et al 2017 diamond et al 2021 gonze et al 2017 lahti et al 2014 rindi et al 2017 as described by the alternative stable states theory ecosystems with more than one attraction basin will suddenly shift into a contrasting state in response to the changes in environmental stress and shifts between attractors have obvious hysteresis traits scheffer et al 2001 scheffer and carpenter 2003 accordingly variables reflecting ecosystem state will exhibit multimodality of frequency distributions demonstrating the existence of multiple attractors namely multiple stable states scheffer and carpenter 2003 by visualizing attraction basins and constructing stability landscapes potential analysis has been commonly used to identify alternative stable states in many ecosystems such as forest hirota et al 2011 dry land chen et al 2020 and marine rindi et al 2017 improving the understanding of alternative stable states in various macro ecosystems nevertheless to our knowledge no study has adopted this approach in micro ecosystems considering that the state of micro ecosystems cannot be directly described by tree cover as in the case of forest ecosystems there remains a fundamental challenge in applying potential analysis in investigating alternative stable states in microbially mediated n cycle pathways therefore the study selected a highly urbanized river network as study area and aims to answer the following questions i do multi modality or even multi stability exist in riverine microbial community and n cycle pathways if so ii what are key nutrients and how these nutrients drive regime shifts in benthic microbial community and n cycle pathways in a highly urbanized river network iii what are relationships between alternative microbiota states and alternative n cycle pathway state also iv what implications for urban river management can be drawn from this relationship our findings empirically illustrated the multi stability in microbial communities and n cycle pathways and visually displayed state recovery trajectories in an urban river ecosystem thus providing a meaningful insight into implementing effective restoration strategies and alleviating adverse effects of the nutrient loading on n cycle pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing this study was conducted in the river network in the northern and southern plains of the mulan river with a total area of 425 km2 which is a region with an intensive river network a dense population and a high degree of urbanization in putian china 59 sampling sites were set up alone the river network fig 1 fig s1 and the sampling occurred in january 2022 in each sampling site water depth was about 3 m channel width varied from 3 to 8 m some samples were failed to collected due to the dredging therefore a total of 45 sediment samples was collected fig s1 data s1 at each sampling site surface sediment sample top 0 10 cm was collected in triplicate using a grab sampler xdb0201 changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china samples were mixed for homogenization sealed in plastic bags and then immediately shipped to the laboratory each sample was separated into two parts one was stored at 4 c for environmental parameters and enzyme activities measurements and the other was stored at 80 c for microbial dna extraction the conventional physicochemical parameters in water including temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity and oxidation reduction potential were measured in situ by the hach hq30d portable meter hach co loveland co usa sediment samples for environmental parameters analysis were first sieved through a 150 μm sieve the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and nitrite nitrogen no 2 n in sediments were determined using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa as described by zhang et al 2019c the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total organic carbon toc were measured using the standard methods as described by wu et al 2019 the total organic nitrogen ton concentration was calculated as tn concentration minus the total inorganic nitrogen concentration tin including nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n 2 2 dna extraction and processing microbial dna was extracted from 0 3 g sediment samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to manufacturer s instructions dna integrity in samples was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis and then the dna was stored at 20 c until amplification and sequencing conducted at shanghai biozeron co ltd shanghai china the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified 95 c for 2 min followed by 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min using primer pairs 341f and 806r amplicons were extracted from 2 agarose gels and purified using the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca u s purified pcr products were quantified by qubit 3 0 life invitrogen and then were paired end sequencing on an illumina platform the raw dna sequencing data are available at the ncbi sra under project accession prjna85092 raw fastq files were demultiplexed using in house perl scripts according to three criteria as described by zhang et al 2019c reads which could not be assembled were discarded the remaining sequences were dereplicated and subjected to the dada2 algorithm qiime 2 recommended to identify indel mutations and substitutions callahan et al 2016 paired reads were trimmed and filtered with a maximum of two expected errors per read the phylogenetic affiliation of each 16s rrna gene sequence namely amplicon sequence variants asvs was analyzed by rdp classifier performed in http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu132 16s rrna database with a confidence threshold of 70 after merging paired reads and chimera filtering amato et al 2013 2 3 assessment of functionality of n cycle pathways enzyme activities were used to assess n cycle pathways because enzyme exhibits the functions encoded in genes and reflects the role of microbiota in n cycling li et al 2020 ammonification nitrification and denitrification are three microbial n cycle pathways involved in tn removal from sediments therefore chitinase chi hydroxylamine oxidase hao and nitrite reductase nir were measured to describe potential ammonification nitrification and denitrification respectively kuypers et al 2018 these three enzyme activities were measured at sci go www sci go com using elisa kit nanjing molfarming biotechnology co ltd and molecular devices spectramax 190 was applied to determine the absorbance 585 nm for chi 45 nm for hao 450 nm for nir li et al 2020 each individual enzyme activity was normalized using the formula f x x i x min x max x min where x i x min and x max are the true minimum and maximum values of variable i that observed in the study area respectively schuldt et al 2018 the values for each normalized enzyme activity were then averaged to obtain a composite index m describing the n cycle pathways berdugo et al 2017 the correlation between the normalized enzyme activity and nutrient loading was visualized using ggpmisc package in r v4 1 3 https www r project org and the smoothing method used in the stat smooth function is lm 2 4 nutrient pollution degree assessments the comprehensive pollution index approach was used to assess the nutrient pollution degree in river sediments 1 s j c j c s 2 f f f 2 f max 2 2 where s j is the single evaluation index of variable j j tn and tp cj is the observed value of variable j and cs is assessment criteria value of variable j cs of tn is 550 mg kg 1 and cs of tp is 600 mg kg 1 according to leivuori and niemistoe 1995 ff is the comprehensive pollution index f and f max are the average and maximum values of s s t n and s stp respectively 2 5 statistical analyses 16s rrna gene sequences of all samples were rarified to keep 21 688 sequences per sample jensen shannon divergence between samples was achieved using philentropy package in r v4 2 2 partitioning around the medoid pam clustering algorithm on jensen shannon divergence at genus levels were applied to cluster samples into different groups and was achieved using cluster package silhouette index was used to determine the optimal number of clusters as described by gao et al 2021 subsequently the principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed using vegan package v2 6 2 to visually show differences between microbial community types analysis of similarities anosim was achieved using anosim function in the vegan package to evaluate whether the group differences in are significant the α diversity indices including shannon chao1 richness inverse simpson ace and pielou were calculated using the biozeron cloud platform http www cloud biomicroclass com cloudplatform the correlation between microbial communities and environmental factors was calculated and visualized by redundancy analysis rda since the length of axis 1 of detrended correspondence analysis was less than 3 0 in this online platform microbial networks were constructed to illustrate differences between different microbial community structures using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline menap according to the instructions zhou et al 2011 genera with occurrence in at least 25 of sediment samples were selected for obtaining similarity matrix based on the pearson s correlation gephi http gephi github io was used to visualize microbial networks and obtain network modularity values of within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi were acquired from the menap to find key taxa according to a previous report olesen et al 2007 specifically genera with zi 2 5 or pi 0 62 will be identified as key taxa structure of function relationships was assessed to describe characterization of two contrasting functionality states the value of each individual n transformation process was the normalized enzyme activity accordingly pearson s correlations were calculated between each individual n transformation process and also between each individual n transformation process and the m index all related information were put into gephi to visualize the structure of function relationships the bimodal distribution and probability density function pdf of state variables were obtained using mclust package v6 0 0 bayesian information criterion bic was used to determine whether the frequency distribution was unimodal or bimodal briefly bi or multimode should have a lower bic compared to one mode berdugo et al 2017 the bimodality coefficient and frequency minima were get using potential analysis function in the microbiome package the potential of the ecosystem was calculated from pdf of the state variables using the formula u σ 2 2 log p d f where u and σ are estimated potential and noise level respectively u u σ 2 was used as the scaled potential because only a qualitative estimation of the potential is required hirota et al 2011 in stability landscapes derived from pdf black balls show stable states and the white ball shows unstable state marking border between bistable states stability landscapes reflecting multiple stable states under a specific range of an environmental stress herein nutrient pollution degree were constructed using the movpotential ews function in the earlywarnings package in r v4 2 2 hirota et al 2011 scheffer et al 2012 and the relevant parameters are used by default the visualization of stability landscapes was realized in origin 2018 using contour color fill the minima and maxima of the potential at a given nutrient pollution degree correspond to the stable and unstable states respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 bimodality of benthic microbial community using the pam approach and silhouette index samples were automatically clustered into two different groups and differences in these groups were visualized in the pcoa plot fig 2 a the result showed these two microbial communities separated basically along the pcoa axis 1 and anosim indicated that these two microbial communities have significant differences fig s2 thus the pcoa1 coordinates were regarded as an indicators of microbiota states to better examine these two microbial community types the frequency distribution analysis demonstrated the bimodal distribution of microbial communities further demonstrating the existence of two different microbiota types fig 2b bimodal distribution of microbial communities could be explained by three possible factors fig 2f h one is the artifacts due to the unbalanced sampling events lahti et al 2014 one is the nonlinear response with critical threshold of microbial community to environmental conditions van de guchte et al 2021 and the another is the bistable or hysteretic response of microbial community to similar environmental conditions scheffer and carpenter 2003 to test these possibilities the distribution of microbiota states in subgroups with similar nutrient loading was analyzed the result showed these two microbiota types co existed in most subgroups fig 2d which invalidated the second possibilities in addition the distribution of microbial communities displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality along the gradient of nutrient loading table s1 which was in line with the expectation of alternative stable states theory scheffer and carpenter 2003 and also invalidated the first possibilities consequently these examinations invalidated the first two possibilities fig 2f and g importantly a stability landscape describing the number and value of alternative microbiota states was constructed by potential analysis fig 2c the result illustrated that there were two basins of attraction and were separated by an unstable equilibrium indirectly supporting the last possibility however further studies are needed to investigating temporal trend in microbial community structure to provide direct evidence on the alternative microbiota states thereby benefiting the understanding of river ecosystems in urban areas to better clarify the characteristics of these two microbiota states in this study the one with low values of pcoa1 was referred to as the microbiota state a and the other with high values of pcoa1 was referred to as the microbiota state b co occurrence networks of microbiota state a network a and b network b were constructed to understand structural differences between these two microbiota states fig 2e in these networks only regionally abundant genera that were present in 25 of sediment samples in study area were selected specifically compared to the network b the ratio of nodes to edges in the network a was relatively low indicating a smaller number of co occurrences in network a in addition network a was characterized by small network size low average degree low average clustering coefficient and small number of keystone species while the network b was characterized by the opposite properties table s2 fig s5 illustrating the relatively high complexity of the network b yuan et al 2021 3 2 bimodality of n cycle pathways n cycle pathways here refers to the multiple n transformation processes regarding ammonification nitrification and denitrification which were assessed by analyzing chi hao and nir three n transformation processes responded differently to nutrient loading fig 3 e at the nutrient loading range of 0 1 most samples exhibited high ability of ammonification and nitrification but low ability of denitrification at the nutrient loading range of 2 3 most samples exhibited low ability of ammonification and nitrification but high ability of denitrification at the nutrient loading range of 1 2 there were large uncertainties in the strengths of three processes according to the linear fitting ammonification and nitrification decreased with increasing nutrients while denitrification increased with increasing nutrients fig 3e which were consistent with observations reported in the previous studies li et al 2020 wu et al 2019 to better understand n cycle pathways in the study area the m index describing the total functionality of n cycle pathways was used the frequency distribution of m index exhibited two modes namely low m index of 0 33 and high m index of 0 59 with the frequency minima at 0 48 fig 3a to better distinguish between these two functionality states the one with low m index was referred to as the pathway state a and the other with high m index was referred to as the pathway state b it should be noted that chi hao and nir were used to assess n cycle pathways in this study because ammonification nitrification and denitrification are of great importance in tn removal from urban rivers considering n cycle involves many other n transformation processes such as n fixation and anammox further efforts comprehensively evaluating the total functionality of n cycle pathways is encouraged to find the most probable explanation for the bimodal distribution of m index i e artifacts critical threshold response or bistable response analyses similar to those in section 3 1 were performed the result showed these two functionality states co existed in most subgroups fig 3c in addition along the gradient of nutrient loading the distribution of m index displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality table s3 furthermore a stability landscape depicting the number and value of estimated alternative n cycle pathway states was constructed fig 3b indirectly confirming bistability is the most possible explanation for the bimodal distribution of m index fig 2h the correlations between pairs of n transformation processes were calculated to understand different characteristics of two functionality states and functional networks were used to visualize these correlations fig 3c in sites of pathway sate b all of three n transformation processes were strong and these three processes maintained the functionality together in sites of pathway state a ammonification and nitrification were weak and denitrification was decoupled in maintaining the total functionality of n cycle pathways fig 3d 3 3 identification of key nutrients to disentangle relationships between nutrient loading and ecosystem states the rda were performed to find factors causing differences in microbial community structures fig s3a toc p 0 001 tn p 0 001 nh 4 p 0 001 and tp p 0 05 were recognized as significant factors affecting microbial communities to further test which nutrients were drivers of two microbiota states samples were divided into subgroups based on the gradient of each environmental factor to examine the multimodality of microbial communities in each subgroup table s4 s7 the results showed that the distribution of microbial communities displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality only along the gradient of tn and tp which was in line with the behavior of an ecosystem with bistable states scheffer et al 2001 scheffer and carpenter 2003 in addition microbiota state a and b separated along the axis of tn or tp as showed in the rda plot fig s3b therefore tn and tp were identified as main nutrient pollutants driving shifts between these two microbiota states a closer examination into the rda plot fig s3b revealed that angles between many communities in the microbiota state a and tn and tp concentrations were acute demonstrating the positive relationships on opposite angles between most communities in the microbiota state b and tn and tp concentrations were obtuse demonstrating the negative relationships to better illustrate the effects of identified drivers on the riverine benthic ecosystems the comprehensive pollution index ff considering both tn and tp concentrations was adopted the frequency distribution of microbial community also displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality along the gradient of ff table s1 demonstrating the reliability of this pollution index notably the frequency distribution of m index also displayed a similar pattern along the gradient of ff table s3 therefore tn and tp are identified as key nutrients driving regime shifts in both microbial communities and n cycle pathways 3 4 trajectories of ecosystem responses to nutrient loading to infer the stable and unstable states in driver spaces stability landscapes reflecting ecosystem responses to changes in nutrient pollution were built the results showed ecosystem states stabilize to two local minima displaying hysteresis traits in response to the increase and decrease in ff fig 4 for microbial community the bistable region was at the ff range of 1 2 1 6 which means microbiota state can be either a or b at that range of nutrient loading microbial community stayed at the microbiota state a when the ff was above 1 6 and reducing the ff to below 1 6 was thought to be insufficient to shift the microbiota state from a to b unless the ff was largely reduced e g ff 1 2 for n cycle pathways when ff was above 1 3 the n cycle pathways will stay at pathway state a in which concentrations of bioavailable nh 4 and on were high reducing the ff to below 1 3 may be insufficient to recover the desirable functionality state given that functionality state can be either pathway state a or b at the ff range of 0 4 1 3 notably in sites of pathway state a denitrification was dominant while ammonification and nitrification were limited probably leading to the accumulation of nh 4 and on the analysis of n content in different pathway states under similar range of nutrient loading 0 4 ff 1 3 revealed high concentrations of nh 4 and ton in sites of the pathway state a fig s4 given that similar nutrient loading in sites of these two functionality states the accumulation of nh 4 and on suggested low n self removal capacity in sites of the pathway state a probably threating ecological health of the river ecosystem the high concentration of nh 4 in rivers has gained great scientific concerns because it has high toxic effect to aquatic life and signifies the degradation in river ecosystems wang et al 2020 ton especially dissolved organic nitrogen don can be utilized by microbes and form microbe derived don mdon such as amino acids protein and their derivates lin et al 2021 the mdon is an active precursor of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts and can readily induce harmful algal blooms due to its high bioavailability lin et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a the comparison of chlorophyll a concentration between two pathway states further demonstrated the adverse effects of on on river ecosystems fig s4 ultimately the accumulation of nh 4 and ton in sediments is likely to pose great ecologic risks to river ecosystems in addition when ff is above 1 6 both microbial communities and n cycle pathways stabilize to an undesirable state at that range the complexity of microbial community was relatively low table s2 suggesting microbial community may be vulnerable to the change in environmental conditions yuan et al 2021 in addition bioavailable nh 4 and on were accumulated in sediments due to weak strengths of ammonification and nitrification probably causing high ecological risks consistent with previous studies cheng et al 2021 leivuori and niemistoe 1995 ye et al 2019 yu et al 2017 ff 1 5 is characterized as moderately or heavily polluted that is likely to threaten the health of aquatic ecosystems it should be noted that ff 1 3 may also have caused n cycle pathways to remain at an undesirable state although this nutrient loading range is characterized as slightly polluted or clean the occurrence of this phenomenon could be partly attributed to the existence of functional redundancy allison and martiny 2008 under such conditions a longer hysteresis response of n cycle pathways to nutrient loading will be caused making the microbiota state shift from a to b while functionality remained at an undesirable state 3 5 relationship between microbiota states and n cycle pathway states microbial communities and n cycle pathways responded similarly to nutrient loading fig 4 suggesting closed relationship between them to detangle to what extent n cycle pathways were related to microbiota states the taxonomic differences between the two microbiota states were examined at the phylum level abundant microorganisms in microbiota state a and b were similar and the difference was that microbiota state a had abundant fusobacteria fig s5a fusobacteria is the anaerobic bacteria sun et al 2019 suggesting high nutrient loading in the sites of microbiota state a site a has created anaerobic environments at the order level fig s5b clostridales and bacteroidales two major microbial indicators of black odorous rivers hu et al 2017 were abundant at site a further suggesting its anaerobic conditions notably site a harbored abundant pseudomonadales and rhodocyclales that involved in denitrification which could be partly attributed the anaerobic environments in site a hesselsoe et al 2009 wei et al 2019 compared to site a sites of microbiota state b site b harbored more diverse n transformation bacteria such as chitinophagales involved in ammonification worner and pester 2019 sphingomomadales involved in nitrification and denitrification zhang et al 2019c under such conditions site b should have relatively high m index compared to site a given that high m index means the ability to participate multiple n transformation processes keystone species were identified by constructing co occurrence networks to further detangle the relationship between microbial communities and n cycle pathways fig s5 rhizobiales involved in denitrification was identified as a keystone in both network a and b sphingomonadales involved in nitrification and denitrification was identified as a keystone in network b in addition relative abundances of rhizobiales and sphingomonadales in site a were significantly lower than in site b fig s6 together these results demonstrated that potential for n transformation was relatively lower in microbiota state a than in microbiota state b this was consistent with the result shown in fig 4 that sites with low m index were dominated by the microbiota state a when ff 1 6 a map depicting their probability density distribution further illustrated the relationship between microbial community and n cycle pathways fig 5 most samples in site a had the low m index while most samples in site b had the high m index importantly if nutrient loading was more than 1 0 the functionality state of site a will be limited to the pathway state a and reverting to the desirable functionality state was observably difficult of particular concern was that most sites of pathway state b high m index were belong to site b 76 implying the significance of microbiota state b in maintaining high m index these results indicated that shifting microbial community from state a to state b is an indispensable way to improve m index in addition bacterial α diversity was positively correlated with the m index in site a fig s7 implying that increasing biodiversity may benefit the improvement of m index in site a 3 6 implications for urban river management catastrophic shifts are increasingly observed in ecosystems such as shallow lakes scheffer et al 1993 forests hirota et al 2011 and coral reefs mccook 1999 recently river ecosystems have also been thought to have multi stability and probably experience catastrophic shifts diamond et al 2021 shang et al 2021 tauro 2021 although the prominent importance of n cycle in river ecosystem investigations of n cycle pathways from the perspective of multi stability have been scare this study provided a deep understanding of how functionality of n cycle pathways responds to nutrient loading by assessing the existence and influencing factors of alternative n cycle pathway states the obtained results contribute to the search for possible ways to improve n self removal capacity and mitigate adverse effects of high nutrient loading in urban rivers with the increase of nutrient inputs into urban rivers various eco environmental problems have arisen due to biogeochemical imbalance especially n imbalance the study visually demonstrated the hysteretic response of the total functionality of n cycle pathways to the increasing nutrient loading the results implied that when the sediment was slightly or non contaminated i e ff 1 3 n cycle pathways were likely to be at a desirable state the pathway state b characterized by strong ammonification nitrification and denitrification however as sediments are moderately or seriously polluted i e ff 1 3 the ecosystem could suddenly shift to the alternatively undesirable state leading to the accumulation of nh 4 and on in addition reducing the nutrient loading to the original level i e ff 1 3 may be insufficient to revert the desirable state unless the nutrient loading was largely reduced or microbiota state was improved it should be noted that regime shifts may begin in the area of the ecosystem closest to the threshold of nutrient loading and gradually spread around as predicted by ecological theory eklof et al 2020 therefore sites closest to the threshold of regime shifts ff 1 3 for n cycle pathway deserve more attention to prevent the occurrence of the undesirable pathway state pathway state b with high m index in urban rivers was found to benefit the reduction of bioavailable n compound and the improvement of n self removal capacity nutrient driven alternative n cycle pathway states and alternative microbiota states were found to be closely related thus providing some insights into avoiding the accumulation of bioavailable n in urban rivers fig 6 according to the obtained results the reduction of nutrient loading to the slightly polluted level i e ff 1 3 is necessary and indispensable because the pathway state b only exist below this threshold further reducing nutrient loading to the safe level i e ff 0 9 will largely ensure that the pathway state b did not shift to the pathway state a recover trajectory 2 however this way may be time consuming costly and sometimes inefficient because nutrients are hard to be removed from sediments and imbalance in n p ratio also cause undesirable changes in river ecosystems ibanez and penuelas 2019 tong et al 2020 the alternative way recover trajectory 1 is to keep microbial community in the microbiota state b which can be realized by strengthening the resilience of this state ling et al 2015 shang et al 2021 it has been identified that rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were keystone species of these two microbiota states and that both taxa were more abundant in microbiota state b than in microbiota state a therefore the increase in the dominance of rhizobiales and sphingomonadales may strengthen the resilience of microbiota state b given that abundant anaerobic bacteria are enriched at site a weakening the resilience of the microbiota state a by increasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in site a may also facilitate the shift from the microbiota state a to b 4 conclusion in summary this study provided the first field based evidence for the existence of alternative n cycle pathway states and impacts of regime shift in microbial communities on n cycle in urban rivers improving the capacity to anticipate catastrophic shifts in river ecosystems tn and tp were identified as main drivers of alternative stable states in benthic microbes and n cycle pathways and these two nutrients were combined to obtain a composite index ff to describe nutrient loading reducing nutrient loading was found to shift the n cycle pathway to a desirable state namely the pathway state b characterized by high ammonification nitrification and denitrification the maintenance of the pathway state b in urban rivers could probably avoid the accumulation of bioavailable nh 4 and on it should be noted that microbial communities play an important role in influencing n cycle pathways results indicated that the pathway state b can be maintained almost when the microbial community was in the microbiota state b characterized by high complexity keystone species including rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were thought to play a vital role in maintaining the resilience of the microbiota state b and thus may facilitate the shift of the n cycle pathway to the pathway state b the obtained results will help fill in the knowledge gaps related to the bistable response of the total functionality of n cycle pathways to the gradient of nutrient loading and provide new insights into the improvement of bioavailable n removal capacity in rivers of urban areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14829,excessive nutrients have disrupted pathways of microbial mediated nitrogen n cycle in urban rivers and caused bioavailable n to accumulate in sediments while remedial actions sometimes fail to recover degraded river ecosystems even when environmental quality has been improved it is not sufficient to revert the ecosystem to its original healthy state by restoring the pre degradation environmental conditions as explained by alternative stable states theory understanding the recovery of disrupted n cycle pathways from the perspective of alternative stable states theory can benefit effective river remediation previous studies have found alternative microbiota states in rivers however the existence and implications of alternative stable states in microbial mediated n cycle pathway remain unclear here high throughput sequencing and n related enzyme activities measurement were combined in the field investigation to provide empirical evidence for the bi stability in microbially mediated n cycle pathways according to the behavior of bistable ecosystems the existence of alternative stable states in microbial mediated n cycle pathway have been shown and nutrient loading mainly total nitrogen and total phosphorus were identified as key driver of regime shifts in addition potential analysis revealed that reducing nutrient loading shifted the n cycle pathway to a desirable state characterized by high ammonification and nitrification probably avoiding the accumulation of ammonia and organic n it should be noted that the improvement of microbiota status can facilitate the recovery of the desirable pathway state according to the relationship between microbiota states and n cycle pathway states keystone species including rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were discerned by network analysis and the increase in their relative abundance may facilitate the improvement of microbiota status the obtained results suggested that the nutrient reduction should be combined with microbiota management to benefit the bioavailable n removal in urban rivers therefore providing a new insight into alleviating adverse effects of the nutrient loading on urban rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords alternative stable states theory microbial mediated nitrogen cycle sediment nutrients effective river restoration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the management of urban rivers has long received public attention because they provide various ecosystem services but are vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance best 2018 with the rapid urbanization large amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorous p has been discharged into urban rivers leading to the degradation of river ecosystems bush et al 2017 diamond et al 2021 it has been investigated that river ecosystems have multi stability under similar conditions diamond et al 2021 shang et al 2021 tauro 2021 suggesting that the degradation of urban rivers is likely to be a catastrophic shift accompanied by the abrupt and radical loss of ecosystem structure and functioning scheffer et al 2001 various remediation measures have been implemented to restore structure and functioning of urban river ecosystems while these measures sometimes failed to make achievements even though water quality has been improved liu et al 2020a 2020b which could be attributed to the existence of alternative stable states in river ecosystems under similar environmental conditions scheffer et al 2001 classical examples of this phenomenon come from shallow lakes which exhibit either a clear water state or a turbid water state under similar nutrient loading reducing nutrient loading to the pre degradation level is insufficient to revert lakes from a turbid water state to a clear water state due to hysteresis dakos et al 2019 scheffer et al 2001 therefore understanding alternative stable states and the state recovery trajectory in river ecosystems is crucial for urban river management agencies to implement effective remediation strategies most nutrients in urban rivers are deposited in sediments which are inhabited by abundant and diverse microorganisms that play an essential role in influencing the functioning of river ecosystems such as biogeochemical cycling and energy flow yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b changes in nutrient loading in sediment can alter other environmental factors and thus reshape benthic microbial communities xuan et al 2022 reducing nutrient loading has been shown to improve the anoxic conditions in overlying water thereby increasing the abundance of aerobic microbes and undermining the dominance of anaerobic microbes bush et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in addition it has been found that microbial communities changed markedly when nutrient loading was reduced to a critical threshold liu et al 2020a attractively a recent study has demonstrated that benthic microbes were bistable and the improvement in sediment quality drove the regime shift in microbial communities accompanied by an increase in biodiversity shang et al 2021 therefore a reduction in the nutrient loading an important evaluation index of sediment quality may also lead to the regime shift in benthic microbial communities however whether the reduction of nutrient loading drives the regime shift in benthic microbiota status and the impact of such shift on the ecosystem functioning remain open questions the n cycle is significant in maintaining the biogeochemical balance of urban rivers excessive nutrient inputs have affected n cycle pathways and caused the accumulation of bioavailable n e g ammonium and organic n in river sediments leading to hypoxia black odorous rivers and other environmental problems aalto et al 2018 wu et al 2019 considering n cycle in urban rivers are mainly mediated by microorganisms regime shifts in benthic microbes driven by reduced nutrient loading probably alter n cycle pathways therefore avoiding the accumulation of bioavailable n previous studies have found that reducing nutrient loading will benefit microbial nitrification and ammonification by increasing the oxygen content of the overlying water sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 consequently facilitating the removal of ammonium liu et al 2022 however it remains unclear whether the regime shift in the benthic microbial community signifies an alteration in the n cycling pathway and whether such an alternation avoids the accumulation of bioavailable n over the past decades many studies have been conducted to investigate regime shift and alternative stable states in ecosystems berdugo et al 2017 diamond et al 2021 gonze et al 2017 lahti et al 2014 rindi et al 2017 as described by the alternative stable states theory ecosystems with more than one attraction basin will suddenly shift into a contrasting state in response to the changes in environmental stress and shifts between attractors have obvious hysteresis traits scheffer et al 2001 scheffer and carpenter 2003 accordingly variables reflecting ecosystem state will exhibit multimodality of frequency distributions demonstrating the existence of multiple attractors namely multiple stable states scheffer and carpenter 2003 by visualizing attraction basins and constructing stability landscapes potential analysis has been commonly used to identify alternative stable states in many ecosystems such as forest hirota et al 2011 dry land chen et al 2020 and marine rindi et al 2017 improving the understanding of alternative stable states in various macro ecosystems nevertheless to our knowledge no study has adopted this approach in micro ecosystems considering that the state of micro ecosystems cannot be directly described by tree cover as in the case of forest ecosystems there remains a fundamental challenge in applying potential analysis in investigating alternative stable states in microbially mediated n cycle pathways therefore the study selected a highly urbanized river network as study area and aims to answer the following questions i do multi modality or even multi stability exist in riverine microbial community and n cycle pathways if so ii what are key nutrients and how these nutrients drive regime shifts in benthic microbial community and n cycle pathways in a highly urbanized river network iii what are relationships between alternative microbiota states and alternative n cycle pathway state also iv what implications for urban river management can be drawn from this relationship our findings empirically illustrated the multi stability in microbial communities and n cycle pathways and visually displayed state recovery trajectories in an urban river ecosystem thus providing a meaningful insight into implementing effective restoration strategies and alleviating adverse effects of the nutrient loading on n cycle pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing this study was conducted in the river network in the northern and southern plains of the mulan river with a total area of 425 km2 which is a region with an intensive river network a dense population and a high degree of urbanization in putian china 59 sampling sites were set up alone the river network fig 1 fig s1 and the sampling occurred in january 2022 in each sampling site water depth was about 3 m channel width varied from 3 to 8 m some samples were failed to collected due to the dredging therefore a total of 45 sediment samples was collected fig s1 data s1 at each sampling site surface sediment sample top 0 10 cm was collected in triplicate using a grab sampler xdb0201 changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china samples were mixed for homogenization sealed in plastic bags and then immediately shipped to the laboratory each sample was separated into two parts one was stored at 4 c for environmental parameters and enzyme activities measurements and the other was stored at 80 c for microbial dna extraction the conventional physicochemical parameters in water including temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity and oxidation reduction potential were measured in situ by the hach hq30d portable meter hach co loveland co usa sediment samples for environmental parameters analysis were first sieved through a 150 μm sieve the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and nitrite nitrogen no 2 n in sediments were determined using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa as described by zhang et al 2019c the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total organic carbon toc were measured using the standard methods as described by wu et al 2019 the total organic nitrogen ton concentration was calculated as tn concentration minus the total inorganic nitrogen concentration tin including nh 4 n no 3 n and no 2 n 2 2 dna extraction and processing microbial dna was extracted from 0 3 g sediment samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to manufacturer s instructions dna integrity in samples was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis and then the dna was stored at 20 c until amplification and sequencing conducted at shanghai biozeron co ltd shanghai china the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified 95 c for 2 min followed by 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min using primer pairs 341f and 806r amplicons were extracted from 2 agarose gels and purified using the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca u s purified pcr products were quantified by qubit 3 0 life invitrogen and then were paired end sequencing on an illumina platform the raw dna sequencing data are available at the ncbi sra under project accession prjna85092 raw fastq files were demultiplexed using in house perl scripts according to three criteria as described by zhang et al 2019c reads which could not be assembled were discarded the remaining sequences were dereplicated and subjected to the dada2 algorithm qiime 2 recommended to identify indel mutations and substitutions callahan et al 2016 paired reads were trimmed and filtered with a maximum of two expected errors per read the phylogenetic affiliation of each 16s rrna gene sequence namely amplicon sequence variants asvs was analyzed by rdp classifier performed in http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu132 16s rrna database with a confidence threshold of 70 after merging paired reads and chimera filtering amato et al 2013 2 3 assessment of functionality of n cycle pathways enzyme activities were used to assess n cycle pathways because enzyme exhibits the functions encoded in genes and reflects the role of microbiota in n cycling li et al 2020 ammonification nitrification and denitrification are three microbial n cycle pathways involved in tn removal from sediments therefore chitinase chi hydroxylamine oxidase hao and nitrite reductase nir were measured to describe potential ammonification nitrification and denitrification respectively kuypers et al 2018 these three enzyme activities were measured at sci go www sci go com using elisa kit nanjing molfarming biotechnology co ltd and molecular devices spectramax 190 was applied to determine the absorbance 585 nm for chi 45 nm for hao 450 nm for nir li et al 2020 each individual enzyme activity was normalized using the formula f x x i x min x max x min where x i x min and x max are the true minimum and maximum values of variable i that observed in the study area respectively schuldt et al 2018 the values for each normalized enzyme activity were then averaged to obtain a composite index m describing the n cycle pathways berdugo et al 2017 the correlation between the normalized enzyme activity and nutrient loading was visualized using ggpmisc package in r v4 1 3 https www r project org and the smoothing method used in the stat smooth function is lm 2 4 nutrient pollution degree assessments the comprehensive pollution index approach was used to assess the nutrient pollution degree in river sediments 1 s j c j c s 2 f f f 2 f max 2 2 where s j is the single evaluation index of variable j j tn and tp cj is the observed value of variable j and cs is assessment criteria value of variable j cs of tn is 550 mg kg 1 and cs of tp is 600 mg kg 1 according to leivuori and niemistoe 1995 ff is the comprehensive pollution index f and f max are the average and maximum values of s s t n and s stp respectively 2 5 statistical analyses 16s rrna gene sequences of all samples were rarified to keep 21 688 sequences per sample jensen shannon divergence between samples was achieved using philentropy package in r v4 2 2 partitioning around the medoid pam clustering algorithm on jensen shannon divergence at genus levels were applied to cluster samples into different groups and was achieved using cluster package silhouette index was used to determine the optimal number of clusters as described by gao et al 2021 subsequently the principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed using vegan package v2 6 2 to visually show differences between microbial community types analysis of similarities anosim was achieved using anosim function in the vegan package to evaluate whether the group differences in are significant the α diversity indices including shannon chao1 richness inverse simpson ace and pielou were calculated using the biozeron cloud platform http www cloud biomicroclass com cloudplatform the correlation between microbial communities and environmental factors was calculated and visualized by redundancy analysis rda since the length of axis 1 of detrended correspondence analysis was less than 3 0 in this online platform microbial networks were constructed to illustrate differences between different microbial community structures using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline menap according to the instructions zhou et al 2011 genera with occurrence in at least 25 of sediment samples were selected for obtaining similarity matrix based on the pearson s correlation gephi http gephi github io was used to visualize microbial networks and obtain network modularity values of within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi were acquired from the menap to find key taxa according to a previous report olesen et al 2007 specifically genera with zi 2 5 or pi 0 62 will be identified as key taxa structure of function relationships was assessed to describe characterization of two contrasting functionality states the value of each individual n transformation process was the normalized enzyme activity accordingly pearson s correlations were calculated between each individual n transformation process and also between each individual n transformation process and the m index all related information were put into gephi to visualize the structure of function relationships the bimodal distribution and probability density function pdf of state variables were obtained using mclust package v6 0 0 bayesian information criterion bic was used to determine whether the frequency distribution was unimodal or bimodal briefly bi or multimode should have a lower bic compared to one mode berdugo et al 2017 the bimodality coefficient and frequency minima were get using potential analysis function in the microbiome package the potential of the ecosystem was calculated from pdf of the state variables using the formula u σ 2 2 log p d f where u and σ are estimated potential and noise level respectively u u σ 2 was used as the scaled potential because only a qualitative estimation of the potential is required hirota et al 2011 in stability landscapes derived from pdf black balls show stable states and the white ball shows unstable state marking border between bistable states stability landscapes reflecting multiple stable states under a specific range of an environmental stress herein nutrient pollution degree were constructed using the movpotential ews function in the earlywarnings package in r v4 2 2 hirota et al 2011 scheffer et al 2012 and the relevant parameters are used by default the visualization of stability landscapes was realized in origin 2018 using contour color fill the minima and maxima of the potential at a given nutrient pollution degree correspond to the stable and unstable states respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 bimodality of benthic microbial community using the pam approach and silhouette index samples were automatically clustered into two different groups and differences in these groups were visualized in the pcoa plot fig 2 a the result showed these two microbial communities separated basically along the pcoa axis 1 and anosim indicated that these two microbial communities have significant differences fig s2 thus the pcoa1 coordinates were regarded as an indicators of microbiota states to better examine these two microbial community types the frequency distribution analysis demonstrated the bimodal distribution of microbial communities further demonstrating the existence of two different microbiota types fig 2b bimodal distribution of microbial communities could be explained by three possible factors fig 2f h one is the artifacts due to the unbalanced sampling events lahti et al 2014 one is the nonlinear response with critical threshold of microbial community to environmental conditions van de guchte et al 2021 and the another is the bistable or hysteretic response of microbial community to similar environmental conditions scheffer and carpenter 2003 to test these possibilities the distribution of microbiota states in subgroups with similar nutrient loading was analyzed the result showed these two microbiota types co existed in most subgroups fig 2d which invalidated the second possibilities in addition the distribution of microbial communities displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality along the gradient of nutrient loading table s1 which was in line with the expectation of alternative stable states theory scheffer and carpenter 2003 and also invalidated the first possibilities consequently these examinations invalidated the first two possibilities fig 2f and g importantly a stability landscape describing the number and value of alternative microbiota states was constructed by potential analysis fig 2c the result illustrated that there were two basins of attraction and were separated by an unstable equilibrium indirectly supporting the last possibility however further studies are needed to investigating temporal trend in microbial community structure to provide direct evidence on the alternative microbiota states thereby benefiting the understanding of river ecosystems in urban areas to better clarify the characteristics of these two microbiota states in this study the one with low values of pcoa1 was referred to as the microbiota state a and the other with high values of pcoa1 was referred to as the microbiota state b co occurrence networks of microbiota state a network a and b network b were constructed to understand structural differences between these two microbiota states fig 2e in these networks only regionally abundant genera that were present in 25 of sediment samples in study area were selected specifically compared to the network b the ratio of nodes to edges in the network a was relatively low indicating a smaller number of co occurrences in network a in addition network a was characterized by small network size low average degree low average clustering coefficient and small number of keystone species while the network b was characterized by the opposite properties table s2 fig s5 illustrating the relatively high complexity of the network b yuan et al 2021 3 2 bimodality of n cycle pathways n cycle pathways here refers to the multiple n transformation processes regarding ammonification nitrification and denitrification which were assessed by analyzing chi hao and nir three n transformation processes responded differently to nutrient loading fig 3 e at the nutrient loading range of 0 1 most samples exhibited high ability of ammonification and nitrification but low ability of denitrification at the nutrient loading range of 2 3 most samples exhibited low ability of ammonification and nitrification but high ability of denitrification at the nutrient loading range of 1 2 there were large uncertainties in the strengths of three processes according to the linear fitting ammonification and nitrification decreased with increasing nutrients while denitrification increased with increasing nutrients fig 3e which were consistent with observations reported in the previous studies li et al 2020 wu et al 2019 to better understand n cycle pathways in the study area the m index describing the total functionality of n cycle pathways was used the frequency distribution of m index exhibited two modes namely low m index of 0 33 and high m index of 0 59 with the frequency minima at 0 48 fig 3a to better distinguish between these two functionality states the one with low m index was referred to as the pathway state a and the other with high m index was referred to as the pathway state b it should be noted that chi hao and nir were used to assess n cycle pathways in this study because ammonification nitrification and denitrification are of great importance in tn removal from urban rivers considering n cycle involves many other n transformation processes such as n fixation and anammox further efforts comprehensively evaluating the total functionality of n cycle pathways is encouraged to find the most probable explanation for the bimodal distribution of m index i e artifacts critical threshold response or bistable response analyses similar to those in section 3 1 were performed the result showed these two functionality states co existed in most subgroups fig 3c in addition along the gradient of nutrient loading the distribution of m index displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality table s3 furthermore a stability landscape depicting the number and value of estimated alternative n cycle pathway states was constructed fig 3b indirectly confirming bistability is the most possible explanation for the bimodal distribution of m index fig 2h the correlations between pairs of n transformation processes were calculated to understand different characteristics of two functionality states and functional networks were used to visualize these correlations fig 3c in sites of pathway sate b all of three n transformation processes were strong and these three processes maintained the functionality together in sites of pathway state a ammonification and nitrification were weak and denitrification was decoupled in maintaining the total functionality of n cycle pathways fig 3d 3 3 identification of key nutrients to disentangle relationships between nutrient loading and ecosystem states the rda were performed to find factors causing differences in microbial community structures fig s3a toc p 0 001 tn p 0 001 nh 4 p 0 001 and tp p 0 05 were recognized as significant factors affecting microbial communities to further test which nutrients were drivers of two microbiota states samples were divided into subgroups based on the gradient of each environmental factor to examine the multimodality of microbial communities in each subgroup table s4 s7 the results showed that the distribution of microbial communities displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality only along the gradient of tn and tp which was in line with the behavior of an ecosystem with bistable states scheffer et al 2001 scheffer and carpenter 2003 in addition microbiota state a and b separated along the axis of tn or tp as showed in the rda plot fig s3b therefore tn and tp were identified as main nutrient pollutants driving shifts between these two microbiota states a closer examination into the rda plot fig s3b revealed that angles between many communities in the microbiota state a and tn and tp concentrations were acute demonstrating the positive relationships on opposite angles between most communities in the microbiota state b and tn and tp concentrations were obtuse demonstrating the negative relationships to better illustrate the effects of identified drivers on the riverine benthic ecosystems the comprehensive pollution index ff considering both tn and tp concentrations was adopted the frequency distribution of microbial community also displayed a pattern of unimodality multimodality unimodality along the gradient of ff table s1 demonstrating the reliability of this pollution index notably the frequency distribution of m index also displayed a similar pattern along the gradient of ff table s3 therefore tn and tp are identified as key nutrients driving regime shifts in both microbial communities and n cycle pathways 3 4 trajectories of ecosystem responses to nutrient loading to infer the stable and unstable states in driver spaces stability landscapes reflecting ecosystem responses to changes in nutrient pollution were built the results showed ecosystem states stabilize to two local minima displaying hysteresis traits in response to the increase and decrease in ff fig 4 for microbial community the bistable region was at the ff range of 1 2 1 6 which means microbiota state can be either a or b at that range of nutrient loading microbial community stayed at the microbiota state a when the ff was above 1 6 and reducing the ff to below 1 6 was thought to be insufficient to shift the microbiota state from a to b unless the ff was largely reduced e g ff 1 2 for n cycle pathways when ff was above 1 3 the n cycle pathways will stay at pathway state a in which concentrations of bioavailable nh 4 and on were high reducing the ff to below 1 3 may be insufficient to recover the desirable functionality state given that functionality state can be either pathway state a or b at the ff range of 0 4 1 3 notably in sites of pathway state a denitrification was dominant while ammonification and nitrification were limited probably leading to the accumulation of nh 4 and on the analysis of n content in different pathway states under similar range of nutrient loading 0 4 ff 1 3 revealed high concentrations of nh 4 and ton in sites of the pathway state a fig s4 given that similar nutrient loading in sites of these two functionality states the accumulation of nh 4 and on suggested low n self removal capacity in sites of the pathway state a probably threating ecological health of the river ecosystem the high concentration of nh 4 in rivers has gained great scientific concerns because it has high toxic effect to aquatic life and signifies the degradation in river ecosystems wang et al 2020 ton especially dissolved organic nitrogen don can be utilized by microbes and form microbe derived don mdon such as amino acids protein and their derivates lin et al 2021 the mdon is an active precursor of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts and can readily induce harmful algal blooms due to its high bioavailability lin et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a the comparison of chlorophyll a concentration between two pathway states further demonstrated the adverse effects of on on river ecosystems fig s4 ultimately the accumulation of nh 4 and ton in sediments is likely to pose great ecologic risks to river ecosystems in addition when ff is above 1 6 both microbial communities and n cycle pathways stabilize to an undesirable state at that range the complexity of microbial community was relatively low table s2 suggesting microbial community may be vulnerable to the change in environmental conditions yuan et al 2021 in addition bioavailable nh 4 and on were accumulated in sediments due to weak strengths of ammonification and nitrification probably causing high ecological risks consistent with previous studies cheng et al 2021 leivuori and niemistoe 1995 ye et al 2019 yu et al 2017 ff 1 5 is characterized as moderately or heavily polluted that is likely to threaten the health of aquatic ecosystems it should be noted that ff 1 3 may also have caused n cycle pathways to remain at an undesirable state although this nutrient loading range is characterized as slightly polluted or clean the occurrence of this phenomenon could be partly attributed to the existence of functional redundancy allison and martiny 2008 under such conditions a longer hysteresis response of n cycle pathways to nutrient loading will be caused making the microbiota state shift from a to b while functionality remained at an undesirable state 3 5 relationship between microbiota states and n cycle pathway states microbial communities and n cycle pathways responded similarly to nutrient loading fig 4 suggesting closed relationship between them to detangle to what extent n cycle pathways were related to microbiota states the taxonomic differences between the two microbiota states were examined at the phylum level abundant microorganisms in microbiota state a and b were similar and the difference was that microbiota state a had abundant fusobacteria fig s5a fusobacteria is the anaerobic bacteria sun et al 2019 suggesting high nutrient loading in the sites of microbiota state a site a has created anaerobic environments at the order level fig s5b clostridales and bacteroidales two major microbial indicators of black odorous rivers hu et al 2017 were abundant at site a further suggesting its anaerobic conditions notably site a harbored abundant pseudomonadales and rhodocyclales that involved in denitrification which could be partly attributed the anaerobic environments in site a hesselsoe et al 2009 wei et al 2019 compared to site a sites of microbiota state b site b harbored more diverse n transformation bacteria such as chitinophagales involved in ammonification worner and pester 2019 sphingomomadales involved in nitrification and denitrification zhang et al 2019c under such conditions site b should have relatively high m index compared to site a given that high m index means the ability to participate multiple n transformation processes keystone species were identified by constructing co occurrence networks to further detangle the relationship between microbial communities and n cycle pathways fig s5 rhizobiales involved in denitrification was identified as a keystone in both network a and b sphingomonadales involved in nitrification and denitrification was identified as a keystone in network b in addition relative abundances of rhizobiales and sphingomonadales in site a were significantly lower than in site b fig s6 together these results demonstrated that potential for n transformation was relatively lower in microbiota state a than in microbiota state b this was consistent with the result shown in fig 4 that sites with low m index were dominated by the microbiota state a when ff 1 6 a map depicting their probability density distribution further illustrated the relationship between microbial community and n cycle pathways fig 5 most samples in site a had the low m index while most samples in site b had the high m index importantly if nutrient loading was more than 1 0 the functionality state of site a will be limited to the pathway state a and reverting to the desirable functionality state was observably difficult of particular concern was that most sites of pathway state b high m index were belong to site b 76 implying the significance of microbiota state b in maintaining high m index these results indicated that shifting microbial community from state a to state b is an indispensable way to improve m index in addition bacterial α diversity was positively correlated with the m index in site a fig s7 implying that increasing biodiversity may benefit the improvement of m index in site a 3 6 implications for urban river management catastrophic shifts are increasingly observed in ecosystems such as shallow lakes scheffer et al 1993 forests hirota et al 2011 and coral reefs mccook 1999 recently river ecosystems have also been thought to have multi stability and probably experience catastrophic shifts diamond et al 2021 shang et al 2021 tauro 2021 although the prominent importance of n cycle in river ecosystem investigations of n cycle pathways from the perspective of multi stability have been scare this study provided a deep understanding of how functionality of n cycle pathways responds to nutrient loading by assessing the existence and influencing factors of alternative n cycle pathway states the obtained results contribute to the search for possible ways to improve n self removal capacity and mitigate adverse effects of high nutrient loading in urban rivers with the increase of nutrient inputs into urban rivers various eco environmental problems have arisen due to biogeochemical imbalance especially n imbalance the study visually demonstrated the hysteretic response of the total functionality of n cycle pathways to the increasing nutrient loading the results implied that when the sediment was slightly or non contaminated i e ff 1 3 n cycle pathways were likely to be at a desirable state the pathway state b characterized by strong ammonification nitrification and denitrification however as sediments are moderately or seriously polluted i e ff 1 3 the ecosystem could suddenly shift to the alternatively undesirable state leading to the accumulation of nh 4 and on in addition reducing the nutrient loading to the original level i e ff 1 3 may be insufficient to revert the desirable state unless the nutrient loading was largely reduced or microbiota state was improved it should be noted that regime shifts may begin in the area of the ecosystem closest to the threshold of nutrient loading and gradually spread around as predicted by ecological theory eklof et al 2020 therefore sites closest to the threshold of regime shifts ff 1 3 for n cycle pathway deserve more attention to prevent the occurrence of the undesirable pathway state pathway state b with high m index in urban rivers was found to benefit the reduction of bioavailable n compound and the improvement of n self removal capacity nutrient driven alternative n cycle pathway states and alternative microbiota states were found to be closely related thus providing some insights into avoiding the accumulation of bioavailable n in urban rivers fig 6 according to the obtained results the reduction of nutrient loading to the slightly polluted level i e ff 1 3 is necessary and indispensable because the pathway state b only exist below this threshold further reducing nutrient loading to the safe level i e ff 0 9 will largely ensure that the pathway state b did not shift to the pathway state a recover trajectory 2 however this way may be time consuming costly and sometimes inefficient because nutrients are hard to be removed from sediments and imbalance in n p ratio also cause undesirable changes in river ecosystems ibanez and penuelas 2019 tong et al 2020 the alternative way recover trajectory 1 is to keep microbial community in the microbiota state b which can be realized by strengthening the resilience of this state ling et al 2015 shang et al 2021 it has been identified that rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were keystone species of these two microbiota states and that both taxa were more abundant in microbiota state b than in microbiota state a therefore the increase in the dominance of rhizobiales and sphingomonadales may strengthen the resilience of microbiota state b given that abundant anaerobic bacteria are enriched at site a weakening the resilience of the microbiota state a by increasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in site a may also facilitate the shift from the microbiota state a to b 4 conclusion in summary this study provided the first field based evidence for the existence of alternative n cycle pathway states and impacts of regime shift in microbial communities on n cycle in urban rivers improving the capacity to anticipate catastrophic shifts in river ecosystems tn and tp were identified as main drivers of alternative stable states in benthic microbes and n cycle pathways and these two nutrients were combined to obtain a composite index ff to describe nutrient loading reducing nutrient loading was found to shift the n cycle pathway to a desirable state namely the pathway state b characterized by high ammonification nitrification and denitrification the maintenance of the pathway state b in urban rivers could probably avoid the accumulation of bioavailable nh 4 and on it should be noted that microbial communities play an important role in influencing n cycle pathways results indicated that the pathway state b can be maintained almost when the microbial community was in the microbiota state b characterized by high complexity keystone species including rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were thought to play a vital role in maintaining the resilience of the microbiota state b and thus may facilitate the shift of the n cycle pathway to the pathway state b the obtained results will help fill in the knowledge gaps related to the bistable response of the total functionality of n cycle pathways to the gradient of nutrient loading and provide new insights into the improvement of bioavailable n removal capacity in rivers of urban areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
