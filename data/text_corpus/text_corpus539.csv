are two indexes that significantly affect the hydraulic and transport properties e g permeability and diffusivity which are studied in various fields such as geotechnical engineering duda et al 2011 li et al 2018 natural gas hydrate explorations zhao and zhou 2020 chen et al 2018 and petroleum chemical industry field gostovic et al 2007 kuruneru et al 2017 therefore it is of great importance to understand the pore scale tortuosity and porosity and their correlations with permeability and diffusions of geomaterials to date various approaches are applied to understand the tortuosity and to evaluate the hydraulic and transport properties which can be simply classified into experimental methods analytical methods and numerical methods for example coleman and vassilicos 2008 and morin et al 2010 conducted the field experiments to evaluate the tortuosity based on the measured electrical conductivity gao et al 2014 and corrochano et al 2015 investigated the tortuosity based on fluid diffusion experiments however although the experiments can provide a direct measurement of tortuosity they cannot accurately characterize the relations of microstructures e g void space distribution and pore connectivity to the tortuosity in analytical methods ahmadi et al 2011 established the analytical relations to calculate the tortuosity and permeability based on the average volume approach and modified representative elementary volume rev model laudone et al 2015 developed an analytical approach to estimate the tortuosity based on the simulated void network which is validated to be reliable by comparing the estimated values with experimental results ebrahimi khabbazi et al 2015 proposed the analytical tortuosity porosity correlations for fractal geometries of sierpinski carpet based on a novel mathematical approach however such methods are inevitably limited to the regular geometries and two dimensional 2d planes of geomaterials for numerical methods lanfrey et al 2010 established the tortuosity equations based on the theoretical model for the fixed bed which is randomly packed with identical particles without any empirical constants sun et al 2013 calculated the effective diffusion coefficient and the tortuosity of a 2d representative elementary volume rev of circular particles using the homogenization method and a numerical tool wu et al 2018 developed a mathematical 3d tortuosity model of regular tetrahedron microstructure to quantify tortuosity and corresponding rev of porous granular media xu et al 2018 accurately determined the nonlinear thermal conductivity and tortuosity of porous composites based on the continuum percolation theory and discussed the variations of thermal conductivity and tortuosity in three dimensional 3d pores with geometrical morphologies from the isotropic sphere to anisotropic polyhedra unfortunately although the numerical methods offer excellent models to relate tortuosity to the porous geometries and are extended to three dimensional geometries their applications are still limited to the known regular geometries of porous media totally although various experimental analytical and numerical methods are conducted to successfully evaluate the tortuosity and hydraulic and transport properties the methods to estimate the tortuosity in microstructures with realistic irregular pores for porous geomaterials are still rarely reported in addition the corresponding hydraulic and transport properties related to tortuosity and the pore scale tortuosity and porosity effects on microscopic permeability and pore diffusivity are not still well understood recently x ray ct imaging techniques are widely applied to study the characteristics and evolution process of cracks sarfarazi et al 2018 yavari et al 2021 fu et al 2021 and to evaluate the hydraulic and transport properties due to its abilities of non destruction testing real time monitoring and the 3d visualization of realistic microstructures with irregular pores and grains for instance sarfarazi et al 2022 studied the cracking process and interaction between the internal hole and two neighbor joints under the uniaxial compression by experiments and numerical simulations kumari et al 2018 investigated the effect of reservoir depth temperature and sample heterogeneity during hydraulic fracturing and analyzed the influence of rock microstructure on fracture propagation using x ray ct imaging zhang et al 2018 studied the pore characteristics and established the nonlinear relation to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity based on x ray ct images zhao and zhou 2018 reconstructed the 3d pore models of sandstone and calculated the pore size distribution and permeability based on the reconstructed 3d models from 2d ct images shanti et al 2014 measured the connectivity and tortuosity based on 3d x ray ct datasets using path length ratio and gas phase flux approaches zhao et al 2022 studied the pore connectivity and water saturation effects on the permeability of deep gas shale pawlowski et al 2018 reconstructed the monolithic alumina columns and computed the tortuosity based on x ray ct images and dijkstra s shortest path algorithm li et al 2018 studied the effects of microscopic fractures on the permeability of carbonate rocks by digital analysis rock cores liu et al 2022a b proposed a machine learning method to predict the gas permeability of gaomiaozi bentonite by digital image analysis in addition the pore network models show its superiority in determining the hydraulic properties koponen et al 1996 sadeghnejad et al 2021 mckague et al 2022 van der heijden et al 2022 xia et al 2019 proposed a fractal dimension model with lacunarity and succolarity analysis to predict the permeability of reservoir rocks by x ray ct imaging khan et al 2019 proposed a snow dual algorithm to simultaneously extract the void and solid microstructure models to compute the effective transport properties which are validated by the experimental and numerical results moslemipour and sadeghnejad 2021 proposed a multi scale pore network model to evaluate the petrophyscial and hydraulic properties of carbonates which are validated by the experimental results qin et al 2022 studied the effects of pore morphology on permeability by euler number and shape factor thorough the digital rock modeling the previous works have validated the excellent performances of x ray ct imaging to evaluate the cracking behaviors hydraulic and transport properties however few works focused on the pore scale variations of tortuosity by x ray ct imaging and its effects on permeability and pore diffusivity for porous geomaterials with realistic pore networks therefore in view of these mentioned problems above the present study mainly aims to develop digital microscopic analysis framework according to x μct imaging techniques in which the pore scale tortuosity of porous geomaterials can be directly obtained with less efforts a labeling segmentation algorithm is proposed to accurately extract the irregular pore geometries and topologies a multi types pore structure analysis with levenberg marquardt algorithm is conducted to link the tortuosity to pore scale variables and to study its relation to pore scale permeability and pore diffusivity in the digital microscopic analysis framework compared with the previous works the main advantages of the proposed approach are that 1 a digital microscopic analysis framework with the proposed labelling segmentation algorithm is established to accurately compute the pore scale tortuosity 2 the effective relations of pore seepage factor and pore diffusion factor characterizing the pore geometry and pore connectivity are established to evaluate hydraulic and transport properties and its pore scale effects are studied and 3 the geometric effects of irregular pores on pore scale tortuosity permeability and diffusivity are studied this rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the characteristics of sandstone samples the methods to extract irregular microstructures and definitions of pore scale variables section 3 elucidates the derivations of multi types pore structure analysis by pore scale variables section 4 provides the main results and discussions of the pore scale tortuosity and its effects on pore diffusivity and permeability which is followed by the simple summaries and conclusions in section 5 2 samples and methods 2 1 sample descriptions in this work 9 types of sandstones are artificially selected and collected based on the observation of the grain diameter in sandstone samples to evaluate the pore scale tortuosity and its relations to pore scale variables e g porosity these sandstones are classified into 3 types of samples with fine pores 3 types of samples with median pores and 3 types of samples with coarse pores with different x μct imaging resolutions totally 300 x μct images fig 1 for each sample are prepared with a size of 300 300 pixels to evaluate the pore scale tortuosity and its effects on permeability and pore diffusivity of porous geomaterials in addition the porosity and permeability are measured by the ap608 automated permeameter porosimete and tortuosity and diffusion coefficient are measured by the poremaster 33 mercury injection apparatus and the macromr12 150h i nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus based on the fluid flow method wang et al 2005 in which the testing procedures can be referred to their detailed values are respectively listed in table 1 for samples s1 s9 2 2 microstructure extraction and analysis the tortuosity and porosity are two primary variables which significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the predicted hydraulic and transport properties by pores and grains in microstructures of porous geomaterials although the classical segmentation algorithms such as the otsu segmentation algorithm otsu 1979 can segment the pores and grains they cannot offer detailed information of different sub pores and sub grains moreover overestimation and underestimation may occur due to complex pore networks with the corresponding pore grain size distribution zhao and zhou 2021 therefore a novel labeling segmentation algorithm is proposed to obtain the porosity and microstructure sizes of porous geomaterials without overestimation and underestimation the labeling segmentation algorithm is divided into 3 steps and described in detail as follows step 1 the computation of the gray level distribution generally gray level value of x μct images always varies from 0 black to 255 white first these images are simply filtered by the median filter in the matlab software as shown in fig 1 s t then the distribution of gray level not only reflects the absorptivity of object to x ray energy but also contains the microstructure information which can be computed by 1 h f 1 n 1 n f x y g u d x d y g u 0 255 where h f denotes the distribution of gray intensity f x y g u represents the unique gray level and n is the dimension of x μct image step 2 the computation of pore segmentation threshold s t once the gray level distribution of x μct images is obtained a pore segmentation threshold s t is utilized to divide the gray level distribution into two groups h f 1 0 s t and h f 2 s t 255 and their variances are respectively expressed as 2 χ 1 0 s t i 1 i h f 1 0 s t h f 1 0 s t i i 1 i h f 1 0 s t h f 1 0 s t i i h f 1 0 s t 2 i h f 1 0 s t 1 3 χ 2 s t 255 i 1 i h f 1 s t 255 h f 1 s t 255 i i 1 i h f 1 s t 255 h f 1 s t 255 i i h f 1 s t 255 2 i h f 1 s t 255 1 where χ and i denote the variance and counter of the unique gray level respectively thus the pore segmentation threshold s t can be finally determined by the maximum of the absolute difference between this two variances by 4 s t max χ 2 s t 255 χ 1 0 s t where max is the searching function of the maximum since the maximum of absolute difference between these two variances is used to determine the threshold the segmentation results would be better for the grayscale image with bi modal distribution step 3 the labeling of different size of pores and grains once the pore segmentation threshold s t is computed by eq 4 the x μct image can be segmented into the sub matrixes of pores and sub matrixes of grains with different sizes thus the microstructures in the x μct images of geomaterials can be represented by different labeling values with different colors fig 1 which can be expressed with the labeling value from top to bottom and left to right in turn by 5 i b i p i g k 1 p n m p k x y k 1 g n m g k x y i g k 1 g n m g k x y ω f x y s t i p k 1 p n m p k x y ω f x y s t where i b i p and i g are respectively the microstructure matrix pore matrix and grain matrix m p x y and m g x y are respectively the sub matrixes for pores and grains and pn and g n are respectively the number of sup pore and sub grain with the corresponding labeling value k for the k th sub pore or sub grain 2 3 extraction of pore scale variables pore scale variables e g porosity and pore size play paramount roles in estimating the hydraulic and transport properties in porous geomaterials to understand these properties porosity pore and grain sizes and tortuosity are defined in the digital microscopic analysis framework porosity is considered as the occupation percentage of void space in the total volume of porous geomaterials which is written as 6 φ i p i p i g k 1 p n m p k x y f x y to obtain accurate pore size and grain size irregular pores grains are equivalent to the circles the radii of each pore and gain represented by sub matrixes can be computed by 7 r p or g p r m p k g k x y π where r p or g is the pore or gain radii and p r is the resolution of x μct images once the pore size and grain size are obtained the specific surface can be simply modified based on its ratio of pore surface area to volume as tiab and donaldson 2011 8 s s a v m p k x y z 1 n m p k z x y 3 r p where s s a v and r p are respectively the specific surface surface area volume and radius for each pore generally the bundle of tubes model with kozeny caman equation is applied to evaluate the permeability and diffusivity in which the gains or pores are considered to be spheres vervoort and cattle 2003 grathwohl 1998 zhao and zhou 2020 thus with the defined pore scale variables the permeability and diffusivity related to the tortuosity based on carman equation can be respectively estimated by 9 k r p φ 3 9 τ 1 φ 2 10 d cd φ d m τ where τ k d cd and d m represent the tortuosity permeability convection diffusion coefficient in porous geomaterials and constant diffusivity for standard flow media by sulfate or methane respectively generally tortuosity is one of the most important variables to study the flow and transport characteristics in geomaterials which is significantly affected by the geometric shape of irregular pores and its definition differs in various fields bullitt et al 2003 ghanbarian et al 2013 in this study the tortuosity is considered as the average ratio of the length of actual arc path to the corresponding straight path length along the pore fluid flow path which is expressed as 11 τ d arc d str l arc f arc x y d s l str f str x y d s where d arc and d str are respectively the length of the actual arc path and the straight length between one point and the final destination in the void space f arc and f str are the path function along the actual arc path l arc and the corresponding straight path l str respectively the shape factor sf in the digital microscopic analysis framework is defined to represent the geometric similarity of pores to its corresponding inscribed circle which is expressed as 12 sf m p x y π r p i n s c r i b e d 2 where r p i n s c r i b e d is the radii of corresponding inscribed circle from eq 1 to eq 5 the pore and grain microstructures can be effectively extracted based on the labeling segmentation algorithm fig 1 shows the color images for different pores represented by different colors thus with these represented pore and grain microstructures the hydraulic and transport properties can be evaluated by eqs 6 12 based on these extracted pore scale variables 3 multi types pore structure analysis to understand the correlations and to establish the relations between tortuosity and pore scale variables the tortuosity and pore scale variables are computed by eqs 6 12 respectively fig 2 shows the distributions of tortuosity versus porosity pore size and pore shape factor from x μct images of sandstone samples with 3 types of fine pores for s1 s3 3 types of median pores for s4 s6 and 3 types of coarse pores for s7 s9 respectively obviously although these datasets are scatter and cannot be directly applied to establish the tortuosity porosity relation there still exist certain relations between tortuosity and pore scale variables especially for tortuosity and pores size with r2 values all larger than 0 80 blue points and orange dash line in fig 2 therefore in the digital microscopic analysis framework of this work the multi types pore structure analysis is conducted to link the tortuosity to pore scale variables and to study its relation of pore scale permeability and pore diffusivity which is detailedly described as follows 3 1 relation between tortuosity versus pore scale variables generally tortuosity is extremely related to void space and its geometry it is easy to find from fig 2 that tortuosity is inversely proportional to porosity pore size and is proportional to shape factor which can be expressed as 13 τ s f τ 1 φ τ 1 r p considering the correlation of these variables represented by their r2 values the comprehensive effects of porosity pore size and pore shape factor are analyzed by using the levenberg marquardt algorithm in the non linear optimization toolbox of matlab software its details for the implementation and theory can be referred to the previous work more 1978 thus the pore comprehensive effect index pcei takes the following form 14 γ pcei r p 1 φ 1 sf where γ pcei denotes the pore comprehensive effect index with the help of pcei the relation of tortuosity versus porosity pore size and pore shape factor can be rapidly established which exhibits a meaningful relation between tortuosity and pcei by the linear fit in matlab software which is expressed as 15 τ a b γ pcei where a and b are the constant coefficients which can be directly obtained by x μct images of sandstone samples thus by substituting eq 14 into eq 15 the final relation of tortuosity versus porosity pore size and pore shape factor can be expressed as 16 τ a b r p 1 φ 1 sf 3 2 relation between tortuosity and transport property the permeability and fluid diffusion are extremely related to the seepage index characterized by the connectivity and tortuosity of pore microstructures in the digital microscopic analysis framework the seepage index is defined as the ratio of connected pores to isolated pores as 17 si k 1 p n c o n m p k x y k 1 p n i s o m p k x y where si p n c o n and p n i s o are the seepage index the number of connected and isolated pores respectively moreover pore scale permeability is extremely related to porosity pcei and seepage index considering the multi types pore structure samples with fine median and coarse pores the porosity pcei and si are computed by eqs 6 and 7 and eqs 14 16 and the relations for their corresponding averages to permeability for each sample is plotted in fig 3 a clearly although there exist meaningful relations for pore scale permeability versus porosity pcei and si their correlations r2 values are all less than 0 99 which leads to the large errors to determine pore scale permeability by these relations the corresponding variation can be expressed as 18 k ps φ k ps p c e i k ps s i where kps is pore scale permeability thus in the multi types pore structure analysis with levenberg marquardt algorithm the pore seepage factor psf characterized by the porosity pcei and si are defined and the exponential relation between pore scale permeability kps and pore seepage factor is written as 19 p sf si γ pcei φ 2 20 k ps a 1 b 1 e c 1 p sf where a 1 b 1 and c 1 are the constant coefficients which can be directly obtained by x μct images of sandstone samples similar to the variations of pore scale permeability it is easy to find from fig 3 b that although the correlations of pore diffusivity versus porosity and si are larger than 0 9 and it has low value for pore diffusivity versus pcei there exist meaningful relations between pore diffusivity and porosity pcei γ pcei and si thus in the multi types pore structure analysis with levenberg marquardt algorithm the pore diffusion factor pdf characterized by the porosity pcei and si is defined and the logarithm relation between pore scale diffusivity dps and pore diffusion factor is established as 21 p df γ pcei s i φ 22 d ps a 2 ln p df b 2 c 2 where a 2 b 2 and c 2 are the constant coefficients which can be directly obtained by x μct images of sandstone samples 3 3 pore scale single phase flow and transport simulations to study the pore scale variations of permeability and diffusivity for samples with multi types pore structures this work conducts the pore scale single phase flow and transport simulations for samples s1 s9 with the original voxel scale of 3003 the corresponding boundary conditions are shown in fig 4 in which the voxel scale of 50 50 is taken as an example for the numerical simulations with the cubic representations of the pore and solid meshes referring to the pore scale single phase flow the details for governing equations and numerical implementations can be referred to our previous work zhou et al 2020a b the fluid input output and symmetry controlling equations are respectively expressed as 23 n t p h μ u u t n p 0 u t 0 p 0 p 0 24 p h μ u u t n p 0 n p 0 p 0 25 k k n n 0 u n 0 k μ u u t where and respectively denote the fluid density kg m3 dynamic viscosity m s and velocity field m s and espectively denote the pressure pa initial and varying pressure drop pa and k are respectively the normal vector of the fluid flow direction and permeability considering the pore scale transport simulations the boundary controlling equations for the fluid concentration and flux boundaries and the time dependent governing equations for the realistic microstructure model fig 4 can be respectively expressed as 26 c t 0 c 0 d c n k m c c 1 d c n 0 27 c t d c 0 where c is the concentration mol m3 d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s and km is the mass transfer coefficient m s thus by using eqs 22 27 the pore scale fluid flow and transport properties in realistic microstructures for samples s1 s9 can be detailedly analyzed 4 results and discussions 4 1 validation for pore scale tortuosity relations to further validate the accuracy of the established relations between tortuosity and pcei characterized by porosity pore size and shape factor the corresponding pcei tortuosity and porosity are computed by eq 14 eq 11 and eq 6 respectively which are then compared with the experimental result in table 1 fig 5 shows the 3d distributions of pore scale tortuosity in different pores extracted from the reconstructed 3d microstructures of samples s1 s9 obviously the tortuosity increases with increasing pore size which is corresponding to the variations shown in fig 2 and eq 13 14 fig 6 a i respectively shows the tortuosity pcei relations for samples s1 s9 it is clear to find that although these parameters for these relations change a little for samples s1 s9 these relations have the same format as eq 15 and the r2 values are all larger than 0 96 implying excellent correlation of tortuosity and pcei totally to remove the effects of pore shape and size these datasets from samples s1 s9 with 3 types of fine pores 3 types of medium pores and 3 types of coarse pores are computed together the final relation between tortuosity and pcei for sandstone with multi types pore structures fig 6 j can be determined by modifying eq 15 and eq 16 as 28 γ pcei r p 1 φ 1 sf τ 1 7064 0 0043 γ pcei r 2 0 9801 in addition the tortuosity from experiments and computed by the relations from the previous works table 2 and this work are compared in fig 6 k it is easy to find from fig 6 k and table 2 that there are large relative errors 10 between the computed results by eq 28 in this work and the previous work by dullien 1975 and barrande et al 2007 due to their large differences for the computation condition for these works however the relative errors between the other previous works and the present work are all less than 10 and they are less than 5 for the previous work by pisani 2011 and naveed et al 2013 due to similar computation condition in addition the relative errors of tortuosity by experiments and the proposed equation in this work are nearly around 0 implying the accuracy of the proposed tortuosity pcei relation it is easy to find from fig 1 u v and fig 6 l that the segmentation result by this work fig 1 u is better than that by the classical otsu algorithm which is validated by the small porosity errors with experimental porosity the corresponding porosity errors fig 6 l between experiment and computed results are less than 5 implying the accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm in this work therefore it is concluded that the pcei characterized by porosity pore size and shape factor and the proposed tortuosity pcei relation in the digital microscopic analysis framework are more effective to characterize the geometry of pore microstructure and its transport properties 4 2 pore scale permeability evaluation fig 7 respectively shows the velocity distributions of pore microstructures in samples s1 s9 it is easy to find that the velocity changes greatly with changeable pore microstructures to further study the pore scale permeability variations pore scale permeability distributions in different pores extracted from the reconstructed 3d microstructures of samples s1 s9 are plotted in fig 8 a i clearly as porosity and pore sizes increase pore scale permeability either increases or decreases for samples s1 s9 namely there is obvious tendency for the pore scale permeability with changeable pore size and porosity because pore scale permeability is not only related to the pore size porosity and pore geometry but also related to the connected pores in fact the connected pores play significant roles in evaluating permeability of porous geomaterials thus considering the comprehensive effects of pore geometry and pore connectivity the relation between pore scale permeability and pore seepage factor characterizing the pore geometry and pore connectivity can be obtained by analyzing the x μct images of sandstone samples s1 s9 fig 8 j its corresponding expression is written as 29 p sf si γ pcei φ 2 si 1 φ 1 sf r p φ 2 k ps 0 9449 0 1367 e 4 932 p sf r 2 0 9996 where psf denotes the pore seepage factor and kps is the pore scale permeability to validate the accuracy of the established relation between pore scale permeability and pore seepage factor the permeability values computed by eq 29 in this work are compared with permeability values computed by eq 9 in the previous work vervoort and cattle 2003 and experiments and numerical results in this work which are plotted in fig 8 k it is easy to find that some of the relative errors between the experimental and computed results by eq 9 are less than 5 and the others have larger errors than 5 because only the effects of porosity pore size and pore geometry are considered and the significant roles of pore connectivity of microstructures for permeability are neglected however the relative errors between the computed results by eq 29 and experiments and numerical results are all less than 5 implying the accuracy of the established relation between permeability and pore seepage factor totally it is concluded that pore seepage factor is effective to characterize the pore geometry and pore connectivity and the established permeability pore seepage factor is more effective to evaluate pore scale permeability of porous geomaterials 4 3 pore scale diffusivity evaluation fig 9 respectively shows the pore scale fluid concentration distributions of microstructures for samples s1 s9 it is easy to find that the pore scale fluid concentration changes greatly with changeable pore microstructures to deeply understand the characteristics of mass transfer in pore microstructures pore scale diffusivity in different pores of samples s1 s9 is extracted and plotted in fig 10 a i it is easy to find that there exists an obvious variation tendency for the pore scale diffusivity with changeable pore size because pore scale diffusivity is extremely affected by the pore shapes characterized by tortuosity and porosity grathwohl 1998 however pore scale diffusivity is also significantly affected by the pore connectivity therefore considering the comprehensive effects of pore shape and pore connectivity the relation between pore scale diffusivity and pore geometry and connectivity can be obtained by analyzing the x μct images of sandstone samples s1 s9 fig 19 j its corresponding expression is written as 30 p df γ pcei s i φ s i φ r p 1 φ 1 sf d ps 0 6122 ln p df 8 1605 1 5995 r 2 0 9951 where pdf denotes the pore diffusion factor and dps is the pore scale diffusivity to validate the accuracy of the proposed relation between pore scale diffusivity and pore diffusion factor the diffusivity values computed by eq 30 in this work are compared with diffusivity values computed by eq 10 in the previous work grathwohl 1998 and experiments and numerical results in this work which are plotted in fig 10 k it is easy to find that although most of the relative errors between the experimental and computed results by eq 9 are less than 5 the others have larger errors than 5 because only the effects of porosity and tortuosity are considered and the significant roles of microstructural pore connectivity for diffusivity are ignored in addition the relative errors between the computed results by eq 30 and experiments and numerical results are all less than 5 implying the accuracy of the established diffusivity and pore diffusion factor totally it is concluded that pore diffusion factor is effective to characterize the pore geometry and pore connectivity for pore scale diffusion evaluation and the established relation is more effective to evaluate pore scale diffusivity of porous geomaterials 5 summaries and conclusions this paper proposed a digital microscopic analysis framework by the proposed labeling segmentation algorithm and multi types pore structure analysis in which the pore scale variables are defined based on segmented microstructure of x μct images the pore seepage factor and pore diffusion factor characterizing the pore geometry tortuosity and pore connectivity are

helpful to evaluate the hydraulic and transport properties of porous geomaterials 3 the proposed tortuosity pcei permeability pore seepage factor and diffusivity pore diffusion factor relations in the

li et al 2018 natural gas hydrate explorations zhao and zhou 2020 chen et al 2018 and petroleum chemical industry field gostovic et al 2007 kuruneru et al 2017 therefore it is of great importance to understand the pore scale tortuosity and porosity and their correlations with permeability and diffusions of geomaterials to date various approaches are applied to understand the tortuosity and to evaluate the hydraulic and transport properties which can be simply classified into experimental methods analytical methods and numerical methods for example coleman and vassilicos 2008 and morin et al 2010 conducted the field experiments to evaluate the tortuosity based on the measured electrical conductivity gao et al 2014 and corrochano et al 2015 investigated the tortuosity based on fluid diffusion experiments however although the experiments can provide a direct measurement of tortuosity they cannot accurately characterize the relations of microstructures e g void space distribution and pore connectivity to the tortuosity in analytical methods ahmadi et al 2011 established the analytical relations to calculate the tortuosity and permeability based on the average volume approach and modified representative elementary volume rev model laudone et al 2015 developed an analytical approach to estimate the tortuosity based on the simulated void network which is validated to be reliable by comparing the estimated values with experimental results ebrahimi khabbazi et al 2015 proposed the analytical tortuosity porosity correlations for fractal geometries of sierpinski carpet based on a novel mathematical approach however such methods are inevitably limited to the regular geometries and two dimensional 2d planes of geomaterials for numerical methods lanfrey et al 2010 established the tortuosity equations based on the theoretical model for the fixed bed which is randomly packed with identical particles without any empirical constants sun et al 2013 calculated the effective diffusion coefficient and the tortuosity of a 2d representative elementary volume rev of circular particles using the homogenization method and a numerical tool wu et al 2018 developed a mathematical 3d tortuosity model of regular tetrahedron microstructure to quantify tortuosity and corresponding rev of porous granular media xu et al 2018 accurately determined the nonlinear thermal conductivity and tortuosity of porous composites based on the continuum percolation theory and discussed the variations of thermal conductivity and tortuosity in three dimensional 3d pores with geometrical morphologies from the isotropic sphere to anisotropic polyhedra unfortunately although the numerical methods offer excellent models to relate tortuosity to the porous geometries and are extended to three dimensional geometries their applications are still limited to the known regular geometries of porous media totally although various experimental analytical and numerical methods are conducted to successfully evaluate the tortuosity and hydraulic and transport properties the methods to estimate the tortuosity in microstructures with realistic irregular pores for porous geomaterials are still rarely reported in addition the corresponding hydraulic and transport properties related to tortuosity and the pore scale tortuosity and porosity effects on microscopic permeability and pore diffusivity are not still well understood recently x ray ct imaging techniques are widely applied to study the characteristics and evolution process of cracks sarfarazi et al 2018 yavari et al 2021 fu et al 2021 and to evaluate the hydraulic and transport properties due to its abilities of non destruction testing real time monitoring and the 3d visualization of realistic microstructures with irregular pores and grains for instance sarfarazi et al 2022 studied the cracking process and interaction between the internal hole and two neighbor joints under the uniaxial compression by experiments and numerical simulations kumari et al 2018 investigated the effect of reservoir depth temperature and sample heterogeneity during hydraulic fracturing and analyzed the influence of rock microstructure on fracture propagation using x ray ct imaging zhang et al 2018 studied the pore characteristics and established the nonlinear relation to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity based on x ray ct images zhao and zhou 2018 reconstructed the 3d pore models of sandstone and calculated the pore size distribution and permeability based on the reconstructed 3d models from 2d ct images shanti et al 2014 measured the connectivity and tortuosity based on 3d x ray ct datasets using path length ratio and gas phase flux approaches zhao et al 2022 studied the pore connectivity and water saturation effects on the permeability of deep gas shale pawlowski et al 2018 reconstructed the monolithic alumina columns and computed the tortuosity based on x ray ct images and dijkstra s shortest path algorithm li et al 2018 studied the effects of microscopic fractures on the permeability of carbonate rocks by digital analysis rock cores liu et al 2022a b proposed a machine learning method to predict the gas permeability of gaomiaozi bentonite by digital image analysis in addition the pore network models show its superiority in determining the hydraulic properties koponen et al 1996 sadeghnejad et al 2021 mckague et al 2022 van der heijden et al 2022 xia et al 2019 proposed a fractal dimension model with lacunarity and succolarity analysis to predict the permeability of reservoir rocks by x ray ct imaging khan et al 2019 proposed a snow dual algorithm to simultaneously extract the void and solid microstructure models to compute the effective transport properties which are validated by the experimental and numerical results moslemipour and sadeghnejad 2021 proposed a multi scale pore network model to evaluate the petrophyscial and hydraulic properties of carbonates which are validated by the experimental results qin et al 2022 studied the effects of pore morphology on permeability by euler number and shape factor thorough the digital rock modeling the previous works have validated the excellent performances of x ray ct imaging to evaluate the cracking behaviors hydraulic and transport properties however few works focused on the pore scale variations of tortuosity by x ray ct imaging and its effects on permeability and pore diffusivity for porous geomaterials with realistic pore networks therefore in view of these mentioned problems above the present study mainly aims to develop digital microscopic analysis framework according to x μct imaging techniques in which the pore scale tortuosity of porous geomaterials can be directly obtained with less efforts a labeling segmentation algorithm is proposed to accurately extract the irregular pore geometries and topologies a multi types pore structure analysis with levenberg marquardt algorithm is conducted to link the tortuosity to pore scale variables and to study its relation to pore scale permeability and pore diffusivity in the digital microscopic analysis framework compared with the previous works the main advantages of the proposed approach are that 1 a digital microscopic analysis framework with the proposed labelling segmentation algorithm is established to accurately compute the pore scale tortuosity 2 the effective relations of pore seepage factor and pore diffusion factor characterizing the pore geometry and pore connectivity are established to evaluate hydraulic and transport properties and its pore scale effects are studied and 3 the geometric effects of irregular pores on pore scale tortuosity permeability and diffusivity are studied this rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the characteristics of sandstone samples the methods to extract irregular microstructures and definitions of pore scale variables section 3 elucidates the derivations of multi types pore structure analysis by pore scale variables section 4 provides the main results and discussions of the pore scale tortuosity and its effects on pore diffusivity and permeability which is followed by the simple summaries and conclusions in section 5 2 samples and methods 2 1 sample descriptions in this work 9 types of sandstones are artificially selected and collected based on the observation of the grain diameter in sandstone samples to evaluate the pore scale tortuosity and its relations to pore scale variables e g porosity these sandstones are classified into 3 types of samples with fine pores 3 types of samples with median pores and 3 types of samples with coarse pores with different x μct imaging resolutions totally 300 x μct images fig 1 for each sample are prepared with a size of 300 300 pixels to evaluate the pore scale tortuosity and its effects on permeability and pore diffusivity of porous geomaterials in addition the porosity and permeability are measured by the ap608 automated permeameter porosimete and tortuosity and diffusion coefficient are measured by the poremaster 33 mercury injection apparatus and the macromr12 150h i nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus based on the fluid flow method wang et al 2005 in which the testing procedures can be referred to their detailed values are respectively listed in table 1 for samples s1 s9 2 2 microstructure extraction and analysis the tortuosity and porosity are two primary variables which significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the predicted hydraulic and transport properties by pores and grains in microstructures of porous geomaterials although the classical segmentation algorithms such as the otsu segmentation algorithm otsu 1979 can segment the pores and grains they cannot offer detailed information of different sub pores and sub grains moreover overestimation and underestimation may occur due to complex pore networks with the corresponding pore grain size distribution zhao and zhou 2021 therefore a novel labeling segmentation algorithm is proposed to obtain the porosity and microstructure sizes of porous geomaterials without overestimation and underestimation the labeling segmentation algorithm is divided into 3 steps and described in detail as follows step 1 the computation of the gray level distribution generally gray level value of x μct images always varies from 0 black to 255 white first these images are simply filtered by the median filter in the matlab software as shown in fig 1 s t then the distribution of gray level not only reflects the absorptivity of object to x ray energy but also contains the microstructure information which can be computed by 1 h f 1 n 1 n f x y g u d x d y g u 0 255 where h f denotes the distribution of gray intensity f x y g u represents the unique gray level and n is the dimension of x μct image step 2 the computation of pore segmentation threshold s t once the gray level distribution of x μct images is obtained a pore segmentation threshold s t is utilized to divide the gray level distribution into two groups h f 1 0 s t and h f 2 s t 255 and their variances are respectively expressed as 2 χ 1 0 s t i 1 i h f 1 0 s t h f 1 0 s t i i 1 i h f 1 0 s t h f 1 0 s t i i h f 1 0 s t 2 i h f 1 0 s t 1 3 χ 2 s t 255 i 1 i h f 1 s t 255 h f 1 s t 255 i i 1 i h f 1 s t 255 h f 1 s t 255 i i h f 1 s t 255 2 i h f 1 s t 255 1 where χ and i denote the variance and counter of the unique gray level respectively thus the pore segmentation threshold s t can be finally determined by the maximum of the absolute difference between this two variances by 4 s t max χ 2 s t 255 χ 1 0 s t where max is the searching function of the maximum since the maximum of absolute difference between these two variances is used to determine the threshold the segmentation results would be better for the grayscale image with bi modal distribution step 3 the labeling of different size of pores and grains once the pore segmentation threshold s t is computed by eq 4 the x μct image can be segmented into the sub matrixes of pores and sub matrixes of grains with different sizes thus the microstructures in the x μct images of geomaterials can be represented by different labeling values with different colors fig 1 which can be expressed with the labeling value from top to bottom and left to right in turn by 5 i b i p i g k 1 p n m p k x y k 1 g n m g k x y i g k 1 g n m g k x y ω f x y s t i p k 1 p n m p k x y ω f x y s t where i b i p and i g are respectively the microstructure matrix pore matrix and grain matrix m p x y and m g x y are respectively the sub matrixes for pores and grains and pn and g n are respectively the number of sup pore and sub grain with the corresponding labeling value k for the k th sub pore or sub grain 2 3 extraction of pore scale variables pore scale variables e g porosity and pore size play paramount roles in estimating the hydraulic and transport properties in porous geomaterials to understand these properties porosity pore and grain sizes and tortuosity are defined in the digital microscopic analysis framework porosity is considered as the occupation percentage of void space in the total volume of porous geomaterials which is written as 6 φ i p i p i g k 1 p n m p k x y f x y to obtain accurate pore size and grain size irregular pores grains are equivalent to the circles the radii of each pore and gain represented by sub matrixes can be computed by 7 r p or g p r m p k g k x y π where r p or g is the pore or gain radii and p r is the resolution of x μct images once the pore size and grain size are obtained the specific surface can be simply modified based on its ratio of pore surface area to volume as tiab and donaldson 2011 8 s s a v m p k x y z 1 n m p k z x y 3 r p where s s a v and r p are respectively the specific surface surface area volume and radius for each pore generally the bundle of tubes model with kozeny caman equation is applied to evaluate the permeability and diffusivity in which the gains or pores are considered to be spheres vervoort and cattle 2003 grathwohl 1998 zhao and zhou 2020 thus with the defined pore scale variables the permeability and diffusivity related to the tortuosity based on carman equation can be respectively estimated by 9 k r p φ 3 9 τ 1 φ 2 10 d cd φ d m τ where τ k d cd and d m represent the tortuosity permeability convection diffusion coefficient in porous geomaterials and constant diffusivity for standard flow media by sulfate or methane respectively generally tortuosity is one of the most important variables to study the flow and transport characteristics in geomaterials which is significantly affected by the geometric shape of irregular pores and its definition differs in various fields bullitt et al 2003 ghanbarian et al 2013 in this study the tortuosity is considered as the average ratio of the length of actual arc path to the corresponding straight path length along the pore fluid flow path which is expressed as 11 τ d arc d str l arc f arc x y d s l str f str x y d s where d arc and d str are respectively the length of the actual arc path and the straight length between one point and the final destination in the void space f arc and f str are the path function along the actual arc path l arc and the corresponding straight path l str respectively the shape factor sf in the digital microscopic analysis framework is defined to represent the geometric similarity of pores to its corresponding inscribed circle which is expressed as 12 sf m p x y π r p i n s c r i b e d 2 where r p i n s c r i b e d is the radii of corresponding inscribed circle from eq 1 to eq 5 the pore and grain microstructures can be effectively extracted based on the labeling segmentation algorithm fig 1 shows the color images for different pores represented by different colors thus with these represented pore and grain microstructures the hydraulic and transport properties can be evaluated by eqs 6 12 based on these extracted pore scale variables 3 multi types pore structure analysis to understand the correlations and to establish the relations between tortuosity and pore scale variables the tortuosity and pore scale variables are computed by eqs 6 12 respectively fig 2 shows the distributions of tortuosity versus porosity pore size and pore shape factor from x μct images of sandstone samples with 3 types of fine pores for s1 s3 3 types of median pores for s4 s6 and 3 types of coarse pores for s7 s9 respectively obviously although these datasets are scatter and cannot be directly applied to establish the tortuosity porosity relation there still exist certain relations between tortuosity and pore scale variables especially for tortuosity and pores size with r2 values all larger than 0 80 blue points and orange dash line in fig 2 therefore in the digital microscopic analysis framework of this work the multi types pore structure analysis is conducted to link the tortuosity to pore scale variables and to study its relation of pore scale permeability and pore diffusivity which is detailedly described as follows 3 1 relation between tortuosity versus pore scale variables generally tortuosity is extremely related to void space and its geometry it is easy to find from fig 2 that tortuosity is inversely proportional to porosity pore size and is proportional to shape factor which can be expressed as 13 τ s f τ 1 φ τ 1 r p considering the correlation of these variables represented by their r2 values the comprehensive effects of porosity pore size and pore shape factor are analyzed by using the levenberg marquardt algorithm in the non linear optimization toolbox of matlab software its details for the implementation and theory can be referred to the previous work more 1978 thus the pore comprehensive effect index pcei takes the following form 14 γ pcei r p 1 φ 1 sf where γ pcei denotes the pore comprehensive effect index with the help of pcei the relation of tortuosity versus porosity pore size and pore shape factor can be rapidly established which exhibits a meaningful relation between tortuosity and pcei by the linear fit in matlab software which is expressed as 15 τ a b γ pcei where a and b are the constant coefficients which can be directly obtained by x μct images of sandstone samples thus by substituting eq 14 into eq 15 the final relation of tortuosity versus porosity pore size and pore shape factor can be expressed as 16 τ a b r p 1 φ 1 sf 3 2 relation between tortuosity and transport property the permeability and fluid diffusion are extremely related to the seepage index characterized by the connectivity and tortuosity of pore microstructures in the digital microscopic analysis framework the seepage index is defined as the ratio of connected pores to isolated pores as 17 si k 1 p n c o n m p k x y k 1 p n i s o m p k x y where si p n c o n and p n i s o are the seepage index the number of connected and isolated pores respectively moreover pore scale permeability is extremely related to porosity pcei and seepage index considering the multi types pore structure samples with fine median and coarse pores the porosity pcei and si are computed by eqs 6 and 7 and eqs 14 16 and the relations for their corresponding averages to permeability for each sample is plotted in fig 3 a clearly although there exist meaningful relations for pore scale permeability versus porosity pcei and si their correlations r2 values are all less than 0 99 which leads to the large errors to determine pore scale permeability by these relations the corresponding variation can be expressed as 18 k ps φ k ps p c e i k ps s i where kps is pore scale permeability thus in the multi types pore structure analysis with levenberg marquardt algorithm the pore seepage factor psf characterized by the porosity pcei and si are defined and the exponential relation between pore scale permeability kps and pore seepage factor is written as 19 p sf si γ pcei φ 2 20 k ps a 1 b 1 e c 1 p sf where a 1 b 1 and c 1 are the constant coefficients which can be directly obtained by x μct images of sandstone samples similar to the variations of pore scale permeability it is easy to find from fig 3 b that although the correlations of pore diffusivity versus porosity and si are larger than 0 9 and it has low value for pore diffusivity versus pcei there exist meaningful relations between pore diffusivity and porosity pcei γ pcei and si thus in the multi types pore structure analysis with levenberg marquardt algorithm the pore diffusion factor pdf characterized by the porosity pcei and si is defined and the logarithm relation between pore scale diffusivity dps and pore diffusion factor is established as 21 p df γ pcei s i φ 22 d ps a 2 ln p df b 2 c 2 where a 2 b 2 and c 2 are the constant coefficients which can be directly obtained by x μct images of sandstone samples 3 3 pore scale single phase flow and transport simulations to study the pore scale variations of permeability and diffusivity for samples with multi types pore structures this work conducts the pore scale single phase flow and transport simulations for samples s1 s9 with the original voxel scale of 3003 the corresponding boundary conditions are shown in fig 4 in which the voxel scale of 50 50 is taken as an example for the numerical simulations with the cubic representations of the pore and solid meshes referring to the pore scale single phase flow the details for governing equations and numerical implementations can be referred to our previous work zhou et al 2020a b the fluid input output and symmetry controlling equations are respectively expressed as 23 n t p h μ u u t n p 0 u t 0 p 0 p 0 24 p h μ u u t n p 0 n p 0 p 0 25 k k n n 0 u n 0 k μ u u t where and respectively denote the fluid density kg m3 dynamic viscosity m s and velocity field m s and espectively denote the pressure pa initial and varying pressure drop pa and k are respectively the normal vector of the fluid flow direction and permeability considering the pore scale transport simulations the boundary controlling equations for the fluid concentration and flux boundaries and the time dependent governing equations for the realistic microstructure model fig 4 can be respectively expressed as 26 c t 0 c 0 d c n k m c c 1 d c n 0 27 c t d c 0 where c is the concentration mol m3 d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s and km is the mass transfer coefficient m s thus by using eqs 22 27 the pore scale fluid flow and transport properties in realistic microstructures for samples s1 s9 can be detailedly analyzed 4 results and discussions 4 1 validation for pore scale tortuosity relations to further validate the accuracy of the established relations between tortuosity and pcei characterized by porosity pore size and shape factor the corresponding pcei tortuosity and porosity are computed by eq 14 eq 11 and eq 6 respectively which are then compared with the experimental result in table 1 fig 5 shows the 3d distributions of pore scale tortuosity in different pores extracted from the reconstructed 3d microstructures of samples s1 s9 obviously the tortuosity increases with increasing pore size which is corresponding to the variations shown in fig 2 and eq 13 14 fig 6 a i respectively shows the tortuosity pcei relations for samples s1 s9 it is clear to find that although these parameters for these relations change a little for samples s1 s9 these relations have the same format as eq 15 and the r2 values are all larger than 0 96 implying excellent correlation of tortuosity and pcei totally to remove the effects of pore shape and size these datasets from samples s1 s9 with 3 types of fine pores 3 types of medium pores and 3 types of coarse pores are computed together the final relation between tortuosity and pcei for sandstone with multi types pore structures fig 6 j can be determined by modifying eq 15 and eq 16 as 28 γ pcei r p 1 φ 1 sf τ 1 7064 0 0043 γ pcei r 2 0 9801 in addition the tortuosity from experiments and computed by the relations from the previous works table 2 and this work are compared in fig 6 k it is easy to find from fig 6 k and table 2 that there are large relative errors 10 between the computed results by eq 28 in this work and the previous work by dullien 1975 and barrande et al 2007 due to their large differences for the computation condition for these works however the relative errors between the other previous works and the present work are all less than 10 and they are less than 5 for the previous work by pisani 2011 and naveed et al 2013 due to similar computation condition in addition the relative errors of tortuosity by experiments and the proposed equation in this work are nearly around 0 implying the accuracy of the proposed tortuosity pcei relation it is easy to find from fig 1 u v and fig 6 l that the segmentation result by this work fig 1 u is better than that by the classical otsu algorithm which is validated by the small porosity errors with experimental porosity the corresponding porosity errors fig 6 l between experiment and computed results are less than 5 implying the accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm in this work therefore it is concluded that the pcei characterized by porosity pore size and shape factor and the proposed tortuosity pcei relation in the digital microscopic analysis framework are more effective to characterize the geometry of pore microstructure and its transport properties 4 2 pore scale permeability evaluation fig 7 respectively shows the velocity distributions of pore microstructures in samples s1 s9 it is easy to find that the velocity changes greatly with changeable pore microstructures to further study the pore scale permeability variations pore scale permeability distributions in different pores extracted from the reconstructed 3d microstructures of samples s1 s9 are plotted in fig 8 a i clearly as porosity and pore sizes increase pore scale permeability either increases or decreases for samples s1 s9 namely there is obvious tendency for the pore scale permeability with changeable pore size and porosity because pore scale permeability is not only related to the pore size porosity and pore geometry but also related to the connected pores in fact the connected pores play significant roles in evaluating permeability of porous geomaterials thus considering the comprehensive effects of pore geometry and pore connectivity the relation between pore scale permeability and pore seepage factor characterizing the pore geometry and pore connectivity can be obtained by analyzing the x μct images of sandstone samples s1 s9 fig 8 j its corresponding expression is written as 29 p sf si γ pcei φ 2 si 1 φ 1 sf r p φ 2 k ps 0 9449 0 1367 e 4 932 p sf r 2 0 9996 where psf denotes the pore seepage factor and kps is the pore scale permeability to validate the accuracy of the established relation between pore scale permeability and pore seepage factor the permeability values computed by eq 29 in this work are compared with permeability values computed by eq 9 in the previous work vervoort and cattle 2003 and experiments and numerical results in this work which are plotted in fig 8 k it is easy to find that some of the relative errors between the experimental and computed results by eq 9 are less than 5 and the others have larger errors than 5 because only the effects of porosity pore size and pore geometry are considered and the significant roles of pore connectivity of microstructures for permeability are neglected however the relative errors between the computed results by eq 29 and experiments and numerical results are all less than 5 implying the accuracy of the established relation between permeability and pore seepage factor totally it is concluded that pore seepage factor is effective to characterize the pore geometry and pore connectivity and the established permeability pore seepage factor is more effective to evaluate pore scale permeability of porous geomaterials 4 3 pore scale diffusivity evaluation fig 9 respectively shows the pore scale fluid concentration distributions of microstructures for samples s1 s9 it is easy to find that the pore scale fluid concentration changes greatly with changeable pore microstructures to deeply understand the characteristics of mass transfer in pore microstructures pore scale diffusivity in different pores of samples s1 s9 is extracted and plotted in fig 10 a i it is easy to find that there exists an obvious variation tendency for the pore scale diffusivity with changeable pore size because pore scale diffusivity is extremely affected by the pore shapes characterized by tortuosity and porosity grathwohl 1998 however pore scale diffusivity is also significantly affected by the pore connectivity therefore considering the comprehensive effects of pore shape and pore connectivity the relation between pore scale diffusivity and pore geometry and connectivity can be obtained by analyzing the x μct images of sandstone samples s1 s9 fig 19 j its corresponding expression is written as 30 p df γ pcei s i φ s i φ r p 1 φ 1 sf d ps 0 6122 ln p df 8 1605 1 5995 r 2 0 9951 where pdf denotes the pore diffusion factor and dps is the pore scale diffusivity to validate the accuracy of the proposed relation between pore scale diffusivity and pore diffusion factor the diffusivity values computed by eq 30 in this work are compared with diffusivity values computed by eq 10 in the previous work grathwohl 1998 and experiments and numerical results in this work which are plotted in fig 10 k it is easy to find that although most of the relative errors between the experimental and computed results by eq 9 are less than 5 the others have larger errors than 5 because only the effects of porosity and tortuosity are considered and the significant roles of microstructural pore connectivity for diffusivity are ignored in addition the relative errors between the computed results by eq 30 and experiments and numerical results are all less than 5 implying the accuracy of the established diffusivity and pore diffusion factor totally it is concluded that pore diffusion factor is effective to characterize the pore geometry and pore connectivity for pore scale diffusion evaluation and the established relation is more effective to evaluate pore scale diffusivity of porous geomaterials 5 summaries and conclusions this paper proposed a digital microscopic analysis framework by the proposed labeling segmentation algorithm and multi types pore structure analysis in which the pore scale variables are defined based on segmented microstructure of x μct images the pore seepage factor and pore diffusion factor characterizing the pore geometry tortuosity and pore connectivity are established which are linked to the pore scale permeability and diffusivity and their effects on pore scale permeability and diffusivity are studied the primary conclusions are drawn as follows 1 with the development of x μct imaging techniques accurate and reliable microstructures and basic petrophysical parameters such as porosity and tortuosity can be easily extracted from the x μct images by using the proposed labeling segmentation algorithm 2 the proposed pore seepage factor and pore diffusion factor are more effective to characterize the pore geometry and pore connectivity which are helpful to evaluate the hydraulic and transport properties of porous geomaterials 3 the proposed tortuosity pcei permeability pore seepage factor and diffusivity pore diffusion factor relations in the digital microscopic analysis framework have great potentials to rapidly and accurately evaluate the pore scale permeability and diffusivity of geomaterials with less effort which is helpful for the evaluations of various engineering projects such as geothermal exploration and shale oil gas exploration this work mainly focuses on the sandstone samples with different pore types and it is a general digital microscopic analysis framework for different porous media however the representation element volume rev would be changed to accurately predict the hydraulic properties of different porous media such as carbonates and the rev effects on the hydraulic properties of different types of rocks e g sandstone carbonates shale and coal rocks etc would be comprehensively studied in the future

2696,the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac that is a dynamic interactive and coupled system is particularly complicated in arid seasonally frozen regions asf regions with the effects of soil freeze thaw process and salinity a quantitative understanding of heat water salt transport and crop growth in the spac over an entire agricultural year agr year is an importance of promoting best practices

confidential 1 introduction in many arid regions irrigated agricultural production usually faces two significant issues crop water deficit due to inadequate irrigation water supply and irrigation induced soil salinization caused by excessive irrigation shao et al 2009 xu et al 2010 assouline et al 2015 a good understanding of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system and its dynamics is of crucial importance for efficient agricultural management xu et al 2013 bodner et al 2015 in general the spac system is an integrated and dynamic system in which mass water and solute and energy heat transfer occur with very complicated interactions philip 1966 hillel 1998 molz and faybishenko 2013 porporato et al 2015 trautz et al 2017 in particular the spac system becomes more complicated in arid seasonally frozen asf regions where the salinity and the soil freeze thaw process may also greatly affect the system dynamics it is well known that salinity is one of the main factors in limiting plant evapotranspiration et and growth panta et al 2014 zorb et al 2019 meanwhile soil freeze thaw process has a large impact on the mass and energy exchanges among the atmosphere crop soil and groundwater during the winter season alkhaier et al 2012 ireson et al 2012 cui et al 2020 kelleners 2020 it significantly changes the re distribution of soil water temperature and salt thus affecting the emergence and seedling growth in the next spring season in addition the soil freeze thaw process may have larger effects on the efficiency of salt leaching and moisture preservation for regions with a tradition of applying the pre winter irrigation after crop harvest e g in arid regions of inland asia xu et al 2010 wu et al 2019 therefore a full and quantitative understanding of the spac system in an entire agricultural year agr year including both crop growth season and frost period is quite necessary for promoting rational water use and crop production for agroecosystems field experiment is the basis to understand the spac of the agroecosystem while it is costly laborious and time consuming ren et al 2016 alternatively scientists from different disciplines have developed many mathematical models to simulate the spac and its responses to ambient environmental changes e g hydrus swap ahc apsim dssat shaw coupmodel etc šimůnek et al 2008 van dam et al 1997 xu et al 2018 keating et al 2003 jones et al 2003 flerchinger and saxton 1989 jansson and karlberg 2004 more comprehensive and systematic analyses could be conducted with a combined use of the spac model and experimental data in general the existing spac models have varying degrees of sophistication and different functionality monteith 1996 kucharik 2003 xu et al 2018 a model which can be well used for spac simulation in arid regions is usually required to have the ability to describe the soil water salt heat crop processes many simulation models have achieved good performance and various applications in agricultural and environmental fields in arid regions kumar et al 2015 mubeen et al 2020 wang et al 2022b however most of these spac models primarily focus on simulating the spac system for non frost seasons i e covering crop growth seasons being lack of describing the soil freeze thaw processes some models have applied physically rigorous approaches for modeling flow processes in frozen soils based on fully coupled water and heat transport including shaw coupmodel and a modified hydrus hansson et al 2004 to our knowledge very few released models e g shaw and coupmodel include clear coupling mechanisms of water solute heat transport for frozen soils and have practical use in the agroecosystem of asf regions kahimba et al 2009 wu et al 2011 wu et al 2019 lu et al 2019 in addition the coupmodel has a crop growth module but adopts a very simplified balance based solute model only considering solute convection but neglecting solute diffusion wu et al 2019 in contrast the shaw applies a more mechanistic solute module based on solving the advection dispersion equation however the formally released version does not simulate the crop growth but requires the input of known canopy information note that some modification works have been carried out to couple the shaw with crop growth modules or crop models for example rzwqm shaw is developed to simulate crop root growth and it was used to estimate overwinter soil moisture and temperature flerchinger et al 2000 li et al 2012 a coupled model of shaw and wofost is proposed and well used to simulate the actual effect of soil water stress on crop transpiration and describe the interactions of energy and water in the agroecosystem li et al 2013 however the above shaw modifications focus more on the interactions of water heat transfer and crop growth while few studies take salt transport into account lu et al 2019 besides the shaw also has some unique features of its own especially including the simultaneous simulation of water vapor and heat transfer in surface residues and within multiple layers of plant canopy flerchinger et al 1998 thus it is attractive to further improve a spac model to describe the interactions of heat water salt crop in asf regions over an entire agr year particularly based on the good framework of shaw therefore the main objective of this paper is to enhance and extend the spac model for simulating the coupled processes of heat water salt transport and crop growth over an entire agr year in asf regions the original shaw is thus significantly modified by improving the components of soil water and solute transport and plant growth the modifications mainly involve 1 embedding a new crop growth model i e epic crop growth module with moderate input data demand 2 improving the calculation approaches for root water uptake soil evaporation and plant transpiration as well as water salinity stress and 3 modifying the solute module for reasonably describing the salt migration particularly salt leaching during the infiltration process the improved coupled model hereafter called shaw sc is tested with sunflower field experiments over two entire agr years in hetao irrigation district hetao of the arid upper yellow river basin after that the dynamic processes of soil heat water salt transfer and crop growth and interactions are systematically analyzed for the spac and water use performance is conducted on a scale of entire agr year 2 detailed description of shaw sc and the related modifications the simultaneous heat and water shaw model that is developed by flerchinger and saxton 1989 simultaneously simulates the heat water and solute transfer with considering the effects of plant cover residue and snow the physical system described by the shaw consists of a vertical one dimensional 1 d profile extending from the plant canopy including canopy leaves and air snow residue or soil surface to a specified depth within the soil fig 1 heat water solute fluxes within the 1 d system profile are described by a series of continuous partial differential equations which are solved by the finite differential method infiltration flux is calculated separately using a green ampt approach for a multi layered soil meantime solute leaching and energy transfer are subsequently calculated by a balance method based on the above infiltration flux the shaw provides a detailed mechanistic description of soil freezing and thawing besides it uses a sophisticated approach to calculate transpiration and water vapor transfer through a plant canopy flerchinger et al 1996 1998 although it does not simulate plant growth process more detailed theoretical description of shaw can be found in flerchinger 1987 and flerchinger 2017a the simultaneous heat water salt and crop shaw sc model being a modified version of shaw is proposed with a focus on improving the simulation abilities of water salt transport and crop growth in asf regions the main calculation flow chart is presented in fig 2 system profile compositions and site parameters are initialized at the beginning of the program absorbed shortwave radiation are first calculated and assumed constant over the hour then heat water and solute transport in the system profile is simulated with given boundary conditions on the basis of hourly time step the hourly time step may be divided into smaller time steps for convergence in iterative solutions subsequently further adjustments are made for precipitation snowmelt interception and infiltration to update the heat water solute balance and profile information at end of each hour at the end of each day the daily water salinity stress is to be calculated by integrating the hourly soil information after that the crop growth and biomass are simulated based on a daily time step this calculation process is repeated until the end of the simulation period the modifications are carried out based on the latest shaw model of version 3 0 mainly involving 1 embedding a new epic crop growth module to simulate canopy growth and yield formation 2 adapting the lower boundary of solute transport to reasonably capture actual salt exchange between soil water and shallow groundwater 3 correcting the existing errors in solute leaching calculation during irrigation precipitation infiltration and 4 improving the soil evaporation calculation with including the surface mulch effects and crop transpiration calculation with considering the salinity osmotic stress the main principles of shaw and the detailed modifications are described in the following sections 2 1 heat transport within canopy and soil for heat and water transport within canopy layers thermal and vapor fluxes are exchanged between the air space while transpiration and heat dissipation of leaves are regarded as source terms into canopy air space in the shaw heat flux and temperature within the air space of the canopy are described by 1 ρ a c a t t z ρ a c a k e t z h l where ρa ca and ta are density kg m 3 specific heat capacity j kg 1c 1 and temperature of the air within the canopy respectively t is time s z is the vertical distance within 1 d system profile m ke is a transfer coefficient within the canopy m2 s 1 and hl is heat transferred from the leaves to the air space within the canopy w m 3 in the numerical solution of eq 1 the actual placement of the highest node at any given time will equal the actual canopy height that is dynamically changed with plant development the state equation for temperature distribution in the soil profile considering convective heat transfer by liquid and latent heat transfer by vapor for a layer of freezing soil is given by 2 c s t t ρ i l f θ i t z k s t z ρ l c l q l t z l v ρ v t q v z where cs and t are volumetric heat capacity j kg 1c 1 and temperature of the soil respectively ρi and ρl are density kg m 3 of ice and water respectively θi is volumetric ice content cm3 cm 3 ks is soil thermal conductivity w m 1c 1 cl is specific heat capacity of water j kg 1c 1 ql is liquid water flux m s 1 qv is vapor flux kg m 2 s 1 and ρv is vapor density kg m 3 within the soil at subfreezing soil temperatures soil liquid water exists in equilibrium with ice due to matric and osmotic potentials the relation between liquid content and temperature is given by the freezing point depression equation fuchs et al 1978 3 ϕ π h l f g t t k where φ π and h are respectively soil total water potential soil water osmotic potential and soil matric potential i e soil water pressure head m and lf is latent heat of fusion j kg 1 osmotic potential in soil solution is computed from 4 π c r t k g where c is solute concentration mol l 1 in the soil solution and r is a universal gas constant π is calculated as the sum of the osmotic potential of each ionic species with the determined osmotic potential soil temperature defines the matric potential and therefore the liquid water content 2 2 water transport within canopy and soil 2 2 1 water flux between layers vapor flux through the canopy is written similarly to the canopy heat flux equation 5 ρ v t z k e ρ v z e l where el is transpiration or evaporation from the leaves within the canopy the soil water flux equation for liquid and vapor flow with provisions for frozen soils is written as 6 θ l t ρ i ρ l θ i t z k h h z 1 1 ρ l q v z u where θl is soil liquid water content cm3 cm 3 k is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ms 1 and u is a source sink term e g root water uptake for water flux m3 m 3 s 1 rainfall snowmelt and ponded water are infiltrated into the soil at the end of each time step and the infiltration flux is calculated using a green ampt approach for a multi layered soil solving eq 6 requires knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties and three options are available in shaw to describe the soil moisture release curve and k h curve including the campbell functions campbell 1974 the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1966 and the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 in addition hydraulic conductivity is reduced linearly with ice content assuming zero conductivity at an available porosity of 0 13 bloomsburg and wang 1969 2 2 2 evaporation evaporation is calculated through the transfer of water vapor from the exchange surface to the atmosphere as follows 7 e ρ vs ρ va r v where ρvs and ρva are vapor density kg m 3 of the exchange surface and air respectively and rv is the resistance value for vapor transfer s m 1 in this paper the modification and treatment are proposed for the shaw sc 1 the term soil evaporation esl is newly defined and calculated as the vapor flux between soil surface layer and canopy bottom layer when canopy exists 2 surface mulching is an important agricultural practice in arid cold regions for reducing soil evaporation and maintaining soil temperature the effects of surface mulching are thus introduced and described by two factors i e the fraction of soil surface covered by mulch cfmul and the adjusted factor of mulch material fmm soil evaporation and surface latent heat are adjusted by a mulching reduction coefficient kr mul 8 k r m u l 1 c f mul f mm where cfmul varies from 0 to 100 and fmm varies between 0 5 for mulches of plant material and is close to 1 0 for plastic mulches xu et al 2018 2 2 3 transpiration transpiration within a canopy is determined assuming a soil plant atmosphere continuum water flow is calculated assuming continuity in water potential throughout the plants i e in the soil root xylem leaf system the plant transpiration is calculated as 9 t a k 1 ns h k h x r r k i 1 nc h x h l i r l i i 1 nc ρ vsto i ρ va i r s i r v i l ai i where ns and nc are the number of rooted soil and canopy nodes ta is total transpiration rate kg m 2 s 1 hx and hl are water potential m in the plant xylem and in the leaves of canopy respectively rr and rl are the resistance to water flow m3 s kg 1 through the roots and the leaves respectively ρvsto is the vapor density kg m 3 within the stomatal cavities assumed to be saturated vapor density lai is the leaf area index lai rs is stomatal resistance per unit of lai s m 1 and rv is the resistance to convective transfer s m 1 from the leaves the stomatal resistance is computed considering the function of leaf water potential and meteorological influences as follows 10 r s r s 0 1 h l h c n f t f st f vpd where rs0 is stomatal resistance with no stress s m 1 hc is a critical leaf water potential m at which stomatal resistance is twice its minimum value n is an empirical exponent and fst ft and fvpd are stomatal restriction factors for ambient solar radiation temperature and vapor pressure deficit respectively functions for fst and ft follow a jarvis stewart approach jarvis 1976 stewart 1988 note that the transpiration calculation in shaw only considers the water stress caused by soil matric potential h see eq 9 the modification in shaw sc is mainly related to the salinity stress that may largely affect root water uptake and thus restrict crop growth uptake reduction due to a combination of water and salinity stresses could be modeled by assuming that stresses are somehow additive or multiplicative van genuchten 1987 skaggs et al 2006 in shaw sc the effect of osmotic potential on root water uptake is considered to be additive to the soil matric potential for computer program implementation hence we use h i e the sum of soil matric potential and osmotic potential to replace the h in eq 9 for calculating water salinity stress since the additivity has been inferred from a number of laboratory and field experiments skaggs et al 2006 in addition a new term potential transpiration tp is introduced to calculate the water salinity stress factor αws that is required in the crop growth module tp is calculated with the stomatal resistance under no water salinity stress rscl as follows 11 t p i 1 nc ρ vsto i ρ va i r scl i r v i l a i i i 1 nc ρ vsto i ρ va i r s 0 i f t f st f vpd r v i l ai i where rscl is stomatal resistance affected by ambient climatic conditions but with no water salinity stress the ratio of ta tp is considered as the water salinity stress factor αws in restricting crop transpiration and growth in addition the proportions of water and salinity stress can also be obtained based on the relative value of matric and osmotic potentials 2 3 solute transport within soil 2 3 1 solute flux between layers the shaw considers three processes of solute transfer molecular diffusion convection and hydrodynamic dispersion the solute transport equation is written as 12 ρ b s t ρ l z d h d m c z ρ l q l c z where ρb is soil bulk density kg m 3 s is total salt content g kg 1 dh and dm are the hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 respectively and ql is liquid water flux m s 1 this equation is used to simulate the transport of multiple ionic species in shaw some specific treatment and modification in shaw sc are as follows for salinity simulation the total solute in soil solution is treated as an ideal and single solute species without distinguishing various ionic species in the original shaw the lower boundary condition for eq 12 is set as cn t cn 1 t which means that solute concentration of soil bottom node n always equals to that of soil node n 1 this assumption may be not reasonable for shallow groundwater system where water and solute may exchange frequently between soil and aquifer solute concentration at bottom node is variable and affected by both soil water and groundwater dynamics the bottom of soil model domain is often set below the groundwater table xu et al 2013 therefore an additional lower boundary condition is provided in shaw sc i e the dirichlet boundary condition with cn t cgw t cgw is the observed solute concentration of the groundwater the detail treatment for this new lower boundary condition can be found in annex a 2 3 2 solute leaching upon infiltration the solute transport and leaching upon infiltration which are not included in solving eq 12 are calculated separately in shaw during infiltration the solute balance equation for layer k i e the node k in the numerical solution of a multi layered soil is written as 13 c k θ k c k θ k 1 δ z k f k c inf k f k 1 c inf k 1 δ z k f k c inf k f k 1 c k where θ and c are respectively soil moisture cm3 cm 3 and solute concentration mol l 1 in the layer after leaching δzk is the depth m of soil layer k fk and fk 1 are respectively the total water m into layer k and k 1 and cinf and c inf are the average solute concentration mol l 1 of water entering and leaving the layer respectively c can be solved by assuming c inf c as presented in eq 13 however in the calculation code of shaw when calculating the solute balance of layer k 1 the c inf k is recalculated as c inf k δzk c k θ k ck θk fk 1 i e the ratio of the salt loss of the layer k to the water leaving the layer k but not based on the above mentioned c inf k c k actually this misses the solute brought by infiltration water entering the layer i e the term δzk fk cinf which would result in a large overestimation of solute leaching during infiltration therefore the relevant code for the above error is thus modified in shaw sc for solute balance of k 1 layer the c inf k is corrected as 14 c inf k c k f k c inf k δ z k c k θ k δ z k θ k f k 1 note that fk and cinf k are controlled by irrigation precipitation and surface ponding water for the first layer i e k 1 2 4 new crop growth module the shaw sc incorporated a crop growth module here called crp g based on the modified epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 the crp g module could simulate the phenological development crop growth including lai crop height root depth and biomass and yield formation with effects of environmental stress xu et al 2018 the environmental stress is expressed as the factor 0 1 0 of αt αw and αs for temperature stress water stress and salinity stress respectively annex b the phenological development of the crop is based on daily heat unit accumulation with a heat unit index hui ranging from 0 at planting to 1 at physiological maturity lai is simulated as a function of heat units crop stress and crop development stages crop height is calculated as a function of maximum crop height and heat unit factor the root depth is described as a function of hui and a specific maximum depth which generally increases rapidly from planting to the maximum by early mid season biomass is estimated based on the interception of solar radiation and calculated by a beer s law equation monsi and saeki 1953 with effects of temperature water and salinity stress the fraction of total biomass partitioned to the root system normally decreases from 0 3 to 0 5 in the seedling to 0 05 to 0 20 at maturity jones 1985 the actual crop yield was finally estimated by using the harvest index hi concept the detailed calculation principles of the crp g module have been provided in annex b note that the crp g module has the main advantage that the biological process is relatively simplified but well applicable to the field issues especially for the regional scale simulation compared with some other detailed models xu et al 2018 3 model testing and application 3 1 site characteristics field experiments and observations the field experiments were conducted at an experimental site named yangchang canal command area yca located in the hetao of the upper yellow river basin northwest china 40 48 40 n 107 05 15 e 1039 m altitude the hetao has typical characteristics of semi arid to arid continental climate and seasonal soil freeze thaw being a very typical asf region the average annual rainfall and pan evaporation 20 cm pan are respectively 160 mm and 2240 mm during 1981 2009 with over 70 of the rainfall occurring between june and september xu et al 2018 soil usually starts to freeze in mid november and fully thaws after late april in hetao with frost days lasting over 200 days and maximum frozen depth of about 100 cm ren et al 2018 liu et al 2021 crop growth is almost fully dependent on irrigation water which is mainly diverted from the yellow river excessive water diversions and poor drainage caused shallow groundwater in hetao with groundwater depth gwd generally varying from 0 3 to 3 0 m this results in frequent water salt exchanges between soil water and groundwater ren et al 2016 xiao et al 2021 and further increases the complexity of the spac the dynamics and characteristics of soil water groundwater and crop growth are schematically presented in fig 1 with the effects of agricultural and irrigation activities the field experiments were conducted during two entire agr years of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 i e from october 1st 2019 to september 30th 2020 and from october 1st 2020 to september 30th 2021 sunflowers were planted at the experimental field with varieties of nh 601 and jk 361 in 2020 and 2021 respectively sunflowers were sown in late may and harvested in late september in both two agr years with the planting density of 30 300 and 28 000 plants per hectare respectively transparent plastic film was covered in late april before planting the irrigation scheduling was provided in table 1 in hetao irrigation events could be generally categorized as pre winter irrigation late october or early november pre planting irrigation late april or early may and crop season irrigation from june to august daily meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were collected from the nearby linhe weather station rainfall was registered by a tipping bucket unit using a rain gauge the monthly averages of rainfall relative humidity rh average minimum and maximum temperature tavg tmin and tmax are presented in fig 3 during the experimental years table 2 listed the soil physical properties at experimental field the particle size distribution was obtained using a laser particle size analyzer malvern ms2000 uk and the soil texture was then determined according to the usda textural classification the dry bulk density was measured by oven drying undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 field observations related to soil and crops were performed every 7 15 days with three replications a total of six soil layers were sampled to 100 cm soil depth using a soil auger the sampling thickness was 10 cm for the first and second layers and 20 cm for the below four layers gravimetric water content kg kg 1 was measured by oven drying at 105 and was converted to volumetric water content cm 3 cm 3 i e soil water content with the bulk densities soil salt content g kg 1 was determined from the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 and converted to soil salinity concentration g l 1 with the bulk densities and water content crop height was measured directly leaf area index lai was obtained from the length and maximum width of each fully unfolded leaf the dry above ground biomass d agb and dry seed yield were measured by drying at 75 to the constant mass irrigation and groundwater total dissolved solid tds were obtained using empirical relationships tds g l 1 0 69 ecw ds m 1 from the measured electrical conductivity ecw of water samples every sampling time xu et al 2013 gwd and temperatures of groundwater were measured by an automatic water level logger hobo u20 in an observation well the soil temperature was measured by a temperature record hobo s tmb with probes buried at the depth of 10 30 and 70 cm 3 2 model setup calibration and validation the canopy profile was prescribed with a maximum height of 300 cm and vertically divided into a maximum of 10 canopy layers with each layer spacing of 30 cm only the nodes below the actual height of the canopy simulated by crop module were set to be active while extra nodes will not be used during simulations meanwhile a soil profile with 300 cm depth was specified and divided into six soil horizons according to the physical properties of the soil table 2 the vertical one dimensional soil domain was then discretized into 301 nodes with a uniform spacing of 1 cm the initial conditions for the first agr year were set based on monitored and measured data for the initial soil temperature and salt profiles the temperatures and salt contents for nodes within 0 100 cm depth were equal to measured values at the corresponding depth these for nodes below the initial groundwater level gwl were set the same as the temperature and tds of groundwater and these for nodes from 100 cm to gwl were determined by linear interpolation between the related values at 100 cm depth and groundwater for the initial soil water profile it was in terms of the pressure head of each node which was determined in hydrostatic equilibrium with initial gwd xu et al 2013 the initial conditions for the second agr year were determined by using the simulated results on the last day of the first agr year the boundary conditions at the bottom of the soil profile were set as follows 1 for heat transport the third type cauchy and first type dirichlet boundary conditions were specified as the upper and lower boundary conditions respectively the upper boundary condition was driven by air temperatures and solar radiation and the lower boundary condition was specified by the temperature of bottom node which was set equal to that of groundwater 2 for water transport the upper boundary condition was the second type neumann boundary condition which was determined by evaporation and transpiration rate and precipitation and irrigation fluxes table 1 while the first type boundary condition was adopted for the lower boundary condition by specifying variable pressure head of bottom node which was defined from the observed gwd 3 for solute transport the upper boundary condition was the second type boundary condition with considering the observed tds of irrigation water the lower boundary condition was the first type boundary condition with a given salinity concentration of bottom node which was equal to the observed tds of groundwater the datasets of the first and second agr years were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively the soil hydraulic parameters and parameters related to solute transport heat transport soil evaporation surface mulch crop transpiration and crop growth were mainly calibrated for the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 the parameters θs ks θr n l and α of van genuchten mualem equation were estimated from ren et al 2016 which was conducted adjacently to the experimental site the values of τ and κ were estimated from flerchinger 1987 and shackelford and daniel 1991 for solute transport the total solute in soil solution was simply assumed to be sodium chloride nacl according to zheng et al 2021 and wang et al 2022a which found that the most active ions in the soil and groundwater are na and cl in hetao the diffusion coefficient d 0 table 3 for sodium chloride was obtained referring to flury and gimmi 2002 the parameters related to heat transport ad zm and zh and crop transpiration hc rs0 rp and rr were estimated from the recommended values of the shaw flerchinger 2017b for mulching related parameters cfmul was measured during field experiment and fmm was referred to allen et al 1998 for the crop growth related parameters used in the crp g module hmax laimax and rdmax were specified based on field observations while other parameters tl to rue dlai hi and phu were estimated from xiong et al 2019 and wang et al 2022b all the above mentioned parameters were calibrated using a trial and error method an iterative calibration approach was adopted and carried out sequentially for the processes of heat transport water flow solute transport and crop growth and yield formation the parameters related to heat transport were calibrated using observed soil temperatures at soil depths of 10 30 and 70 cm the measured soil water contents and salinity concentrations in different layers i e 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 cm were used for calibrating soil hydrological and solute transport parameters the crop growth parameters were calibrated using measured lai d agb and yield the simulated values were compared with the measured ones through the fitness performance indicator during calibration and the parameters were adjusted repeatedly until simulation accuracy was acceptable in both calibration and validation the procedure was analogous to that adopted by xu et al 2013 subsequently the shaw sc was tested with respect to its capacity to describe the soil water salt heat dynamics and crop growth in the spac system four indicators were taken to assess the performance of the model including the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r2 the detailed definitions and equations for the above indicators could be found in xu et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the comparison of simulated and measured soil temperatures water contents salinity concentrations and salt contents simulated in the different soil layers of the root zone i e 0 60 cm are presented in figs 4 6 for the calibration and validation periods meanwhile the simulated and observed crop growth indicators crop height lai and d agb are compared and shown in fig 7 the calibrated parameters related to soil heat water salt transport and crop growth are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively results showed that the shaw sc performed very well in reproducing soil temperatures during the calibration year fig 4a with rmse 2 65 nse 0 95 and r2 0 95 table 4 the model underestimated soil temperatures at 10 and 30 cm depth in january probably due to the neglect of thermal insulation of the ice or snow coverage the model also presented good performance in reproducing the total soil water contents swcs for different layers as shown in fig 5 with rmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nse 0 65 and r2 0 67 table 4 for salinity simulation the shaw sc could reasonably capture the fluctuations of salinity concentration in liquid soil water csw g l water 1 and soil salt content ssc g kg soil 1 for different soil layers both for the freeze thaw period and other periods fig 6 the goodness of fit indicators were also satisfactory for csw rmse 1 09 g l 1 nse 0 32 and r2 0 64 table 4 despite the complexity of salt transport and the measurement difficulty the simulated values at 0 20 cm depth showed relatively large uncertainty mainly due to the stronger spatial variability of salt for surface soils for crop modeling the simulated crop height lai and d agb were in good agreement with observations fig 7 with rmse values equal to 11 8 cm 0 21 and 1 13 t ha 1 respectively and r2 values greater than 0 96 table 4 the good indicators implied that the shaw sc successfully simulated crop growth processes the simulated crop yield in 2020 was 4 8 t ha 1 which was only slightly higher than the observed one 4 7 t ha 1 all calibrated parameters were used as model inputs during validation except several ones affected by field management practices saturated hydraulic conductivity in 0 20 cm layers was halved from october 2020 to april 2021 due to soil compaction effect during land leveling with large machinery in the second agr year meanwhile some crop parameters rue hmax and phu were adjusted due to the change of sunflower variety table 3 results indicated that the simulated soil temperature matched well with observations during the validation fig 4a with rmse 3 38 nse 0 88 and r2 0 92 table 4 the simulated values of swc also in agreement with the observations fig 5 producing rmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nse 0 64 and r2 0 72 table 4 meanwhile the simulated csw and ssc in most periods were reasonable enough fig 6 the goodness of fit indicators were satisfied for csw with rmse 2 44 g l 1 nse 0 83 and r2 0 56 table 4 the simulated crop height lai and d agb agreed well with the measured values rmse 9 51 cm 0 20 and 2 16 t ha 1 and r2 0 94 0 99 table 4 the simulated and observed crop yield 4 7 t ha 1 and 4 6 t ha 1 were also quite close to each other in addition the simulated development of soil freezing and thawing fronts fig 4b were almost consistent with the intuitive observations during field samplings meanwhile the front development and the variation of soil ice contents were also similar to the observations in some previous experimental studies in hetao e g wu et al 2019 wang et al 2022a it was worth noting that the shaw sc efficiently solved the problem of overestimation of salt leaching during infiltration figs 6 and a1 and thus more reasonably simulate the salt dynamics than the original shaw see the green and red lines in fig a1 in summary the general agreement between the simulated and measured data suggested that the calibrated shaw sc resulted in an adequate estimation of soil temperatures soil water and salt contents and crop indicators for both calibration and validation periods thus the model performed well and can be used for analyzing the coupled processes of heat water salt transport and sunflower growth in the case area 4 2 soil water salt dynamics and transport mechanisms according to the spac variations and influencing factors an entire agr year could be identified into five characteristic periods under sunflower cultivation pre freezing p1 soil freezing p2 soil thawing p3 pre planting p4 and crop growth p5 periods see details in table 5 during the pre freezing period p1 the continuous soil evaporation after harvest led to a gradual decrease of swc and an increase of csw for surface soil layers 0 40 cm before pre winter irrigation fig 5 field winter irrigation could effectively replenish soil moisture and caused the soil profile being almost saturated in 2019 however large pre winter irrigation 150 mm resulted in too shallow gwls at the field fig 8 a meanwhile the ssc was only decreased for the op surface layer i e 0 20 cm but increased in deeper layers e g 20 60 cm this implied that the salt leaching was inefficient due to excessive irrigation and poor drainage under current conditions the decrease of csw should be more attributed to the dilution effect of low salinity irrigation water 0 5 g l 1 in addition although no pre winter irrigation was applied at the experimental field in 2020 soil moisture could maintain relatively high in the root zone around 0 3 cm3 cm 3 and even had a slight increase for deeper soil layers this was caused by the rise of gwls as affected by regional scale irrigation fig 8b when entering the soil freezing p2 period soil liquid water started to be solidified into ice the freezing front moved downward from surface to deeper layers with maximum frozen depth reaching to 80 100 cm fig 4b soil freezing could limit the vertical drainage and help maintain high swc in upper layers meanwhile the very small water potential in frozen soils caused a large amount of water moving upward from the deeper unfrozen layers thus the swc of upper soil layers may be significantly increased in the early soil freezing period fig 5 e g increasing from 0 2 to over 0 3 cm3 cm 3 for 0 20 cm layer in the second agr year besides the swc was not changed anymore for the first agr year with field irrigation since it has been in a near saturated state before freezing the swc was almost invariable during the stable soil freezing stage for salinity simulation soil salt was excluded from ice crystals as soil was being freezing with the assumption that solutes are only present in soil solution the remaining unfrozen water was thus more concentrated resulting a significant increase for csw fig 6 salt migration became rather complicated during soil freezing process salt was diffused downward under the high concentration gradients between upper frozen layers and lower unfrozen layers and meantime it migrated upward under the convection effect the salt re distribution depended on the relative strength of the two effects with opposite directions for example in the first agr year since the downward diffusion effect was dominant fig 9 salt migrated down from an upper freezing layer to its adjacent lower unfrozen layer in sequence the ssc of a certain layer firstly increased and reached a peak and then decreased during soil profile freezing whereas the similar phenomenon was weaker in the second agr year as the upward convection partially counteracted the downward diffusion figs 6 and 9 the shaw sc quantitatively explained this complex salt migration process which was qualitatively found in some previous research e g ireson et al 2012 shafique et al 2016 wang et al 2022a during the soil thawing period p3 the frozen soil started to thaw bidirectionally due to the combined effects of increasing air temperatures and bottom geothermal heat i e downward from surface soil to deeper layers and upward from maximum frozen depth to upper layers soil was completely thawed at 70 80 cm depth fig 4b soil ice content decreased largely and meanwhile the swc of the soil profile also kept decreasing significantly due to intense evaporation after soil has been thawed figs 5 and 6 salt accumulated to the upper layers due to the combined effects of upward diffusion and upward convection figs 6 and 9 and thus the csw of upper layers was increased while with a small change for deeper layers fig 6 after the soil was fully thawed i e entering p4 and p5 the swc increased quickly after irrigation and rainfall fig 5 meanwhile the csw of upper layers decreased significantly while that of deeper layers showed small changes fig 6 irrigation provided moisture and leached salt out of root zone especially the pre planting irrigation effectively leached the salt accumulated in spring and provided a good salinity condition for seed germination for example after the first irrigation in 2021 the csw of surface layer 0 20 cm was largely reduced from about 20 to 2 g l 1 after irrigation or rainfall the swc kept decreasing due to crop evapotranspiration and salt re accumulated into the root zone note that the swc still remained above 0 3 cm3 cm 3 in most of time because of the shallowness of gwls these soil water salt dynamics were in agreement with most other research conducted in the shallow groundwater systems e g xu et al 2013 ren et al 2016 4 3 capillary rise deep percolation and evapotranspiration the accumulative amounts of water balance components in the root zone were calculated for different periods table 5 the variations of daily capillary rise and deep percolation i e the cumulative upward flux and downward flux at bottom of root zone during a day are presented in fig 8 during the pre freezing period p1 there was continuous capillary rise in both two agr years with the accumulative amount of 57 mm and 42 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively the capillary rise in 2019 was obviously stronger than that in 2020 due to much shallower water table with pre winter irrigation fig 8 the cumulative value of actual soil evaporation ea was 80 mm during 2019 half of which was the free water evaporation of ponding water fig 8a while that was only 46 mm in 2020 with no field pre winter irrigation and larger gwds averaged 1 6 m fig 8b during the soil freezing period p2 water was frozen and retained in the root zone indirectly increasing the soil water holding capacity for frozen layers in spite of a significant lowering of gwls there was very little deep percolation with only 7 mm in the first agr year even with high soil moistures and approaching zero in the second agr year fig 8 whereas the capillary rise may occur and recharge the upper frozen layer in the initial period as the freezing progresses deep soil water continuously migrated upward into the root zone until late december and the cumulative capillary rise reached to 52 mm during the second agr year with less antecedent soil moisture fig 8b however there was almost no capillary rise in the first agr year since the root zone moisture already reached a near saturation state after pre winter irrigation figs 5 and 8a results further showed that there was no water flux exchange when the soil was steadily frozen soil evaporation was inhibited due to the freezing of surface soil accumulating respectively to 60 mm 0 6 mm d 1 and 19 mm 0 2 mm d 1 for the first and second agr years and even approached zero when the surface soil was completely frozen the smaller soil evaporation in the second year was due to the lower liquid water contents of surface layers during the soil thawing period p3 the ea rate was increased significantly after the surface soil layer started to thaw varying at about 1 3 mm d 1 fig 8 the cumulative ea reached to 89 mm and 54 mm for the first and second agr years respectively there was no water flux at the bottom of root zone when root zone soil was not fully thawed capillary rise occurred after the root zone and lower adjacent layer were completely thawed but with very small amounts of 20 mm and 11 mm in the first and second agr years respectively note that in the second agr year a total of 10 mm temporary deep percolation occurred during the period from march 26th to april 1st fig 8b since the whole soil profile was just completely thawed and the moist layers at the bottom of root zone produced downward water fluxes whereas there was no downward water flux during the similar period for the first agr year as there were still ice layers below the root zone until april 15th fig 8a this difference should be mainly attributed to the colder weather and larger antecedent ice contents in the first agr year in addition the total ea over freeze thaw periods reached to 149 mm and 73 mm in the first and second agr years respectively table 5 we noted that the value 73 mm for the second agr year was closer to those measured in previous studies e g 86 mm in wu et al 2016 and 39 106 mm in liu et al 2021 mainly due to more similar gwds and soil moisture conditions during the pre planting period p4 there was intense soil evaporation due to the warm and windy weather in spring the ea rate even reached over 5 mm d 1 after irrigation fig 8 the cumulative ea reached to 123 mm average 2 4 mm d 1 and 85 mm average 1 8 mm d 1 during this period for the two years respectively significant capillary rise was observed to recharge the root zone accumulating to 94 mm and 50 mm equivalent to 76 and 58 of soil evaporation in the first and second agr years respectively table 5 whereas rapid and large deep percolation occurred after applying the pre planting irrigation i e the first irrigation reaching to 162 mm and 64 mm around 50 60 of irrigation depth the deep percolation was beneficial to leaching salt out of the upper root zone fig 6 during the crop growth period p5 deep percolation only occurred a few days after irrigation fig 8 and its cumulative values reached to 93 mm and 91 mm in the first and second agr years respectively amounting to 71 and 49 of irrigation depth table 5 this raised the groundwater table and also may result in significant waste of fertilizer due to the large deep percolation during the most of time there was continuous capillary rise for supplementing crop water consumption fig 8 with the cumulative value of about 180 mm for two agr years i e about 42 of actual crop et eta during crop season crop transpiration was the main way of soil water consumption with actual crop transpiration ta accumulating to about 349 mm in both two agr years table 5 the potential transpiration tp was larger in 2021 but also subject to more severe water salinity stress fig 8 the ea was reduced with the development of crop canopy accumulating to 73 mm and 99 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 the ratio of ea to eta during p5 was respectively 0 17 and 0 22 in the first and second agr years the values were similar to the results of some previous research e g 0 17 0 44 in sánchez et al 2014 and 0 23 in ren et al 2016 however it was found that ea eta for the entire agr year was obviously larger and reached up to 0 55 and 0 48 while the ea for non growing period accounted for 83 and 67 of that for the entire agr year 4 4 variations of salt storage in root zone the variation of salt storage in the root zone is presented in fig 9 the solute convection and diffusion as the two main factors driving salt movement played significantly different roles at each period during the pre freezing period p1 salt storage was increased by 450 g m 2 and 150 g m 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively mainly due to the upward convection of solute fig 9 solute diffusion was quite weak compared to convection note that there was almost no downward convection flux after pre winter irrigation because of the poor drainage during the soil freezing period p2 the salt migration was affected by both the downward diffusion and upward convection as mentioned before fig 9 at first the upward convection could result in an increase in salt storage during the early period when the upper root zone was in the freezing process then salt storage showed a significant decreasing trend as the freezing front moved down to the bottom of the root zone since the downward diffusion became dominant due to the large salinity concentration gradients after the root zone was completely frozen salt storage was nearly invariable or slightly decreased in both two agr years finally salt storage was decreased by 300 g m 2 and 45 g m 2 during the freezing period for the first and second agr years respectively a similar phenomenon of decline in salt storage during soil freezing was also observed and reported by wang et al 2022a about 9 27 decline the salt storage in the root zone may increase or decrease but with relatively small changes during the soil thawing period p3 affected by soil evaporation and deep percolation fig 9 salt flux was firstly dominated by the upward diffusion and then by the upward convection after thawing a lot which was partially affected by the soil thawing rate salt may more accumulate to the upper soil layers if the soil below the root zone was still in frozen state e g in 2020 whereas there may be downward solute convection with deep percolation when the lower frozen soil of the root zone thawed quickly e g in 2021 fig 9 for our experimental years the salt storage was increased by 100 g m 2 and decreased by 50 g m 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively during the pre planting period p4 salt largely accumulated into the root zone due to the intense surface evaporation while it was dramatically leached out by the subsequent pre planting irrigation fig 9 for example in 2020 salt storage was increased by 250 g m 2 from april 1st to may 20th and subsequently reduced by 420 g m 2 after the irrigation on may 21st that indicated the significant effect of the pre planting irrigation on promoting a good soil salinity condition for planting and seedling growth in addition too early pre planting irrigation may lead to over re accumulation of salt in the root zone and thus supplemental irrigation for salt leaching such as that in 2021 during the crop growth period p5 salt storage showed an obvious and rapid decrease after irrigation and then had an increasing trend during the irrigation interval fig 9 simulation indicated that convection was the main way for salt migration during the period salt storage was increased by 350 g m 2 and 550 g m 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively due to larger amount of capillary rise than that of deep percolation overall salt storage was increased from 900 to 1810 g m 2 i e with an increase of 1 0 to 2 0 g kg 1 for ssc for the root zone during the two agr years 4 5 crop growth and water use management fig 10 presented the daily factors of temperature stress and water salinity stress for crop growth as well as the proportion of water stress and salinity stress to water salinity stress water salinity stress reflected the actual soil water and salinity conditions and thus the operation level of farmland irrigation and drainage the crop yield under no water salinity stress was considered as the potential yield i e climatic yield in this study results showed that crop growth was susceptible to being affected by temperature stress only during the early or late stage with relatively low air temperatures fig 10 in other stages water salinity stress became the dominant limiting factor on crop growth but showed quite differences between years in 2020 the crop was just slightly affected by water salinity stress with sufficient water supply with an average value of αws equal to 0 89 over the growth period fig 10a even after the last irrigation july 20th the water salinity stress especially the water stress was still mild whereas the water salinity stress was much more severe during the season of 2021 with an average αws of 0 77 fig 10b the worse water salt conditions were mainly caused by less irrigation and rainfall as well as less capillary rise under deeper gwls in particular the αws reduced to 0 70 from the last irrigation july 19th to harvest during which the salinity stress averagely accounted for over 60 of the water salinity stress as a result the actual crop yield was 4 8 t ha 1 and 4 7 t ha 1 respectively for 2020 and 2021 which was quite close despite with higher potential yield in 2021 more significantly the quantitative analyses over an entire agr year could reveal some other meaningful issues in agricultural water use and soil salinity control in the case study area of hetao particularly involving the soil freeze thaw process and its effects compared with the previous studies e g pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 ren et al 2016 the practice of applying pre winter irrigation required good field drainage conditions to timely drain out the leached salt for shallow water table areas otherwise the irrigation water and leached salt cannot be drained in time before soil freezing thus reducing the salt leaching effect whereas inadequate or no pre winter irrigation may lead to too high soil salinity in the following crop growth season actually this should be even more critical for other crops sown in early or mid spring e g spring wheat and spring maize it was worth noting that pre winter irrigation should not be applied too late to approach winter besides the effects of soil freezing the freezing of water in the ditches may reduce the drainage efficiency and thus weaken the salt leaching effect since the air temperature had dropped below zero in late october in addition the pre planting irrigation could effectively leach out the salt accumulating in the spring season however too early pre planting irrigation required extra irrigation for salt leaching and reduced water use efficiency moreover it should be noticed that excessive irrigation during non growing periods resulted in large but non beneficial soil evaporation the ea for non growing periods accounted for over 65 of that for the entire agr year in this study some treatments including surface mulching straw incorporation and improved conservation tillage could be adopted for preserving soil moisture and reducing salt accumulation 5 summary and conclusion in this paper we proposed an improved spac model shaw sc and realized a continuous coupled simulation of heat water salt transport and crop growth processes over an agricultural year agr year for arid seasonally frozen asf regions the following modifications were carried out in shaw sc on the basis of the latest shaw version 3 0 1 incorporating a new epic crop growth module for simulating the crop dynamics 2 correcting the calculation issues related to solute leaching and solute lower boundary conditions and 3 considering the effects of surface mulch and salinity osmotic stress for reasonably simulating soil evaporation root water uptake and crop transpiration the shaw sc was then applied and tested with experimental data of two entire agr years including crop growth season and soil freeze thaw period at the sunflower field in northwest china results indicated that the model presented good performance in simulating the soil water and salt contents soil temperatures and crop growth indicators over two entire agr years in particular the reasonable simulation of salt migration and crop dynamics showed the enhanced capability of shaw sc for crop season compared with the original shaw model application indicated that the improvements made the shaw sc have better simulation and prediction abilities in agro ecosystem modeling for asf regions quantitative analyses of agroecosystem processes and water use were conducted with identifying five different periods i e pre freezing soil freezing soil thawing pre planting and crop growth periods during the soil freezing period soil freezing from the surface to deeper layers caused soil water to move upward and significantly inhibit the soil evaporation salt firstly migrated upward with water in convection whereas downward salt diffusion occurred and became dominant as the freezing front reached the bottom of root zone resulting in the decrease of salt storage for the main root zone i e 0 60 cm depth during the soil thawing period the frozen soil was thawed bidirectionally and soil evaporation rate increased significantly after soil thawing water and salt moved upward after the fully thawing of root zone and the main way for salt upward migration was diffusion before the thawing of soil below the root zone and then convection after that there was also temporary deep percolation and downward salt convection when the root zone was just fully thawed with a faster thawing rate during other periods capillary rise continued to recharge the root zone and supply for evaporation transpiration while deep percolation occurred only few days after irrigation furthermore water use analysis indicated that the pre winter irrigation required good field drainage conditions to leach salt away and inadequate or no pre winter irrigation resulted in too high soil salinity for the following year pre planting irrigation can effectively leach the salt accumulated in spring but too early pre planting irrigation reduced water use efficiency moreover excessive irrigation during the non growing periods led to massive but non beneficial soil evaporation with total evaporation for non growing periods accounting for over 67 of that for the entire agr year in this case study in summary the study presented the shaw sc as an efficient tool for modelling the coupled processes of heat water salt and crop growth in asf regions it significantly expended the model abilities of current spac models and realized the dynamic simulation of spac system on an entire agr year scale for asf regions the quantitative and comprehensive analysis of the agroecosystem processes provided some new insights on supporting water use management and salinity control which may also be very useful for other irrigated areas in asf regions moreover our follow up modeling work will focus more on the model parameterization simulation function extension and best management practices on agricultural water use and agronomic practices credit authorship contribution

2696,the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac that is a dynamic interactive and coupled system is particularly complicated in arid seasonally frozen regions asf regions with the effects of soil freeze thaw process and salinity a quantitative understanding of heat water salt transport and crop growth in the spac over an entire agricultural year agr year is an importance of promoting best practices for water use and crop production in this paper an improved coupled spac model shaw sc is presented and applied for continuously simulating the spac system of asf regions over an agr year the model is developed based on modifying the shaw model version 3 0 and incorporating the epic crop growth module the main new features of the shaw sc include extending the model capability for canopy growth and yield formation improving the description of soil solute transport in the shallow groundwater systems and providing functions to describe the effects of surface mulching on soil evaporation and salinity stress on crop growth and transpiration model testing and application were conducted with two agr year data at the sunflower experimental field in irrigated areas of the upper yellow river basin northwest china with an arid and cold climate simulations of soil water content temperature and crop growth indicators fitted well with the observations both in calibration and validation with nse 0 64 and sufficiently small rmse meanwhile simulation of salinity concentration was also satisfactory nse 0 32 and 0 83 rmse 1 09 and 2 44 g l 1 despite the complexity of salt transport and the measurement difficulty in addition the comparison with previous experimental results also showed the reasonability of modeling results then a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the spac dynamics was conducted over an agr year with identifying five characteristic periods i e pre freezing soil freezing soil thawing pre planting and crop growth periods results provided a fuller understanding of the characteristics of water salt dynamics and balance components and the related issues of crop stress water use and salinity control on an entire agr year scale model testing and application proved that the proposed shaw sc was an efficient tool to simulate coupled processes of heat water salt transport and crop growth for asf regions and as well an enhancement of current spac models for practical field applications keywords soil water and salt heat transport soil freeze thaw process shaw epic crop growth module spac system data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in many arid regions irrigated agricultural production usually faces two significant issues crop water deficit due to inadequate irrigation water supply and irrigation induced soil salinization caused by excessive irrigation shao et al 2009 xu et al 2010 assouline et al 2015 a good understanding of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system and its dynamics is of crucial importance for efficient agricultural management xu et al 2013 bodner et al 2015 in general the spac system is an integrated and dynamic system in which mass water and solute and energy heat transfer occur with very complicated interactions philip 1966 hillel 1998 molz and faybishenko 2013 porporato et al 2015 trautz et al 2017 in particular the spac system becomes more complicated in arid seasonally frozen asf regions where the salinity and the soil freeze thaw process may also greatly affect the system dynamics it is well known that salinity is one of the main factors in limiting plant evapotranspiration et and growth panta et al 2014 zorb et al 2019 meanwhile soil freeze thaw process has a large impact on the mass and energy exchanges among the atmosphere crop soil and groundwater during the winter season alkhaier et al 2012 ireson et al 2012 cui et al 2020 kelleners 2020 it significantly changes the re distribution of soil water temperature and salt thus affecting the emergence and seedling growth in the next spring season in addition the soil freeze thaw process may have larger effects on the efficiency of salt leaching and moisture preservation for regions with a tradition of applying the pre winter irrigation after crop harvest e g in arid regions of inland asia xu et al 2010 wu et al 2019 therefore a full and quantitative understanding of the spac system in an entire agricultural year agr year including both crop growth season and frost period is quite necessary for promoting rational water use and crop production for agroecosystems field experiment is the basis to understand the spac of the agroecosystem while it is costly laborious and time consuming ren et al 2016 alternatively scientists from different disciplines have developed many mathematical models to simulate the spac and its responses to ambient environmental changes e g hydrus swap ahc apsim dssat shaw coupmodel etc šimůnek et al 2008 van dam et al 1997 xu et al 2018 keating et al 2003 jones et al 2003 flerchinger and saxton 1989 jansson and karlberg 2004 more comprehensive and systematic analyses could be conducted with a combined use of the spac model and experimental data in general the existing spac models have varying degrees of sophistication and different functionality monteith 1996 kucharik 2003 xu et al 2018 a model which can be well used for spac simulation in arid regions is usually required to have the ability to describe the soil water salt heat crop processes many simulation models have achieved good performance and various applications in agricultural and environmental fields in arid regions kumar et al 2015 mubeen et al 2020 wang et al 2022b however most of these spac models primarily focus on simulating the spac system for non frost seasons i e covering crop growth seasons being lack of describing the soil freeze thaw processes some models have applied physically rigorous approaches for modeling flow processes in frozen soils based on fully coupled water and heat transport including shaw coupmodel and a modified hydrus hansson et al 2004 to our knowledge very few released models e g shaw and coupmodel include clear coupling mechanisms of water solute heat transport for frozen soils and have practical use in the agroecosystem of asf regions kahimba et al 2009 wu et al 2011 wu et al 2019 lu et al 2019 in addition the coupmodel has a crop growth module but adopts a very simplified balance based solute model only considering solute convection but neglecting solute diffusion wu et al 2019 in contrast the shaw applies a more mechanistic solute module based on solving the advection dispersion equation however the formally released version does not simulate the crop growth but requires the input of known canopy information note that some modification works have been carried out to couple the shaw with crop growth modules or crop models for example rzwqm shaw is developed to simulate crop root growth and it was used to estimate overwinter soil moisture and temperature flerchinger et al 2000 li et al 2012 a coupled model of shaw and wofost is proposed and well used to simulate the actual effect of soil water stress on crop transpiration and describe the interactions of energy and water in the agroecosystem li et al 2013 however the above shaw modifications focus more on the interactions of water heat transfer and crop growth while few studies take salt transport into account lu et al 2019 besides the shaw also has some unique features of its own especially including the simultaneous simulation of water vapor and heat transfer in surface residues and within multiple layers of plant canopy flerchinger et al 1998 thus it is attractive to further improve a spac model to describe the interactions of heat water salt crop in asf regions over an entire agr year particularly based on the good framework of shaw therefore the main objective of this paper is to enhance and extend the spac model for simulating the coupled processes of heat water salt transport and crop growth over an entire agr year in asf regions the original shaw is thus significantly modified by improving the components of soil water and solute transport and plant growth the modifications mainly involve 1 embedding a new crop growth model i e epic crop growth module with moderate input data demand 2 improving the calculation approaches for root water uptake soil evaporation and plant transpiration as well as water salinity stress and 3 modifying the solute module for reasonably describing the salt migration particularly salt leaching during the infiltration process the improved coupled model hereafter called shaw sc is tested with sunflower field experiments over two entire agr years in hetao irrigation district hetao of the arid upper yellow river basin after that the dynamic processes of soil heat water salt transfer and crop growth and interactions are systematically analyzed for the spac and water use performance is conducted on a scale of entire agr year 2 detailed description of shaw sc and the related modifications the simultaneous heat and water shaw model that is developed by flerchinger and saxton 1989 simultaneously simulates the heat water and solute transfer with considering the effects of plant cover residue and snow the physical system described by the shaw consists of a vertical one dimensional 1 d profile extending from the plant canopy including canopy leaves and air snow residue or soil surface to a specified depth within the soil fig 1 heat water solute fluxes within the 1 d system profile are described by a series of continuous partial differential equations which are solved by the finite differential method infiltration flux is calculated separately using a green ampt approach for a multi layered soil meantime solute leaching and energy transfer are subsequently calculated by a balance method based on the above infiltration flux the shaw provides a detailed mechanistic description of soil freezing and thawing besides it uses a sophisticated approach to calculate transpiration and water vapor transfer through a plant canopy flerchinger et al 1996 1998 although it does not simulate plant growth process more detailed theoretical description of shaw can be found in flerchinger 1987 and flerchinger 2017a the simultaneous heat water salt and crop shaw sc model being a modified version of shaw is proposed with a focus on improving the simulation abilities of water salt transport and crop growth in asf regions the main calculation flow chart is presented in fig 2 system profile compositions and site parameters are initialized at the beginning of the program absorbed shortwave radiation are first calculated and assumed constant over the hour then heat water and solute transport in the system profile is simulated with given boundary conditions on the basis of hourly time step the hourly time step may be divided into smaller time steps for convergence in iterative solutions subsequently further adjustments are made for precipitation snowmelt interception and infiltration to update the heat water solute balance and profile information at end of each hour at the end of each day the daily water salinity stress is to be calculated by integrating the hourly soil information after that the crop growth and biomass are simulated based on a daily time step this calculation process is repeated until the end of the simulation period the modifications are carried out based on the latest shaw model of version 3 0 mainly involving 1 embedding a new epic crop growth module to simulate canopy growth and yield formation 2 adapting the lower boundary of solute transport to reasonably capture actual salt exchange between soil water and shallow groundwater 3 correcting the existing errors in solute leaching calculation during irrigation precipitation infiltration and 4 improving the soil evaporation calculation with including the surface mulch effects and crop transpiration calculation with considering the salinity osmotic stress the main principles of shaw and the detailed modifications are described in the following sections 2 1 heat transport within canopy and soil for heat and water transport within canopy layers thermal and vapor fluxes are exchanged between the air space while transpiration and heat dissipation of leaves are regarded as source terms into canopy air space in the shaw heat flux and temperature within the air space of the canopy are described by 1

of eq 1 the actual placement of the highest node at any given time will equal the actual canopy height that is dynamically changed with plant development the state equation for temperature distribution in the soil profile considering convective heat transfer by liquid and latent heat transfer by vapor for a layer of freezing soil is given by 2 c s t t ρ i l f θ i t z k s t z ρ l c l q l

within the soil at subfreezing soil temperatures soil liquid water exists in equilibrium with ice due to matric and osmotic potentials the relation between liquid content and temperature is given by the freezing point depression equation fuchs et al 1978 3 ϕ π h l f g t t k where φ π and h are respectively soil total water potential soil water osmotic potential and soil matric potential i e soil

universal gas constant π is calculated as the sum of the osmotic potential of each ionic species with the determined osmotic potential soil temperature defines the matric potential and therefore the liquid water content 2 2 water transport within canopy and soil 2 2 1 water flux between layers vapor flux through the canopy is written similarly to the canopy heat flux equation 5 ρ v t z k e ρ v z

rainfall snowmelt and ponded water are infiltrated into the soil at the end of each time step and the infiltration flux is calculated using a green ampt approach for a multi layered soil solving eq 6 requires knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties and three options are available in shaw to describe the soil moisture release curve and k h curve including the campbell functions campbell 1974 the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1966 and the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 in addition hydraulic conductivity is reduced linearly with ice content assuming zero conductivity at an available porosity of 0 13 bloomsburg and wang 1969 2 2 2 evaporation evaporation is calculated through the transfer of water vapor from the exchange surface to the atmosphere as follows 7 e ρ vs ρ va r v where ρvs and ρva are vapor density kg m 3 of the exchange surface and air respectively and rv is the resistance value for vapor transfer s m 1 in this paper the modification and treatment are proposed for the shaw sc 1 the term soil evaporation esl is newly defined and calculated as the vapor flux between soil surface layer and canopy bottom layer when canopy exists 2 surface mulching is an important agricultural practice in arid cold regions for reducing soil evaporation and maintaining soil temperature the effects of surface mulching are thus introduced and described by two factors i e the fraction of soil surface covered by mulch cfmul and the adjusted factor of mulch material fmm soil evaporation and surface latent heat are adjusted by a mulching reduction coefficient kr mul 8 k r m u l 1 c f mul f mm where cfmul varies from 0 to 100 and fmm varies between 0 5 for mulches of plant material and is close to 1 0 for plastic mulches xu et al 2018

the soil root xylem leaf system the plant transpiration is calculated as 9 t a k 1 ns h k h x r r k i 1 nc h x h l i r l i i 1 nc ρ vsto i ρ va i r s i r v i l ai i where ns and nc are the number of

stomatal resistance per unit of lai s m 1 and rv is the resistance to convective transfer s m 1 from the leaves the stomatal resistance is computed considering the function of leaf water potential and meteorological influences as follows 10 r s r s 0 1 h l h c n f t f st f vpd where rs0 is stomatal resistance with no stress s m 1 hc is a critical leaf water potential m at which stomatal resistance is twice its minimum value n is an empirical exponent and fst ft and fvpd are stomatal restriction factors for ambient solar radiation temperature and vapor pressure deficit respectively functions for fst and ft follow a jarvis stewart approach jarvis 1976 stewart 1988 note that the transpiration calculation in shaw only considers the water stress caused by soil matric potential h see eq 9 the modification in shaw sc is mainly related to the salinity stress that may largely affect root water uptake and thus restrict crop growth uptake reduction due to a combination of water and salinity stresses could be modeled by assuming that stresses are somehow additive or multiplicative van genuchten 1987 skaggs et al 2006 in shaw sc the effect of osmotic potential on root water uptake is considered to be additive to the soil matric potential for computer program implementation hence we use h i e the sum of soil matric potential and osmotic potential to replace the h in eq 9 for calculating water salinity stress since the additivity has been inferred from a number of laboratory and field experiments skaggs et al 2006 in addition a new term potential transpiration tp is introduced to calculate the water salinity stress factor αws that is required in the crop growth module tp is calculated with the stomatal resistance under no water salinity stress rscl as follows 11 t p i 1 nc ρ vsto i ρ va i r scl i r v i l a i i i 1 nc ρ vsto i ρ va i r s 0 i f t f st f vpd r v i l ai i where rscl is stomatal resistance affected by ambient climatic conditions but with no water salinity stress the ratio of ta tp is considered as the water salinity stress factor αws in restricting crop transpiration and growth in addition the proportions of water and salinity stress can also be obtained based on the relative value of matric and osmotic potentials 2 3 solute transport within soil 2 3 1 solute flux between layers the shaw considers three processes of solute transfer molecular diffusion convection and hydrodynamic dispersion the solute transport equation is written as 12 ρ b s t ρ l z d h d m c z ρ l q l c z where ρb is soil bulk density kg m 3 s is total salt content g kg 1 dh and dm are the hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 respectively and ql is liquid water flux m s 1 this equation is used to simulate the transport of multiple ionic species in shaw some specific treatment and modification in shaw sc are as follows for salinity simulation the total solute in soil solution is treated as an ideal and single solute species without distinguishing various ionic species in the original shaw the lower boundary condition for eq 12 is set as cn t cn 1 t which means that solute concentration of soil bottom node n always equals to that of soil node n 1 this assumption may be not reasonable for shallow groundwater system where water and solute may exchange frequently between soil and aquifer solute concentration at bottom node is variable and affected by both soil water and groundwater dynamics the bottom of soil model domain is often set below the groundwater table xu et al 2013 therefore an additional lower boundary condition is provided in shaw sc i e the dirichlet boundary condition with cn t cgw t cgw is the observed solute concentration of the groundwater the detail treatment for this new lower boundary condition can be found in annex a 2 3 2 solute leaching upon infiltration the solute transport and leaching upon infiltration which are not included in solving eq 12 are calculated separately in shaw during infiltration the solute balance equation for layer k i e the node k in the numerical solution of a multi layered soil is written as 13 c k θ k c k θ k 1 δ z k f k c inf k f k 1 c inf k 1 δ z k f k c inf k f k 1 c k where θ and c are respectively soil moisture cm3 cm 3 and solute concentration mol l 1 in the layer after leaching δzk is the depth m of soil layer k fk and fk 1 are respectively the total water m into layer k and k 1 and cinf and c inf are the average solute concentration mol l 1 of water entering and leaving the layer respectively c can be solved by assuming c inf c as presented in eq 13 however in the calculation code of shaw when calculating the solute balance of layer k 1 the c inf k is recalculated as c inf k δzk c k θ k ck θk fk 1 i e the ratio of the salt loss of the layer k to the water leaving the layer k but not based on the above mentioned c inf k c k actually this misses the solute brought by infiltration water entering the layer i e the term δzk fk cinf which would result in a large overestimation of solute leaching during infiltration therefore the relevant code for the above error is thus modified in shaw sc for solute balance of k 1 layer the c inf k is corrected as 14 c inf k c k f k c inf k δ z k c k θ k δ z k θ k f k 1 note that fk and cinf k are controlled by irrigation precipitation and surface ponding water for the first layer i e k 1 2 4 new crop growth module the shaw sc incorporated a crop growth module here called crp g based on the modified epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 the crp g module could simulate the phenological development crop growth including lai crop height root depth and biomass and yield formation with effects of environmental stress xu et al 2018 the environmental stress is expressed as the factor 0 1 0 of αt αw and αs for temperature stress water stress and salinity stress respectively annex b the phenological development of the crop is based on daily heat unit accumulation with a heat unit index hui ranging from 0 at planting to 1 at physiological maturity lai is simulated as a function of heat units crop stress and crop development stages crop height is calculated as a function of maximum crop height and heat unit factor the root depth is described as a function of hui and a specific maximum depth which generally increases rapidly from planting to the maximum by early mid season biomass is estimated based on the interception of solar radiation and calculated by a beer s law equation monsi and saeki 1953 with effects of temperature water and salinity stress the fraction of total biomass partitioned to the root system normally decreases from 0 3 to 0 5 in the seedling to 0 05 to 0 20 at maturity jones 1985 the actual crop yield was finally estimated by using the harvest index hi concept the detailed calculation principles of the crp g module have been provided in annex b note that the crp g module has the main advantage that the biological process is relatively simplified but well applicable to the field issues especially for the regional scale simulation compared with some other detailed models xu et al 2018 3 model testing and application 3 1 site characteristics field experiments and observations the field experiments were conducted at an experimental site named yangchang canal command area yca located in the hetao of the upper yellow river basin northwest china 40 48 40 n 107 05 15 e 1039 m altitude the hetao has typical characteristics of semi arid to arid continental climate and seasonal soil freeze thaw being a very typical asf region the average annual rainfall and pan evaporation 20 cm pan are respectively 160 mm and 2240 mm during 1981 2009 with over 70 of the rainfall occurring between june and september xu et al 2018 soil usually starts to freeze in mid november and fully thaws after late april in hetao with frost days lasting over 200 days and maximum frozen depth of about 100 cm ren et al 2018 liu et al 2021 crop growth is almost fully dependent on irrigation water which is mainly diverted from the yellow river excessive water diversions and poor drainage caused shallow groundwater in hetao with groundwater depth gwd generally varying from 0 3 to 3 0 m this results in frequent water salt exchanges between soil water and groundwater ren et al 2016 xiao et al 2021 and further increases the complexity of the spac the dynamics and characteristics of soil water groundwater and crop growth are schematically presented in fig 1 with the effects of agricultural and irrigation activities the field experiments were conducted during two entire agr years of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 i e from october 1st 2019 to september 30th 2020 and from october 1st 2020 to september 30th 2021 sunflowers were planted at the experimental field with varieties of nh 601 and jk 361 in 2020 and 2021 respectively sunflowers were sown in late may and harvested in late september in both two agr years with the planting density of 30 300 and 28 000 plants per hectare respectively transparent plastic film was covered in late april before planting the irrigation scheduling was provided in table 1 in hetao irrigation events could be generally categorized as pre winter irrigation late october or early november pre planting irrigation late april or early may and crop season irrigation from june to august daily meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were collected from the nearby linhe weather station rainfall was registered by a tipping bucket unit using a rain gauge the monthly averages of rainfall relative humidity rh average minimum and maximum temperature tavg tmin and tmax are presented in fig 3 during the experimental years table 2 listed the soil physical properties at experimental field the particle size distribution was obtained using a laser particle size analyzer malvern ms2000 uk and the soil texture was then determined according to the usda textural classification the dry bulk density was measured by oven drying undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 field observations related to soil and crops were performed every 7 15 days with three replications a total of six soil layers were sampled to 100 cm soil depth using a soil auger the sampling thickness was 10 cm for the first and second layers and 20 cm for the below four layers gravimetric water content kg kg 1 was measured by oven drying at 105 and was converted to volumetric water content cm 3 cm 3 i e soil water content with the bulk densities soil salt content g kg 1 was determined from the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 and converted to soil salinity concentration g l 1 with the bulk densities and water content crop height was measured directly leaf area index lai was obtained from the length and maximum width of each fully unfolded leaf the dry above ground biomass d agb and dry seed yield were measured by drying at 75 to the constant mass irrigation and groundwater total dissolved solid tds were obtained using empirical relationships tds g l 1 0 69 ecw ds m 1 from the measured electrical conductivity ecw of water samples every sampling time xu et al 2013 gwd and temperatures of groundwater were measured by an automatic water level logger hobo u20 in an observation well the soil temperature was measured by a temperature record hobo s tmb with probes buried at the depth of 10 30 and 70 cm 3 2 model setup calibration and validation the canopy profile was prescribed with a maximum height of 300 cm and vertically divided into a maximum of 10 canopy layers with each layer spacing of 30 cm only the nodes below the actual height of the canopy simulated by crop module were set to be active while extra nodes will not be used during simulations meanwhile a soil profile with 300 cm depth was specified and divided into six soil horizons according to the physical properties of the soil table 2 the vertical one dimensional soil domain was then discretized into 301 nodes with a uniform spacing of 1 cm the initial conditions for the first agr year were set based on monitored and measured data for the initial soil temperature and salt profiles the temperatures and salt contents for nodes within 0 100 cm depth were equal to measured values at the corresponding depth these for nodes below the initial groundwater level gwl were set the same as the temperature and tds of groundwater and these for nodes from 100 cm to gwl were determined by linear interpolation between the related values at 100 cm depth and groundwater for the initial soil water profile it was in terms of the pressure head of each node which was determined in hydrostatic equilibrium with initial gwd xu et al 2013 the initial conditions for the second agr year were determined by using the simulated results on the last day of the first agr year the boundary conditions at the bottom of the soil profile were set as follows 1 for heat transport the third type cauchy and first type dirichlet boundary conditions were specified as the upper and lower boundary conditions respectively the upper boundary condition was driven by air temperatures and solar radiation and the lower boundary condition was specified by the temperature of bottom node which was set equal to that of groundwater 2 for water transport the upper boundary condition was the second type neumann boundary condition which was determined by evaporation and transpiration rate and precipitation and irrigation fluxes table 1 while the first type boundary condition was adopted for the lower boundary condition by specifying variable pressure head of bottom node which was defined from the observed gwd 3 for solute transport the upper boundary condition was the second type boundary condition with considering the observed tds of irrigation water the lower boundary condition was the first type boundary condition with a given salinity concentration of bottom node which was equal to the observed tds of groundwater the datasets of the first and second agr years were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively the soil hydraulic parameters and parameters related to solute transport heat transport soil evaporation surface mulch crop transpiration and crop growth were mainly calibrated for the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 the parameters θs ks θr n l and α of van genuchten mualem equation were estimated from ren et al 2016 which was conducted adjacently to the experimental site the values of τ and κ were estimated from flerchinger 1987 and shackelford and daniel 1991 for solute transport the total solute in soil solution was simply assumed to be sodium chloride nacl according to zheng et al 2021 and wang et al 2022a which found that the most active ions in the soil and groundwater are na and cl in hetao the diffusion coefficient d 0 table 3 for sodium chloride was obtained referring to flury and gimmi 2002 the parameters related to heat transport ad zm and zh and crop transpiration hc rs0 rp and rr were estimated from the recommended values of the shaw flerchinger 2017b for mulching related parameters cfmul was measured during field experiment and fmm was referred to allen et al 1998 for the crop growth related parameters used in the crp g module hmax laimax and rdmax were specified based on field observations while other parameters tl to rue dlai hi and phu were estimated from xiong et al 2019 and wang et al 2022b all the above mentioned parameters were calibrated using a trial and error method an iterative calibration approach was adopted and carried out sequentially for the processes of heat transport water flow solute transport and crop growth and yield formation the parameters related to heat transport were calibrated using observed soil temperatures at soil depths of 10 30 and 70 cm the measured soil water contents and salinity concentrations in different layers i e 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 cm were used for calibrating soil hydrological and solute transport parameters the crop growth parameters were calibrated using measured lai d agb and yield the simulated values were compared with the measured ones through the fitness performance indicator during calibration and the parameters were adjusted repeatedly until simulation accuracy was acceptable in both calibration and validation the procedure was analogous to that adopted by xu et al 2013 subsequently the shaw sc was tested with respect to its capacity to describe the soil water salt heat dynamics and crop growth in the spac system four indicators were taken to assess the performance of the model including the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r2 the detailed definitions and equations for the above indicators could be found in xu et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the comparison of simulated and measured soil temperatures water contents salinity concentrations and salt contents simulated in the different soil layers of the root zone i e 0 60 cm are presented in figs 4 6 for the calibration and validation periods meanwhile the simulated and observed crop growth indicators crop height lai and d agb are compared and shown in fig 7 the calibrated parameters related to soil heat water salt transport and crop growth are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively results showed that the shaw sc performed very well in reproducing soil temperatures during the calibration year fig 4a with rmse 2 65 nse 0 95 and r2 0 95 table 4 the model underestimated soil temperatures at 10 and 30 cm depth in january probably due to the neglect of thermal insulation of the ice or snow coverage the model also presented good performance in reproducing the total soil water contents swcs for different layers as shown in fig 5 with rmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nse 0 65 and r2 0 67 table 4 for salinity simulation the shaw sc could reasonably capture the fluctuations of salinity concentration in liquid soil water csw g l water 1 and soil salt content ssc g kg soil 1 for different soil layers both for the freeze thaw period and other periods fig 6 the goodness of fit indicators were also satisfactory for csw rmse 1 09 g l 1 nse 0 32 and r2 0 64 table 4 despite the complexity of salt transport and the measurement difficulty the simulated values at 0 20 cm depth showed relatively large uncertainty mainly due to the stronger spatial variability of salt for surface soils for crop modeling the simulated crop height lai and d agb were in good agreement with observations fig 7 with rmse values equal to 11 8 cm 0 21 and 1 13 t ha 1 respectively and r2 values greater than 0 96 table 4 the good indicators implied that the shaw sc successfully simulated crop growth processes the simulated crop yield in 2020 was 4 8 t ha 1 which was only slightly higher than the observed one 4 7 t ha 1 all calibrated parameters were used as model inputs during validation except several ones affected by field management practices saturated hydraulic conductivity in 0 20 cm layers was halved from october 2020 to april 2021 due to soil compaction effect during land leveling with large machinery in the second agr year meanwhile some crop parameters rue hmax and phu were adjusted due to the change of sunflower variety table 3 results indicated that the simulated soil temperature matched well with observations during the validation fig 4a with rmse 3 38 nse 0 88 and r2 0 92 table 4 the simulated values of swc also in agreement with the observations fig 5 producing rmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 nse 0 64 and r2 0 72 table 4 meanwhile the simulated csw and ssc in most periods were reasonable enough fig 6 the goodness of fit indicators were satisfied for csw with rmse 2 44 g l 1 nse 0 83 and r2 0 56 table 4 the simulated crop height lai and d agb agreed well with the measured values rmse 9 51 cm 0 20 and 2 16 t ha 1 and r2 0 94 0 99 table 4 the simulated and observed crop yield 4 7 t ha 1 and 4 6 t ha 1 were also quite close to each other in addition the simulated development of soil freezing and thawing fronts fig 4b were almost consistent with the intuitive observations during field samplings meanwhile the front development and the variation of soil ice contents were also similar to the observations in some previous experimental studies in hetao e g wu et al 2019 wang et al 2022a it was worth noting that the shaw sc efficiently solved the problem of overestimation of salt leaching during infiltration figs 6 and a1 and thus more reasonably simulate the salt dynamics than the original shaw see the green and red lines in fig a1 in summary the general agreement between the simulated and measured data suggested that the calibrated shaw sc resulted in an adequate estimation of soil temperatures soil water and salt contents and crop indicators for both calibration and validation periods thus the model performed well and can be used for analyzing the coupled processes of heat water salt transport and sunflower growth in the case area 4 2 soil water salt dynamics and transport mechanisms according to the spac variations and influencing factors an entire agr year could be identified into five characteristic periods under sunflower cultivation pre freezing p1 soil freezing p2 soil thawing p3 pre planting p4 and crop growth p5 periods see details in table 5 during the pre freezing period p1 the continuous soil evaporation after harvest led to a gradual decrease of swc and an increase of csw for surface soil layers 0 40 cm before pre winter irrigation fig 5 field winter irrigation could effectively replenish soil moisture and caused the soil profile being almost saturated in 2019 however large pre winter irrigation 150 mm resulted in too shallow gwls at the field fig 8 a meanwhile the ssc was only decreased for the op surface layer i e 0 20 cm but increased in deeper layers e g 20 60 cm this implied that the salt leaching was inefficient due to excessive irrigation and poor drainage under current conditions the decrease of csw should be more attributed to the dilution effect of low salinity irrigation water 0 5 g l 1 in addition although no pre winter irrigation was applied at the experimental field in 2020 soil moisture could maintain relatively high in the root zone around 0 3 cm3 cm 3 and even had a slight increase for deeper soil layers this was caused by the rise of gwls as affected by regional scale irrigation fig 8b when entering the soil freezing p2 period soil liquid water started to be solidified into ice the freezing front moved downward from surface to deeper layers with maximum frozen depth reaching to 80 100 cm fig 4b soil freezing could limit the vertical drainage and help maintain high swc in upper layers meanwhile the very small water potential in frozen soils caused a large amount of water moving upward from the deeper unfrozen layers thus the swc of upper soil layers may be significantly increased in the early soil freezing period fig 5 e g increasing from 0 2 to over 0 3 cm3 cm 3 for 0 20 cm layer in the second agr year besides the swc was not changed anymore for the first agr year with field irrigation since it has been in a near saturated state before freezing the swc was almost invariable during the stable soil freezing stage for salinity simulation soil salt was excluded from ice crystals as soil was being freezing with the assumption that solutes are only present in soil solution the remaining unfrozen water was thus more concentrated resulting a significant increase for csw fig 6 salt migration became rather complicated during soil freezing process salt was diffused downward under the high concentration gradients between upper frozen layers and lower unfrozen layers and meantime it migrated upward under the convection effect the salt re distribution depended on the relative strength of the two effects with opposite directions for example in the first agr year since the downward diffusion effect was dominant fig 9 salt migrated down from an upper freezing layer to its adjacent lower unfrozen layer in sequence the ssc of a certain layer firstly increased and reached a peak and then decreased during soil profile freezing whereas the similar phenomenon was weaker in the second agr year as the upward convection partially counteracted the downward diffusion figs 6 and 9 the shaw sc quantitatively explained this complex salt migration process which was qualitatively found in some previous research e g ireson et al 2012 shafique et al 2016 wang et al 2022a during the soil thawing period p3 the frozen soil started to thaw bidirectionally due to the combined effects of increasing air temperatures and bottom geothermal heat i e downward from surface soil to deeper layers and upward from maximum frozen depth to upper layers soil was completely thawed at 70 80 cm depth fig 4b soil ice content decreased largely and meanwhile the swc of the soil profile also kept decreasing significantly due to intense evaporation after soil has been thawed figs 5 and 6 salt accumulated to the upper layers due to the combined effects of upward diffusion and upward convection figs 6 and 9 and thus the csw of upper layers was increased while with a small change for deeper layers fig 6 after the soil was fully thawed i e entering p4 and p5 the swc increased quickly after irrigation and rainfall fig 5 meanwhile the csw of upper layers decreased significantly while that of deeper layers showed small changes fig 6 irrigation provided moisture and leached salt out of root zone especially the pre planting irrigation effectively leached the salt accumulated in spring and provided a good salinity condition for seed germination for example after the first irrigation in 2021 the csw of surface layer 0 20 cm was largely reduced from about 20 to 2 g l 1 after irrigation or rainfall the swc kept decreasing due to crop evapotranspiration and salt re accumulated into the root zone note that the swc still remained above 0 3 cm3 cm 3 in most of time because of the shallowness of gwls these soil water salt dynamics were in agreement with most other research conducted in the shallow groundwater systems e g xu et al 2013 ren et al 2016 4 3 capillary rise deep percolation and evapotranspiration the accumulative amounts of water balance components in the root zone were calculated for different periods table 5 the variations of daily capillary rise and deep percolation i e the cumulative upward flux and downward flux at bottom of root zone during a day are presented in fig 8 during the pre freezing period p1 there was continuous capillary rise in both two agr years with the accumulative amount of 57 mm and 42 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively the capillary rise in 2019 was obviously stronger than that in 2020 due to much shallower water table with pre winter irrigation fig 8 the cumulative value of actual soil evaporation ea was 80 mm during 2019 half of which was the free water evaporation of ponding water fig 8a while that was only 46 mm in 2020 with no field pre winter irrigation and larger gwds averaged 1 6 m fig 8b during the soil freezing period p2 water was frozen and retained in the root zone indirectly increasing the soil water holding capacity for frozen layers in spite of a significant lowering of gwls there was very little deep percolation with only 7 mm in the first agr year even with high soil moistures and approaching zero in the second agr year fig 8 whereas the capillary rise may occur and recharge the upper frozen layer in the initial period as the freezing progresses deep soil water continuously migrated upward into the root zone until late december and the cumulative capillary rise reached to 52 mm during the second agr year with less antecedent soil moisture fig 8b however there was almost no capillary rise in the first agr year since the root zone moisture already reached a near saturation state after pre winter irrigation figs 5 and 8a results further showed that there was no water flux exchange when the soil was steadily frozen soil evaporation was inhibited due to the freezing of surface soil accumulating respectively to 60 mm 0 6 mm d 1 and 19 mm 0 2 mm d 1 for the first and second agr years and even approached zero when the surface soil was completely frozen the smaller soil evaporation in the second year was due to the lower liquid water contents of surface layers during the soil thawing period p3 the ea rate was increased significantly after the surface soil layer started to thaw varying at about 1 3 mm d 1 fig 8 the cumulative ea reached to 89 mm and 54 mm for the first and second agr years respectively there was no water flux at the bottom of root zone when root zone soil was not fully thawed capillary rise occurred after the root zone and lower adjacent layer were completely thawed but with very small amounts of 20 mm and 11 mm in the first and second agr years respectively note that in the second agr year a total of 10 mm temporary deep percolation occurred during the period from march 26th to april 1st fig 8b since the whole soil profile was just completely thawed and the moist layers at the bottom of root zone produced downward water fluxes whereas there was no downward water flux during the similar period for the first agr year as there were still ice layers below the root zone until april 15th fig 8a this difference should be mainly attributed to the colder weather and larger antecedent ice contents in the first agr year in addition the total ea over freeze thaw periods reached to 149 mm and 73 mm in the first and second agr years respectively table 5 we noted that the value 73 mm for the second agr year was closer to those measured in previous studies e g 86 mm in wu et al 2016 and 39 106 mm in liu et al 2021 mainly due to more similar gwds and soil moisture conditions during the pre planting period p4 there was intense soil evaporation due to the warm and windy weather in spring the ea rate even reached over 5 mm d 1 after irrigation fig 8 the cumulative ea reached to 123 mm average 2 4 mm d 1 and 85 mm average 1 8 mm d 1 during this period for the two years respectively significant capillary rise was observed to recharge the root zone accumulating to 94 mm and 50 mm equivalent to 76 and 58 of soil evaporation in the first and second agr years respectively table 5 whereas rapid and large deep percolation occurred after applying the pre planting irrigation i e the first irrigation reaching to 162 mm and 64 mm around 50 60 of irrigation depth the deep percolation was beneficial to leaching salt out of the upper root zone fig 6 during the crop growth period p5 deep percolation only occurred a few days after irrigation fig 8 and its cumulative values reached to 93 mm and 91 mm in the first and second agr years respectively amounting to 71 and 49 of irrigation depth table 5 this raised the groundwater table and also may result in significant waste of fertilizer due to the large deep percolation during the most of time there was continuous capillary rise for supplementing crop water consumption fig 8 with the cumulative value of about 180 mm for two agr years i e about 42 of actual crop et eta during crop season crop transpiration was the main way of soil water consumption with actual crop transpiration ta accumulating to about 349 mm in both two agr years table 5 the potential transpiration tp was larger in 2021 but also subject to more severe water salinity stress fig 8 the ea was reduced with the development of crop canopy accumulating to 73 mm and 99 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 the ratio of ea to eta during p5 was respectively 0 17 and 0 22 in the first and second agr years the values were similar to the results of some previous research e g 0 17 0 44 in sánchez et al 2014 and 0 23 in ren et al 2016 however it was found that ea eta for the entire agr year was obviously larger and reached up to 0 55 and 0 48 while the ea for non growing period accounted for 83 and 67 of that for the entire agr year 4 4 variations of salt storage in root zone the variation of salt storage in the root zone is presented in fig 9 the solute convection and diffusion as the two main factors driving salt movement played significantly different roles at each period during the pre freezing period p1 salt storage was increased by 450 g m 2 and 150 g m 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively mainly due to the upward convection of solute fig 9 solute diffusion was quite weak compared to convection note that there was almost no downward convection flux after pre winter irrigation because of the poor drainage during the soil freezing period p2 the salt migration was affected by both the downward diffusion and upward convection as mentioned before fig 9 at first the upward convection could result in an increase in salt storage during the early period when the upper root zone was in the freezing process then salt storage showed a significant decreasing trend as the freezing front moved down to the bottom of the root zone since the downward diffusion became dominant due to the large salinity concentration gradients after the root zone was completely frozen salt storage was nearly invariable or slightly decreased in both two agr years finally salt storage was decreased by 300 g m 2 and 45 g m 2 during the freezing period for the first and second agr years respectively a similar phenomenon of decline in salt storage during soil freezing was also observed and reported by wang et al 2022a about 9 27 decline the salt storage in the root zone may increase or decrease but with relatively small changes during the soil thawing period p3 affected by soil evaporation and deep percolation fig 9 salt flux was firstly dominated by the upward diffusion and then by the upward convection after thawing a lot which was partially affected by the soil thawing rate salt may more accumulate to the upper soil layers if the soil below the root zone was still in frozen state e g in 2020 whereas there may be downward solute convection with deep percolation when the lower frozen soil of the root zone thawed quickly e g in 2021 fig 9 for our experimental years the salt storage was increased by 100 g m 2 and decreased by 50 g m 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively during the pre planting period p4 salt largely accumulated into the root zone due to the intense surface evaporation while it was dramatically leached out by the subsequent pre planting irrigation fig 9 for example in 2020 salt storage was increased by 250 g m 2 from april 1st to may 20th and subsequently reduced by 420 g m 2 after the irrigation on may 21st that indicated the significant effect of the pre planting irrigation on promoting a good soil salinity condition for planting and seedling growth in addition too early pre planting irrigation may lead to over re accumulation of salt in the root zone and thus supplemental irrigation for salt leaching such as that in 2021 during the crop growth period p5 salt storage showed an obvious and rapid decrease after irrigation and then had an increasing trend during the irrigation interval fig 9 simulation indicated that convection was the main way for salt migration during the period salt storage was increased by 350 g m 2 and 550 g m 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively due to larger amount of capillary rise than that of deep percolation overall salt storage was increased from 900 to 1810 g m 2 i e with an increase of 1 0 to 2 0 g kg 1 for ssc for the root zone during the two agr years 4 5 crop growth and water use management fig 10 presented the daily factors of temperature stress and water salinity stress for crop growth as well as the proportion of water stress and salinity stress to water salinity stress water salinity stress reflected the actual soil water and salinity conditions and thus the operation level of farmland irrigation and drainage the crop yield under no water salinity stress was considered as the potential yield i e climatic yield in this study results showed that crop growth was susceptible to being affected by temperature stress only during the early or late stage with relatively low air temperatures fig 10 in other stages water salinity stress became the dominant limiting factor on crop growth but showed quite differences between years in 2020 the crop was just slightly affected by water salinity stress with sufficient water supply with an average value of αws equal to 0 89 over the growth period fig 10a even after the last irrigation july 20th the water salinity stress especially the water stress was still mild whereas the water salinity stress was much more severe during the season of 2021 with an average αws of 0 77 fig 10b the worse water salt conditions were mainly caused by less irrigation and rainfall as well as less capillary rise under deeper gwls in particular the αws reduced to 0 70 from the last irrigation july 19th to harvest during which the salinity stress averagely accounted for over 60 of the water salinity stress as a result the actual crop yield was 4 8 t ha 1 and 4 7 t ha 1 respectively for 2020 and 2021 which was quite close despite with higher potential yield in 2021 more significantly the quantitative analyses over an entire agr year could reveal some other meaningful issues in agricultural water use and soil salinity control in the case study area of hetao particularly involving the soil freeze thaw process and its effects compared with the previous studies e g pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 ren et al 2016 the practice of applying pre winter irrigation required good field drainage conditions to timely drain out the leached salt for shallow water table areas otherwise the irrigation water and leached salt cannot be drained in time before soil freezing thus reducing the salt leaching effect whereas inadequate or no pre winter irrigation may lead to too high soil salinity in the following crop growth season actually this should be even more critical for other crops sown in early or mid spring e g spring wheat and spring maize it was worth noting that pre winter irrigation should not be applied too late to approach winter besides the effects of soil freezing the freezing of water in the ditches may reduce the drainage efficiency and thus weaken the salt leaching effect since the air temperature had dropped below zero in late october in addition the pre planting irrigation could effectively leach out the salt accumulating in the spring season however too early pre planting irrigation required extra irrigation for salt leaching and reduced water use efficiency moreover it should be noticed that excessive irrigation during non growing periods resulted in large but non beneficial soil evaporation the ea for non growing periods accounted for over 65 of that for the entire agr year in this study some treatments including surface mulching straw incorporation and improved conservation tillage could be adopted for preserving soil moisture and reducing salt accumulation 5 summary and conclusion in this paper we proposed an improved spac model shaw sc and realized a continuous coupled simulation of heat water salt transport and crop growth processes over an agricultural year agr year for arid seasonally frozen asf regions the following modifications were carried out in shaw sc on the basis of the latest shaw version 3 0 1 incorporating a new epic crop growth module for simulating the crop dynamics 2 correcting the calculation issues related to solute leaching and solute lower boundary conditions and 3 considering the effects of surface mulch and salinity osmotic stress for reasonably simulating soil evaporation root water uptake and crop transpiration the shaw sc was then applied and tested with experimental data of two entire agr years including crop growth season and soil freeze thaw period at the sunflower field in northwest china results indicated that the model presented good performance in simulating the soil water and salt contents soil temperatures and crop growth indicators over two entire agr years in particular the reasonable simulation of salt migration and crop dynamics showed the enhanced capability of shaw sc for crop season compared with the original shaw model application indicated that the improvements made the shaw sc have better simulation and prediction abilities in agro ecosystem modeling for asf regions quantitative analyses of agroecosystem processes and water use were conducted with identifying five different periods i e pre freezing soil freezing soil thawing pre planting and crop growth periods during the soil freezing period soil freezing from the surface to deeper layers caused soil water to move upward and significantly inhibit the soil evaporation salt firstly migrated upward with water in convection whereas downward salt diffusion occurred and became dominant as the freezing front reached the bottom of root zone resulting in the decrease of salt storage for the main root zone i e 0 60 cm depth during the soil thawing period the frozen soil was thawed bidirectionally and soil evaporation rate increased significantly after soil thawing water and salt moved upward after the fully thawing of root zone and the main way for salt upward migration was diffusion before the thawing of soil below the root zone and then convection after that there was also temporary deep percolation and downward salt convection when the root zone was just fully thawed with a faster thawing rate during other periods capillary rise continued to recharge the root zone and supply for evaporation transpiration while deep percolation occurred only few days after irrigation furthermore water use analysis indicated that the pre winter irrigation required good field drainage conditions to leach salt away and inadequate or no pre winter irrigation resulted in too high soil salinity for the following year pre planting irrigation can effectively leach the salt accumulated in spring but too early pre planting irrigation reduced water use efficiency moreover excessive irrigation during the non growing periods led to massive but non beneficial soil evaporation with total evaporation for non growing periods accounting for over 67 of that for the entire agr year in this case study in summary the study presented the shaw sc as an efficient tool for modelling the coupled processes of heat water salt and crop growth in asf regions it significantly expended the model abilities of current spac models and realized the dynamic simulation of spac system on an entire agr year scale for asf regions the quantitative and comprehensive analysis of the agroecosystem processes provided some new insights on supporting water use management and salinity control which may also be very useful for other irrigated areas in asf regions moreover our follow up modeling work will focus more on the model parameterization simulation function extension and best management practices on agricultural water use and agronomic practices credit authorship contribution

2697,global warming potentially increases precipitation and intensifies water exchange thereby accelerating the hydrological cycle the tibetan plateau tp is an asian water tower in which the water budget varies and its anomaly exerts stress on resource availability few studies have quantified long term water budgets across tp owing to scarcity of ground based observations and uncertainties in remote sensing data in this study water budget components i e precipitation glacial melting gm evapotranspiration et runoff and soil moisture sm state in tp are synthetically estimated for the past three decades the water budget estimation benefits from a gm coupled hydrological ensemble modeling which is forced by nine precipitation products with seven from satellite methods the results show that the ensemble modeling effectively captures the dynamics of runoff et and terrestrial water storage the long term average annual water input sum of precipitation and gm was approximately 438 mm with 4 contribution from gm for which the annual et and runoff take away was approximately 263 and 173 mm respectively from 1984 to 2015 the four water fluxes significantly increased with varying rates 2 3 mm yr precipitation 0 9 mm yr gm 1 5 mm yr et 1 1 mm yr runoff which suggested an accelerating hydrological cycle particularly increasing gm 5 8 mm yr in the nyainqentanglha mountains in southern tp induced high yield runoff 800 mm these estimations aid in yielding robust solutions for water management in tp and neighboring regions the accelerated hydrological cycle implies potential flooding risk and vulnerability of the hydrological system under climate change keywords tibetan plateau water budget glacier melting hydrological ensemble modeling vic glacier model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is known as the third pole with an average altitude of over 4000 m it is the source area of about ten major rivers including the yellow yangtze mekong salween brahmaputra and indus rivers runoff generated from tp provides valuable water resources for downstream regions precipitation and evapotranspiration et dominate the land surface hydrological processes and connect processes in the hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere on tp and surrounding areas zhang and yang 2010 soil moisture sm acts as a distinct hydroclimatic factor characterizing land atmosphere water and energy interchanges long et al 2019 yang et al 2021 in recent decades global climate has been experiencing significant alterations owing to the natural and anthropogenic forcing troch et al 2008 climate change likely promotes increased precipitation and a higher frequency of extreme precipitation events silva et al 2017 which is the main driver of et and soil moisture dynamics consequently regional and global terrestrial hydrological processes may experience various accelerations allan and zveryaev 2011 ji et al 2020 liu and curry 2010 the acceleration of the hydrological cycle is also probably reflected in tp as the region has complex climatic conditions and extensive cryospheric landforms ji et al 2020 xu et al 2008 yang et al 2011 specifically climate change has strengthened precipitation over the central tp but has led to less water vapor exchange in the southern and eastern regions yang et al 2014 glacier melting gm has also been enhanced due to the disappearance of fresh snow and a decline in albedo in a warming climate barnett et al 2005 thereby increasing the water supply to downstream regions immerzeel et al 2010 however the intensified hydrological cycle on tp is unstable as the precipitation and gm changes may cause substantial variability to the water partition among et runoff and soil moisture sm xie et al 2006 meanwhile the water budget and its dynamics are strongly coupled with energy and biological cycles rodriguez iturbe 2000 therefore estimating long term water budget components on tp is one of the most important issues under climate change and associated water resource management scott and biederman 2019 most studies concerning the hydrological cycle on tp illustrated only a subset of water budget components as the main water input precipitation shows high spatial heterogeneity because of the complex monsoons and mountain blockages on tp it exhibited an increasing trend on tp during the past two decades ouyang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2011 other than that glacier mass change as a unique hydrological process on tp provides substantial water to most watersheds on tp e g the sources of salween brahmaputra rivers it can be the main contributor to the increasing runoff and related hydrological factors lutz et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 given the precipitation and glacier melting conditions runoff and et are characterized by strong spatio temporal variability goodrich et al 2004 li et al 2014 however few studies have attempted to provide a synthesized quantitative view of long term water budget patterns or quantified the change patterns of the hydrological cycle on tp lutz and immerzeel 2013 estimated the tp water budget by integrating ground and satellite observations in a distributed hydrological model but only for a short duration 2008 2010 moreover estimating or modeling the water budget for tp is challenging owing to the scarcity of hydrometeorological observations and the extensive cryosphere given the sparse distribution of ground based hydrological observations on tp it is difficult to perform an acceptable hydrological modeling based on ground based data alone maussion et al 2014 satellite products provide an encouraging alternative but have considerable discrepancies among different products which may pose uncertainties in water budget analysis and hydrological modeling ullah et al 2018 wang et al 2020 ensemble method was proposed aiming to reduce subjectivity in hydrological modeling and to increase the level of confidence in simulations seiller et al 2017 the method has been widely implemented and proved high performance worldwide for example the application of ensemble precipitation forcing for streamflow simulations in the pipiripau basin in brazil strauch et al 2012 and the ensemble physical parameterizations for rainfall forecasting in the fuping and zijingguan basins in northern china tian et al 2019 however ensemble methods may face uncertainties from ensemble members and most studies only consider three or four members in the ensemble method ma and zhang 2022 strauch et al 2012 additionally the glaciers faced variability from global climate change zhao et al 2019 with obvious mass decrease in snow and or glacier dominated regions e g alaska arctic canada antarctic and himalayas in tp hugonnet et al 2021 yao et al 2019 glacier mass change can provide substantial water for runoff and may regulate hydrological processes barnett et al 2005 thus a long term synthesis and quantitative assessment of the water budget is necessary on tp and reasonable modeling methods are needed to consider uncertainties from the limited data and the impact of gm in this study we aimed to quantify the water budgets including precipitation gm et runoff and sm of the top 1 m thickness and identify the dynamic pattern of the hydrological cycle on tp over the past 30 years to consider the impact of gm on tp we coupled a glacier melting algorithm with the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model hereinafter named as vic glacier and as for the uncertainty from climate forcing especially precipitation we performed a hydrological ensemble modeling that is driven by nine precipitation products the ensemble modeling of vic glacier model would be evaluated regarding runoff sm et and water storage after that the spatial temporal dynamics and uncertainties of the water budgets were calculated from the nine ensemble members our work improved understanding of water balance patterns on tp thereby has implications for water resource management for tp and downstream regions moreover our work indicates that an ensemble method can be reference for data sparse areas and presents the importance of snow and glacier melting in water balance for alpine mountains 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the tp region is situated in central asia covering an area of approximately 2 5 million km2 fig 1 it has complex climatic conditions including tropical humid semi humid monsoon and semi arid climates the average temperature ranges from 20 c in the southeastern tp to approximately 6 c in the northwestern region influenced by multiple sources of water vapor and mountain blockage its precipitation presents evident spatial variability with an average annual value ranging from 50 to 2000 mm moreover tp is characterized by extensive snow and glacier coverage with a total glacier area of approximately 50 000 km2 yao et al 2007 especially in the himalayas nyainqentanglha and tanggula mountains glaciers and precipitation promote a dense river network on tp including headwaters of five major asian rivers the yangtze yellow brahmaputra salween and mekong rivers the tp region can be divided into eight subregions hexi qaidam inner upper yellow uye upper yangtze uya upper salween us upper mekong um and upper brahmaputra ub watershed fig 1 the first three subregions hexi qaidam and inner are situated in the northern and western parts of tp which have relatively low precipitation as the water vapor mainly comes from the mid latitude westerlies the other five are closed watersheds uye uya us um and ub located in the eastern or southeastern parts of tp in these watersheds precipitation is relatively high because of the monsoons originating from the arabian sea the south china sea and the western pacific the eight subregions have varying glacier coverage with the smallest area in the uye 134 km2 and the largest in the ub 4225 km2 zhang et al 2013 2 2 data availability and processing 2 2 1 precipitation datasets precipitation is one of the most influential driving forces in hydrological modeling based on previous studies on precipitation evaluation we selected nine precipitation products table 1 for hydrological modeling the nine products are all widely used and their performance have been proved on tp beck et al 2017 kai et al 2014 wang et al 2020 among the nine products the cma and cpc global products are gauge based datasets while the other seven products mainly rely on remote sensing retrieval and data fusion technologies notably each precipitation product has its advantages and limitations and it is difficult to establish a reliable bias correction method in places with scarce gauge observations such as the western tp therefore instead of bias correction for the precipitation products in this study we adopted ensemble modeling to quantify the uncertainties of the simulated water budget components the spatial resolutions of the nine precipitation products were between 0 05 and 1 0 and four of the products had a resolution of 0 25 i e cma cmorph bld persiann cdr tmpa to simplify the modeling all precipitation products were downscaled or upscaled to the same resolution of 0 25 specifically the products i e cpc global mswep and gpcp 1dd with a resolution coarser than 0 25 were subjected to bilinear interpolation and the chirps and cmfd products with resolutions finer than 0 25 were averaged into a 0 25 resolution moreover given the time span of these products and a three year warm up period for all hydrological simulations the simulated water budget components were from three groups 1984 2015 cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd 1986 2015 cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd persiann cdr and 2001 2015 cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd persiann cdr cmorph bld gpcp 1dd tmpa the simulated water budget components during 1984 1985 period corresponded to the mean values from five simulation realizations cma cpc global mswep chirps and cmfd the persiann cdr driven simulation realization was added during 1986 2001 period and after 2001 the simulated water budget components were obtained from all the nine simulation realizations 2 2 2 other model input data the model input data included topography meteorological forcing vegetation and soil data table 2 the topographical data i e the digital elevation model dem obtained from the us geological survey website were used to delineate river networks and extract boundaries of subregions in tp the meteorological forcing data included precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed and relative humidity the precipitation has been described above and the other forcing variables were generated by interpolating 156 cma stations the data from the cma stations have undergone strict quality control to eliminate evident anomaly values e g precipitation less than 0 mm kai et al 2014 the interpolation was based on the inverse distance weighting method considering a 6 5 c km decline rate to reflect the temperature dependence of altitude xie et al 2015 the vegetation input includes a land cover map for vegetation types and associated vegetation parameters the land cover map was derived from the classification data for the year 2010 liu et al 2010 and had a spatial resolution of 1 km and 12 land cover types vegetation parameters were obtained from nijssen et al 2001 ftp ftp hydro washington edu the soil input includes a soil cover map and the associated soil parameters the soil cover map was obtained based on a 30 30 arc second resolution soil characteristics dataset zhu et al 2020 soil physical parameters such as field capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived from a china soil dataset dai et al 2013 and other parameters e g bubbling pressure and thermal damping depth were defined according to the soil dataset from the food and agriculture organization nijssen et al 2001 the gm process simulation requires the glacier distribution and the degree day factor ddf parameter the glacier distribution dataset used the second chinese glacier inventory it was generated based on remote sensing products and google earth images during 2004 2011 guo et al 2017 the glacier distribution dataset was downloaded from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https data tpdc ac cn zh hans liu et al 2012 and it has been widely used for glacier related studies chen et al 2017 su et al 2022 the glacier distribution dataset is in vector format and it was transferred to grids with spatial resolution of 0 005 in computation ddf parameter depends on the exposure of the glacier and is calculated based on a linear correlation between ice melt measured by ablation stakes from different glaciers and the sum of daily mean temperatures above the melting point zhang et al 2006 the ddfs have been widely and successfully applied in multiple researches including gm calculation lai et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 and streamflow simulation liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2 2 3 data for model evaluation the hydrological ensemble modeling was evaluated with observations of runoff et and sm and compared with satellite based products of et and terrestrial water storage tws streamflow data from five stations were converted to runoff by dividing the streamflow with the associated watershed area which was used for model calibration and validation the streamflow data generally have long time coverage 1970 to 2010 or after thus all nine simulation realizations can be calibrated and validated as shown in fig 1 the five stations are located at the outlets of the uye uya us um and ub watersheds which are distributed in the eastern and southern parts of tp with varying degrees of glacier coverage the in situ soil moisture observations were obtained from soil moisture and temperature measurement system smtms networks containing 89 stations with 25 stations in the pali network and 64 stations in the naqu network chen et al 2013 su et al 2011 the two networks located in mid southern tp with high altitude 4000 m fig 1 and provided sm data of 5 10 20 and 40 cm depth with daily time steps for the periods from august 2010 to december 2015 and august 2015 to december 2015 respectively it worth noting that the observed sm only referred to liquid water so the data may have uncertainties in representing total water in frozen state chen et al 2013 et was evaluated using observations from four eddy covariance towers and a satellite based et product the eddy covariance towers are located in the southern tp namely naqu zhufeng namucuo and maqu with forest or grass vegetation types as a reliable remote sensing product the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam et product was used as reference data in this study because it has been successfully applied in tp for et evaluation and water budget calculation abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 li et al 2019 the gleam et has relatively long temporal coverage 1980 present and a spatial resolution of 0 25 satellite based tws data were obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace this product can measure the variations in gravity and provide monthly tws anomalies with a spatial resolution of 0 25 adam 2002 grace has extensive applications worldwide including water balance and tws calculation in tp li et al 2019 liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 model description and setup the vic model is a land surface scheme that uses a variable infiltration curve and a nonlinear formulation to simulate the baseflow and deep soil moisture movement the model considers multiple vegetation types and one main soil layer within each calculation unit liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 and it can capture the dynamics of water and energy balances moreover the model calculates snow cover by dividing precipitation into rainfall and snowfall according to air temperature snow melt and accumulation are computed based on land surface energy balance thus the vic model has been successfully applied in studies at various scales cuo et al 2013 xie et al 2015 in this study we conducted the simulation with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 hour however the original vic model did not consider the glacier melt process zhang et al 2013 and su et al 2016 coupled a degree day glacier algorithm with the vic model vic glacier to reflect the glacier hydrology this study extends the application to estimate the water balance in tp the total runoff calculated using this model is computed as follows 1 r i f g i 1 f r vic i where r i is the total runoff depth mm in grid i f is the glacier fraction which is calculated by dividing the glacier area with the area of the gird cell i r vic i is the runoff depth mm in grid i calculated by the original vic model and g i is the runoff from the glaciated area mm including liquid precipitation and glacier runoff gm i in grid i gm i is calculated as follows 2 gm i ddf t i t i 0 0 t i 0 where ddf is the degree day factor m m c d a y and is determined according to zhang et al 2006 t i is daily mean temperature above glacier surface c a roughly estimate of ti is assumed to be equal to the temperature of the modeling grid cell in the size of 0 25 in the study wang et al 2021 but this may overestimate ti because glaciers are generally located in mountains with high attitude and low temperature we recalculated ti for each glacier at a finer spatial resolution 0 005 and considered the decrease of temperature with the increase of the glacier altitude 6 5 c per 1 km so ti for gm i calculation is lower than the grid cell average temperature that is the forcing for other hydrological processes the glacier volume affects the gm estimation and determines the upper limit of annual gm in this study the glacier volume was calculated using the volume area scaling relation method radić et al 2007 radić et al 2008 3 v 0 04 s 1 43 where v is the glacier volume and s is the glacier area considering the glacier dynamics ragettlia et al 2016 yan et al 2021 the glacier volume and area were updated every year using equation 3 this update was repeated for all the vic glacier simulation periods notably snow is assumed to melt prior to the gm process thus the gm will be suspended if there is a snowpack on the glacier zhang et al 2013 the snow calculation is consistent in non glacier and glacier areas 3 2 model calibration and evaluation method there are seven influential parameters for a vic model simulation namely the infiltration parameter b i n f three baseflow parameters d s w s d smax and the thicknesses of three soil layers d 1 d 2 d 3 liang and xie 2001 zhu et al 2020 the model was calibrated by observed runoff from the five watersheds and was validated regarding runoff sm et and tws the observed runoff datasets were divided into two segments for model calibration and validation respectively the first segment covered approximately 20 years and the latter one ranged between 5 and 10 years for each simulation with one precipitation product model calibration was conducted to adjust the seven parameters to match the simulated runoff with the observations each ensemble member therefore may have different model parameters according to model calibration and validation after adjusting the parameters in the five watersheds the adjusted parameters were transferred to ungauged regions based on their climatic similarity i e similar precipitation patterns or the same climate zones zhu et al 2021 the simulated sm for the top layer will be validated with the observed sm at the depth of 10 cm from the smtms network to avoid the scale difference between the simulations and the in situ observations the average sm values were calculated based on the multiple in situ observations and then they were used to validate the simulated sm of grid cells that contained the in situ observations the simulated et values were validated with four eddy covariance towers and compared with the gleam et it worth noting that the spatial resolution of the vic glacier simulations is 0 25 and each grid cell may contain a variety of vegetation types while the eddy covariance towers can only capture small scale et information 1 km in order to relieve the mismatch of spatial scale between the two the observed et was used to evaluate the simulated et with the same vegetation type in the corresponding grid moreover the simulated tws change twsc was compared with the grace estimates for the period 2003 2014 at a yearly scale the missing data in grace were filled by linear interpolation based on the values corresponding to the previous and following months the yearly twsc from grace was calculated as the difference between the values of december and january and the yearly twsc from the ensemble modeling was equal to the difference between precipitation and water output runoff and et in this study we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient r and relative error er to evaluate the performance of the nine simulation realizations 3 3 ensemble method and uncertainty representation given the nine precipitation products we performed ensemble modeling with nine independent simulation realizations the average values and 95 confidence intervals 1 96 standard deviation of the nine simulation realizations were served as the values and fluctuation ranges of water budget components based on the knowledge of statistics and normal distribution the average value of a dataset generally shows the highest occurrence probability and the 95 confidence interval can cover 95 occurrence probability of a dataset anctil et al 2009 the uncertainty mentioned in this study refers to the discrepancy in water budget components in the nine simulation realizations and it is usually defined by a statistical method according to montanari 2007 the coefficient of variation cv was used to measure uncertainty thus the cv is calculated with respect to the uncertainty of each water budget component based on the multi year average results of the nine simulation realizations 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the nine vic glacier simulation realizations were calibrated and validated using the streamflow data from the five watersheds as shown in fig 2 a and table 3 the ensemble mean based on the nine simulation realizations agreed well with the observations as they present similar dynamic changes during both the calibrated and validated periods the mean simulation realizations achieve nses generally higher than 0 6 and r values over 0 8 during the calibrated period however the runoff simulations underestimated the observations to some degree as the ers were negative for the five watersheds specifically the ers in the um and ub watersheds were over 20 similar patterns were showed during the validation period the nse and r values were approximately 0 7 and 0 9 respectively with ers ranging from 25 to 3 considering the absence of gm runoff observations this study evaluated the model performance on spring runoff as the gm has a greater impact in this season from march to may the evaluation was conducted in uye uya um and ub watersheds the us watershed was excluded as only yearly streamflow data were available there as shown in fig 2b the simulated spring runoff presented similar temporal dynamics compared to the observed data the r values ranged between 0 5 and 0 7 and the ers were generally negative which indicated that the spring runoff simulations generally underestimated to some degree however the absolute ers were lower than 25 in the four watersheds demonstrating that the vic glacier model presents acceptable performance for the gm process fig 3 shows the validation results of the sm the average sm at 10 cm obtained from the nine simulation realizations aligned with the smtms observations the er values of the naqu and pali networks were below 10 and the r values were 0 88 and 0 85 respectively the biases may be attributed to the input data the simulation method and frozen soil notably the simulations presented obvious overestimations during the winter season from december to february in the following year the frozen soil may be a major reason for the overestimation as the sm observations can only represent liquid water rather than solid state which may bring uncertainties in representing total water in winter season the average et achieved by the nine simulation realizations was evaluated by ground based observations from the four eddy covariance towers and was compared with gleam et fig 4 the er values in the naqu and zhufeng towers were approximately 41 and 65 respectively the large deviation may be attributed to the extensive glaciers and frozen soil cover in tp or the uncertainty within the observations despite the deviations the simulated et presented consistent daily dynamics with the observations especially in the maqu tower r 0 8 fig 4a in comparison with the spatial distribution and interannual variation fig 4b c the simulated et exhibited a similar spatial distribution and monthly dynamics as the gleam et with er and r values of 13 4 and 0 98 respectively the simulated twsc anomaly was further compared with the grace product on a yearly scale as shown in fig 5 the average twsc anomaly obtained from the nine simulation realizations were consistent with the grace data the r values for the entire tp were approximately 0 65 the simulations present relatively poor performance in the uye watershed with r of approximately 0 40 however the rs for other subregions were generally higher than 0 6 especially for the uya and ub subregions r 0 75 given the validation in runoff et sm and twsc the ensemble modeling achieves an acceptable performance for the water budget component simulation therefore the simulation realizations can be used to identify the dynamics of the water balance components in tp 4 2 spatial temporal variability of the long term water budgets the spatial distribution of the water budget components that is precipitation runoff gm et sm as well as their uncertainties were quantified based on the nine simulation realizations here sm was defined as the mean soil water content of the soil profile for the top 1 m thickness as the sm of this thickness can characterize the seasonal cycle of soil water state without being affected by precipitation events as shown in fig 6 the average annual precipitation exhibits a southeast northwest decreasing gradient over tp it is 1500 mm in the southern himalayas mountains and less than 100 mm in the northwestern part of tp the gm is mainly distributed in mountains with high altitudes and is approximately 16 mm however the gm exceeded 200 mm in the southeastern part of tp especially in the nyainqentanglha mountains in nyingchi and changdu annual et was consistent with the precipitation in terms of the spatial pattern and ranged from below 50 mm to over 500 mm the annual total runoff showed significant differences between the northwestern and southern tp specifically it is less than 10 mm in the northwestern tp and over 800 mm in the southeastern tp the long term average sm ranges from 115 mm to 445 mm in tp and is represented as wet in the southeastern 180 mm and dry in the western part of tp 150 mm the uncertainties of the five water budget components measured by the cv are shown in fig 7 for precipitation the average cv was approximately 33 which was generally higher in the western and southern parts of tp but it was below 20 in the eastern tp large uncertainties showed in the runoff simulation as the average cv was higher than 50 the cvs for et gm and sm were generally low 25 the estimates of the five water budget components have small uncertainties in the eastern tp but large in the southern and western regions the water budget components generally exhibited increasing trends during the study period fig 8 precipitation increased at a rate of 2 3 mm yr for the entire tp except for its decreasing trend in the southeastern himalayas gm increased with a value of approximately 0 9 mm yr and exhibited the highest increase in the nyainqentanglha mountains et and runoff also exhibited increasing trends for the whole tp 1 5 and 1 1 mm yr but decreasing trends in the southeastern tp notably affected by precipitation and gm runoff exhibited more complicated patterns it generally had a decreasing trend in the southeastern himalayas but an increasing trend in nyainqentanglha mountains the sm showed slight changes during the study period 0 1 mm yr and it generally increases in the western tp and decreases in the eastern region 4 3 subregional scale water budget closure fig 9 shows the water budgets over tp and the eight internal subregions we defined that the water input to the hydrological system in tp was mainly contributed by precipitation and gm the average annual water input sum of precipitation and gm in tp was approximately 438 mm during the period 1984 2015 with approximately 3 7 contribution from gm among the eight subregions the annual water inputs in the hexi qaidam and inner subregions were less than 250 mm while the water inputs were higher than 390 mm in the other five watersheds the largest gm contribution appeared in us 7 2 and qaidam 4 4 subregions but the values were less than 2 in the uya um uye and inner subregions as for the water output et accounts for a large amount of tp with an annual value of approximately 263 mm followed by a runoff of approximately 173 mm the ratio of et to water output was generally higher in the northern tp and lower in the southern part of the region specifically the ratios were 70 in the hexi qaidam uye inner and uya subregions but less than 65 in the southern watersheds of tp i e the us and ub watersheds as shown in fig 9 the soil water storage change δs was positive 2 4 mm for tp during the 1984 2015 period among the eight subregions the ub watershed exhibited the most obvious increase 8 8 mm for soil water storage followed by the um 1 2 mm and uya 0 9 mm watersheds while the hexi qaidam and uye subregions presented negative δs suggesting a slight decrease in soil water storage notably δs was different from twsc which described in subsection 3 3 and 4 1 here gm was regarded as a water input for the hydrological cycle δs was therefore calculated as the difference between the water input gm and precipitation and water output runoff and et while twsc was equal to the difference between precipitation and water output i e runoff and et the annual dynamics of the water budget are shown in fig 10 and table 4 tp presented an acceleration of the hydrological cycle as all four water fluxes precipitation runoff gm and et showed increasing trends during 1984 2015 particularly precipitation over tp presented a sudden increase around the year of 1997 i e from 391 mm in the period of 1984 1997 to 439 mm during 1998 2015 however it exhibited a slight increase of 0 5 and 0 1 mm yr respectively during these two periods the acceleration of the hydrological cycle was also demonstrated at the subregional scale although the four water fluxes exhibited various trends precipitation in the hexi subregion has the lowest increase of about 1 8 mm yr while the trends exceed 2 0 mm yr in the other subregions with the largest in the uya um and ub watersheds 3 0 mm yr gm changed in the hexi inner and um subregions with rates varying from 0 3 to 0 5 mm yr and the largest glacier mass loss occurred in the us watershed with rate of 3 3 mm yr as to the output water fluxes the runoff and et showed increases in the subregions located in northern and eastern tp i e hexi qaidam inner and uye subregions ranging between 0 7 and 1 0 mm yr and 1 2 2 0 mm yr respectively but they have larger increases in the southern tp i e us and ub subregions with rates beyond 1 3 and 2 2 mm yr respectively the fluctuation range of each water flux varies in tp for the entire tp the fluctuation ranges of the average annual precipitation gm runoff and et were within 315 529 12 20 108 239 and 219 306 mm respectively the us and ub watersheds presented the largest precipitation 394 890 and 252 860 mm respectively and gm fluctuation ranges 42 57 and 4 23 mm respectively therefore the two watersheds generally exhibited the largest fluctuation ranges for runoff and et however the uya subregion exhibited relatively smaller fluctuation intervals of water budgets with values of 24 mm for precipitation 26 mm for et and less than 10 mm for gm and runoff 4 4 seasonal cycle of water budget components the four water budget components i e precipitation gm et and runoff have different seasonal cycles as shown in fig 11 and table 5 for the entire tp approximately 58 of the precipitation occurs in summer from june to august with only approximately 4 in winter from december to february glaciers also experience large losses during summer 80 which leads to massive water exchanges during this season 58 of annual et and 60 of runoff the eight subregions presented similar patterns in tp precipitation and gm were prominent in summer which promoted abundant et and runoff 58 65 for et and 52 73 for runoff in particular the ub watershed exhibited the highest percentage of summer precipitation 65 and the us watershed had the largest summer gm 44 mm the seasonal cycle of sm was not shown in fig 11 because it was relatively stable in all four seasons table 5 regarding the water output et generally consumes most of the water approximately 60 in tp with the highest percentage in winter 74 and the lowest in autumn 57 although the peak et of approximately 60 mm per month in july for the eight subregions the ratios of et to the water output ranged between 56 and 79 and the ratios also exhibited seasonal dynamics the highest ratios generally occurred in winter and the low values happened in summer and autumn seasons for instance the ratio was approximately 65 in winter and only about 55 in the summer and autumn seasons in the us watershed the low percentages of summer et implied a relatively high summer runoff generation capability large precipitation and gm as well as the high conversion ratio of runoff in summer may together cause a relatively intensive summer runoff in tp especially in the subregions of the us and ub the timing of the peak runoff differed in the subregions fig 11 generally peak flow appears in july but it can postpone to august in the inner and ub subregions intriguingly the uye watershed seemed to present a double peak flow regime in july and september approximately 29 mm and 25 mm per month respectively the timing of peak flow is largely determined by the climatological precipitation rhythm for example the double peak flow regime in the uye was consistent with the climatological pattern of precipitation 4 5 hotspot area with intensive runoff the ensemble modeling showed that the changes in the water budget components have evident spatial variability in particular intensive precipitation and gm appeared in the southeastern tp which caused an average runoff of 800 mm in this area we take two subregions i e the nyainqentanglha mountains and the southeastern himalayas as hotspots and identify their runoff characteristics and the contributions of precipitation and gm the locations of the two subregions are marked in fig 8 the two subregions demonstrated high runoff yield fig 12 but exhibited contrasting trends during the 1984 2015 period increased runoff in the nyainqentanglha mountains and decreased runoff in the southeastern himalayas specifically in the nyainqentanglha mountains the average annual runoff was approximately 810 mm with an increasing rate of 5 7 mm yr the gm runoff contributed to over 45 of the total runoff with a significant increase of 5 8 mm yr the precipitation runoff presented a decreasing change of approximately 0 1 mm yr in the southeastern himalayas however precipitation runoff 837 mm contributed to approximately 98 of the total runoff 852 mm and it exhibited a decreasing trend 3 1 mm yr resulting in a decrease in total runoff at a rate of 2 8 mm yr 5 discussion 5 1 benefit of the ensemble modeling the ensemble method can be established with multi forcing modeling multi models and or multi parameter approaches and it is inspired from modular frameworks empirical model development and multi model applications seiller et al 2017 wei et al 2020 the method benefits from extracting multiple information from the ensemble members and neutralizing the weakness of a single one thereby increasing the credibility of the simulations henrik et al 2014 strauch et al 2012 it has been increasingly used in addressing hydrological problems and can be a key step to mitigate uncertainties granata 2019 ma and zhang 2022 the ensemble method has been applied worldwide including tp qi et al 2020 pakistan waseem et al 2015 u s sharma et al 2019 taiwan yang et al 2020 and canada veĺazquez et al 2009 however the spatiotemporal uncertainties associated with initial conditions of models and parameters may hinder the efficiency of the ensemble modelling the method thereby is not always with acceptable performance veĺazquez et al 2009 yang et al 2020 our work selected high performance precipitation products referring to wang et al 2020 before the ensemble modelling rather than conducted the modelling directly moreover our work employed more ensemble members i e nine precipitation products than most other studies thereby improving statistical significance as more samples will likely achieve more reliable statistical estimation the ensemble means in our work present satisfactory performance for runoff et sm and twsc based on extensive evaluations lacking of accuracy is one of the primary motivations for using an ensemble approach considering the insufficient data in tp and the importance of precipitation in hydrological modelling strauch et al 2012 the ensemble modelling regarding precipitation diversity may effectively improve the accuracy of water balance estimation in tp this method is also applicable for water balance estimation in any data sparse regions partly because the satellite products are freely available for global scales we further remind that the ensemble simulation strategies can be established with different situations such as considering temperature diversity for energy balance simulation moreover the ensemble modeling could provide a probabilistic assessment and uncertainties of simulations replacing the traditional method of a deterministic or single model simulations veĺazquez et al 2009 this study provided reliable probabilistic forecast and confirmed the discrepancy of the nine precipitation products in tp and its influence on other water budget components 5 2 estimates of long term water budgets in tp based on hydrological ensemble modeling our study quantified the spatial patterns and seasonal cycles of the water balance components the average annual precipitation exhibited a southeast northwest decreasing gradient over tp with the highest value in the southern himalayan mountains 1000 mm most of the precipitation occurred in summer 58 with less than 4 in winter these patterns may come from multiple climatic conditions in tp as the southern region is dominated by the indian and east asian monsoons with high water vapor during the summer season while the northern tp is dominated by mid latitude westerlies with relatively low water vapor li et al 2020 zhu et al 2011 the mean annual gm was approximately 16 mm in tp and it exhibited significant seasonal dynamics with over 80 in the summer influenced by air temperature it has been reported that the mean annual gm was about 48 mm wang et al 2021 which may be an overestimation because the grid cell average temperature was used to compute gm in equation 2 this study updated the temperature of the glacier surface by considering the elevation effect as described in subsection 3 1 lutz et al 2014 and qi et al 2022 also estimates gm in eastern tp they showed that gm contributes approximately 16 20 to discharge in ub watershed which is much larger than our work the difference likely stems from the boundary definition the ub watershed included the nyainqentanglha mountains in lutz et al 2014 and qi et al 2022 but our work mainly focused on the upper watershed that excluded nyainqentanglha mountains the nyainqentanglha mountains have extensive glacier cover and warm winds from the southern tp bay of bengal south china sea and the western pacific resulting in a massive glacier loss 48 2 m yr bibi et al 2018 yao et al 2012 besides that our work demonstrated the reliable gm estimation regarding the spring runoff evaluation and similar gm contribution values in most watersheds e g us uya um and uye compared with lutz et al 2014 and qi et al 2022 both the precipitation and gm input fluxes lead to high magnitudes of et and runoff especially in the summer season and the southern tp moreover et generally consumes approximately 60 of the total water input over tp with higher percentages in winter and the northern tp similar spatio temporal pattern of et has been observed by yang et al 2011 and kuang and jiao 2016 and also obtained by li et al 2019 in five source watersheds of tp and by zhang et al 2018 in tp with point scale estimation the high et percentage in winter may be because of the drizzle or scarce gm which evapotranspired before being converted into runoff the low et percentage in the southern tp may be due to the high runoff generated from the steep mountains we noticed ma and zhang 2022 used three precipitation products to drive a water carbon coupled biophysical model penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 and estimated the mean annual et up to 353 mm for 1982 2016 this difference may result from the precipitation forcing and the modeling our study employed more precipitation forcing datasets to estimate water budgets in tp in the southeastern tp we identified a region of high yield runoff of over 800 mm per year this phenomenon is mainly attributed to the high magnitudes of precipitation and gm the monsoons and the himalayan mountains together create a humid subtropical climate zone in the southern himalayas promoting annual precipitation up to 1000 mm gao and liu 2012 additionally the nyainqentanglha mountains are experiencing a warming pattern chen et al 2015 ji et al 2020 and massive glacier loss bibi et al 2018 yao et al 2012 thus the intensive gm and precipitation result in a large magnitude and an increasing trend of runoff 5 7 mm yr the uncertainties of the water budget components were calculated based on the discrepancy of the nine simulation realizations the uncertainty of precipitation was 30 and generally exhibited higher values in the western and southern parts of tp one of the primary reasons might be the different precipitation estimation instruments e g infrared and microwave beck et al 2017 the high uncertainties in the western and southern parts of tp may stem from the lack of post processing e g gauge data fusion for the products owing to the complex topography and limitations of observed data in the region kai et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the uncertainties were transferred to the water budget estimation the cv value for runoff was approximately 57 and the values for et gm and sm were lower than 25 the high cv of runoff estimates may also be attributed to insufficient model calibration in the western tp and the fact that runoff is more sensitive to precipitation uncertainties than the other forcing variables in general qi et al 2020 5 3 acceleration of hydrological cycle in tp the simulated results illustrated that tp experienced an intensified hydrological cycle during the 1980 2015 period all the water budgets exhibit increasing trends that is approximately 2 3 mm yr for precipitation 0 9 mm yr for gm 1 5 mm yr for et 1 1 mm yr for runoff and 0 1 mm yr for sm the increasing trends of one or several water budget components on tp have been partly evidenced in studies li et al 2019 lin et al 2021 lutz et al 2014 for instance shi et al 2016 found that sm increased significantly during 1980 2012 with an abrupt change in 2003 yang et al 2014 illustrated that precipitation et runoff and surface sm generally presented increasing trends during 1984 2006 except for the southern himalayan mountains immerzeel et al 2012 and wang et al 2019 demonstrated obvious glacier loss in tp influenced by global warming however our work has the advantage of synthetically mapping the long term dynamics of the water budget of tp the dynamic patterns may be largely attributed to the enhanced asian summer monsoon and deep convection triggered by the thermal force the asian summer monsoon brings more water moisture and deep convection exerts the troposphere stratosphere exchanges of water vapor fu et al 2006 moreover global warming directly forces massive surface heating thereby inducing intensive glacier loss over tp immerzeel et al 2012 sorg et al 2012 the two result in a large amount of runoff and et especially in the southeastern tp lin et al 2021 xu et al 2020 however the southeastern himalayas exhibit a deceleration of the hydrological cycle with decreasing precipitation as mentioned above this process may be attributed to the weakened water vapor exchange between the asian monsoon region and tp with wind stilling yang et al 2014 5 4 implications and limitations climate change has attracted considerable attention because of its significant impact on the hydrological and atmospheric environments cuo et al 2013 hanittinan et al 2019 tp which is one of the most vulnerable regions is subject to considerable impacts of climate change on the water fluxes and states regarding precipitation gm et runoff and sm immerzeel et al 2010 lai et al 2020 moreover the water exchange in tp will exert influence on regional climate biological and hydrological systems in asia and play an important role in atmospheric circulation over europe and north america duan and duan 2020 the findings of this study have implications for understanding the acceleration of the hydrological cycle and its potential impacts on tp and surrounding regions under global warming the long term ensemble modeling illustrated that tp is undergoing increased water input which forces higher runoff and et as well as a wetter condition increasing sm in general et and sm exert influence on atmospheric and biological phenomena peng et al 2016 ullah et al 2018 for example the increases in et and sm may force more extensive vegetation areas including forests and grasslands and an overall improvement in the ecosystem and biological phenomena chen et al 2015 furthermore runoff plays an important role in water availability and it influences the economy and human lives regarding to floods or droughts immerzeel et al 2020 increasing runoff could promote water availability for the surrounding regions while for the local scale of tp the hydrological and ecological systems might tend to deteriorate for instance the region of the nyainqentanglha mountains is experiencing a large increasing trend in runoff 5 7 mm yr owing to glacier mass loss 5 8 mm yr the glacier area is projected to decline by 50 at the end of the 21st century in the southern and eastern tp zhao et al 2019 therefore runoff may introduce a high flooding risk to the tp and surrounding regions water resources may face a decrease in the near future lutz et al 2014 sorg et al 2012 thus relevant measures such as flood prevention and water diversion should be gradually implemented and enhanced the uncertainty quantification for the water budget components implies the capability of the ensemble modeling method the precipitation estimation from the ensemble products is more reliable in the eastern tp because of the small cv and it has the largest impact on runoff simulation among the hydrological forcing variables the hydrological ensemble modeling used in this study is capable of quantifying the uncertainties of water budgets and estimating their fluctuation ranges table 4 ensemble modeling which extracts the benefit of available remote sensing products could therefore provide an important reference for other studies especially for areas with sparse ground based observations this study has limitations in estimation method and model forcing data which may introduce potential uncertainties in water budget estimation first the melted glacier water and the rainfall on glacier area is assumed to directly convert to surface runoff which may cause a relative overestimation of runoff moreover the degree day glacier algorithm fails to consider glacier solidification or gm et conversion probably leading to an overestimation of gm and underestimation of et second the nine precipitation products were downscaled or upscaled for the same resolution thus the scale change by interpolation or merging may bring additional uncertainties in precipitation and related water budget estimation and our work only focused on uncertainties from precipitation the other datasets for model forcing e g temperature and wind speed merit further investigation especially for temperature in the glacier areas third the glacier volume changes were not verified due to inadequate glacier data while we evaluated spring runoff fig 2 and compared with other studies to partly reflect the glacier change and the ground based observations for model calibration and validation are mainly in the eastern tp which implies the higher uncertainties of water budget estimation in the western area because of insufficient calibration therefore more ground based observations and remote sensing data are needed for model forcing and evaluation 6 conclusion this study identified the hydrological cycle based on hydrological ensemble modeling of long term water budgets 1984 2015 on tp ensemble modeling featured the integration of multiple precipitation products cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd persiann cdr cmorph bld gpcp 1dd tmpa thereby estimating the water budget components and their uncertainties moreover gm and its influence were quantified using a degree day glacier algorithm in our study the main results are summarized as follows 1 the ensemble modeling method can fully utilize multiple remote sensing precipitation products and neutralize the weakness of a single forcing it has great potential for long term water budget estimation in areas with scarcity of ground observations 2 the ensemble modeling revealed that the annual water input precipitation and gm of tp was approximately 438 mm during the study period with approximately 3 7 contributed by gm annual et and runoff took away approximately 263 mm and 173 mm of water respectively thus the soil water storage exhibited a slightly positive change each year 2 4 mm yr furthermore precipitation and gm exhibited various seasonal dynamics with high percentages occurring in summer over 58 and 83 respectively which drive massive water exchanges in this season 58 of annual et and 60 of runoff 3 the hydrological cycle exhibited an acceleration phenomenon as evidenced by increasing precipitation 2 3 mm yr and et 1 5 mm yr the hydrological cycle was more intensive in the us watershed which exhibited larger annual water input 642 mm and high increasing precipitation 2 6 mm yr and gm 3 3 mm yr the southern tp presented a decreasing precipitation and runoff but the nyainqentanglha mountains showed an acceleration of the hydrological cycle owing to the increasing gm 4 the uncertainties the cv values of precipitation and runoff were 30 and the cv of et was approximately 25 followed by gm and sm the uncertainties of the components presented a dominating spatial distribution of higher cv values in the western and southern tp this pattern indicates that precipitation products are generally more reliable in the eastern tp than in the other parts and the uncertainties in precipitation have the strongest influence on runoff followed by et this study has limitations regarding the modeling method and the forcing data however our work shows clear advantages in mapping the comprehensive water budget and identifying the acceleration of the hydrological cycle during the 1984 2015 period the findings could provide a useful reference for ecological and environmental governance and water management in tp and surrounding regions moreover the ensemble method can be established in any other data sparse regions because more satellite products are freely available for global scale to obtain more reliable water budget estimates future studies should focus on ground based observations of glacier dynamics climatic and hydrological fluxes and states at a fine scale furthermore uncertainties can also emerge using only one hydrological model thus it would be beneficial to integrate more hydrological models to

2697,global warming potentially increases precipitation and intensifies water exchange thereby accelerating the hydrological cycle the tibetan plateau tp is an asian water tower in which the water budget varies and its anomaly exerts stress on resource availability few studies have quantified long term water budgets across tp owing to scarcity of ground based observations and uncertainties in remote sensing data in this study water budget components i e precipitation glacial melting gm evapotranspiration et runoff and soil moisture sm state in tp are synthetically estimated for the past three decades the water budget estimation benefits from a gm coupled hydrological ensemble modeling which is forced by nine precipitation products with seven from satellite methods the results show that the ensemble modeling effectively captures the dynamics of runoff et and terrestrial water storage the long term average annual water input sum of precipitation and gm was approximately 438 mm with 4 contribution from gm for which the annual et and runoff take away was approximately 263 and 173 mm respectively from 1984 to 2015 the four water fluxes significantly increased with varying rates 2 3 mm yr precipitation 0 9 mm yr gm 1 5 mm yr et 1 1 mm yr runoff which suggested an accelerating hydrological cycle particularly increasing gm 5 8 mm yr in the nyainqentanglha mountains in southern tp induced high yield runoff 800 mm these estimations aid in yielding robust solutions for water management in tp and neighboring regions the accelerated hydrological cycle implies potential flooding risk and vulnerability of the hydrological system under climate change keywords tibetan plateau water budget glacier melting hydrological ensemble modeling vic glacier model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is known as the third pole with an average altitude of over 4000 m it is the source area of about ten major rivers including the yellow yangtze mekong salween brahmaputra and indus rivers runoff generated from tp provides valuable water resources for downstream regions precipitation and evapotranspiration et dominate the land surface hydrological processes and connect processes in the hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere on tp and surrounding areas zhang and yang 2010 soil moisture sm acts as a distinct hydroclimatic factor characterizing land atmosphere water and energy interchanges long et al 2019 yang et al 2021 in recent decades global climate has been experiencing significant alterations owing to the natural and anthropogenic forcing troch et al 2008 climate change likely promotes increased precipitation and a higher frequency of extreme precipitation events silva et al 2017 which is the main driver of et and soil moisture dynamics consequently regional and global terrestrial hydrological processes may experience various accelerations allan and zveryaev 2011 ji et al 2020 liu and curry 2010 the acceleration of the hydrological cycle is also probably reflected in tp as the region has complex climatic conditions and extensive cryospheric landforms ji et al 2020 xu et al 2008 yang et al 2011 specifically climate change has strengthened precipitation over the central tp but has led to less water vapor exchange in the southern and eastern regions yang et al 2014 glacier melting gm has also been enhanced due to the disappearance of fresh snow and a decline in albedo in a warming climate barnett et al 2005 thereby increasing the water supply to downstream regions immerzeel et al 2010 however the intensified hydrological cycle on tp is unstable as the precipitation and gm changes may cause substantial variability to the water partition among et runoff and soil moisture sm xie et al 2006 meanwhile the water budget and its dynamics are strongly coupled with energy and biological cycles rodriguez iturbe 2000 therefore estimating long term water budget components on tp is one of the most important issues under climate change and associated water resource management scott and biederman 2019 most studies concerning the hydrological cycle on tp illustrated only a subset of water budget components as the main water input precipitation shows high spatial heterogeneity because of the complex monsoons and mountain blockages on tp it exhibited an increasing trend on tp during the past two decades ouyang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2011 other than that glacier mass change as a unique hydrological process on tp provides substantial water to most watersheds on tp e g the sources of salween brahmaputra rivers it can be the main contributor to the increasing runoff and related hydrological factors lutz et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 given the precipitation and glacier melting conditions runoff and et are characterized by strong spatio temporal variability goodrich et al 2004 li et al 2014 however few studies have attempted to provide a synthesized quantitative view of long term water budget patterns or quantified the change patterns of the hydrological cycle on tp lutz and immerzeel 2013 estimated the tp water budget by integrating ground and satellite observations in a distributed hydrological model but only for a short duration 2008 2010 moreover estimating or modeling the water budget for tp is challenging owing to the scarcity of hydrometeorological observations and the extensive cryosphere given the sparse distribution of ground based hydrological observations on tp it is difficult to perform an acceptable hydrological modeling based on ground based data alone maussion et al 2014 satellite products provide an encouraging alternative but have considerable discrepancies among different products which may pose uncertainties in water budget analysis and hydrological modeling ullah et al 2018 wang et al 2020 ensemble method was proposed aiming to reduce subjectivity in hydrological modeling and to increase the level of confidence in simulations seiller et al 2017 the method has been widely implemented and proved high performance worldwide for example the application of ensemble precipitation forcing for streamflow simulations in the pipiripau basin in brazil strauch et al 2012 and the ensemble physical parameterizations for rainfall forecasting in the fuping and zijingguan basins in northern china tian et al 2019 however ensemble methods may face uncertainties from ensemble members and most studies only consider three or four members in the ensemble method ma and zhang 2022 strauch et al 2012 additionally the glaciers faced variability from global climate change zhao et al 2019 with obvious mass decrease in snow and or glacier dominated regions e g alaska arctic canada antarctic and himalayas in tp hugonnet et al 2021 yao et al 2019 glacier mass change can provide substantial water for runoff and may regulate hydrological processes barnett et al 2005 thus a long term synthesis and quantitative assessment of the water budget is necessary on tp and reasonable modeling methods are needed to consider uncertainties from the limited data and the impact of gm in this study we aimed to quantify the water budgets including precipitation gm et runoff and sm of the top 1 m thickness and identify the dynamic pattern of the hydrological cycle on tp over the past 30 years to consider the impact of gm on tp we coupled a glacier melting algorithm with the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model hereinafter named as vic glacier and as for the uncertainty from climate forcing especially precipitation we performed a hydrological ensemble modeling that is driven by nine precipitation products the ensemble modeling of vic glacier model would be evaluated regarding runoff sm et and water storage after that the spatial temporal dynamics and uncertainties of the water budgets were calculated from the nine ensemble members our work improved understanding of water balance patterns on tp thereby has implications for water resource management for tp and downstream regions moreover our work indicates that an ensemble method can be reference for data sparse areas and presents the importance of snow and glacier melting in water balance for alpine mountains 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the tp region is situated in central asia covering an area of approximately 2 5 million km2 fig 1 it has complex climatic conditions including tropical humid semi humid monsoon and semi arid climates the average temperature ranges from 20 c in the southeastern tp to approximately 6 c in the northwestern region influenced by multiple sources of water vapor and mountain blockage its precipitation presents evident spatial variability with an average annual value ranging from 50 to 2000 mm moreover tp is characterized by extensive snow and glacier coverage with a total glacier area of approximately 50 000 km2 yao et al 2007 especially in the himalayas nyainqentanglha and tanggula mountains glaciers and precipitation promote a dense river network on tp including headwaters of five major asian rivers the yangtze yellow brahmaputra salween and mekong rivers the tp region can be divided into eight subregions hexi qaidam inner upper yellow uye upper yangtze uya upper salween us upper mekong um and upper brahmaputra ub watershed fig 1 the first three subregions hexi qaidam and inner are situated in the northern and western parts of tp which have relatively low precipitation as the water vapor mainly comes from the mid latitude westerlies the other five are closed watersheds uye uya us um and ub located in the eastern or southeastern parts of tp in these watersheds precipitation is relatively high because of the monsoons originating from the arabian sea the south china sea and the western pacific the eight subregions have varying glacier coverage with the smallest area in the uye 134 km2 and the largest in the ub 4225 km2 zhang et al 2013 2 2 data availability and processing 2 2 1 precipitation datasets precipitation is one of the most influential driving forces in hydrological modeling based on previous studies on precipitation evaluation we selected nine precipitation products table 1 for hydrological modeling the nine products are all widely used and their performance have been proved on tp beck et al 2017 kai et al 2014 wang et al 2020 among the nine products the cma and cpc global products are gauge based datasets while the other seven products mainly rely on remote sensing retrieval and data fusion technologies notably each precipitation product has its advantages and limitations and it is difficult to establish a reliable bias correction method in places with scarce gauge observations such as the western tp therefore instead of bias correction for the precipitation products in this study we adopted ensemble modeling to quantify the uncertainties of the simulated water budget components the spatial resolutions of the nine precipitation products were between 0 05 and 1 0 and four of the products had a resolution of 0 25 i e cma cmorph bld persiann cdr tmpa to simplify the modeling all precipitation products were downscaled or upscaled to the same resolution of 0 25 specifically the products i e cpc global mswep and gpcp 1dd with a resolution coarser than 0 25 were subjected to bilinear interpolation and the chirps and cmfd products with resolutions finer than 0 25 were averaged into a 0 25 resolution moreover given the time span of these products and a three year warm up period for all hydrological simulations the simulated water budget components were from three groups 1984 2015 cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd 1986 2015 cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd persiann cdr and 2001 2015 cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd persiann cdr cmorph bld gpcp 1dd tmpa the simulated water budget components during 1984 1985 period corresponded to the mean values from five simulation realizations cma cpc global mswep chirps and cmfd the persiann cdr driven simulation realization was added during 1986 2001 period and after 2001 the simulated water budget components were obtained from all the nine simulation realizations 2 2 2 other model input data the model input data included topography meteorological forcing vegetation and soil data table 2 the topographical data i e the digital elevation model dem obtained from the us geological survey website were used to delineate river networks and extract boundaries of subregions in tp the meteorological forcing data included precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed and relative humidity the precipitation has been described above and the other forcing variables were generated by interpolating 156 cma stations the data from the cma stations have undergone strict quality control to eliminate evident anomaly values e g precipitation less than 0 mm kai et al 2014 the interpolation was based on the inverse distance weighting method considering a 6 5 c km decline rate to reflect the temperature dependence of altitude xie et al 2015 the vegetation input includes a land cover map for vegetation types and associated vegetation parameters the land cover map was derived from the classification data for the year 2010 liu et al 2010 and had a spatial resolution of 1 km and 12 land cover types vegetation parameters were obtained from nijssen et al 2001 ftp ftp hydro washington edu the soil input includes a soil cover map and the associated soil parameters the soil cover map was obtained based on a 30 30 arc second resolution soil characteristics dataset zhu et al 2020 soil physical parameters such as field capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived from a china soil dataset dai et al 2013 and other parameters e g bubbling pressure and thermal damping depth were defined according to the soil dataset from the food and agriculture organization nijssen et al 2001 the gm process simulation requires the glacier distribution and the degree day factor ddf parameter the glacier distribution dataset used the second chinese glacier inventory it was generated based on remote sensing products and google earth images during 2004 2011 guo et al 2017 the glacier distribution dataset was downloaded from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https data tpdc ac cn zh hans liu et al 2012 and it has been widely used for glacier related studies chen et al 2017 su et al 2022 the glacier distribution dataset is in vector format and it was transferred to grids with spatial resolution of 0 005 in computation ddf parameter depends on the exposure of the glacier and is calculated based on a linear correlation between ice melt measured by ablation stakes from different glaciers and the sum of daily mean temperatures above the melting point zhang et al 2006 the ddfs have been widely and successfully applied in multiple researches including gm calculation lai et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 and streamflow simulation liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2 2 3 data for model evaluation the hydrological ensemble modeling was evaluated with observations of runoff et and sm and compared with satellite based products of et and terrestrial water storage tws streamflow data from five stations were converted to runoff by dividing the streamflow with the associated watershed area which was used for model calibration and validation the streamflow data generally have long time coverage 1970 to 2010 or after thus all nine simulation realizations can be calibrated and validated as shown in fig 1 the five stations are located at the outlets of the uye uya us um and ub watersheds which are distributed in the eastern and southern parts of tp with varying degrees of glacier coverage the in situ soil moisture observations were obtained from soil moisture and temperature measurement system smtms networks containing 89 stations with 25 stations in the pali network and 64 stations in the naqu network chen et al 2013 su et al 2011 the two networks located in mid southern tp with high altitude 4000 m fig 1 and provided sm data of 5 10 20 and 40 cm depth with daily time steps for the periods from august 2010 to december 2015 and august 2015 to december 2015 respectively it worth noting that the observed sm only referred to liquid water so the data may have uncertainties in representing total water in frozen state chen et al 2013 et was evaluated using observations from four eddy covariance towers and a satellite based et product the eddy covariance towers are located in the southern tp namely naqu zhufeng namucuo and maqu with forest or grass vegetation types as a reliable remote sensing product the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam et product was used as reference data in this study because it has been successfully applied in tp for et evaluation and water budget calculation abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 li et al 2019 the gleam et has relatively long temporal coverage 1980 present and a spatial resolution of 0 25 satellite based tws data were obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace this product can measure the variations in gravity and provide monthly tws anomalies with a spatial resolution of 0 25 adam 2002 grace has extensive applications worldwide including water balance and tws calculation in tp li et al 2019 liu et al 2021 meng et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 model description and setup the vic model is a land surface scheme that uses a variable infiltration curve and a nonlinear formulation to simulate the baseflow and deep soil moisture movement the model considers multiple vegetation types and one main soil layer within each calculation unit liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 and it can capture the dynamics of water and energy balances moreover the model calculates snow cover by dividing precipitation into rainfall and snowfall according to air temperature snow melt and accumulation are computed based on land surface energy balance thus the vic model has been successfully applied in studies at various scales cuo et al 2013 xie et al 2015 in this study we conducted the simulation with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 hour however the original vic model did not consider the glacier melt process zhang et al 2013 and su et al 2016 coupled a degree day glacier algorithm with the vic model vic glacier to reflect the glacier hydrology this study extends the application to estimate the water balance in tp the total runoff calculated using this model is computed as follows 1 r i f g i 1 f r vic i where r i is the total runoff depth mm in grid i f is the glacier fraction which is calculated by dividing the glacier area with the area of the gird cell i r vic i is the runoff depth mm in grid i calculated by the original vic model and g i is the runoff from the glaciated area mm including liquid precipitation and glacier runoff gm i in grid i gm i is calculated as follows 2 gm i ddf t i t i 0 0 t i 0 where ddf is the degree day factor m m c d a y and is determined according to zhang et al 2006 t i is daily mean temperature above glacier surface c a roughly estimate of ti is assumed to be equal to the temperature of the modeling grid cell in the size of 0 25 in the study wang et al 2021 but this may overestimate ti because glaciers are generally located in mountains with high attitude and low temperature we recalculated ti for each glacier at a finer spatial resolution 0 005 and considered the decrease of temperature with the increase of the glacier altitude 6 5 c per 1 km so ti for gm i calculation is lower than the grid cell average temperature that is the forcing for other hydrological processes the glacier volume affects the gm estimation and determines the upper limit of annual gm in this study the glacier volume was calculated using the volume area scaling relation method radić et al 2007 radić et al 2008 3 v 0 04 s 1 43 where v is the glacier volume and s is the glacier area considering the glacier dynamics ragettlia et al 2016 yan et al 2021 the glacier volume and area were updated every year using equation 3 this update was repeated for all the vic glacier simulation periods notably snow is assumed to melt prior to the gm process thus the gm will be suspended if there is a snowpack on the glacier zhang et al 2013 the snow calculation is consistent in non glacier and glacier areas 3 2 model calibration and evaluation method there are seven influential parameters for a vic model simulation namely the infiltration parameter b i n f three baseflow parameters d s w s d smax and the thicknesses of three soil layers d 1 d 2 d 3 liang and xie 2001 zhu et al 2020 the model was calibrated by observed runoff from the five watersheds and was validated regarding runoff sm et and tws the observed runoff datasets were divided into two segments for model calibration and validation respectively the first segment covered approximately 20 years and the latter one ranged between 5 and 10 years for each simulation with one precipitation product model calibration was conducted to adjust the seven parameters to match the simulated runoff with the observations each ensemble member therefore may have different model parameters according to model calibration and validation after adjusting the parameters in the five watersheds the adjusted parameters were transferred to ungauged regions based on their climatic similarity i e similar precipitation patterns or the same climate zones zhu et al 2021 the simulated sm for the top layer will be validated with the observed sm at the depth of 10 cm from the smtms network to avoid the scale difference between the simulations and the in situ observations the average sm values were calculated based on the multiple in situ observations and then they were used to validate the simulated sm of grid cells that contained the in situ observations the simulated et values were validated with four eddy covariance towers and compared with the gleam et it worth noting that the spatial resolution of the vic glacier simulations is 0 25 and each grid cell may contain a variety of vegetation types while the eddy covariance towers can only capture small scale et information 1 km in order to relieve the mismatch of spatial scale between the two the observed et was used to evaluate the simulated et with the same vegetation type in the corresponding grid moreover the simulated tws change twsc was compared with the grace estimates for the period 2003 2014 at a yearly scale the missing data in grace were filled by linear interpolation based on the values corresponding to the previous and following months the yearly twsc from grace was calculated as the difference between the values of december and january and the yearly twsc from the ensemble modeling was equal to the difference between precipitation and water output runoff and et in this study we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient r and relative error er to evaluate the performance of the nine simulation realizations 3 3 ensemble method and uncertainty representation given the nine precipitation products we performed ensemble modeling with nine independent simulation realizations the average values and 95 confidence intervals 1 96 standard deviation of the nine simulation realizations were served as the values and fluctuation ranges of water budget components based on the knowledge of statistics and normal distribution the average value of a dataset generally shows the highest occurrence probability and the 95 confidence interval can cover 95 occurrence probability of a dataset anctil et al 2009 the uncertainty mentioned in this study refers to the discrepancy in water budget components in the nine simulation realizations and it is usually defined by a statistical method according to montanari 2007 the coefficient of variation cv was used to measure uncertainty thus the cv is calculated with respect to the uncertainty of each water budget component based on the multi year average results of the nine simulation realizations 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the nine vic glacier simulation realizations were calibrated and validated using the streamflow data from the five watersheds as shown in fig 2 a and table 3 the ensemble mean based on the nine simulation realizations agreed well with the observations as they present similar dynamic changes during both the calibrated and validated periods the mean simulation realizations achieve nses generally higher than 0 6 and r values over 0 8 during the calibrated period however the runoff simulations underestimated the observations to some degree as the ers were negative for the five watersheds specifically the ers in the um and ub watersheds were over 20 similar patterns were showed during the validation period the nse and r values were approximately 0 7 and 0 9 respectively with ers ranging from 25 to 3 considering the absence of gm runoff observations this study evaluated the model performance on spring runoff as the gm has a greater impact in this season from march to may the evaluation was conducted in uye uya um and ub watersheds the us watershed was excluded as only yearly streamflow data were available there as shown in fig 2b the simulated spring runoff presented similar temporal dynamics compared to the observed data the r values ranged between 0 5 and 0 7 and the ers were generally negative which indicated that the spring runoff simulations generally underestimated to some degree however the absolute ers were lower than 25 in the four watersheds demonstrating that the vic glacier model presents acceptable performance for the gm process fig 3 shows the validation results of the sm the average sm at 10 cm obtained from the nine simulation realizations aligned with the smtms observations the er values of the naqu and pali networks were below 10 and the r values were 0 88 and 0 85 respectively the biases may be attributed to the input data the simulation method and frozen soil notably the simulations presented obvious overestimations during the winter season from december to february in the following year the frozen soil may be a major reason for the overestimation as the sm observations can only represent liquid water rather than solid state which may bring uncertainties in representing total water in winter season the average et achieved by the nine simulation realizations was evaluated by ground based observations from the four eddy covariance towers and was compared with gleam et fig 4 the er values in the naqu and zhufeng towers were approximately 41 and 65 respectively the large deviation may be attributed to the extensive glaciers and frozen soil cover in tp or the uncertainty within the observations despite the deviations the simulated et presented consistent daily dynamics with the observations especially in the maqu tower r 0 8 fig 4a in comparison with the spatial distribution and interannual variation fig 4b c the simulated et exhibited a similar spatial distribution and monthly dynamics as the gleam et with er and r values of 13 4 and 0 98 respectively the simulated twsc anomaly was further compared with the grace product on a yearly scale as shown in fig 5 the average twsc anomaly obtained from the nine simulation realizations were consistent with the grace data the r values for the entire tp were approximately 0 65 the simulations present relatively poor performance in the uye watershed with r of approximately 0 40 however the rs for other subregions were generally higher than 0 6 especially for the uya and ub subregions r 0 75 given the validation in runoff et sm and twsc the ensemble modeling achieves an acceptable performance for the water budget component simulation therefore the simulation realizations can be used to identify the dynamics of the water balance components in tp 4 2 spatial temporal variability of the long term water budgets the spatial distribution of the water budget components that is precipitation runoff gm et sm as well as their uncertainties were quantified based on the nine simulation realizations here sm was defined as the mean soil water content of the soil profile for the top 1 m thickness as the sm of this thickness can characterize the seasonal cycle of soil water state without being affected by precipitation events as shown in fig 6 the average annual precipitation exhibits a southeast northwest decreasing gradient over tp it is 1500 mm in the southern himalayas mountains and less than 100 mm in the northwestern part of tp the gm is mainly distributed in mountains with high altitudes and is approximately 16 mm however the gm exceeded 200 mm in the southeastern part of tp especially in the nyainqentanglha mountains in nyingchi and changdu annual et was consistent with the precipitation in terms of the spatial pattern and ranged from below 50 mm to over 500 mm the annual total runoff showed significant differences between the northwestern and southern tp specifically it is less than 10 mm in the northwestern tp and over 800 mm in the southeastern tp the long term average sm ranges from 115 mm to 445 mm in tp and is represented as wet in the southeastern 180 mm and dry in the western part of tp 150 mm the uncertainties of the five water budget components measured by the cv are shown in fig 7 for precipitation the average cv was approximately 33 which was generally higher in the western and southern parts of tp but it was below 20 in the eastern tp large uncertainties showed in the runoff simulation as the average cv was higher than 50 the cvs for et gm and sm were generally low 25 the estimates of the five water budget components have small uncertainties in the eastern tp but large in the southern and western regions the water budget components generally exhibited increasing trends during the study period fig 8 precipitation increased at a rate of 2 3 mm yr for the entire tp except for its decreasing trend in the southeastern himalayas gm increased with a value of approximately 0 9 mm yr and exhibited the highest increase in the nyainqentanglha mountains et and runoff also exhibited increasing trends for the whole tp 1 5 and 1 1 mm yr but decreasing trends in the southeastern tp notably affected by precipitation and gm runoff exhibited more complicated patterns it generally had a decreasing trend in the southeastern himalayas but an increasing trend in nyainqentanglha mountains the sm showed slight changes during the study period 0 1 mm yr and it generally increases in the western tp and decreases in the eastern region 4 3 subregional scale water budget closure fig 9 shows the water budgets over tp and the eight internal subregions we defined that the water input to the hydrological system in tp was mainly contributed by precipitation and gm the average annual water input sum of precipitation and gm in tp was approximately 438 mm during the period 1984 2015 with approximately 3 7 contribution from gm among the eight subregions the annual water inputs in the hexi qaidam and inner subregions were less than 250 mm while the water inputs were higher than 390 mm in the other five watersheds the largest gm contribution appeared in us 7 2 and qaidam 4 4 subregions but the values were less than 2 in the uya um uye and inner subregions as for the water output et accounts for a large amount of tp with an annual value of approximately 263 mm followed by a runoff of approximately 173 mm the ratio of et to water output was generally higher in the northern tp and lower in the southern part of the region specifically the ratios were 70 in the hexi qaidam uye inner and uya subregions but less than 65 in the southern watersheds of tp i e the us and ub watersheds as shown in fig 9 the soil water storage change δs was positive 2 4 mm for tp during the 1984 2015 period among the eight subregions the ub watershed exhibited the most obvious increase 8 8 mm for soil water storage followed by the um 1 2 mm and uya 0 9 mm watersheds while the hexi qaidam and uye subregions presented negative δs suggesting a slight decrease in soil water storage notably δs was different from twsc which described in subsection 3 3 and 4 1 here gm was regarded as a water input for the hydrological cycle δs was therefore calculated as the difference between the water input gm and precipitation and water output runoff and et while twsc was equal to the difference between precipitation and water output i e runoff and et the annual dynamics of the water budget are shown in fig 10 and table 4 tp presented an acceleration of the hydrological cycle as all four water fluxes precipitation runoff gm and et showed increasing trends during 1984 2015 particularly precipitation over tp presented a sudden increase around the year of 1997 i e from 391 mm in the period of 1984 1997 to 439 mm during 1998 2015 however it exhibited a slight increase of 0 5 and 0 1 mm yr respectively during these two periods the acceleration of the hydrological cycle was also demonstrated at the subregional scale although the four water fluxes exhibited various trends precipitation in the hexi subregion has the lowest increase of about 1 8 mm yr while the trends exceed 2 0 mm yr in the other subregions with the largest in the uya um and ub watersheds 3 0 mm yr gm changed in the hexi inner and um subregions with rates varying from 0 3 to 0 5 mm yr and the largest glacier mass loss occurred in the us watershed with rate of 3 3 mm yr as to the output water fluxes the runoff and et showed increases in the subregions located in northern and eastern tp i e hexi qaidam inner and uye subregions ranging between 0 7 and 1 0 mm yr and 1 2 2 0 mm yr respectively but they have larger increases in the southern tp i e us and ub subregions with rates beyond 1 3 and 2 2 mm yr respectively the fluctuation range of each water flux varies in tp for the entire tp the fluctuation ranges of the average annual precipitation gm runoff and et were within 315 529 12 20 108 239 and 219 306 mm respectively the us and ub watersheds presented the largest precipitation 394 890 and 252 860 mm respectively and gm fluctuation ranges 42 57 and 4 23 mm respectively therefore the two watersheds generally exhibited the largest fluctuation ranges for runoff and et however the uya subregion exhibited relatively smaller fluctuation intervals of water budgets with values of 24 mm for precipitation 26 mm for et and less than 10 mm for gm and runoff 4 4 seasonal cycle of water budget components the four water budget components i e precipitation gm et and runoff have different seasonal cycles as shown in fig 11 and table 5 for the entire tp approximately 58 of the precipitation occurs in summer from june to august with only approximately 4 in winter from december to february glaciers also experience large losses during summer 80 which leads to massive water exchanges during this season 58 of annual et and 60 of runoff the eight subregions presented similar patterns in tp precipitation and gm were prominent in summer which promoted abundant et and runoff 58 65 for et and 52 73 for runoff in particular the ub watershed exhibited the highest percentage of summer precipitation 65 and the us watershed had the largest summer gm 44 mm the seasonal cycle of sm was not shown in fig 11 because it was relatively stable in all four seasons table 5 regarding the water output et generally consumes most of the water approximately 60 in tp with the highest percentage in winter 74 and the lowest in autumn 57 although the peak et of approximately 60 mm per month in july for the eight subregions the ratios of et to the water output ranged between 56 and 79 and the ratios also exhibited seasonal dynamics the highest ratios generally occurred in winter and the low values happened in summer and autumn seasons for instance the ratio was approximately 65 in winter and only about 55 in the summer and autumn seasons in the us watershed the low percentages of summer et implied a relatively high summer runoff generation capability large precipitation and gm as well as the high conversion ratio of runoff in summer may together cause a relatively intensive summer runoff in tp especially in the subregions of the us and ub the timing of the peak runoff differed in the subregions fig 11 generally peak flow appears in july but it can postpone to august in the inner and ub subregions intriguingly the uye watershed seemed to present a double peak flow regime in july and september approximately 29 mm and 25 mm per month respectively the timing of peak flow is largely determined by the climatological precipitation rhythm for example the double peak flow regime in the uye was consistent with the climatological pattern of precipitation 4 5 hotspot area with intensive runoff the ensemble modeling showed that the changes in the water budget components have evident spatial variability in particular intensive precipitation and gm appeared in the southeastern tp which caused an average runoff of 800 mm in this area we take two subregions i e the nyainqentanglha mountains and the southeastern himalayas as hotspots and identify their runoff characteristics and the contributions of precipitation and gm the locations of the two subregions are marked in fig 8 the two subregions demonstrated high runoff yield fig 12 but exhibited contrasting trends during the 1984 2015 period increased runoff in the nyainqentanglha mountains and decreased runoff in the southeastern himalayas specifically in the nyainqentanglha mountains the average annual runoff was approximately 810 mm with an increasing rate of 5 7 mm yr the gm runoff contributed to over 45 of the total runoff with a significant increase of 5 8 mm yr the precipitation runoff presented a decreasing change of approximately 0 1 mm yr in the southeastern himalayas however precipitation runoff 837 mm contributed to approximately 98 of the total runoff 852 mm and it exhibited a decreasing trend 3 1 mm yr resulting in a decrease in total runoff at a rate of 2 8 mm yr 5 discussion 5 1 benefit of the ensemble modeling the ensemble method can be established with multi forcing modeling multi models and or multi parameter approaches and it is inspired from modular frameworks empirical model development and multi model applications seiller et al 2017 wei et al 2020 the method benefits from extracting multiple information from the ensemble members and neutralizing the weakness of a single one thereby increasing the credibility of the simulations henrik et al 2014 strauch et al 2012 it has been increasingly used in addressing hydrological problems and can be a key step to mitigate uncertainties granata 2019 ma and zhang 2022 the ensemble method has been applied worldwide including tp qi et al 2020 pakistan waseem et al 2015 u s sharma et al 2019 taiwan yang et al 2020 and canada veĺazquez et al 2009 however the spatiotemporal uncertainties associated with initial conditions of models and parameters may hinder the efficiency of the ensemble modelling the method thereby is not always with acceptable performance veĺazquez et al 2009 yang et al 2020 our work selected high performance precipitation products referring to wang et al 2020 before the ensemble modelling rather than conducted the modelling directly moreover our work employed more ensemble members i e nine precipitation products than most other studies thereby improving statistical significance as more samples will likely achieve more reliable statistical estimation the ensemble means in our work present satisfactory performance for runoff et sm and twsc based on extensive evaluations lacking of accuracy is one of the primary motivations for using an ensemble approach considering the insufficient data in tp and the importance of precipitation in hydrological modelling strauch et al 2012 the ensemble modelling regarding precipitation diversity may effectively improve the accuracy of water balance estimation in tp this method is also applicable for water balance estimation in any data sparse regions partly because the satellite products are freely available for global scales we further remind that the ensemble simulation strategies can be established with different situations such as considering temperature diversity for energy balance simulation moreover the ensemble modeling could provide a probabilistic assessment and uncertainties of simulations replacing the traditional method of a deterministic or single model simulations veĺazquez et al 2009 this study provided reliable probabilistic forecast and confirmed the discrepancy of the nine precipitation products in tp and its influence on other water budget components 5 2 estimates of long term water budgets in tp based on hydrological ensemble modeling our study quantified the spatial patterns and seasonal cycles of the water balance components the average annual precipitation exhibited a southeast northwest decreasing gradient over tp with the highest value in the southern himalayan mountains 1000 mm most of the precipitation occurred in summer 58 with less than 4 in winter these patterns may come from multiple climatic conditions in tp as the southern region is dominated by the indian and east asian monsoons with high water vapor during the summer season while the northern tp is dominated by mid latitude westerlies with relatively low water vapor li et al 2020 zhu et al 2011 the mean annual gm was approximately 16 mm in tp and it exhibited significant seasonal dynamics with over 80 in the summer influenced by air temperature it has been reported that the mean annual gm was about 48 mm wang et al 2021 which may be an overestimation because the grid cell average temperature was used to compute gm in equation 2 this study updated the temperature of the glacier surface by considering the elevation effect as described in subsection 3 1 lutz et al 2014 and qi et al 2022 also estimates gm in eastern tp they showed that gm contributes approximately 16 20 to discharge in ub watershed which is much larger than our work the difference likely stems from the boundary definition the ub watershed included the nyainqentanglha mountains in lutz et al 2014 and qi et al 2022 but our work mainly focused on the upper watershed that excluded nyainqentanglha mountains the nyainqentanglha mountains have extensive glacier cover and warm winds from the southern tp bay of bengal south china sea and the western pacific resulting in a massive glacier loss 48 2 m yr bibi et al 2018 yao et al 2012 besides that our work demonstrated the reliable gm estimation regarding the spring runoff evaluation and similar gm contribution values in most watersheds e g us uya um and uye compared with lutz et al 2014 and qi et al 2022 both the precipitation and gm input fluxes lead to high magnitudes of et and runoff especially in the summer season and the southern tp moreover et generally consumes approximately 60 of the total water input over tp with higher percentages in winter and the northern tp similar spatio temporal pattern of et has been observed by yang et al 2011 and kuang and jiao 2016 and also obtained by li et al 2019 in five source watersheds of tp and by zhang et al 2018 in tp with point scale estimation the high et percentage in winter may be because of the drizzle or scarce gm which evapotranspired before being converted into runoff the low et percentage in the southern tp may be due to the high runoff generated from the steep mountains we noticed ma and zhang 2022 used three precipitation products to drive a water carbon coupled biophysical model penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 and estimated the mean annual et up to 353 mm for 1982 2016 this difference may result from the precipitation forcing and the modeling our study employed more precipitation forcing datasets to estimate water budgets in tp in the southeastern tp we identified a region of high yield runoff of over 800 mm per year this phenomenon is mainly attributed to the high magnitudes of precipitation and gm the monsoons and the himalayan mountains together create a humid subtropical climate zone in the southern himalayas promoting annual precipitation up to 1000 mm gao and liu 2012 additionally the nyainqentanglha mountains are experiencing a warming pattern chen et al 2015 ji et al 2020 and massive glacier loss bibi et al 2018 yao et al 2012 thus the intensive gm and precipitation result in a large magnitude and an increasing trend of runoff 5 7 mm yr the uncertainties of the water budget components were calculated based on the discrepancy of the nine simulation realizations the uncertainty of precipitation was 30 and generally exhibited higher values in the western and southern parts of tp one of the primary reasons might be the different precipitation estimation instruments e g infrared and microwave beck et al 2017 the high uncertainties in the western and southern parts of tp may stem from the lack of post processing e g gauge data fusion for the products owing to the complex topography and limitations of observed data in the region kai et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the uncertainties were transferred to the water budget estimation the cv value for runoff was approximately 57 and the values for et gm and sm were lower than 25 the high cv of runoff estimates may also be attributed to insufficient model calibration in the western tp and the fact that runoff is more sensitive to precipitation uncertainties than the other forcing variables in general qi et al 2020 5 3 acceleration of hydrological cycle in tp the simulated results illustrated that tp experienced an intensified hydrological cycle during the 1980 2015 period all the water budgets exhibit increasing trends that is approximately 2 3 mm yr for precipitation 0 9 mm yr for gm 1 5 mm yr for et 1 1 mm yr for runoff and 0 1 mm yr for sm the increasing trends of one or several water budget components on tp have been partly evidenced in studies li et al 2019 lin et al 2021 lutz et al 2014 for instance shi et al 2016 found that sm increased significantly during 1980 2012 with an abrupt change in 2003 yang et al 2014 illustrated that precipitation et runoff and surface sm generally presented increasing trends during 1984 2006 except for the southern himalayan mountains immerzeel et al 2012 and wang et al 2019 demonstrated obvious glacier loss in tp influenced by global warming however our work has the advantage of synthetically mapping the long term dynamics of the water budget of tp the dynamic patterns may be largely attributed to the enhanced asian summer monsoon and deep convection triggered by the thermal force the asian summer monsoon brings more water moisture and deep convection exerts the troposphere stratosphere exchanges of water vapor fu et al 2006 moreover global warming directly forces massive surface heating thereby inducing intensive glacier loss over tp immerzeel et al 2012 sorg et al 2012 the two result in a large amount of runoff and et especially in the southeastern tp lin et al 2021 xu et al 2020 however the southeastern himalayas exhibit a deceleration of the hydrological cycle with decreasing precipitation as mentioned above this process may be attributed to the weakened water vapor exchange between the asian monsoon region and tp with wind stilling yang et al 2014 5 4 implications and limitations climate change has attracted considerable attention because of its significant impact on the hydrological and atmospheric environments cuo et al 2013 hanittinan et al 2019 tp which is one of the most vulnerable regions is subject to considerable impacts of climate change on the water fluxes and states regarding precipitation gm et runoff and sm immerzeel et al 2010 lai et al 2020 moreover the water exchange in tp will exert influence on regional climate biological and hydrological systems in asia and play an important role in atmospheric circulation over europe and north america duan and duan 2020 the findings of this study have implications for understanding the acceleration of the hydrological cycle and its potential impacts on tp and surrounding regions under global warming the long term ensemble modeling illustrated that tp is undergoing increased water input which forces higher runoff and et as well as a wetter condition increasing sm in general et and sm exert influence on atmospheric and biological phenomena peng et al 2016 ullah et al 2018 for example the increases in et and sm may force more extensive vegetation areas including forests and grasslands and an overall improvement in the ecosystem and biological phenomena chen et al 2015 furthermore runoff plays an important role in water availability and it influences the economy and human lives regarding to floods or droughts immerzeel et al 2020 increasing runoff could promote water availability for the surrounding regions while for the local scale of tp the hydrological and ecological systems might tend to deteriorate for instance the region of the nyainqentanglha mountains is experiencing a large increasing trend in runoff 5 7 mm yr owing to glacier mass loss 5 8 mm yr the glacier area is projected to decline by 50 at the end of the 21st century in the southern and eastern tp zhao et al 2019 therefore runoff may introduce a high flooding risk to the tp and surrounding regions water resources may face a decrease in the near future lutz et al 2014 sorg et al 2012 thus relevant measures such as flood prevention and water diversion should be gradually implemented and enhanced the uncertainty quantification for the water budget components implies the capability of the ensemble modeling method the precipitation estimation from the ensemble products is more reliable in the eastern tp because of the small cv and it has the largest impact on runoff simulation among the hydrological forcing variables the hydrological ensemble modeling used in this study is capable of quantifying the uncertainties of water budgets and estimating their fluctuation ranges table 4 ensemble modeling which extracts the benefit of available remote sensing products could therefore provide an important reference for other studies especially for areas with sparse ground based observations this study has limitations in estimation method and model forcing data which may introduce potential uncertainties in water budget estimation first the melted glacier water and the rainfall on glacier area is assumed to directly convert to surface runoff which may cause a relative overestimation of runoff moreover the degree day glacier algorithm fails to consider glacier solidification or gm et conversion probably leading to an overestimation of gm and underestimation of et second the nine precipitation products were downscaled or upscaled for the same resolution thus the scale change by interpolation or merging may bring additional uncertainties in precipitation and related water budget estimation and our work only focused on uncertainties from precipitation the other datasets for model forcing e g temperature and wind speed merit further investigation especially for temperature in the glacier areas third the glacier volume changes were not verified due to inadequate glacier data while we evaluated spring runoff fig 2 and compared with other studies to partly reflect the glacier change and the ground based observations for model calibration and validation are mainly in the eastern tp which implies the higher uncertainties of water budget estimation in the western area because of insufficient calibration therefore more ground based observations and remote sensing data are needed for model forcing and evaluation 6 conclusion this study identified the hydrological cycle based on hydrological ensemble modeling of long term water budgets 1984 2015 on tp ensemble modeling featured the integration of multiple precipitation products cma cpc global mswep chirps cmfd persiann cdr cmorph bld gpcp 1dd tmpa thereby estimating the water budget components and their uncertainties moreover gm and its influence were quantified using a degree day glacier algorithm in our study the main results are summarized as follows 1 the ensemble modeling method can fully utilize multiple remote sensing precipitation products and neutralize the weakness of a single forcing it has great potential for long term water budget estimation in areas with scarcity of ground observations 2 the ensemble modeling revealed that the annual water input precipitation and gm of tp was approximately 438 mm during the study period with approximately 3 7 contributed by gm annual et and runoff took away approximately 263 mm and 173 mm of water respectively thus the soil water storage exhibited a slightly positive change each year 2 4 mm yr furthermore precipitation and gm exhibited various seasonal dynamics with high percentages occurring in summer over 58 and 83 respectively which drive massive water exchanges in this season 58 of annual et and 60 of runoff 3 the hydrological cycle exhibited an acceleration phenomenon as evidenced by increasing precipitation 2 3 mm yr and et 1 5 mm yr the hydrological cycle was more intensive in the us watershed which exhibited larger annual water input 642 mm and high increasing precipitation 2 6 mm yr and gm 3 3 mm yr the southern tp presented a decreasing precipitation and runoff but the nyainqentanglha mountains showed an acceleration of the hydrological cycle owing to the increasing gm 4 the uncertainties the cv values of precipitation and runoff were 30 and the cv of et was approximately 25 followed by gm and sm the uncertainties of the components presented a dominating spatial distribution of higher cv values in the western and southern tp this pattern indicates that precipitation products are generally more reliable in the eastern tp than in the other parts and the uncertainties in precipitation have the strongest influence on runoff followed by et this study has limitations regarding the modeling method and the forcing data however our work shows clear advantages in mapping the comprehensive water budget and identifying the acceleration of the hydrological cycle during the 1984 2015 period the findings could provide a useful reference for ecological and environmental governance and water management in tp and surrounding regions moreover the ensemble method can be established in any other data sparse regions because more satellite products are freely available for global scale to obtain more reliable water budget estimates future studies should focus on ground based observations of glacier dynamics climatic and hydrological fluxes and states at a fine scale furthermore uncertainties can also emerge using only one hydrological model thus it would be beneficial to integrate more hydrological models to

2698,as an essential regulating service soil conservation service is the primary way to suppress soil erosion accurate assessment of soil conservation service can provide scientific support for regional ecological protection and is of great significance to regional environmental security however because of the lack of future high resolution meteorological data there are few researches on ecosystem services prediction resulting in limited persuasion to guide ecological construction therefore this study uses the wrf model to obtain a high resolution meteorological dataset 0 05 0 05 2021 2035 daily to drive the swat model in the jinghe river basin through this method we introduce the dynamical downscaling method into the research field of ecosystem services to predict the temporal spatial characteristics of soil conservation service the results indicate that first the dynamical downscaling results of the wrf model can reflect the magnitude temporal fluctuation and spatial distribution of regional precipitation and temperature second multi year average 2021 2035 soil conservation is 9 79 108 t rcp4 5 and 10 98 108 t rcp8 5 which are significantly higher than the 2000 2020 period 4 21 108 t the inter annual variation of soil conservation service is affected considerably by precipitation with correlation coefficients of 0 80 rcp4 5 and 0 81 rcp8 5 finally the spatial distribution of soil conservation service under two scenarios is similar the research results provide scientific support for ecological construction and scientific management and the research ideas are also applicable to other ecosystem services prediction at the watershed scale keywords soil conservation service climate change dynamical downscaling swat data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the ecosystem provides the human living environment and natural resources and is directly related to human well being and socio economic sustainability pedreschi et al 2018 climate change mainly characterized by global warming has become increasingly prominent and a major global environmental problem zickfeld et al 2017 climate change significantly affects the global supply of ecosystem services by altering ecosystem structure and function which poses a serious threat to human survival and socio economic sustainability fu et al 2020 the millennium ecosystem assessment report issued by the united nations pointed out that 15 of the 24 ecosystem services worldwide are declining millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the research on ecosystem services has attracted more and more attention from scholars at home and abroad and has become the frontier and hotspot of geography ecology and other disciplines costanza et al 2014 accurately grasping the laws of climate change simulating eco hydrological processes and quantitatively assessing ecosystem services responses to climate change in the context of global change are challenges that urgently need to be improved and solved soil conservation service is the erosion control capacity of ecosystems to prevent soil loss and store sediment liu et al 2019 as an ecosystem regulation service it is an important guarantee to prevent land degradation and reduce the risk of flood disaster previous studies on soil conservation service mainly used soil erosion models and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle was the most widely used anache et al 2017 liu et al 2021a this model is supplemented and improved by usda nrcs based on the universal soil loss equation usle the core of rusle is to calculate the impact factors such as rainfall runoff erosivity factor r land cover and management measures factor c and soil and water conservation measures factor p and take the difference between potential the maximum amount of soil erosion without surface vegetation and soil and water conservation measures and actual soil erosion as the supply of soil conservation service zheng et al 2021 the research on soil conservation service based on empirical rusle model bai et al 2012 has certain limitations geneletti 2013 because it does not consider the process of soil stripping transportation and sedimentation during soil erosion and lacks the analysis of erosion mechanism some scholars have recently begun to use hydrological models based on physical processes to study soil conservation service for example liu et al 2001 established the chinese soil loss equation csle considering the biological engineering and farming measures related to vegetation evolution to explore the soil loss rate of different vegetation cover types such as forest and grassland liu et al 2021b studied the soil conservation service and analyzed the impact of meteorological elements and topographic conditions on soil conservation service based on the soil and water assessment tool swat model bai et al 2021 introduced the long time series ndvi into the sediment module of the swat model improved the accuracy of sediment simulation of the model and further explored the relationship between soil conservation service and drought however most previous studies are current situation simulations for lack of high spatial resolution meteorological data in the future there are few studies on ecosystem service prediction under different climate scenarios so the persuasion to guide future ecological construction is limited as the primary tool for researching climate change lü et al 2020 climate models have broad applications in related fields with the development of theory and technology the prediction of climate variation based on the general circulation model gcm has entered a new stage of development 40 sets of gcms formulated by cmip5 have adopted representative concentration pathways rcps providing meteorological results under four scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 which provides a basis for climate change prediction research however the spatial resolution of gcm is generally 100 km and due to the lack of regional information gcms are unable to meet the needs of watershed simulation kong 2020 xu et al 2019 to make up for this deficiency the method of connecting global and regional scale climate change research mcsweeney et al 2015 by downscaling method came into being mainly including statistical downscaling method and dynamical downscaling method nasa released the nex gddp dataset based on the statistical downscaling method thrasher et al 2012 however only the temperature and precipitation data are provided which is insufficient to support hydrological process simulation other meteorological parameters need to be obtained by other means due to the constraints of historical statistics statistical downscaling methods cannot describe historical periods the changes in the situation are not suitable for areas where the correlation between large scale elements and regional elements is not apparent fan et al 2013 the dynamical downscaling method over couples regional and global climate models to predict future climate with clear physical meaning and meeting the information needs of regional climate simulation yu et al 2010 tested the weather research and foresting model wrf to simulate china s regional climate the research results showed that the regional model could improve temperature and precipitation simulation ability compared with the global model especially the simulation of annual average precipitation based on this method wu et al 2016 also downscaled the fnl data combined with accuracy verification which showed that the wrf model has a solid ability to simulate the temperature at 2 m and shortwave radiation the development of gcms and downscaling methods make it possible to predict future climate conditions and explore the response of ecosystem services under the climatic changing taking the jinghe river basin on the loess plateau as an example this study explored and evaluated the soil conservation service from 2021 to 2035 by taking into account land use prediction and climate change simulation firstly predicting the land use 2030 using ca markov model under the natural development scenario secondly dynamical downscaling the results of large scale gcms to obtain the meteorological data 0 05 0 05 daily with the help of multi level nesting of the wrf model finally the swat model is driven by land use and meteorological data based on future scenarios realizing the dynamic simulation of soil conservation service 2 data sources 2 1 study area the jinghe river basin 106 14 e 108 42 e 34 46 n 37 19 n with an area of 45 421 km2 is located in the central loess plateau china fig 1 the basin is situated in the transitional climate zone from semi humid to semi arid with severe soil erosion fragile ecological environment and sensitivity to climate change the climate type is dominated by continental monsoon and the annual average temperature is 8 c the annual precipitation ranges from 350 to 650 mm which is mainly concentrated in summer it is also the primary source of the weihe river s sediment water and sediment are primarily concentrated in the flood season and are greatly influenced by precipitation and human activities 2 2 data sources and preprocessing the data used in this study are as follows 1 primary geographic data such as

data from 2000 to 2005 were selected to calibrate the model and the data from 2021 to 2035 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were used for predication 3 research methods 3 1 land use prediction ca markov model takes the land use of the base period as the initial state and redistributes the land types based on the previous land use transfer area and suitability atlas so as to achieve accurate land use predictions this model combines the advantages of ca model in simulating the spatial changes of complex systems and markov model in long term sequence prediction and has been widely used in land use change simulation the ca model is defined as follow 1 s t 1 f s t n where st and st 1 are two sets of cellular states f is the local transfer rule and n is cellular field the markov model is defined as follow 2 x t 1 p ij x t where xt and xt 1 are two sets of land use conditions and pij is land use transition probability matrix moreover kappa index has been widely used to reflect the consistency between actual and simulated map zhao et al 2018 generally when the kappa index is above 0 75 the ca markov model is satisfactory and can predict future land use patterns ji et al 2019 simulation of future land use using the ca markov module of idrisi software 1 taking the land use data in 2000 and 2010 as the initial and the last year the probability transfer matrix of land use from 2000 to 2010 was obtained through the markov module 2 on the one hand taking into account the high priority given by the government to the ecological security of the jinghe river basin this paper selects forest reserves and water area as constrained factors to prohibit the conversion to other land use types on the other hand this paper selects elevation slope and distance to rivers and roads as influencing factors see appendix 2 for conversion rules generate suitability maps appendix 3 for the mainland types through the multi criteria evaluation mce module 3 taking the land use data in 2010 as the initial image the probability transfer matrix from 2000 to 2010 and suitability maps were entered into the ca markov model select a 5 5 neighborhood filter as the neighborhood definition the cell size is set to 30 m 30 m and the cycle is set to 10 times the land use data of the jinghe river basin in 2020 was simulated fig 2 b 4 compare the area of each land use type for error analysis appendix 1 comparing the actual with simulated land use map through the crosstab module the kappa index is 0 892 indicating that the ca markov model can well simulate the land cover change in the jinghe river basin 3 2 dynamical downscaling method 3 2 1 model configuration and experiment design the wrf model is a mesoscale weather research and forecasting system developed by ncar this model makes up for the deficiency that the resolution of gcms is too coarse to meet the needs of regional scale climate simulation and has a broad application in regional weather and climate simulation forecasting the wrf model uses multiple grid nesting to achieve advanced simulation within the boundary layer and this study achieves dynamical downscaling of the gcm with the help of a double layer nesting scheme on the one hand the simulation boundary greatly influences the simulation effect and the suitable simulation boundary can improve the simulation effect li et al 2015 considering the study area and avoiding areas with complex topography to minimize the disturbance caused by topographic factors this study chooses the d01 and d02 areas in fig 3 as the simulation area of the wrf model in this study on the other hand in the dynamical downscaling of the wrf model the grid is not as small as possible by comparing the simulation results under different resolutions 0 25 0 05 and 0 01 the low resolution grid 0 25 cannot accurately reflect the impact of the underlying surface and the high level resolution 0 05 or 0 01 simulation results are satisfactory the resolution increases from 0 05 to 0 01 will significantly increase the number of grids thus added the computational cost while the improvement of simulation effect is not apparent while ensuring the simulation effect and considering the calculation efficiency the spatial resolution of dynamical downscaling is 0 05 another key to the model configuration is the selection of physical schemes the wrf model provides a variety of schemes based on physical processes but when different physical schemes are combined the final simulation results will be quite different it is required to explore the impact of different physical scenarios on regional climate simulations through a series of sensitivity tests select the physical schemes with the best performance for regional climate simulations in the jinghe river basin finally the double layer nesting scheme of the wrf model shows in table 1 3 2 2 evaluation of wrf model performance the dynamical downscaling results of the wrf model are evaluated from the spatial and temporal scales according to the observation data from weather stations this study combines several indicators to confirm the reliability of the wrf model for dynamical downscaling this study uses coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to assess the simulation results on a time scale pattern correlation coefficient pcc and root mean square error rmse were used to assess the spatial consistency of simulation results with observations on a spatial scale wu et al 2013 this study downscaled the output results of the ccsm4 model from 2000 to 2005 running year by year and october december of the previous year as the spin up period the observation data of meteorological stations due to the lack of measured data solar radiation has not been verified were used to evaluate the downscaling results fig 4 and table 2 the constructed dynamical downscaling model has a solid ability to simulate the meteorological elements required by the hydrological model especially temperature and precipitation which can better reflect the magnitude intra annual variation pattern and spatial distribution characteristics of meteorological elements and can provide data support for the simulation of regional hydrological processes 3 3 assessment of soil conservation service the sediment module of swat model is selected to quantitatively assess the soil conservation service the swat model is a distributed hydrological model developed by usda ars for long time series simulation li et al 2022 with a solid physical mechanism anderson et al 2011 which has been broadly applied to the simulation of hydrological processes at the watershed scale chen et al 2017 and has high applicability in the loess plateau china chen et al 2020 yan et al 2017 this module uses the musle to calculate the actual amount of soil erosion of each hydrological response unit hru 3 sed 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed is the actual amount of soil erosion t q surf is surface runoff volume mm ha q peak is the peak runoff rate m 3 s area hru is the area of the hru ha k usle is soil erodibility factor c usle is the cover and management factor p usle is the support practice factor ls usle is topographic factor cfrg is the coarse fragment factor the parameters of the swat model were calibrated based on the measured runoff and sediment data from zhangjiashan station appendix 4 first the runoff parameters are calibrated and the comparison results between the monthly simulated and the measured runoff are shown in fig 5 the values of r2 nse and pbias were 0 74 0 73 and 9 6 in the calibration period and 0 78 0 78 and 7 2 in the validation period respectively the sediment parameters were calibrated under the premise of keeping the runoff parameters unchanged fig 6 the values of r2 nse and pbias in the calibration period were 0 61 0 58 and 5 and 0 63 0 61 and 1 2 in the validation period respectively the calibrated model can meet the accuracy requirements of the swat model r2 0 6 nse 0 5 and runoff pbias 25 sediment pbias 55 meaurio et al 2015 chen et al 2019 the monthly sediment yield simulation results strongly correlate with the monthly measured data which shows that the calibrated swat is suitable for the jinghe river basin the amount of soil conservation is received via subtracting actual soil erosion from potential soil erosion soil loss in bare land with no conservation treatment 4 sed c sed q sed a 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 k usle 1 c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed c is

runoff and sediment data from zhanjiashan hydrological station since the potential soil erosion is obtained by setting c usle p usle 1 based on the actual erosion calculation we believe that potential soil erosion has also passed verification 3 4 key issue in coupling climate model with hydrological model parameter transmission is a crucial issue for coupling climate and hydrological models the meteorological module in the hydrological model is used as the parameter interface for model coupling and the high resolution meteorological data obtained from the downscaling of the wrf model is input into the hydrological model to achieve the one way coupling between the climate and hydrological model in order to avoid affecting the stability and integration process of the original climate model the feedback from hydrological model to climate model is not considered 1 extracting meteorological elements from wrf results the output of the wrf model contains many variables considering that the meteorological data required by the swat model 11 variables related are extracted from wrf simulation results t2 k rainc mm rainnc mm u10 m s v10 m s swdown w m2 q2 kg kg psfc pa xlong xlon and hgt m 2 converting meteorological element format the variables extracted from the output of the wrf model are processed as follows according to the swat input data format taking each grid as a station ①this study sorts the daily hourly ground temperature at 2 m height extracts the daily maximum and minimum temperature and converts the unit c k 273 15 ②the precipitation shall be the sum of cumulus and grid scale precipitation taking into account that rainc and rainnc are the accumulated precipitation from the beginning of the simulation therefore rainc and rainnc are first added together then subtract the previous 00 00 from the latter 00 00 and finally obtain the daily precipitation data of each grid ③solar radiation is calculated based on the hourly downward short wave flux at ground

downscaling results of the wrf model appendix 5 6 this study used the swat simulating the hydrological processes from 2021 to 2035 and predicted the ecosystem soil conservation service under different climate scenarios of the jinghe river basin on the time scale the annual amount of soil conservation sc t was selected to characterize the scale of annual soil conservation service at the spatial scale soil conservation modulus scm t ha was used to reflect the differences in soil conservation functions in different regions 4 1 simulation of future land use taking the land use data in 2020 as the initial image the probability transfer matrix from 2010 to 2020 and suitability maps appendix 3 are input into the constructed ca markov model the 5 5 neighborhood filter is selected as the neighborhood definition and the cycle is set to 10 times the land use data of the jinghe river basin in 2030 is simulated fig 7 the future land use changes in the jinghe river basin are mainly characterized by a decrease in agriculture and an increase in grassland and urban on the one hand agriculture in areas with undulating terrain and slopes is further transformed into forest and grassland and the soil conservation function is enhanced on the other hand as a result of urbanization agriculture in flat areas around cities is being developed into urban in addition large scale afforestation activities will decrease in the future with natural restoration being the main method and the area of grassland increasing 4 2 the time series variation of soil conservation service the inter annual variations of sc under different climate scenarios are shown in fig 8 under the rcp4 5 scenario the annual average sc is 9 79 108 t higher than 4 21 108 t in 2000 2020 under the rcp8 5 scenario the annual average sc is 10 98 108 t higher than rcp4 5 and the value from 2000 to 2020 the inter annual variation range of soil conservation will be relatively extensive in the next 15 years under the rcp4 5 scenario the maximum value of sc 14 36 t in 2027 is 3 28 times the minimum value 4 37 t in 2034 in 2024 2027 and 2032 the sc exceeds 45 of the multi year average under this scenario while in 2022 2033 and 2034 the sc is 60 of the multi year average under the rcp8 5 scenario the maximum value of sc 16 19 t in 2035 is 3 6 times the minimum value 4 49 t in 2031 in 2021 2030 and 2035 it exceeds 35 of the multi year average under this scenario while in 2031 sc only accounts for 40 92 of the multi year average under this scenario the supply of soil conservation service is mainly affected by topography soil types land use and meteorological conditions among them the change of topography soil and other factors require an extended period and meteorological conditions are the main factors causing soil conservation s inter annual variation li and zhou 2014 as the most significant and direct external forcing of soil erosion among meteorological elements precipitation has the most significant impact on soil conservation service their correlation coefficients reach 0 80 rcp4 5 and 0 81 rcp8 5 and with high sc in years of high precipitation on the one hand precipitation enhancement will lead to an increase in potential erosion providing a tremendous lot of soil that needs to be maintained moreover according to eq 4 a positive correlation can be found between soil conservation and potential soil erosion on the other hand the stress of precipitation on vegetation growth is evident in arid and semi arid areas under the background of rising temperature precipitation increases plant photosynthesis is more potent and vegetation growth becomes better which can more effectively intercept raindrops regulate runoff hold soil and improve soil shape so soil conservation function becomes stronger the results of the dynamical downscaling indicate that the regional climate will develop in the direction of warming and humidification appendix 5 6 and the instability of the climate system will intensify in the next 15 years as a result the soil conservation from 2021 to 2035 will be high and show significant fluctuations 4 3 spatial variation characteristics of soil conservation service the spatial distribution of yearly scm under the two rcp scenarios in the jinghe river basin is shown in fig 9 and fig 10 on the one hand similar to the research results of sc scm under the two scenarios in the same year is not consistent this is mainly due to the difference in precipitation in the same year on the other hand there are differences in scm distribution in different years of the same climate scenario we believe that this is mainly related to the spatial distribution of meteorological elements each year such as the center of gravity of precipitation the spatial distribution of multi year average scm for two rcps scenarios is shown in fig 11 for rcp4 5 scenario the multi year average value of scm varies from 0 to 1740 5 t ha and the average value of the whole basin is 234 19 t ha which is higher than that from 2000 to 2020 105 39 t ha for rcp8 5 scenario the multi year average value of scm varies from 0 to 1834 16 t ha and the average value of the whole basin is 263 07 t ha which is higher than the rcp4 5 scenario and the value from 2000 to 2020 under two scenarios the spatial distribution of multi year average scm in the jing river basin is similar and the distribution varies considerably within the basin the high values of scm are concentrated in three regions firstly liupanshan mountain area in the west of the basin with the largest area and the highest scm secondly the other part is located in the southeast of the basin finally a small part is distributed in the northeast with a small area and relatively small scm but still higher than the average level of the basin the low value of scm is widely distributed firstly it is mainly distributed in the malianhe river watershed with the highest area and the lowest scm secondly low level scm is also widely distributed in the basin s center finally it is also distributed in the northwest and south of the basin the upper reaches of ruhe river the difference between the multi year average scm from 2021 to 2035 and the results from 2000 to 2020 is used to reflect the influence of different climate scenarios on soil conservation service fig 12 a and b under two scenarios scm is greater than the value of 2000 2020 in most parts of basin and the areas with increased scm account for 95 9 and 96 3 respectively the high value areas of scm growth are located in three main regions firstly the highest increase is in the mountainous area of the liupan mountains between the mainstream of the jinghe river and the heihe river in the western part of the basin where the vegetation cover is high and the good ecological environment in this area can provide higher soil conservation service under the changeable climate background secondly the two banks of sanshuihe river in the southeast of the basin and the tail of jinghe river take second place the terrain of this area is relatively flat with abundant precipitation high temperature good hydrothermal conditions and scm increases finally the downstream area of yuanchengchuan in the northeast of the basin is also relatively obvious the low value area of scm growth is concentrated in the upstream of the malianhe river in the north of the basin this area has little precipitation high wind speed numerous sandstorms sparse vegetation and a poor ecological environment scm growth will not be significant under future scenarios the spatial difference of scm under two scenarios is shown in fig 12 c for 87 of the areas in the basin the scm under rcp 8 5 scenario is greater than rcp4 5 by comparing the spatial distribution of meteorological elements it is found that the spatial distribution of scm difference under the two rcps scenarios is basically consistent with the precipitation difference which further proves the significance of the influence of precipitation on soil conservation 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty analysis 5 1 1 uncertainty in land use modeling as an important input to the swat model the prediction accuracy of the land use map can cause some uncertainty in the simulation results of soil conservation services validation of the simulated results of the 2020 land use map shows that the kappa index is 0 892 the total area of agriculture forest and grassland accounted for 95 and the kappa index were 0 84 0 92 and 0 78 respectively the water area accounts for 1 but the simulation error is large and the kappa is only 0 51 there are differences between the simulated and actual land use maps in addition this study only predicted the land use map under natural development scenarios and there is a need to set up more refined scenarios with different development paths and further investigate the mechanisms of land use change on ecosystem services in subsequent studies 5 1 2 uncertainty in dynamical downscaling the dynamical downscaling process has clear physical meaning solves the scale mismatch meets the needs of regional climate simulation and achieves the purpose of predicting the future climate at the watershed scale tapiador et al 2019 the future regional climate of study area is developing in the direction of warming and humidification and the instability of the climate system is increasing these results are the same as previous research conclusions gao et al 2017 tian et al 2015 however there are some uncertainties in the climate simulation process first there are some uncertainties in the gcms with coupled model inter comparison project cmip many gcms have been developed by various related groups but each model has different considerations in terms of parameters structure and resolution leading to differences and uncertainties in simulation results given the extensive research base of the cmip5 and considering the availability of gcms data and its applicability in the loess plateau this paper finally selects the ccsm4 model output of cmip5 to provide the original boundary data for the wrf model at present the cmip series has been developing to cmip6 based on the representative concentration pathways rcps of cmip5 cmip6 incorporates future shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and considers a more comprehensive range of factors and a more complex system making the future prediction results more reasonable previous studies have shown that climate predictions based on cmip5 and cmip6 have the same trend but the simulation effect of cmip6 is better than that of cmip5 sophal et al 2022 chen et al 2021 in this paper although there is a loss of simulation accuracy by using cmip5 it does not cause a disruptive effect on the results and the simulation results are still reliable in addition zhang and zhang and chen 2021 compared the uncertainty in the projection of precipitation and temperature extremes between cmip5 and cmip6 using 24 gcms in each phase of cmip they decomposed the total uncertainty t of climate projections into the greenhouse gas ghg emission scenario uncertainty s gcm uncertainty m and internal climate variability uncertainty v the magnitudes of s m v and t in cmip6 are 0 94 0 96 1 38 2 07 1 04 1 69 and 1 20 1 93 times as high as those in cmip5 there is currently a larger difference among projections of various gcms for cmip6 and it is difficult to avoid the contingency of using a single mode second the downscaling method causes uncertainty the selection of the parameterization scheme during the wrf model simulation and the structural framework of the model are also sources of uncertainty this study selected the widely used wrf model for dynamical downscaling and the optimal parameterization scheme combination was selected through sensitivity tests third the complexity and variability of the climate system have also increased the uncertainty of climate prediction based on the measured meteorological data this study evaluates the downscaling results of the wrf model from the monthly scale with the improvement of weather forecasting technology it is necessary to verify the result from a shorter time scale in the future 5 1 3 uncertainty in the calibration of swat model parameters based on the measured data of runoff and sediment available from the zhangjiashan station the model parameters are calibrated in this paper although the simulation accuracy meets the requirements meaurio et al 2015 chen et al 2019 there are still some differences between the simulated and measured values leading to uncertainties in the simulation results of soil conservation services on the one hand due to the limitation of the data source this paper only calibrates the sediment parameters based on the sediment data from 2000 to 2014 on the other hand due to the complexity of the geographical environment of the study area it is necessary to establish a more accurate swat model 5 1 4 uncertainty in model coupling in this paper ca markov wrf and swat are used to integrate land use and climate change factors in the prediction of soil conservation services but there are some uncertainties in the model coupling process firstly the three models are different in research scale secondly there is still some uncertainty in describing the land use change climate change and hydrological process using mathematical equations ji et al 2021 5 2 quantitative simulation of soil conservation service in previous studies soil conservation service assessments mainly were based on empirical equations such as usle or rusle qiao et al 2018 xiong et al 2017 which could not describe the physical mechanism and detailed process of soil erosion and the results could not be verified by modifying the source code of the soil erosion sub module this study realized the evaluation of soil conservation service by using hydrological model directly the swat model considers the transport of denuded soil particles from hrus to slopes and then to fine channels intermittent channels perennial channels as well as the sediment transport carrying and deposition along with the water flow which can portray the sediment transport and deposition process in addition the calibration of parameters based on actual sediment measurements at the hydrological stations improves the credibility of soil conservation service assessment the erosion type of the jinghe river basin is mainly water erosion and the swat model has good applicability however due to the level of technology and knowledge some erosion processes are not yet reflected in the swat model such as wind erosion and gravity erosion limiting the development of the model for soil conservation service in some areas there is an urgent need to develop assessment models based on different erosion processes 5 3 bidirectional coupling of climate models and hydrological models the meteorological module of swat model is used as the model interface to input the meteorological data obtained from dynamical downscaling into the hydrological model which lays the foundation for the area lacking meteorological observation data and the simulation of the hydrological process in the future similar to most current coupled studies xu et al 2014 the method used in this study is one way coupling which means that the output of the climate model is downscaled and used as the driving force of the hydrological model the influence of climate change is considered in hydrological process simulation but the feedback effect of the hydrological process on climate simulation is not considered bringing the underlying surface evapotranspiration and other elements from the hydrological model back to the climate model and realizing the two way coupling between climate and hydrological models remain a difficult area of atmosphere hydrology coupling research and an important development direction in the future kruk et al 2013 5 4 recommendations for enhance soil conservation services soil erosion is primary ecological problem in the jinghe river basin which restricts the sustainable development there is an urgent need to develop adaptive management measures to meet the challenges posed by future climate change to ecosystem services therefore this study proposes the following suggestions for enhance soil conservation services 1 implement soil and water conservation measures according to local conditions different regions of the jinghe river basin have different geographical environments therefore different soil and water conservation measures should be implemented according to local conditions 1 the northern part of the basin has low annual precipitation land desertification and an extremely fragile ecological environment which is not suitable for extensive afforestation it should focus on natural restoration supplemented by artificial treatment such as closing mountains beaches to grazing and the appropriate establishment of artificial grassland 2 the central and southeastern regions of the basin have a wide distribution of agricultural land which can change the farming methods to enhance soil conservation we recommend trying conservation tillage no till grass and crop rotation implementing farming measures that alter local terrains furrow and ridge planting pit field planting and interplanting crops and forages with different densities and growing seasons to increase vegetation coverage or surface coverage time 3 the eastern forest area and the western mountainous area have a better ecological environment and are key supply areas for soil conservation services in the jinghe river basin forest reserves can be established to prevent the expansion of human activities and avoid damaging the function of soil conservation 2 carry out engineering prevention and control measures for extreme climate the climate of the jinghe river basin is moving towards warming and humidification and the instability of the climate system will increase with an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events heavy rainfall droughts high wind etc given the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation events in the future engineering measures can be taken to change the local terrain retain rainwater locally delay surface runoff and reduce soil erosion caused by short term high intensity precipitation 1 the windy beach area in the northern part of the basin with 400 mm of annual precipitation can consider building silt dams sand traps and other projects at the key position in moderation storing water sources retaining channel sediment and fixing sand sources gradually improving the regional ecological environment and enhancing the ability to cope with climate change 2 in the southern part of the basin where precipitation is abundant reservoirs and small ditch storage projects should be built to store water and regulate the flow of rivers to cope with possible floods and droughts as well as to hold sediment and reduce soil erosion 6 conclusions based on the ca markov and wrf model this study realized the scenario simulation of land use and climate respectively and coupled with the swat model to predict the soil conservation service the wrf model could address the mismatch of spatial and temporal scales between climate model and hydrological process laying a foundation for watershed scale ecosystem services prediction our findings also demonstrate that with precipitation enhancement soil conservation service will increase in the future and soil conservation is higher under the rcp8 5 scenario than rcp4 5 affected by climate and geographical location soil conservation service varies significantly in space hence soil and water conservation measures and engineering prevention measures should be adapted according to local conditions and extreme climate credit authorship contribution

2698,as an essential regulating service soil conservation service is the primary way to suppress soil erosion accurate assessment of soil conservation service can provide scientific support for regional ecological protection and is of great significance to regional environmental security however because of the lack of future high resolution meteorological data there are few researches on ecosystem services prediction resulting in limited persuasion to guide ecological construction therefore this study uses the wrf model to obtain a high resolution meteorological dataset 0 05 0 05 2021 2035 daily to drive the swat model in the jinghe river basin through this method we introduce the dynamical downscaling method into the research field of ecosystem services to predict the temporal spatial characteristics of soil conservation service the results indicate that first the dynamical downscaling results of the wrf model can reflect the magnitude temporal fluctuation and spatial distribution of regional precipitation and temperature second multi year average 2021 2035 soil conservation is 9 79 108 t rcp4 5 and 10 98 108 t rcp8 5 which are significantly higher than the 2000 2020 period 4 21 108 t the inter annual variation of soil conservation service is affected considerably by precipitation with correlation coefficients of 0 80 rcp4 5 and 0 81 rcp8 5 finally the spatial distribution of soil conservation service under two scenarios is similar the research results provide scientific support for ecological construction and scientific management and the research ideas are also applicable to other ecosystem services prediction at the watershed scale keywords soil conservation service climate change dynamical downscaling swat data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the ecosystem provides the human living environment and natural resources and is directly related to human well being and socio economic sustainability pedreschi et al 2018 climate change mainly characterized by global warming has become increasingly prominent and a major global environmental problem zickfeld et al 2017 climate change significantly affects the global supply of ecosystem services by altering ecosystem structure and function which poses a serious threat to human survival and socio economic sustainability fu et al 2020 the millennium ecosystem assessment report issued by the united nations pointed out that 15 of the 24 ecosystem services worldwide are declining millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the research on ecosystem services has attracted more and more attention from scholars at home and abroad and has become the frontier and hotspot of geography ecology and other disciplines costanza et al 2014 accurately grasping the laws of climate change simulating eco hydrological processes and quantitatively assessing ecosystem services responses to climate change in the context of global change are challenges that urgently need to be improved and solved soil conservation service is the erosion control capacity of ecosystems to prevent soil loss and store sediment liu et al 2019 as an ecosystem regulation service it is an important guarantee to prevent land degradation and reduce the risk of flood disaster previous studies on soil conservation service mainly used soil erosion models and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle was the most widely used anache et al 2017 liu et al 2021a this model is supplemented and improved by usda nrcs based on the universal soil loss equation usle the core of rusle is to calculate the impact factors such as rainfall runoff erosivity factor r land cover and management measures factor c and soil and water conservation measures factor p and take the difference between potential the maximum amount of soil erosion without surface vegetation and soil and water conservation measures and actual soil erosion as the supply of soil conservation service zheng et al 2021 the research on soil conservation service based on empirical rusle model bai et al 2012 has certain limitations geneletti 2013 because it does not consider the process of soil stripping transportation and sedimentation during soil erosion and lacks the analysis of erosion mechanism some scholars have recently begun to use hydrological models based on physical processes to study soil conservation service for example liu et al 2001 established the chinese soil loss equation csle considering the biological engineering and farming measures related to vegetation evolution to explore the soil loss rate of different vegetation cover types such as forest and grassland liu et al 2021b studied the soil conservation service and analyzed the impact of meteorological elements and topographic conditions on soil conservation service based on the soil and water assessment tool swat model bai et al 2021 introduced the long time series ndvi into the sediment module of the swat model improved the accuracy of sediment simulation of the model and further explored the relationship between soil conservation service and drought however most previous studies are current situation simulations for lack of high spatial resolution meteorological data in the future there are few studies on ecosystem service prediction under different climate scenarios so the persuasion to guide future ecological construction is limited as the primary tool for researching climate change lü et al 2020 climate models have broad applications in related fields with the development of theory and technology the prediction of climate variation based on the general circulation model gcm has entered a new stage of development 40 sets of gcms formulated by cmip5 have adopted representative concentration pathways rcps providing meteorological results under four scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 which provides a basis for climate change prediction research however the spatial resolution of gcm is generally 100 km and due to the lack of regional information gcms are unable to meet the needs of watershed simulation kong 2020 xu et al 2019 to make up for this deficiency the method of connecting global and regional scale climate change research mcsweeney et al 2015 by downscaling method came into being mainly including statistical downscaling method and dynamical downscaling method nasa released the nex gddp dataset based on the statistical downscaling method thrasher et al 2012 however only the temperature and precipitation data are provided which is insufficient to support hydrological process simulation other meteorological parameters need to be obtained by other means due to the constraints of historical statistics statistical downscaling methods cannot describe historical periods the changes in the situation are not suitable for areas where the correlation between large scale elements and regional elements is not apparent fan et al 2013 the dynamical downscaling method over couples regional and global climate models to predict future climate with clear physical meaning and meeting the information needs of regional climate simulation yu et al 2010 tested the weather research and foresting model wrf to simulate china s regional climate the research results showed that the regional model could improve temperature and precipitation simulation ability compared with the global model especially the simulation of annual average precipitation based on this method wu et al 2016 also downscaled the fnl data combined with accuracy verification which showed that the wrf model has a solid ability to simulate the temperature at 2 m and shortwave radiation the development of gcms and downscaling methods make it possible to predict future climate conditions and explore the response of ecosystem services under the climatic changing taking the jinghe river basin on the loess plateau as an example this study explored and evaluated the soil conservation service from 2021 to 2035 by taking into account land use prediction and climate change simulation firstly predicting the land use 2030 using ca markov model under the natural development scenario secondly dynamical downscaling the results of large scale gcms to obtain the meteorological data 0 05 0 05 daily with the help of multi level nesting of the wrf model finally the swat model is driven by land use and meteorological data based on future scenarios realizing the dynamic simulation of soil conservation service 2 data sources 2 1 study area the jinghe river basin 106 14 e 108 42 e 34 46 n 37 19 n with an area of 45 421 km2 is located in the central loess plateau china fig 1 the basin is situated in the transitional climate zone from semi humid to semi arid with severe soil erosion fragile ecological environment and sensitivity to climate change the climate type is dominated by continental monsoon and the annual average temperature is 8 c the annual precipitation ranges from 350 to 650 mm which is mainly concentrated in summer it is also the primary source of the weihe river s sediment water and sediment are primarily concentrated in the flood season and are greatly influenced by precipitation and human activities 2 2 data sources and preprocessing the data used in this study are as follows 1 primary geographic data such as

data from 2000 to 2005 were selected to calibrate the model and the data from 2021 to 2035 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were used for predication 3 research methods 3 1 land use prediction ca markov model takes the land use of the base period as the initial state and redistributes the land types based on the previous land use transfer area and suitability atlas so as to achieve accurate land use predictions this model combines the advantages of ca model in simulating the spatial changes of complex systems and markov model in long term sequence prediction and has been widely used in land use change simulation the ca model is defined as follow 1 s t 1 f s t n where st and st 1 are two sets of cellular states f is the local transfer rule and n is cellular field the markov model is defined as follow 2 x t 1 p ij x t where xt and xt 1 are two sets of land use conditions and pij is land use transition probability matrix moreover kappa index has been widely used to reflect the consistency between actual and simulated map zhao et al 2018 generally when the kappa index is above 0 75 the ca markov model is satisfactory and can predict future land use patterns ji et al 2019 simulation of future land use using the ca markov module of idrisi software 1 taking the land use data in 2000 and 2010 as the initial and the last year the probability transfer matrix of land use from 2000 to 2010 was obtained through the markov module 2 on the one hand taking into account the high priority given by the government to the ecological security of the jinghe river basin this paper selects forest reserves and water area as constrained factors to prohibit the conversion to other land use types on the other hand this paper selects elevation slope and distance to rivers and roads as influencing factors see appendix 2 for conversion rules generate suitability maps appendix 3 for the mainland types through the multi criteria evaluation mce module 3 taking the land use data in 2010 as the initial image the probability transfer matrix from 2000 to 2010 and suitability maps were entered into the ca markov model select a 5 5 neighborhood filter as the neighborhood definition the cell size is set to 30 m 30 m and the cycle is set to 10 times the land use data of the jinghe river basin in 2020 was simulated fig 2 b 4 compare the area of each land use type for error analysis appendix 1 comparing the actual with simulated land use map through the crosstab module the kappa index is 0 892 indicating that the ca markov model can well simulate the land cover change in the jinghe river basin 3 2 dynamical downscaling method 3 2 1 model configuration and experiment design the wrf model is a mesoscale weather research and forecasting system developed by ncar this model makes up for the deficiency that the resolution of gcms is too coarse to meet the needs of regional scale climate simulation and has a broad application in regional weather and climate simulation forecasting the wrf model uses multiple grid nesting to achieve advanced simulation within the boundary layer and this study achieves dynamical downscaling of the gcm with the help of a double layer nesting scheme on the one hand the simulation boundary greatly influences the simulation effect and the suitable simulation boundary can improve the simulation effect li et al 2015 considering the study area and avoiding areas with complex topography to minimize the disturbance caused by topographic factors this study chooses the d01 and d02 areas in fig 3 as the simulation area of the wrf model in this study on the other hand in the dynamical downscaling of the wrf model the grid is not as small as possible by comparing the simulation results under different resolutions 0 25 0 05 and 0 01 the low resolution grid 0 25 cannot accurately reflect the impact of the underlying surface and the high level resolution 0 05 or 0 01 simulation results are satisfactory the resolution increases from 0 05 to 0 01 will significantly increase the number of grids thus added the computational cost while the improvement of simulation effect is not apparent while ensuring the simulation effect and considering the calculation efficiency the spatial resolution of dynamical downscaling is 0 05 another key to the model configuration is the selection of physical schemes the wrf model provides a variety of schemes based on physical processes but when different physical schemes are combined the final simulation results will be quite different it is required to explore the impact of different physical scenarios on regional climate simulations through a series of sensitivity tests select the physical schemes with the best performance for regional climate simulations in the jinghe river basin finally the double layer nesting scheme of the wrf model shows in table 1 3 2 2 evaluation of wrf model performance the dynamical downscaling results of the wrf model are evaluated from the spatial and temporal scales according to the observation data from weather stations this study combines several indicators to confirm the reliability of the wrf model for dynamical downscaling this study uses coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to assess the simulation results on a time scale pattern correlation coefficient pcc and root mean square error rmse were used to assess the spatial consistency of simulation results with observations on a spatial scale wu et al 2013 this study downscaled the output results of the ccsm4 model from 2000 to 2005 running year by year and october december of the previous year as the spin up period the observation data of meteorological stations due to the lack of measured data solar radiation has not been verified were used to evaluate the downscaling results fig 4 and table 2 the constructed dynamical downscaling model has a solid ability to simulate the meteorological elements required by the hydrological model especially temperature and precipitation which can better reflect the magnitude intra annual variation pattern and spatial distribution characteristics of meteorological elements and can provide data support for the simulation of regional hydrological processes 3 3 assessment of soil conservation service the sediment module of swat model is selected to quantitatively assess the soil conservation service the swat model is a distributed hydrological model developed by usda ars for long time series simulation li et al 2022 with a solid physical mechanism anderson et al 2011 which has been broadly applied to the simulation of hydrological processes at the watershed scale chen et al 2017 and has high applicability in the loess plateau china chen et al 2020 yan et al 2017 this module uses the musle to calculate the actual amount of soil erosion of each hydrological response unit hru 3 sed 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed is the actual amount of soil erosion t q surf is surface runoff volume mm ha q peak is the peak runoff rate m 3 s area hru is the area of the hru ha k usle is soil erodibility factor c usle is the cover and management factor p usle is the support practice factor ls usle is topographic factor cfrg is the coarse fragment factor the parameters of the swat model were calibrated based on the measured runoff and sediment data from zhangjiashan station appendix 4 first the runoff parameters are calibrated and the comparison results between the monthly simulated and the measured runoff are shown in fig 5 the values of r2 nse and pbias were 0 74 0 73 and 9 6 in the calibration period and 0 78 0 78 and 7 2 in the validation period respectively the sediment parameters were calibrated under the premise of keeping the runoff parameters unchanged fig 6 the values of r2 nse and pbias in the calibration period were 0 61 0 58 and 5 and 0 63 0 61 and 1 2 in the validation period respectively the calibrated model can meet the accuracy requirements of the swat model r2 0 6 nse 0 5 and runoff pbias 25 sediment pbias 55 meaurio et al 2015 chen et al 2019 the monthly sediment yield simulation results strongly correlate with the monthly measured data which shows that the calibrated swat is suitable for the jinghe river basin the amount of soil conservation is received via subtracting actual soil erosion from potential soil erosion soil loss in bare land with no conservation treatment 4 sed c sed q sed a 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 k usle 1 c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed c is the amount of soil conservation t sed a is actual soil erosion t sed q is potential soil erosion t in the previous step of this study the simulated actual soil erosion was validated based on observed runoff and sediment data from zhanjiashan hydrological station since the potential soil erosion is obtained by setting c usle p usle 1 based on the actual erosion calculation we believe that potential soil erosion has also passed verification 3 4 key issue in coupling climate model with hydrological model parameter transmission is a crucial issue for coupling climate and hydrological models the meteorological module in the hydrological model is used as the parameter interface for model coupling and the high resolution meteorological data obtained from the downscaling of the wrf model is input into the hydrological model to achieve the one way coupling between the climate and hydrological model in order to avoid affecting the stability and integration process of the original climate model the feedback from hydrological model to climate model is not considered 1 extracting meteorological elements from wrf results the output of the wrf model contains many variables considering that the meteorological data required by the swat model 11 variables related are extracted from wrf simulation results t2 k rainc mm rainnc mm u10 m s v10 m s swdown w m2 q2 kg kg psfc pa xlong xlon and hgt m 2 converting meteorological element format the variables extracted from the output of the wrf model are processed as follows according to the swat input data format taking each grid as a station ①this study sorts the daily hourly ground temperature at 2 m height extracts the daily maximum and minimum temperature and converts the unit c k 273 15 ②the precipitation shall be the sum of cumulus and grid scale precipitation taking into account that rainc and rainnc are the accumulated precipitation from the beginning of the simulation therefore rainc and rainnc are first added together then subtract the previous 00 00 from the latter 00 00 and finally obtain the daily precipitation data of each grid ③solar radiation is calculated based on the hourly downward short wave flux at ground

downscaling results of the wrf model appendix 5 6 this study used the swat simulating the hydrological processes from 2021 to 2035 and predicted the ecosystem soil conservation service under different climate scenarios of the jinghe river basin on the time scale the annual amount of soil conservation sc t was selected to characterize the scale of annual soil conservation service at the spatial scale soil conservation modulus scm t ha was used to reflect the differences in soil conservation functions in different regions 4 1 simulation of future land use taking the land use data in 2020 as the initial image the probability transfer matrix from 2010 to 2020 and suitability maps appendix 3 are input into the constructed ca markov model the 5 5 neighborhood filter is selected as the neighborhood definition and the cycle is set to 10 times the land use data of the jinghe river basin in 2030 is simulated fig 7 the future land use changes in the jinghe river basin are mainly characterized by a decrease in agriculture and an increase in grassland and urban on the one hand agriculture in areas with undulating terrain and slopes is further transformed into forest and grassland and the soil conservation function is enhanced on the other hand as a result of urbanization agriculture in flat areas around cities is being developed into urban in addition large scale afforestation activities will decrease in the future with natural restoration being the main method and the area of grassland increasing 4 2 the time series variation of soil conservation service the inter annual variations of sc under different climate scenarios are shown in fig 8 under the rcp4 5 scenario the annual average sc is 9 79 108 t higher than 4 21 108 t in 2000 2020 under the rcp8 5 scenario the annual average sc is 10 98 108 t higher than rcp4 5 and the value from 2000 to 2020 the inter annual variation range of soil conservation will be relatively extensive in the next 15 years under the rcp4 5 scenario the maximum value of sc 14 36 t in 2027 is 3 28 times the minimum value 4 37 t in 2034 in 2024 2027 and 2032 the sc exceeds 45 of the multi year average under this scenario while in 2022 2033 and 2034 the sc is 60 of the multi year average under the rcp8 5 scenario the maximum value of sc 16 19 t in 2035 is 3 6 times the minimum value 4 49 t in 2031 in 2021 2030 and 2035 it exceeds 35 of the multi year average under this scenario while in 2031 sc only accounts for 40 92 of the multi year average under this scenario the supply of soil conservation service is mainly affected by topography soil types land use and meteorological conditions among them the change of topography soil and other factors require an extended period and meteorological conditions are the main factors causing soil conservation s inter annual variation li and zhou 2014 as the most significant and direct external forcing of soil erosion among meteorological elements precipitation has the most significant impact on soil conservation service their correlation coefficients reach 0 80 rcp4 5 and 0 81 rcp8 5 and with high sc in years of high precipitation on the one hand precipitation enhancement will lead to an increase in potential erosion providing a tremendous lot of soil that needs to be maintained moreover according to eq 4 a positive correlation can be found between soil conservation and potential soil erosion on the other hand the stress of precipitation on vegetation growth is evident in arid and semi arid areas under the background of rising temperature precipitation increases plant photosynthesis is more potent and vegetation growth becomes better which can more effectively intercept raindrops regulate runoff hold soil and improve soil shape so soil conservation function becomes stronger the results of the dynamical downscaling indicate that the regional climate will develop in the direction of warming and humidification appendix 5 6 and the instability of the climate system will intensify in the next 15 years as a result the soil conservation from 2021 to 2035 will be high and show significant fluctuations 4 3 spatial variation characteristics of soil conservation service the spatial distribution of yearly scm under the two rcp scenarios in the jinghe river basin is shown in fig 9 and fig 10 on the one hand similar to the research results of sc scm under the two scenarios in the same year is not consistent this is mainly due to the difference in precipitation in the same year on the other hand there are differences in scm distribution in different years of the same climate scenario we believe that this is mainly related to the spatial distribution of meteorological elements each year such as the center of gravity of precipitation the spatial distribution of multi year average scm for two rcps scenarios is shown in fig 11 for rcp4 5 scenario the multi year average value of scm varies from 0 to 1740 5 t ha and the average value of the whole basin is 234 19 t ha which is higher than that from 2000 to 2020 105 39 t ha for rcp8 5 scenario the multi year average value of scm varies from 0 to 1834 16 t ha and the average value of the whole basin is 263 07 t ha which is higher than the rcp4 5 scenario and the value from 2000 to 2020 under two scenarios the spatial distribution of multi year average scm in the jing river basin is similar and the distribution varies considerably within the basin the high values of scm are concentrated in three regions firstly liupanshan mountain area in the west of the basin with the largest area and the highest scm secondly the other part is located in the southeast of the basin finally a small part is distributed in the northeast with a small area and relatively small scm but still higher than the average level of the basin the low value of scm is widely distributed firstly it is mainly distributed in the malianhe river watershed with the highest area and the lowest scm secondly low level scm is also widely distributed in the basin s center finally it is also distributed in the northwest and south of the basin the upper reaches of ruhe river the difference between the multi year average scm from 2021 to 2035 and the results from 2000 to 2020 is used to reflect the influence of different climate scenarios on soil conservation service fig 12 a and b under two scenarios scm is greater than the value of 2000 2020 in most parts of basin and the areas with increased scm account for 95 9 and 96 3 respectively the high value areas of scm growth are located in three main regions firstly the highest increase is in the mountainous area of the liupan mountains between the mainstream of the jinghe river and the heihe river in the western part of the basin where the vegetation cover is high and the good ecological environment in this area can provide higher soil conservation service under the changeable climate background secondly the two banks of sanshuihe river in the southeast of the basin and the tail of jinghe river take second place the terrain of this area is relatively flat with abundant precipitation high temperature good hydrothermal conditions and scm increases finally the downstream area of yuanchengchuan in the northeast of the basin is also relatively obvious the low value area of scm growth is concentrated in the upstream of the malianhe river in the north of the basin this area has little precipitation high wind speed numerous sandstorms sparse vegetation and a poor ecological environment scm growth will not be significant under future scenarios the spatial difference of scm under two scenarios is shown in fig 12 c for 87 of the areas in the basin the scm under rcp 8 5 scenario is greater than rcp4 5 by comparing the spatial distribution of meteorological elements it is found that the spatial distribution of scm difference under the two rcps scenarios is basically consistent with the precipitation difference which further proves the significance of the influence of precipitation on soil conservation 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty analysis 5 1 1 uncertainty in land use modeling as an important input to the swat model the prediction accuracy of the land use map can cause some uncertainty in the simulation results of soil conservation services validation of the simulated results of the 2020 land use map shows that the kappa index is 0 892 the total area of agriculture forest and grassland accounted for 95 and the kappa index were 0 84 0 92 and 0 78 respectively the water area accounts for 1 but the simulation error is large and the kappa is only 0 51 there are differences between the simulated and actual land use maps in addition this study only predicted the land use map under natural development scenarios and there is a need to set up more refined scenarios with different development paths and further investigate the mechanisms of land use change on ecosystem services in subsequent studies 5 1 2 uncertainty in dynamical downscaling the dynamical downscaling process has clear physical meaning solves the scale mismatch meets the needs of regional climate simulation and achieves the purpose of predicting the future climate at the watershed scale tapiador et al 2019 the future regional climate of study area is developing in the direction of warming and humidification and the instability of the climate system is increasing these results are the same as previous research conclusions gao et al 2017 tian et al 2015 however there are some uncertainties in the climate simulation process first there are some uncertainties in the gcms with coupled model inter comparison project cmip many gcms have been developed by various related groups but each model has different considerations in terms of parameters structure and resolution leading to differences and uncertainties in simulation results given the extensive research base of the cmip5 and considering the availability of gcms data and its applicability in the loess plateau this paper finally selects the ccsm4 model output of cmip5 to provide the original boundary data for the wrf model at present the cmip series has been developing to cmip6 based on the representative concentration pathways rcps of cmip5 cmip6 incorporates future shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and considers a more comprehensive range of factors and a more complex system making the future prediction results more reasonable previous studies have shown that climate predictions based on cmip5 and cmip6 have the same trend but the simulation effect of cmip6 is better than that of cmip5 sophal et al 2022 chen et al 2021 in this paper although there is a loss of simulation accuracy by using cmip5 it does not cause a disruptive effect on the results and the simulation results are still reliable in addition zhang and zhang and chen 2021 compared the uncertainty in the projection of precipitation and temperature extremes between cmip5 and cmip6 using 24 gcms in each phase of cmip they decomposed the total uncertainty t of climate projections into the greenhouse gas ghg emission scenario uncertainty s gcm uncertainty m and internal climate variability uncertainty v the magnitudes of s m v and t in cmip6 are 0 94 0 96 1 38 2 07 1 04 1 69 and 1 20 1 93 times as high as those in cmip5 there is currently a larger difference among projections of various gcms for cmip6 and it is difficult to avoid the contingency of using a single mode second the downscaling method causes uncertainty the selection of the parameterization scheme during the wrf model simulation and the structural framework of the model are also sources of uncertainty this study selected the widely used wrf model for dynamical downscaling and the optimal parameterization scheme combination was selected through sensitivity tests third the complexity and variability of the climate system have also increased the uncertainty of climate prediction based on the measured meteorological data this study evaluates the downscaling results of the wrf model from the monthly scale with the improvement of weather forecasting technology it is necessary to verify the result from a shorter time scale in the future 5 1 3 uncertainty in the calibration of swat model parameters based on the measured data of runoff and sediment available from the zhangjiashan station the model parameters are calibrated in this paper although the simulation accuracy meets the requirements meaurio et al 2015 chen et al 2019 there are still some differences between the simulated and measured values leading to uncertainties in the simulation results of soil conservation services on the one hand due to the limitation of the data source this paper only calibrates the sediment parameters based on the sediment data from 2000 to 2014 on the other hand due to the complexity of the geographical environment of the study area it is necessary to establish a more accurate swat model 5 1 4 uncertainty in model coupling in this paper ca markov wrf and swat are used to integrate land use and climate change factors in the prediction of soil conservation services but there are some uncertainties in the model coupling process firstly the three models are different in research scale secondly there is still some uncertainty in describing the land use change climate change and hydrological process using mathematical equations ji et al 2021 5 2 quantitative simulation of soil conservation service in previous studies soil conservation service assessments mainly were based on empirical equations such as usle or rusle qiao et al 2018 xiong et al 2017 which could not describe the physical mechanism and detailed process of soil erosion and the results could not be verified by modifying the source code of the soil erosion sub module this study realized the evaluation of soil conservation service by using hydrological model directly the swat model considers the transport of denuded soil particles from hrus to slopes and then to fine channels intermittent channels perennial channels as well as the sediment transport carrying and deposition along with the water flow which can portray the sediment transport and deposition process in addition the calibration of parameters based on actual sediment measurements at the hydrological stations improves the credibility of soil conservation service assessment the erosion type of the jinghe river basin is mainly water erosion and the swat model has good applicability however due to the level of technology and knowledge some erosion processes are not yet reflected in the swat model such as wind erosion and gravity erosion limiting the development of the model for soil conservation service in some areas there is an urgent need to develop assessment models based on different erosion processes 5 3 bidirectional coupling of climate models and hydrological models the meteorological module of swat model is used as the model interface to input the meteorological data obtained from dynamical downscaling into the hydrological model which lays the foundation for the area lacking meteorological observation data and the simulation of the hydrological process in the future similar to most current coupled studies xu et al 2014 the method used in this study is one way coupling which means that the output of the climate model is downscaled and used as the driving force of the hydrological model the influence of climate change is considered in hydrological process simulation but the feedback effect of the hydrological process on climate simulation is not considered bringing the underlying surface evapotranspiration and other elements from the hydrological model back to the climate model and realizing the two way coupling between climate and hydrological models remain a difficult area of atmosphere hydrology coupling research and an important development direction in the future kruk et al 2013 5 4 recommendations for enhance soil conservation services soil erosion is primary ecological problem in the jinghe river basin which restricts the sustainable development there is an urgent need to develop adaptive management measures to meet the challenges posed by future climate change to ecosystem services therefore this study proposes the following suggestions for enhance soil conservation services 1 implement soil and water conservation measures according to local conditions different regions of the jinghe river basin have different geographical environments therefore different soil and water conservation measures should be implemented according to local conditions 1 the northern part of the basin has low annual precipitation land desertification and an extremely fragile ecological environment which is not suitable for extensive afforestation it should focus on natural restoration supplemented by artificial treatment such as closing mountains beaches to grazing and the appropriate establishment of artificial grassland 2 the central and southeastern regions of the basin have a wide distribution of agricultural land which can change the farming methods to enhance soil conservation we recommend trying conservation tillage no till grass and crop rotation implementing farming measures that alter local terrains furrow and ridge planting pit field planting and interplanting crops and forages with different densities and growing seasons to increase vegetation coverage or surface coverage time 3 the eastern forest area and the western mountainous area have a better ecological environment and are key supply areas for soil conservation services in the jinghe river basin forest reserves can be established to prevent the expansion of human activities and avoid damaging the function of soil conservation 2 carry out engineering prevention and control measures for extreme climate the climate of the jinghe river basin is moving towards warming and humidification and the instability of the climate system will increase with an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events heavy rainfall droughts high wind etc given the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation events in the future engineering measures can be taken to change the local terrain retain rainwater locally delay surface runoff and reduce soil erosion caused by short term high intensity precipitation 1 the windy beach area in the northern part of the basin with 400 mm of annual precipitation can consider building silt dams sand traps and other projects at the key position in moderation storing water sources retaining channel sediment and fixing sand sources gradually improving the regional ecological environment and enhancing the ability to cope with climate change 2 in the southern part of the basin where precipitation is abundant reservoirs and small ditch storage projects should be built to store water and regulate the flow of rivers to cope with possible floods and droughts as well as to hold sediment and reduce soil erosion 6 conclusions based on the ca markov and wrf model this study realized the scenario simulation of land use and climate respectively and coupled with the swat model to predict the soil conservation service the wrf model could address the mismatch of spatial and temporal scales between climate model and hydrological process laying a foundation for watershed scale ecosystem services prediction our findings also demonstrate that with precipitation enhancement soil conservation service will increase in the future and soil conservation is higher under the rcp8 5 scenario than rcp4 5 affected by climate and geographical location soil conservation service varies significantly in space hence soil and water conservation measures and engineering prevention measures should be adapted according to local conditions and extreme climate credit authorship contribution

2699,cold regions involve hydrological processes that are not often addressed appropriately in hydrological models the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm was initially developed in 1998 to assemble and explore the hydrological understanding developed from a series of research basins spanning canada and international cold regions hydrological processes and basin response in cold regions are simulated in a flexible modular object oriented multiphysics platform the crhm platform allows for multiple representations of forcing data interpolation and extrapolation hydrological model spatial and physical process structures and parameter values it is well suited for model falsification algorithm intercomparison and benchmarking and has been deployed for basin hydrology diagnosis prediction land use change and water quality analysis climate impact analysis and flood forecasting around the world this paper describes crhm s capabilities and the insights derived by applying the model in concert with process hydrology research and using the combined information and understanding from research basins to predict hydrological variables diagnose hydrological change and determine the appropriateness of model structure and parameterisations keywords snow frozen ground evapotranspiration water quality glaciers hydrological modelling data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction cold regions where snow and ice play an inordinately important role in streamflow generation involve hydrological processes that are not often addressed appropriately in hydrological models wheater et al 2022 many cold regions are also sub humid and so have the added complication of seasonal aridity armstrong et al 2010 since most cold regions have been glaciated in recent geological time geomorphological processes have not always had sufficient time to develop well defined drainage networks and stream channels and so depressional storage capacities are large and the runoff contributing areas for streamflow generation are variable shook et al 2015 in mountains snowpacks can cover the basin for more than 2 3 of the year and in some areas year round as permanent snowfields and glaciers that dominate the coldest and snowiest parts of high mountain basins pomeroy et al 2012a fang pomeroy 2020 pradhananga pomeroy 2022 cold regions including snowy sub humid and sparsely or ungauged basins pose special challenges to hydrological prediction due to the need to address snow and ice processes such as snow redistribution and ablation and infiltration to frozen soils strong seasonality in process operations bidirectional phase changes from water to vapour ice to liquid and ice to vapour variable contributing area episodic flow processes and restricted opportunity to calibrate model parameters from streamflow observations due to intermittent streamflow small contributing areas to streamflow and lack of gauging stations pomeroy et al 1998a pomeroy et al 2007 shook et al 2021 solutions to these challenges have required half a century of intensive cold regions and sub humid zone process hydrology investigations in western canada and development of alternatives to model calibration from local streamflow to develop functional modelling systems pomeroy et al 2004 pomeroy et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2013 these process studies began in research basins established during the unesco international hydrological decade of 1965 75 in the semi arid continental climate of the canadian prairies an agricultural region with a landscape dominated by annual cereal and oil seed production interspersed with perennial pastures having very mild topography and incomplete drainage basin development leading to vast areas with no streams gray granger 1988 here blowing snow transport and sublimation dominate the winter redistribution of snow soils freeze to depths of greater than 1 5 m with limited infiltration capacities snowmelt occurs over a few weeks or less controlled by solar irradiance and snowmelt contributing to over 85 of annual streamflow gray et al 1986 after snowmelt evapotranspiration normally exceeds spring and summer precipitation soils thaw and infiltration capacities are large and so runoff events are restricted to intense rainstorms usually due to convective precipitation or infrequent large multi day storms that saturate the soils dyck et al 1974 granger gray 1989 streamflow is only generated after surface depressional storage is filled and fill and spill runoff generation can be initiated when water levels in depressions exceed sill levels as originally proposed by chris spence spence et al 2022 pomeroy et al 2010 these studies led to several realisations that showed the inadequacy of hydrological modelling at the time the need to model basins without identifiable streams the need to include a full range of snow and frozen ground processes the need to parameterize a model without calibration of parameters to observed streamflow the need to calculate net radiation as a fundamental driver of coupled heat and mass transfer calculations and the need to treat landscape units as a natural fundamental spatial basis for discretization of basins for water balance calculations research in other basins in northern canada and the canadian rockies revealed the importance of permafrost glaciers forests and shrubs to the hydrology of these regions bash marshall 2014 connon et al 2014 ménard et al 2014 quinton baltzer 2013 nicholls carey 2021 pomeroy et al 2012a pradhananga pomeroy 2022 the inability of models developed in temperate parts of the world to successfully simulate the hydrology of cold regions led to the development of the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 to simulate how cryospheric and hydrological processes govern basin hydrology by linking the energy and mass balance equations together via phase change in a flexible modular predictive framework the model distributes the forcing meteorology to appropriate hydrologically meaningful landscape units that serve as control volumes for hydrological process calculations and which can be aggregated to calculate streamflow at multiple scales modules can be coupled in a wide variety of ways to represent alternative spatial structures or forcing meteorology or processes and process algorithms this permits the rapid development of many models from the platform crhm was designed to test multiple hypotheses about model structure process description and inclusion and algorithm integrity and to output any hydrological variable in a practical and easy to use system it has been used in model falsifications to diagnose suitable model scale structure and process capabilities dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2013a b lv et al 2019 the intention of crhm s development has been to couple model development and application to process hydrology investigations in research basins to examine process importance and algorithm appropriateness for describing cold regions hydrology and to use the model as a tool in combination with field investigations to diagnose hydrological functioning of basins and their sensitivity to land use and climate change the model has been further developed since 2007 for forest permafrost wetland mountain and glaciated basins and to predict water quality and hydrology it has been applied on every continent except antarctica and redesigned to calculate hydrological fluxes over larger river basins cordeiro et al 2017 costa et al 2021 fang et al 2010 2013 he et al 2021 krinner et al 2018 krogh et al 2015 krogh pomeroy 2018 lópez moreno et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2016 lópez moreno et al 2017 pomeroy et al 2013 pradhananga pomeroy 2022 rasouli et al 2014 2019 2022 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2022 stone et al 2019 van hoy et al 2020 weber et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 these versions have been used to study snowmelt and glacier contributions to streamflow summer evapotranspiration and soil moisture regimes drought excess nutrient runoff forest hydrology climate change impacts agricultural land management strategies frozen ground impacts on hydrology and climate and vegetation change impacts on permafrost crhm has been operationalized in flood forecasting systems pomeroy et al 2013 and used to inform the development of continental scale models such as mesh class and chm marsh et al 2020 wheater et al 2022 however the uniqueness of the platform is its use as a tool for the hydrologist to deploy knowledge gained in field investigations to explore and diagnose hydrological functioning from hydrological processes up to streamflow generation in basins in a systematic way the advantage of the typically uncalibrated approach with crhm is in learning from model failure through model falsification or from learning from changing model performance as discretization modules and parameters are changed this has been detailed in papers such as armstrong et al 2009 dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2013a b pomeroy et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2016a this experience has helped inform research directions and algorithm improvements for instance the failure of et soil moisture coupling algorithms in severe drought and extreme wet conditions in the canadian prairies was particularly instructive armstrong et al 2010 mahmood et al 2017 the purpose of this paper is to describe crhm s capabilities and the insights derived from using the model along with process hydrology research to diagnose hydrological change and the appropriateness of model structure and parameterisation it focusses on developments diagnoses and applications since the publication of an extensive description of crhm by pomeroy et al 2007 15 years ago and provides an example of the fusion of hydrological process research field observations and modelling that has provided new understanding and capabilities for modelling hydrology and water quality in cold regions and elsewhere 2 model structure in crhm the user constructs a purpose built model from a selection of possible basin spatial configurations spatial resolutions and physical process modules of varying degrees of physical complexity basin discretization is performed via hydrological response units hrus whose number and nature are selected by the user based on the variability of basin attributes and the desired level of physical complexity an example of basin discretization into hru from ecozones elevation topography and hydrography is shown for marmot creek research basin in the canadian rockies as fig 1 hrus can interact with each other in several ways blowing snow runoff and groundwater can flow amongst hrus in different directions depending on surface aerodynamics and prevailing wind directions for blowing snow aquifer characteristics and potential energy gradients for groundwater and gravity and surface characteristics for runoff blowing snow can enter and leave a basin whilst groundwater and runoff are aggregated and routed as streamflow which can only leave a basin at the outlet hru assemblages for a basin can be grouped and declared a representative basin which can then be repeated and adjusted to allow for rapid parameterisation of larger basins composed of many sub basins fig 1 a full and up to date description of the crhm software and its installation can be found on the chrm wiki page which can be found here https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc crhm cold region hydrological model and on the crhm website https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling crhm php with supporting r code described here https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling r packages php crhm was originally developed as an object oriented modular modelling platform in 1998 using the borland c compiler and included a dynamic linked library version dll that was distributed to module developers in the uk and canada many modules were developed based on research in the university of saskatchewan s division of hydrology environment canada s national hydrology research institute and the university of wales aberystwyth each crhm release version was numbered and dated as were all modules and all modules were reviewed before inclusion with the demise of borland and the inability of users to purchase its c compiler the development of crhm had to be centralized and carefully controlled this was done with a small group of scientists working with the crhm code developer tom brown in informal and formal discussions often in sessions in saskatoon beverage rooms modules were conceptualized debated reviewed and added and model users could request new modules on request and review by this small group detailed help files were written and updated the refactored version of crhm that has just been released permits anyone to compile it with the gnu compiler connection gcc c and module developments are welcome and will be reviewed by the authors of this paper as part of a more formal version control process modules are executed within hrus and there is complete flexibility in defining and selecting hrus a model can be lumped with one hru per sub basin fully distributed with many hrus on a fine grid or more typically semi distributed where hrus are landscape units that are assumed to have some common biogeophysical characteristics and hydrological drainage characteristics and therefore a single set of parameters intrinsic length scales of hrus are that they should be large enough to avoid self similarity in soil moisture and snow water equivalent swe so at least 100 m shook and gray 1997 and less than about 3 km to ensure similar inputs from precipitation and snow redistribution and to calculate runoff dornes et al 2008 time steps for calculations in the hru are set by observations and are assumed to be close to hourly modules may be grouped together to repeat the model structure in many sub basins fig 2 shows a general workflow for model development in crhm based on several steps 1 basin delineation and discretization top panel and 2 parameterization 3 simulation and 4 post processing bottom panel for a non group project the basin delineation and discretization use geospatial datasets i e dem landcover soil and bedrock to determine hrus and soil or glacier firn layers group projects using basin discretization require delineation of sub basin groups the parameters defining the routing length gradients and sequences of hrus and sub basins are set based on datasets of stream networks basin delineation is often informed by gis programs but can now be automated using tools such as the functions in r package cshshydrology https cran r project org package cshshydrology parameter values are rarely calibrated for crhm models instead parameter values are usually estimated based on the deduction induction and abduction dia approach which is suited for either gauged or ungauged basins pomeroy et al 2013 once parameter values are determined they can be written to crhm model project prj files using functions in crhmr historically most crhm modelling has used data from meteorological stations as the source of forcing data these data generally require considerable quality control interpolation and extrapolation to make them suitable for forcing models pre processing for crhm models can be done using crhmr which includes functions for data quality analyses and for infilling missing bad values through interpolation and or imputation the package functions can write data in the observation file obs formats used by crhm crhm was originally a windows program requiring a graphic user interface gui that permits intuitive assembly of modules for model creation hru delineation parameter setting order of operation modification and diagnostic model graphics and outputs and links to the help file however the recent refactoring of the program has allowed it to also be compiled as a command line program which enables it to be run on high performance computers it has also resulted in the program running much faster the crhmr package contains functions to execute crhm of either version and uses the wine compatibility layer https www winehq org to run windows compatible executables on linux or macos computers crhm can output the values of almost any of hundreds of variable which can result in very large output files as many of the variables are used for internal purposes their units may be difficult to work with although the output files are all simple text files there can be many output formats depending on user needs crhmr contains functions to read any output file and to post process the values including converting units and plotting time series of variables there are also functions for performing water balances using r and crhmr the entire sequence of modelling in crhm can be automated once the model structure including the program modules and the number of hrus has been decided on and the initial prj file has been created the ability to parameterize and run models automatically aids the model reproducibility as all steps in the model development are recorded in the r code reproducibility has been shown to be crucial for the elevation of hydrological modelling to a more repeatable scientific endeavour knoben et al 2021 3 processes 3 1 overview hydrological process modules in crhm have been developed from the outcomes of intensive field and detailed modelling studies of cold regions and other hydrological processes these modules can be specific to basin setup such as delineating and discretizing the basin conditioning observations for extrapolation and interpolation in the basin or to hydrological calculation needs such as calculation of longwave radiation under forest canopies wind flow over complex terrain or snow albedo decay but most commonly deal with hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration infiltration snowmelt and streamflow discharge fig 3 model processes over a mountain basin crhm has a selection of process descriptions available at different levels of granularity as separate modules or as variants options within a module for each process and also the ability to rapidly create macros as new modules on the fly to explore new hypotheses or algorithms crhm is unique in its range of cold regions hydrology and water quality capabilities with strong physically based calculations of precipitation phase snow redistribution by wind snow interception sublimation sub canopy radiation snowmelt glacier icemelt icemelt under debris snow avalanching infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils hillslope water movement frozen ground dynamics actual evapotranspiration lake evaporation wetland fill and spill soil water movement subsurface preferential flow from tile drainage groundwater flow water chemistry and streamflow it calculates runoff from rainfall and snowmelt as generated by infiltration excess and saturated overland flow meltwater routing through glacier flow over partially frozen soils detention flow shallow subsurface flow preferential flow and groundwater flow water quality inputs to water bodies can also be simulated the user selects the hydrological processes that they wish to simulate from over 97 modules and dozens of variants of these modules https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc crhm module library some modules address a single process with different algorithms assumptions and data and parameter requirements whilst other modules are more comprehensive dealing with for example all processes in snowpacks glaciers or soils there is also the capability to write a new module quickly using the macro feature where the user writes a tentative module from within the platform the macro feature allows users to create simple modules suitable for testing algorithms and for diagnosing crhm model output and is fully described here https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc crhm macros macros can also be used to create groups for reproducing aspects of the model spatially module sequences repeated in different sub basins https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc groups and structures for intercomparing the performance of different groups of modules in an otherwise common model https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc structures which is useful in diagnosing different model structures macro modules that have proven successful or useful have been then converted into permanent modules in the platform whilst there is considerable freedom in these selections and end points for instance a crhm model can be configured only as a snow model or an evapotranspiration model or a soil moisture balance model or as a full streamflow synthesis hydrology model there are some modules that are required for almost all models these modules deal with setting up the basin inputting and adjusting observations to hrus and calculation of radiation fluxes an example of a crhm model flow chart is shown in fig 4 for a partly glacierized mountain basin some of the principal modules are described in the following section most modules have parameters that need to be specified and the physical basis of most modules means that most parameters are physically identifiable crhm was designed so that the user inputs parameters based on their knowledge of the basin gis and remote sensing analysis soil surveys digital elevation models parameters that worked for similar process studies elsewhere or by borrowing parameters from other basins in similar hydroclimatic and ecological regions fig 2 the deductive inductive and abductive dia approach to parameterisation was described by pomeroy et al 2013 and is a recommended method that has shown to be successful in applying crhm in and outside of research basins including ungauged basins where parameter uncertainty is high many crhm models provide reasonable simulations of snowpacks soil moisture and streamflow using parameters set by the dia approach without calibration of parameters from streamflow appendix table 1 however some particularly routing and subsurface parameters are difficult to observe and so limited parameter calibration has been employed to improve streamflow synthesis 3 2 precipitation meteorology radiation canopy adjustments a critical aspect in successfully representing hydrological processes in any model is the treatment of the forcing meteorology assumptions around the extrapolation and interpolation of forcing data can therefore have important implications for model performance a comparison of commonly used precipitation phase partitioning approaches in crhm demonstrated large changes in timing and magnitude of snow and streamflow generation processes over a variety of cold regions research basins harder pomeroy 2014 an obstacle to adoption of physically based process models has been the more complex forcing meteorological data requirements relative to the simpler requirement of conceptual or calibrated model approaches beven 1993 hrachowitz clark 2017 the crhm framework demonstrates that input data demands need not be onerous as a variety of physically guided approaches are employed to ingest synthesize and distribute meteorological data to drive hydrological process representations and represent the climate perturbations necessary to answer research questions first order data requirements from station gridded observation reanalysis or climate model sources include hourly observations of air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation and incoming shortwave radiation when radiation data are not available crhm uses methods described by annandale et al 2001 and sicart et al 2006 to simulate incoming shortwave and longwave radiation from air temperature and humidity data with relatively small errors forcing meteorology is distributed to hrus by elevation slope aspect and location using user defined lapse rates to interpolate air temperature humidity and precipitation observations whilst respecting vapour pressure saturation limits air temperature and precipitation perturbation impacts on hydrological processes can be considered through simple delta change and multiplier functions gleick 1986 hay et al 2000 hydrological process representations require a second order of information to account for the interactions of the meteorological data and the spatial variability of the basin and its land surface precipitation partitioning into rain or snow phases is critical in cold regions and the psychometric energy balance approach of harder and pomeroy 2013 is used to address the well documented dependence of phase upon temperature and humidity harpold et al 2017 jennings et al 2018 in the absence of reliable humidity information alternate approaches from air temperature harder pomeroy 2014 and ice bulb temperature marks et al 2013 thresholds are available wind induced gauge undercatch of snowfall is a persistent challenge in cold regions and is accounted for with nipher goodison et al 1998 and alter shielded corrections smith 2009 the tight coupling of the water and energy balances when considering physical process representation requires detailed accounting of radiation variability and forest interactions basic corrections such as radiation correction for slope and aspect garnier ohmura 1970 are applied at the hru scale shortwave and longwave radiation transmissions are then simulated separately for effects of forest cover accounting for differences amongst continuous forest canopies forest gaps and larger clearings as functions of measurable forest parameters sicart et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2009 ellis et al 2010 wind flow over complex terrain is calculated using the parametric method of walmsley et al 1989 which adjusts wind speed for topographic location based on the results of a boundary layer model 3 3 snow redistribution and sublimation by wind gravity and forest canopies snow redistribution by wind in open environments and by avalanches in steep mountain terrain are important processes for calculating the accumulation of the seasonal snowpack vionnet et al 2021 crhm calculates blowing snow transport and sublimation pomeroy 1989 pomeroy et al 1993 pomeroy and gray 1990 pomeroy and li 2000 pomeroy and male 1992 pomeroy and gray 1995 to estimate hru snowpack erosion and deposition as a mass balance of horizontal snow transport via saltation and suspension and in transit sublimation using precipitation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity as well as information on the snowpack horizontal blowing snow redistribution by wind from one hru to another is determined by considering exposed surface roughness as a function of snow depth and surface characteristics such as vegetation density and height snow can blow into a basin or sub basin from outside of the basin even if they are over a watershed divide three factors are needed for a blowing snow event to occur wind speed greater than the threshold condition li pomeroy 1997 friction from wind at the surface greater than that causing drag on exposed vegetation and bare ground pomeroy gray 1994 and a supply of erodible snow or concurrent snowfall snow is eroded from wind exposed hrus and deposited as drifts in topographically sheltered or well vegetated hrus the blowing snow model in crhm pomeroy et al 2007 was extended to application of the model over mountains and complex terrain by macdonald et al 2009 using a parameterisation to transport snow from source to sink hrus based on their exposed vegetation height and topographic position influencing relative wind speeds and shear stresses this is shown in fig 5 in addition to blowing snow snow is redistributed by gravity in avalanches from higher to lower elevations on steep slopes described by an avalanche module based on the algorithm developed by bernhardt and schulz 2010 snow slides in an avalanche if the minimum snow holding depth and a minimum slope angle are exceeded they suggested values of holding depth of 50 mm w e water equivalent and 25 minimum surface slope for slopes steeper than the minimum slope angle the snow holding depth decreases exponentially this module moves snow downslope from steep hrus to less steep hrus importantly it interacts with the blowing snow calculations the blowing snow module will deposit snow in cornices at high elevation steep slope hrus and the avalanche module will then redistribute this snow down the valley side producing realistic high mountain snow distributions crhm integrates a canopy module to represent the effects of forest canopy on snow rainfall sublimation and evapotranspiration processes in a physically based manner fig 6 forest precipitation interactions capture the interception of rainfall and snowfall in canopies to quantify evaporation and sublimation losses as a function of forest characteristics and snow unloading and drip as a function of ice bulb temperature hedstrom pomeroy 1998 ellis et al 2010 pomeroy et al 1998b in this module snow interception is estimated by the antecedent canopy snow load unloading rate coefficient and maximum interception capacity of the canopy which is determined by the tree species snowfall density and effective leaf area index lai ellis et al 2010 canopy sublimation is estimated by multiplying the intercepted snow load by a physically based sublimation coefficient calculated from turbulent transfer of sensible heat to and water vapour away from an ideal ice sphere and then corrected for the degree of exposure of intercepted snow in the canopy as described by fractal geometry area volume relationships pomeroy et al 1998b under the canopy snowmelt is governed by sub canopy radiation and turbulent transfer relationships and snowmelt and sub canopy rainfall including drip connect to soil infiltration and evapotranspiration modules and eventually to runoff routing modules figs 3 4 6 3 4 energy for snowmelt icemelt and sublimation the energy available for snow firn and ice melt and sublimation from the snow or ice surface is the sum of fluxes due to shortwave and longwave radiation turbulent transfer of sensible heat advection of energy from precipitation internal energy state change in the snowpack and conduction of heat from the ground pomeroy et al 1998a shortwave and longwave radiation are the principal sources of melt energy and the radiation module in crhm simulates incoming shortwave global radiation adjusted to slope and aspect and so includes self shading but not shadowing from surrounding topography in the absence of observations shortwave transmittance can be estimated using diurnal temperature ranges latitude and time of year shook pomeroy 2011a and longwave irradiance can be estimated from shortwave transmittance and air temperature using the algorithm proposed by sicart et al 2006 that modified brutsaert s clear sky longwave algorithm for cloudy conditions sky view factor and terrain or vegetation emission of longwave are also included in the sicart s model and can be significant in mountains plüss ohmura 1997 and forests pomeroy et al 2009 all snowmelt models use an albedo routine that can be selected from amongst seven options including forcing with observed albedo the area albedo change routine of gray and landine 1987 is often used for its consideration of the effects of initiation of snow covered area depletion on areal albedo during melt of shallow prairie snowcovers an alternative module of snow albedo change developed by verseghy 1991 and adopted by essery and etchevers 2004 is based on the age depth density and temperature of the snow layer and is favoured for continuous and deep snowcovers there are three other snow and ice albedo routine options for specialised applications including using observed albedos as model forcing inputs available melt energy can be converted to a melt rate considering the latent heat of fusion and available latent heat by turbulent transfer can be converted to sublimation considering the latent heat of sublimation crhm has several options for melt calculations one is the energy budget snowmelt model ebsm gray landine 1988 a daily timestep processes based parametric semi empirical single layer snowpack snowmelt model based on snowmelt physics described by male and gray 1981 this model is robust has no parameters to set and is well suited for shallow cold canadian prairie snowpacks or for temperate snowpacks where internal energy changes are small it has been customized to ice and firn melt by adjusting its albedo routine and assuming glacier ice and firn are isothermal so all internal energy change goes to icemelt or firnmelt pradhananga pomeroy 2022 the more physically based two layer energy and mass balance snowmelt model snobal marks et al 1998 is used more commonly in crhm to calculate snow melt processes debeer pomeroy 2017 it can simulate the energy and mass balances of deep cold and isothermal snowpacks over glacier and non glacier surfaces the turbulent heat fluxes are obtained using an approach adopted from brutsaert 1982 by marks and dozier 1992 over glaciers the turbulent fluxes can be calculated to account for the katabatic wind commonly found in glacier environment following a parametrization developed by oerlemans and grisogono 2002 and further tested by munro 2004 debris covered glaciers are prominent features of the world s glacierized mountain regions with the presence of supraglacial debris modifying both the glacier ablation patterns and its response to climatic forcing scherler et al 2018 the effects of debris on glacier surface melt are well understood a thin layer of debris less than several centimetres or patchy debris on the glacier surface enhances melt while a thick layer of debris insulates the underlying ice and reduces melt nicholson benn 2006 östrem 1959 a routine by carenzo et al 2016 has been included to calculate debris covered glacier icemelt crhm can also calculate temperature index and radiation index melt which allow it to simulate less physically based modeling approaches for the purposes of intra platform comparisons or model falsifications e g krogh and pomeroy 2021 3 5 glacier mass balance crhm simulates the mass balance of the snow firn ice water equivalents for glaciers along with the glacier surface elevation and glacier water and ice flow routing pradhananga pomeroy 2022 the change in glacier surface elevation is calculated as a function of snow redistribution and accumulation snow conversion to firn firn conversion to ice and ablation of snow firn and ice firn is snow that has survived at least for one summer melt season anderson benson 1963 and its densification and conversion to ice is calculated in three temporal stages adopted from semi empirical steady state approaches and deployed in an 11 layer snow firn ice system many models do not consider firn separately from glacier ice e g li et al 2015 naz et al 2014 wheater et al 2022 however firn has important properties for glacier energetics and hydrology the albedo of firn is lower than that of snow but it is higher than that of ice meltwater routing is slower in firn than in ice hannah gurnell 2001 3 6 evapotranspiration the evaporation module provides several options that allow users to diagnose actual evaporation the water vapour physically transferred to the atmosphere from soil plants and free water surfaces as a complex physical process diagnosing reasonable estimates of evaporation requires consideration for key interactions between the balance of available energy aerodynamic water vapour transfer and the surface water balance earlier module developments included the granger and gray 1989 method which can be applied to unsaturated agricultural surfaces and does not have parameters to set except surface aerodynamic roughness however for the purposes of hydrological modelling previous studies e g armstrong et al 2010 pomeroy et al 2014 needed to modify existing evaporation parameterisations for water limited e g drought via soil moisture coupling or energy limited conditions e g wet conditions via introduction of the penman monteith p m method monteith 1965 evapotranspiration can be modelled more realistically using the p m approach applied under a range of dry to wet conditions parameterisation of the p m method follows the algorithm described by armstrong et al 2008 2010 this approach uses a standard aerodynamic resistance and a modified jarvis type canopy resistance formula verseghy et al 1993 that applies four environmental stress factors describing stomatal controls under suboptimal conditions for plant growth for free water surfaces e g wetlands small lakes and streams a standard priestley taylor formulation priestley taylor 1972 can be applied to estimate actual evaporation assuming advection free conditions for large lakes a bulk transfer formulation the meyer formula is available krogh et al 2015 all evaporation methods withdraw moisture from free water surfaces first then intercepted canopy water figure 6 then ponded surface water and finally stored soil moisture restricted by water availability to conserve the water mass balance 3 7 hillslope soils and groundwater hillslope hydrology involves surface and subsurface water redistribution and interactive processes such as infiltration evapotranspiration overland subsurface and groundwater flows which play critical roles in streamflow generation kirkby 1988 hillslope hydrology derives the inputs from rainfall and snowmelt at the soil surface which either infiltrate to recharge the upper soil layer or run off as overland flow figure 6 the infiltration process in cold regions comprise frozen and unfrozen soils and is influenced by soil texture initial soil moisture saturation initial surface saturation and soil temperature freeze cherry 1979 kane stein 1983 zhao gray 1999 soil moisture is withdrawn by evapotranspiration into the atmosphere from the rooting depth which is controlled by plant types soil texture and biophysical properties of vegetation armstrong et al 2010 in the unsaturated zone water moves vertically from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer via pressure gradients and gravity and excess water from the lower soil layer percolates vertically to the saturated zone recharging groundwater lateral subsurface flow in the unsaturated zone and lateral groundwater flow in the saturated zone redistributes water based on hydraulic gradients along the hillslope both subsurface and groundwater flows are important flow pathways in streamflow generation and are complicated by local heterogeneities in hillslopes graham et al 2010 and hydrogeological characteristics underneath the hillslope hayashi 2020 surface overland flow generated by infiltration excess or saturation excess mechanisms is the other flow pathway in streamflow generation and can be delayed by detention layers such as loose organic material on forest floor keith et al 2010 or temporal snow damming fang et al 2013a b in areas with heavy soils and intense agricultural activity artificial subsurface drainage structures i e tile drainage also influence subsurface water redistribution processes and affect streamflow generation crhm calculates the overland subsurface and groundwater flows and simulates the groundwater surface water interactions using a soil module the soil module was revised from an original soil moisture balance routine developed by leavesley et al 1983 and has been modified by recent studies to account for cold regions processes dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2010 2013 pomeroy et al 2016a the soil module now estimates soil moisture and groundwater storage depressional storage subsurface flow in soil layers groundwater flow and surface overland flow with detention layer configuration the flow rates are calculated using darcy s law parameterized using the pedotransfer relationship developed by brooks and corey 1964 the soil module interacts with evapotranspiration infiltration and freeze thaw algorithm modules to estimate evaporation loss and infiltration and simulate freezing thawing dynamics on water movement in soil layers a detailed description of these modules for simulating hillslope hydrology is provided in fang et al 2013a b and pomeroy et al 2016a a new tile drainage module has been developed to calculate the tile outflow rate from tile drainage networks based on soil moisture it uses an extended version of hooghoudt s equation hooghoudt 1940 that accounts for the effect of soil capillary fringe on drainable soil water skaggs 1980 crhm has some limitations in simulating groundwater surface interactions and groundwater systems the assumption of surface tension in pore spaces being dominant over gravity is a limitation when simulating preferential flows in subsurface and groundwater layers where coarse textured and unconsolidated materials overlaying impeding layers or bedrock the simple bucket conceptualization of the groundwater component is another limitation in simulating groundwater fed streamflow in first order alpine basins that are controlled by complex groundwater storage discharge dynamics hayashi 2020 3 8 frozen soils and permafrost the presence of frozen soils plays a key hydrological role on cold regions hydrology driving the energy and mass fluxes exchange between the ground and the atmosphere in places with permafrost or seasonally frozen soils infiltration rates depend not only on soils characteristics and available water but also on the degree of ground thaw and soil s water ice content scherler et al 2010 crhm includes a set of physically based algorithms to represent processes related to ground freeze and thaw and infiltration into frozen soils infiltration into frozen soil is characterized by two flow regimes a transient and a quasi steady state regime zhao et al 1997 the transient regime occurs immediately after water starts infiltrating where the infiltration rate and heat transfer decrease rapidly as the soil temperature increases through conduction the quasi steady state is characterized by gradual changes in the infiltration rate with time and soil warming is driven by latent heat released by the refreezing of melted water supplied from upper layers zhao et al 1997 realistically representing infiltration into frozen soils and subsurface storage and flow is thus critical to simulate the hydrological regime of cold regions basins walvoord kurylyk 2016 infiltration into frozen soils is represented following gray et al 2001 where infiltration is first classified as unlimited restricted and limited infiltration under limited conditions depends on initial surface saturation average soil saturation and temperature and infiltration opportunity time and is calculated using a parametric representation of a finite element heat and mass transfer model zhao et al 1997 zhao gray 1997 1999 or a simpler model derived from observations in the canadian prairies fitted into a physically based framework and forced by the degree of soil saturation and peak snow accumulation before melt gray et al 1986 crhm has three different modules options based on xg 2013 hayashi et al 2007 and van wijk 1963 and more variants to calculate soil freezing fronts most algorithms that represent freezing and thawing fronts are based on the stefan equation juminikis 1977 that includes heat exchange through conduction and water phase change in homogeneous soils modified versions of the stefan equation have been implemented to represent multilayered soils fox 1992 hayashi et al 2007 woo et al 2004 xie and gough 2013 other solutions to the freezing and thawing front problem that also incorporate advected heat flux have been developed by lunardini 1998 as shown by kurylyk et al 2014 simpler algorithms based on a temperature index have also been included such as the n factor woo et al 2007 the most preferred options is the xg algorithm as it provides an intermediate degree of complexity fast computation and allows the calculation of freezing and thawing fronts over multilayered soils xie and gough 2013 the xg module in crhm uses a multi layer simplified solution of stefan s equation xie and gough 2013 to represent frost table dynamics freezing and thawing in partially frozen soils the xg algorithm assumes a linear temperature profile in the thawed soil layers to represent heat transfer in multi layered soils with heterogenous soil properties xg in crhm divides the soil into several numerical layers with variable depth to compute the progression of the thawing freezing front in which each layer has its own properties e g porosity and thermal conductivity ground surface temperature is used as the upper boundary condition which can be estimated using the radiative conductive convection rcc method of williams et al 2015 or a temperature index algorithm woo et al 2007 for the snow free period and can be estimated using a conduction approach luce tarboton 2010 by coupling to the energetics of the snobal snowpack module for the snow covered period as the thawing front advances through the summer subsurface water storage capacity increases proportionally to the maximum subsurface capacity where there is permafrost infiltration is restricted by the position of the frost table and the subsurface water storage capacity frost table and infiltration into frozen soils are tightly coupled with the snowpack evapotranspiration infiltration and soil moisture processes for example ground thaw does not start until the snowpack is completely depleted evapotranspiration cannot access water below the frost table and the thermal conductivity of the soil layers depend on the soil moisture content which in turn depends on lateral water redistribution in permafrost soils the non frozen soil layer between the ground surface and the uppermost permafrost layer defines the active layer which varies spatially e g north versus south facing slopes carey woo 2005 and temporally through the season as the air temperature raises after the winter ground thaw primarily depends on the energy available to warm the soil and the soil s heat conductivity capacity which in turn depends on factors such as water ice content porosity and texture ling zhang 2004 zhao et al 1997 the depth of the active layer controls the available soil depth capacity for water transport and storage mediating runoff generation for example quinton and gray 2001 showed that the hydraulic conductivity of organic soils can decrease several orders of magnitude with depth krogh et al 2017 and krogh pomeroy 2021 describe crhm s representation of permafrost dynamics and model validation in detail 3 9 depressional storage and variable contributing areas for runoff generation much of the prairies of western canada and the northern united states lie within the prairie pothole region where the hydrography is dominated by millions of surface depressions known as potholes or sloughs these depressions trap surface runoff which in canada is predominantly from the spring melt of the accumulated winter snowpack because much of the region is underlain by glacial till which generally has very low hydraulic conductivities the infiltration of the water is restricted van der kamp hayashi 1998 when depressions are filled additional runoff or direct precipitation will flow overland to neighbouring depressions the phenomenon being known as fill and spill runoff spence woo 2003 fill and spill influenced runoff occurs not only in the prairies but in the circumpolar boreal forest arctic tundra and other wetland and lake dominated regions with moderate topography and so is a globally important streamflow generation mechanism the trapping and release of fill and spill runoff depends on water storage in the depressions fig 7 therefore the fraction of a basin dominated by depressions that can contribute flow to the outlet also varies with surface water storage when depressions in a basin have available storage capacity they can retain surface runoff and the area contributing flow to these depressions does not contribute flow to the basin outlet conversely when depressions are filled then they cannot retain runoff and their contributing area can contribute flow to the basin outlet the relationship between the storages of water and the contributing fractions of prairie basins is nonlinear and hysteretic due to the very large numbers of state variables water storages in the depressions and their complex interactions shook et al 2013 shook et al 2021 most hydrological models are unable to simulate varying contributing fractions of basins although several hydraulic models have been developed to address the problem including the wetland dem ponding model shook et al 2013 and fluxos overland costa et al 2020 unfortunately these models are computationally expensive and cannot be easily incorporated within hydrological models the pothole cascade model pcm shook et al 2013 is an alternative it is a relatively simple model that simulates fill and spill from depressional storage based on the explicit representation of flow sequences to arrangements of individual depressions fig 8 the model has been shown to produce connected contributing fractions similar to those of the more complex models shook et al 2013 the pcm has been incorporated in crhm by using hrus to simulate networks of connecting depressions fig 8 although the number of depressions in a given basin is much greater than can be simulated by crhm the model is able to compensate by simulating a representative fraction of the depression network with each depression being represented by a hru with its own runoff contributing area the outflow from the modelled fraction is then scaled to represent the entire basin this approach has been applied successfully to several prairie basins pomeroy et al 2012b 2014 3 10 nutrient dynamics crhm has been extended to simulate water quality concentrations and fluxes of nitrogen n five species and phosphorus p five species based on the research of roste 2015 and costa et al 2017 and based on the water quality process simulations developed in the hype model lindström et al 2010 with similar parameterisation needs this extension is motivated by the recognition that nutrient pollution and eutrophication of major lakes are also major environmental challenges in many cold regions around the world smith et al 2006 2019 cold regions biogeochemistry processes have not been adequately represented by conventional rainfall runoff models costa et al 2020 n and p transport and transformation processes are challenging to simulate due to the effect of seasonal snow cover brooks et al 1996 jones 1987 mladenov et al 2012 soil freezing brooks et al 1996 cade menun et al 2013 clark et al 2009 jones 1999 pellerin et al 2012 peters driscoll 1987 sebestyen et al 2008 snider et al 2017 and lake wetland freeze up on soil plant systems soil biogeochemical cycling microbial activity and plant uptake cober et al 2018 costa et al 2019 elliott 2013 liu et al 2013 2019 white 1973 soil management and agricultural practices such as fertilizer use tillage practices miller et al 1994 timmons et al 1970 ulén 1997 and wetland drainage further hinder the application and effectiveness of existing nutrient models baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2020 irvine et al 2019 van esbroeck et al 2017 models that rely excessively on tuned and lumped parameters are prone to fail to capture the nuances of these processes making them less reliable for future climate projections and non stationary scenarios crhm integrates hydro biogeochemical drivers at agricultural field and sub basin scales for example agricultural activities can be explicitly represented in the model such as fertilizer manure application that can strongly impact the amount of soil nutrients mobilized with runoff other sources such as atmospheric deposition and plant residue as well as sinks like plant uptake can also be considered chemical transformations calculated include mineralization for n and p nitrification n denitrification n degradation n and p dissolution n and p and dynamic sorption desorption equilibrium p with sediments transformation rates are computed dynamically by modulating reference values determined at 20 c to changes in soil temperature and moisture the ability to capture spatio temporal hydro biogeochemical variations at high temporal resolution during snowmelt via energy budget calculations hourly and sub hourly makes the model exceptionally suited for capturing both streamflow and nutrient export during the short but critical snowmelt period baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2017 kokulan et al 2019 the modelling of nutrient transport phenomena is integrated within many core modules and extends to the runoff and routing calculations in crhm 3 11 streamflow synthesis streamflow synthesis requires simulations of hydrological processes and calculations of flux and state variables in the hydrology cycle to estimate surface runoff subsurface flow groundwater flow and channel precipitation that are the main sources of streamflow for a drainage basin predicting streamflow at the basin outlet involves the routing of surface runoff subsurface flow and groundwater flow as well as channel routing which considers the effects of storage and dynamics of a system such as land surface depression ponds soil layers groundwater or channel on the shape and movement of various flow hydrographs routing can be classified by different criteria 1 lumped flow or distributed flow routing based on spatial and temporal variations 2 hydrological or hydraulic routing based on governing equations and 3 river flow reservoir or overland flow routing based on watercourse type streamflow synthesis is one of the most important aspects in hydrology for flood forecasting reservoir operation and water resource management but it is highly challenging in cold regions because of the strong seasonal dynamics of frozen soil and snow storage for hru routing in a basin crhm can use clark s lag and route algorithm based on time area unit hydrograph theory clark 1945 for subsurface and groundwater flows and clark s algorithm or muskingum method based on a variable discharge storage relationship chow 1964 for surface runoff routing sequence can be from one hru to another hru for clark s algorithm or from one hru to multiple hrus for muskingum method with a modified hack s law to estimate routing lengths from hru areas fang et al 2010 and to allocate amount of routed flow between hrus based on their relative lengths manning s equation is used to estimate the mean flow velocity in the channel with parameters calculated from the channel condition and the gradient of the drainage network for large river basins crhm uses representative basin rb groups to simulate hydrological processes for sub basins and uses a muskingum routing group to connect and route the sub basin streamflow to the outlet of the river basin details of parameterization and setup for crhm streamflow routing are provided in recent studies fang et al 2010 2013 pomeroy et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2014 routing methods in crhm do not incorporate ice jam and backwater into river flow routing and mainly estimate the natural flow without reservoir operations which are some limitations of crhm in streamflow simulation for large and low relief river basins in cold regions however routing on glaciers is considered in that melt from ice and firn melt is routed through linear reservoirs before being released to the soil routine 4 research basin hydrological process diagnosis crhm has a unique capability to integrate with field investigations in research basins to demonstrate the impacts of improved process descriptions on hydrological prediction and to constrain calculations of hydrological processes from the results of process studies in the basin as it is a modelling platform for scientists it can be changed and developed sequentially to reflect hydrological discoveries and advances in research basins its emphasis on permitting model failure rather than parameter calibration makes the importance of advances in understanding very clear in model outputs model performance metrics against multiple prediction objectives ranging from snow and glaciers to evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater to streamflow discharge and water chemistry are shown in the appendix table 1 the following examples show crhm s application in agricultural forest permafrost and high mountain basins in cold and temperate regions to diagnose specific aspects of how agricultural drainage tillage and fertilizer application permafrost and glaciation impact snowpacks soil moisture groundwater streamflow and hydrochemistry 4 1 impacts of tile drainage on agricultural runoff artificial tile drainage is an essential agricultural management practice in many regions around the world including in cold climates however recent studies suggest that these systems may exacerbate the effect of climate change in increasing nutrient export haghnazari et al 2020 tile drainage systems drain about 14 of farmlands in canada icid 2018 kokulan et al 2019 in southern ontario canada tile drainage is present in 45 of the fields especially in the southwestern part where fine grained and clay soils pose challenges for water management plach et al 2018 van esbroeck et al 2016 many agricultural lands in southern ontario with tile drainage systems have shallow soil layers separated from the deeper groundwater system by an impermeable or semi impermeable layer broughton jutras 2013 these layers with low hydraulic conductivity prevent the free drainage of water from shallow to deeper soil and groundwater systems snowmelt partially frozen soils and freeze thaw events due to large temperature variations in the cold season further contribute to the ponding of water in surface depressions and the need for tile drainage lam et al 2016 macrae et al 2007 macrae et al 2019 during large temperature oscillations heavy rainfall and surface ponding are common and the thick capillary fringe that develops in the fine grained clay and clay loam soils compromises its natural drainage capacity the tile drainage module developed for crhm enables simulation of these cold agricultural regions and evaluation of management options kompanizare et al 2022 tile flow is calculated based on a modified version of the hooghoudt 1940 equation that accounts for capillary fringe development which causes the saturation of soil above the water table and reduces soil drainable water skaggs 1980 fig 9 shows the results obtained for an application to a farm field in southern ontario the model was able to capture the flashy response of the tiles and their effect on the seasonal groundwater table results showed that tile flow was able to rapidly reduce soil moisture and lateral overland flow to adjacent fields the groundwater table oscillated drastically between seasons influencing the tile flow response in the growing season low precipitation and higher evapotranspiration rates often caused minimal tile flows this analysis informs evaluations of tile drainage impacts on lake erie hydrology and water quality 4 2 nutrient export from agricultural basins the crhm water quality modules derived from hype have been used to investigate the dynamics of nitrogen n and phosphorus p in a small basin that contributes to the flow of the red river into lake winnipeg manitoba canada lake winnipeg is the 10th largest in the world and similarly to other lakes in north america such as lake erie has been increasingly threatened by enhanced aquatic productivity and the occurrence of algal schindler et al 2012 due to excessive nutrient load the small basin examined in this study is the steppler basin sb which is located in the headwaters of the south tobacco creek basin stcb sb is a 205 ha agricultural basin comprising 42 farm fields that are used to grow cereal grains and oilseeds on a rotating basis as well as a beef cattle herd beneficial management practices bmps were initiated in 2005 and include a holding pond riparian zone grassed waterway grazing restrictions forage conversion and nutrient management the model was set up to explicitly simulate the 42 individual farm fields in sb meteorological observations were used to force the model hydrology whilst fertilizer manure and plant residue loading information as well as tillage practices were used to force and parameterise the hype water quality modules in crhm model predictions were evaluated against observations at 5 locations in the basin between 2005 and 2011 this included 1 snow water equivalent swe and 2 streamflow for hydrological model validation and 3 two nitrogen species nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 and 4 two phosphorus species soluble reactive phosphorus srp and particulate phosphorous pp for biogeochemical model validation costa et al 2017 liu et al 2014 and mahmood et al 2017 provide details on model setup in this basin fig 10 compares observations and simulations for both hydrological and water quality variables the flashy spring freshet accounted for 21 of the annual streamflow and 30 31 20 and 16 of the annual no3 nh4 srp and pp export load on average the results highlighted the importance of parameterising a water quality model with the amount type placement and timing of fertilizer and manure application as these have strong controls on nutrient export e g duncan et al 2017 grant et al 2019 plach et al 2018 tillage practices i e broadcast incorporated with seeding affect the depth at which nutrient inputs were placed in the soil and also influence nutrient availability to runoff transport the model parameterised with these practices simulated the extremely flashy and episodic discharges of these nutrients during snowmelt freshet this shows the importance of snow and frozen ground hydrological processes along with nutrient dynamics and land use practices in simulating water quality dynamics in cold climate agricultural basins by demonstrating that the crhm with suitable water quality process simulations can predict chemical transport that results from agricultural land management a concrete transformative direction for innovation in basin nutrient modelling in canada and other cold regions is outlined appropriate cold regions hydrological models are needed to provide advanced background hydrology to support comprehensive water quality dynamics simulations 4 3 diagnosing glacier contributions to mountain streamflow the bow river at banff basin brb 2192 km2 originates in the eastern slopes of the canadian rockies and forms a principal headwater of the south saskatchewan river in alberta canada the basin has experienced glacier retreat since the early 20th century and glaciers covered approximately 1 7 of the brb in 2005 bolch et al 2010 glacier coverage is projected to be minimal by the end of the 21st century clarke et al 2015 to investigate recent glacier contributions to streamflow in the brb in order to determine what the losses of streamflow might be in a deglaciated future a crhm model was constructed to simulate relevant snow ice and rainfall runoff streamflow generation processes for high mountains such as blowing snow avalanching snow snow interception and sublimation energy budget snow and glacier melt infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils hillslope water redistribution lake water storage and evaporation evapotranspiration groundwater flow surface and sub surface runoff and open channel flow the hydrological model was entirely parameterised from local research results and observable quantities instead of relying on calibration a high resolution weather model a regional run at 4 km resolution of the weather research and forecasting wrf model li et al 2019 bounded by era interim outputs provided forcing near surface meteorological variables during 2000 2015 a detailed description of the hydrological model setup is provided in fang and pomeroy n d two model simulations were conducted for the brb with glacier 2005 coverage bolch et al 2010 and without glacier minimal coverage expected for the end of the 21st c clarke et al 2015 the model simulation with glacier was evaluated against observed streamflow water survey of canada gauge 05bb001 and the proportional change in the streamflow as result of glacier melt sum of firn and ice melt between the two simulations was used to estimate the glacier contribution to streamflow for the 15 year mean 2000 2015 cold 2002 and warm 2006 years the uncalibrated model provided good predictions of daily streamflow for the brb fig 11 with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 values of 0 75 0 84 and 0 77 and model bias mb fang et al 2013a b values of 0 13 0 19 and 0 11 for the 15 year 2002 and 2006 respectively the 15 year mean annual glacier contribution to streamflow in the brb was 3 7 fig 11a while glacier melt accounted for 1 7 and 5 8 of annual streamflow in the cold 2002 fig 11b and warm 2006 fig 11c years respectively the mean annual glacier contribution to streamflow for bow river at banff during 2000 2015 was lower than the 4 9 mean annual glacier contribution during 2000 2009 estimated by bash and marshall 2014 but higher than the mean annual contribution values of 1 98 estimated for 1952 1993 by hopkinson and young 1998 the 2 2 for 1975 1998 estimated by comeau et al 2009 or the 2 8 for 1976 1998 estimated by demuth et al 2008 these differences likely result from interannual variabilities of streamflow and glacier wastage during these different periods as well as differing estimation methodologies and available forcing data 4 4 arctic droughts and floods arctic hydrology has many challenges for hydrological diagnosis and prediction this remote region is sparsely gauged with few long term research basin laudon et al 2017 which restricts the opportunity to use observations to diagnose hydrological change and to inform the development of hydrological models the arctic supports a wide range of complex biophysical processes bring et al 2016 including the presence of permafrost and or seasonally frozen ground controlling subsurface and surface mass and energy fluxes through thermodynamics these characteristics make northern regions a particularly challenging environment for hydrological models yet hydrological and permafrost thaw predictions are needed to design infrastructure to manage water and to evaluate ecosystem services bring et al 2016 hjort et al 2018 lique et al 2016 schuur et al 2015 a small permafrost underlain arctic basin near inuvik northwest territories canada 16 4 km2 havikpak creek was simulated using crhm krogh et al 2017 to evaluate the contribution of differing hydrological processes to the water balance and streamflow generation using the crhm platform this model configuration incorporates key arctic hydrological processes including snowpack energy balance blowing snow redistribution and sublimation canopy interception ground freeze and thaw infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils evapotranspiration surface and subsurface flow and storage and streamflow routing the permafrost representation see frozen soils and permafrost section is a novel treatment of the ground freeze and thaw algorithm and its interaction with other physical processes three water years dry normal and wet were selected to highlight the interactions between key physical processes at the basin scale fig 12 the example shows the impact of a deeper longer lasting snowpack on the development of the permafrost active layer thickness alt in a dry year with a relatively low 8 cm peak swe the snowpack fully ablated by the end of may allowing an earlier initiation of ground thaw red area fig 12 that resulted in an 80 cm deep alt by the end of the summer in contrast in a wetter year with a much deeper snowpack 180 mm peak swe that fully ablated by june 23 about three weeks later ground thaw initiation was substantially delayed resulting in a shallower end of the summer alt at 64 cm the latter was also influenced by an earlier accumulation of next season snow due to the colder and wetter conditions it is important that such hydrological interactions are properly captured by hydrological models applied to permafrost regions as they impact runoff generation processes and crhm has been shown to adequately represent with little to no calibration most arctic hydrological processes krogh et al 2017 krogh pomeroy 2021 5 diagnosis of land use and climate changes crhm has easy to manipulate parameters that describe land use boundary conditions and also allow systematic changes to forcing meteorology to examine hydrological sensitivity to climate change this provides a useful capability to assess the sensitivity of hydrological processes and basin hydrology to change a few examples of this capability are provided here in diagnoses of the impacts of wetland drainage forest disturbance and climate change on hydrological processes and streamflow generation from local to global scales 5 1 prairie wetland drainage impact on streamflow volume canadian prairie wetlands exist in surface depressions that receive blowing snow transport in the winter causing deep snow accumulations that melt and fill the depressions in spring the impact of depressional storage change on the hydrology of small canadian prairie basins has been unclear because of conflicting conclusions on the degree of impact between studies of runoff in very small scale drainage systems and those of multi year streamflow characteristics of larger basins and because of the compounding effects of climate change dumanski et al 2015 to better understand and predict the impact of wetland drainage on prairie streams due to breaching of depressions resulting in lower elevation outlets crhm was used to create a model that simulates blowing snow redistribution snowmelt infiltration to frozen soils and the fill and spill of networks of depressions at multiple scales pomeroy et al 2014 this crhm model was used to simulate the hydrology of smith creek research basin saskatchewan 400 km2 with various drainage scenarios smith creek research basin has undergone substantial wetland drainage from 1958 when it contained 96 km2 of depressions 24 of the basin area to 43 km2 11 of the basin in 2008 dumanski et al 2015 crhm simulations showed that wetland drainage can increase annual and peak daily flows substantially and that notable increases to estimates of the annual volume and peak daily flow of the flood of record 2011 have derived from drainage to date and will proceed with further wetland drainage restoration of depressional storage from the current extent back to that of 1958 decreased the simulated 2011 flood peak by 32 and the 2011 yearly volume of streamflow by 29 whilst the greatest proportional impacts on the peak daily flows are for dry years substantial impacts on the peak daily discharge of record 2011 from drainage 78 or restoration 32 are notable and important in smith creek and downstream the relative response of total basin flow volume over six hydrological years of simulation 2007 2013 shows a non linear flow response to wetland area change in fig 13 this is a useful metric when assessing the effects of wetland change in smith creek on water supply for large lakes downstream in manitoba that have experienced repeated flooding drainage induced decreases in wetland area by 43 km2 increased the annual flow volume by 55 whilst restoration induced increases in wetland area by 53 km2 decreased the annual flow volume by 26 smith creek is already heavily drained but its flow volumes can still be strongly impacted by further drainage 5 2 mountain forest cover change impact on streamflow the impacts of forest disturbances on streamflow entering calgary alberta canada were investigated using a crhm model of the montane forested elbow river basin 1192 km2 above calgary the model was parameterized from local research results and represent the relevant streamflow generation processes wind redistribution of snow gravitational snow transport on steep mountain slopes glacier accumulation and melt intercepted snow from forest canopies infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils hillslope sub surface water redistribution and evapotranspiration from forests grassland clearings and alpine tundra bias corrected near surface outputs from the weather research and forecasting wrf model bounded by era interim reanalysis during october 2000 september 2015 forced the model air temperature vapour pressure wind speed incoming shortwave radiation and precipitation outputs from the 4 km wrf li et al 2019 were bias corrected using the same outputs from 10 km global environmental multiscale and canadian precipitation analysis gem capa produced by environment and climate change canada generating an initial 10 km bias corrected forcing field additional precipitation bias correction was performed by a double mass curve analysis of streamflow from the model runs using the initial 10 km bias corrected wrf and water survey of canada wsc streamflow observations from the elbow river above calgary the hypotheses to be tested were that disturbance of montane forests by wildfire pine beetle kill and harvesting will increase streamflow volumes and peak flows by reducing evapotranspiration and sublimation from the forest canopy and reducing infiltration to soils through compaction harvesting hydrophobicity wildfire or increased saturation from reduced root withdrawals for evapotranspiration all simulations of forest disturbances were conducted to examine the hydrological sensitivity to disturbance for three types of scenarios wildfire affecting all forests mountain pine beetle dendroctonus ponderosae hopkins infestation of lodgepole pine pinus contorta var latifolia forests salvage harvesting of beetle killed lodgepole pine forests and harvesting of all pine forests forest canopy parameters and soil parameters for infiltration were adjusted for three wildfire severity scenarios ranging from a 20 reduction in forest canopy leaf area for low wildfire severity to an 80 reduction in forest canopy leaf area with development of hydrophobic soils of lower infiltration capacity for the high wildfire severity scenario two lodgepole pine forest harvesting scenarios were created half of the maximum harvest area 25 pine area and the maximum harvest area 50 pine area by adjusting the lodgepole pine forest area forest canopy leaf area and soil storage capacity parameters to reflect the impacts of tree removal and soil compaction from harvesting activities two scenarios for the final stage of mountain pine beetle infestation were set up for both scenarios the entire lodgepole pine forest was impacted by beetle kill with one allowing salvage logging and harvesting related impacts on soils as well as canopy and the other retaining the standing dead lodgepole pine trees and leaving soil storage parameters undisturbed the hydrological impacts of forest disturbance focussed on three main changes to hydrological processes in crhm that set up conditions in which to test the three hypotheses these process changes resulted from model parameters changed to reflect the different forest disturbance scenarios i reduced interception losses of rainfall and snowfall ii faster snowmelt and lower evapotranspiration iii reduced soil moisture storage capacity due to reduced infiltration wetter soils and or soil compaction the results fig 14 show strong streamflow sensitivity to extreme wildfire and modest sensitivity to the impacts of mountain pine beetle followed by salvage logging and a weak sensitivity to forest harvesting the mean annual flow volume over 15 water years for the high wildfire severity scenario increased from 324 mm to 513 mm a 59 increase for the lodgepole pine mountain beetle infestation with salvage logging scenario it increased to 362 mm an 11 increase and for the maximum forest harvest scenario it increased to 340 mm a 5 increase impacts of other forest disturbance scenarios were minor and within 1 5 the simulations were also instructive in examining sensitivity to the recent flood of record the june 2013 flood pomeroy et al 2016b where the reference simulation estimated an event flow volume of 70 140 dam3 high wildfire severity produced the greatest increase in total flow volume to 109 123 dam3 a 56 increase the total flow volume increased to 85 152 dam3 21 increase 90 763 dam3 29 increase for harvest at half maximum and harvest maximum scenarios respectively for mountain pine beetle scenarios the increase in the total flow volume during flood was higher with salvage 101 736 dam3 or 45 increase compared to without salvage logging 80 012 dam3 or 14 increase these results show a strong sensitivity of flood peak volumes to land use in this basin something of concern for the downstream communities 5 3 climate change impacts on mountain snowpacks climate change is expected to alter canadian rockies hydrology substantially because of the importance of snowmelt to streamflow generation pomeroy et al 2012 fang et al 2013a b and the impact of warming on temperature sensitive snow processes woo pomeroy 2012 zhang et al 2000 the canadian rockies region has experienced substantial climate warming and low elevation snowpack decline and is anticipated to undergo further warming due to anthropogenic climate change clarke et al 2015 harder et al 2015 pradhananga pomeroy 2022 to better understand the sensitivity of snow processes to warming pomeroy et al 2015 built a spatially detailed physically based snow hydrology model for marmot creek research basin mcrb alberta canada fig 1 using the crhm platform and used the model to assess the snow hydrology of a high elevation alpine tundra environment 2325 m a s l and two medium elevation environments 1845 m a s l one densely forested spruce fir and the other a small forest clearing 100 m diameter processes modelled included calculation of precipitation phase snow redistribution by wind snow interception and canopy unloading sublimation from blowing intercepted and surface snow and energy budget snowmelt the model was forced with current meteorology from station observations high quality hourly measurements over nine years 2005 2014 and then with perturbed climates with increased temperature holding relative humidity constant allowing vapour pressure to increase based on the delta method increasing temperatures increased the rainfall fraction of precipitation which reduced snow water equivalent swe but also limited blowing snow erodibility warming also enhanced unloading of snow from conifers which reduced sublimation losses and so increased peak swe increasing temperatures accelerated the initiation of snow ablation by increasing incoming longwave turbulent and advected heat fluxes and reducing albedo but advanced ablation into periods of lower insolation that sustained slower snowmelt whilst snowfall in the alpine was proportionately reduced more than the lower elevation sites peak swe was most reduced in the forest and then the clearing blowing snow ablation processes transport and sublimation common in the alpine were reduced more than intercepted snow ablation sublimation processes found in the forest fig 15 as shown in table 1 melt rate reductions with warming were greatest under forest canopies followed by clearings with much smaller reductions found for the high elevation alpine environment this is likely due to the advance of mid summer melting from june and july closer to the solstice period of peak insolation rather than further away as occurred at the lower elevation sites where snow melts in april and may the advance of the snow free date was longest in the forest followed by the alpine and then the clearing environments impacts did not proceed linearly with rising temperatures 2 c of warming led to a shift from snowfall to rainfall dominance a substantial decline in snowpacks and shortening of snow seasons at all elevations however 5 c of warming led to ephemeral low elevation forest snowpacks and an order of magnitude reduction in high elevations snowpacks with snow free dates advancing by from four to six weeks 5 4 global assessment of alpine climate change impacts on snow hydrology the high versatility of crhm for application under contrasting climatic and environmental conditions enables assessment of how snow and hydrological regimes will respond and interact under climate warming lópez moreno et al 2020 thus an idealized virtual alpine basin was synthesized in crhm and simulated for 44 mountainous areas around the world using available long term bias corrected global gridded climatic datasets weedon et al 2014 the results showed that snowpacks worldwide will be reduced by climate warming and a generalized decoupling of mountain river hydrology from snowpack regimes is foreseen in many alpine areas however the study also revealed much complexity behind this generalization because snow and hydrological regimes under the different climatic conditions will respond with differing sensitivity to the same levels of warming fig 16 the variability of the sensitivity of rainfall ratio and peak snow water equivalent swe to warming were closely related to the joint effect of air temperature and humidity however the sensitivity of snowcover duration to warming was more difficult to characterise because of the more complex processes affecting the response of snow accumulation redistribution and melt to changing temperatures e g radiative fluxes wind redistribution and sublimation the sensitivity of snowmelt rate and peak swe to warming were closely related but melt rate sensitivity was substantially lower decreasing mostly between 5 and 10 per c than peak swe sensitivity which decreased mostly between 10 and 30 per c this is because of the proximity of the melt period to the summer solstice warming only slows melt rates when it shifts the melt period into a lower insolation period and this is not the case for some high alpine snow which after solstice and when shifted can melt closer to solstice in a further study lópez moreno et al 2021 used the same modelling approach to conclude that 75 of the same alpine basins will undergo a decrease in the frequency of rain on snow ros events here the differing sensitivities were mostly explained by the current dominant phase of precipitation the duration of snow cover and the average temperature however peak streamflows due to ros are projected to be more intense as a consequence of higher energy inputs and more common isothermal snowpack energy state this type of virtual basin analysis proved to be a good complement to studies performed in mountain research basins with in situ measured meteorological forcing as the virtual basin approach facilitated isolating the effects of differing climatic conditions on the response of snow and hydrology to climate warming 6 conclusions the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm was devised as a tool to better understand the significance of process hydrology investigations in research basins for generation of snowpacks glaciers soil moisture evapotranspiration wetlands and streamflow and has also shown capabilities to assess the impacts of climate and land use change on hydrology the crhm platform allows for multiple representations of forcing data interpolation and extrapolation hydrological model spatial and physical process structure and parameter values with reproducible workflows for each unique model creation it is well suited for model falsification algorithm benchmarking model mimicry and intercomparison and has been deployed for basin hydrology diagnosis prediction land use change analysis water quality climate impact analysis and flood forecasting the development of additional hydrological processes in crhm has been through the incorporation and inclusion of process modules developed by scientists after intensive study of cold regions and other hydrological processes in research basins crhm s capabilities permit the development of hydrological insights through model diagnosis of the role of hydrological processes in controlling snowpack glacier soil moisture evapotranspiration soil thaw groundwater runoff water quality and streamflow regimes examples presented here demonstrate how the regional hydrological diagnosis approaches can be applied for hydrological science investigations and to compare environments over global extents to diagnose cryospheric and hydrological dynamics and their response to disturbance such as climate change and land cover change modelling experiments in crhm to examine hydrological processes model structure and parameterisation have helped to better understand why temperate zone hydrological models have often failed to represent cold regions basin hydrology adequately and the importance of snow glacier and frozen ground processes for representation of the hydrology of cold regions and seasons the model has recently been re engineered to permit platform independence and accelerated calculation and will soon have the ability to use model agnostic automated basin delineation and parameter identification and further development of capabilities for northern peatland evaporation beaver pond water storage sediment erosion and dissolved organic carbon export infiltration to frozen soils on slopes and rock glacier hydrology it is hoped that crhm s story can inspire developments in other hydrological modelling programmes to include structural flexibility snow and ice processes process realism multiphysics approaches uncalibrated parameterisation and strong interactions with field hydrology studies as these have proven scientifically and practically beneficial in the development and

2699,cold regions involve hydrological processes that are not often addressed appropriately in hydrological models the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm was initially developed in 1998 to assemble and explore the hydrological understanding developed from a series of research basins spanning canada and international cold regions hydrological processes and basin response in cold regions are simulated in a flexible modular object oriented multiphysics platform the crhm platform allows for multiple representations of forcing data interpolation and extrapolation hydrological model spatial and physical process structures and parameter values it is well suited for model falsification algorithm intercomparison and benchmarking and has been deployed for basin hydrology diagnosis prediction land use change and water quality analysis climate impact analysis and flood forecasting around the world this paper describes crhm s capabilities and the insights derived by applying the model in concert with process hydrology research and using the combined information and understanding from research basins to predict hydrological variables diagnose hydrological change and determine the appropriateness of model structure and parameterisations keywords snow frozen ground evapotranspiration water quality glaciers hydrological modelling data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction cold regions where snow and ice play an inordinately important role in streamflow generation involve hydrological processes that are not often addressed appropriately in hydrological models wheater et al 2022 many cold regions are also sub humid and so have the added complication of seasonal aridity armstrong et al 2010 since most cold regions have been glaciated in recent geological time geomorphological processes have not always had sufficient time to develop well defined drainage networks and stream channels and so depressional storage capacities are large and the runoff contributing areas for streamflow generation are variable shook et al 2015 in mountains snowpacks can cover the basin for more than 2 3 of the year and in some areas year round as permanent snowfields and glaciers that dominate the coldest and snowiest parts of high mountain basins pomeroy et al 2012a fang pomeroy 2020 pradhananga pomeroy 2022 cold regions including snowy sub humid and sparsely or ungauged basins pose special challenges to hydrological prediction due to the need to address snow and ice processes such as snow redistribution and ablation and infiltration to frozen soils strong seasonality in process operations bidirectional phase changes from water to vapour ice to liquid and ice to vapour variable contributing area episodic flow processes and restricted opportunity to calibrate model parameters from streamflow observations due to intermittent streamflow small contributing areas to streamflow and lack of gauging stations pomeroy et al 1998a pomeroy et al 2007 shook et al 2021 solutions to these challenges have required half a century of intensive cold regions and sub humid zone process hydrology investigations in western canada and development of alternatives to model calibration from local streamflow to develop functional modelling systems pomeroy et al 2004 pomeroy et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2013 these process studies began in research basins established during the unesco international hydrological decade of 1965 75 in the semi arid continental climate of the canadian prairies an agricultural region with a landscape dominated by annual cereal and oil seed production interspersed with perennial pastures having very mild topography and incomplete drainage basin development leading to vast areas with no streams gray granger 1988 here blowing snow transport and sublimation dominate the winter redistribution of snow soils freeze to depths of greater than 1 5 m with limited infiltration capacities snowmelt occurs over a few weeks or less controlled by solar irradiance and snowmelt contributing to over 85 of annual streamflow gray et al 1986 after snowmelt evapotranspiration normally exceeds spring and summer precipitation soils thaw and infiltration capacities are large and so runoff events are restricted to intense rainstorms usually due to convective precipitation or infrequent large multi day storms that saturate the soils dyck et al 1974 granger gray 1989 streamflow is only generated after surface depressional storage is filled and fill and spill runoff generation can be initiated when water levels in depressions exceed sill levels as originally proposed by chris spence spence et al 2022 pomeroy et al 2010 these studies led to several realisations that showed the inadequacy of hydrological modelling at the time the need to model basins without identifiable streams the need to include a full range of snow and frozen ground processes the need to parameterize a model without calibration of parameters to observed streamflow the need to calculate net radiation as a fundamental driver of coupled heat and mass transfer calculations and the need to treat landscape units as a natural fundamental spatial basis for discretization of basins for water balance calculations research in other basins in northern canada and the canadian rockies revealed the importance of permafrost glaciers forests and shrubs to the hydrology of these regions bash marshall 2014 connon et al 2014 ménard et al 2014 quinton baltzer 2013 nicholls carey 2021 pomeroy et al 2012a pradhananga pomeroy 2022 the inability of models developed in temperate parts of the world to successfully simulate the hydrology of cold regions led to the development of the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 to simulate how cryospheric and hydrological processes govern basin hydrology by linking the energy and mass balance equations together via phase change in a flexible modular predictive framework the model distributes the forcing meteorology to appropriate hydrologically meaningful landscape units that serve as control volumes for hydrological process calculations and which can be aggregated to calculate streamflow at multiple scales modules can be coupled in a wide variety of ways to represent alternative spatial structures or forcing meteorology or processes and process algorithms this permits the rapid development of many models from the platform crhm was designed to test multiple hypotheses about model structure process description and inclusion and algorithm integrity and to output any hydrological variable in a practical and easy to use system it has been used in model falsifications to diagnose suitable model scale structure and process capabilities dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2013a b lv et al 2019 the intention of crhm s development has been to couple model development and application to process hydrology investigations in research basins to examine process importance and algorithm appropriateness for describing cold regions hydrology and to use the model as a tool in combination with field investigations to diagnose hydrological functioning of basins and their sensitivity to land use and climate change the model has been further developed since 2007 for forest permafrost wetland mountain and glaciated basins and to predict water quality and hydrology it has been applied on every continent except antarctica and redesigned to calculate hydrological fluxes over larger river basins cordeiro et al 2017 costa et al 2021 fang et al 2010 2013 he et al 2021 krinner et al 2018 krogh et al 2015 krogh pomeroy 2018 lópez moreno et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2016 lópez moreno et al 2017 pomeroy et al 2013 pradhananga pomeroy 2022 rasouli et al 2014 2019 2022 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2022 stone et al 2019 van hoy et al 2020 weber et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 these versions have been used to study snowmelt and glacier contributions to streamflow summer evapotranspiration and soil moisture regimes drought excess nutrient runoff forest hydrology climate change impacts agricultural land management strategies frozen ground impacts on hydrology and climate and vegetation change impacts on permafrost crhm has been operationalized in flood forecasting systems pomeroy et al 2013 and used to inform the development of continental scale models such as mesh class and chm marsh et al 2020 wheater et al 2022 however the uniqueness of the platform is its use as a tool for the hydrologist to deploy knowledge gained in field investigations to explore and diagnose hydrological functioning from hydrological processes up to streamflow generation in basins in a systematic way the advantage of the typically uncalibrated approach with crhm is in learning from model failure through model falsification or from learning from changing model performance as discretization modules and parameters are changed this has been detailed in papers such as armstrong et al 2009 dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2013a b pomeroy et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2016a this experience has helped inform research directions and algorithm improvements for instance the failure of et soil moisture coupling algorithms in severe drought and extreme wet conditions in the canadian prairies was particularly instructive armstrong et al 2010 mahmood et al 2017 the purpose of this paper is to describe crhm s capabilities and the insights derived from using the model along with process hydrology research to diagnose hydrological change and the appropriateness of model structure and parameterisation it focusses on developments diagnoses and applications since the publication of an extensive description of crhm by pomeroy et al 2007 15 years ago and provides an example of the fusion of hydrological process research field observations and modelling that has provided new understanding and capabilities for modelling hydrology and water quality in cold regions and elsewhere 2 model structure in crhm the user constructs a purpose built model from a selection of possible basin spatial configurations spatial resolutions and physical process modules of varying degrees of physical complexity basin discretization is performed via hydrological response units hrus whose number and nature are selected by the user based on the variability of basin attributes and the desired level of physical complexity an example of basin discretization into hru from ecozones elevation topography and hydrography is shown for marmot creek research basin in the canadian rockies as fig 1 hrus can interact with each other in several ways blowing snow runoff and groundwater can flow amongst hrus in different directions depending on surface aerodynamics and prevailing wind directions for blowing snow aquifer characteristics and potential energy gradients for groundwater and gravity and surface characteristics for runoff blowing snow can enter and leave a basin whilst groundwater and runoff are aggregated and routed as streamflow which can only leave a basin at the outlet hru assemblages for a basin can be grouped and declared a representative basin which can then be repeated and adjusted to allow for rapid parameterisation of larger basins composed of many sub basins fig 1 a full and up to date description of the crhm software and its installation can be found on the chrm wiki page which can be found here https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc crhm cold region hydrological model and on the crhm website https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling crhm php with supporting r code described here https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling r packages php crhm was originally developed as an object oriented modular modelling platform in 1998 using the borland c compiler and included a dynamic linked library version dll that was distributed to module developers in the uk and canada many modules were developed based on research in the university of saskatchewan s division of hydrology environment canada s national hydrology research institute and the university of wales aberystwyth each crhm release version was numbered and dated as were all modules and all modules were reviewed before inclusion with the demise of borland and the inability of users to purchase its c compiler the development of crhm had to be centralized and carefully controlled this was done with a small group of scientists working with the crhm code developer tom brown in informal and formal discussions often in sessions in saskatoon beverage rooms modules were conceptualized debated reviewed and added and model users could request new modules on request and review by this small group detailed help files were written and updated the refactored version of crhm that has just been released permits anyone to compile it with the gnu compiler connection gcc c and module developments are welcome and will be reviewed by the authors of this paper as part of a more formal version control process modules are executed within hrus and there is complete flexibility in defining and selecting hrus a model can be lumped with one hru per sub basin fully distributed with many hrus on a fine grid or more typically semi distributed where hrus are landscape units that are assumed to have some common biogeophysical characteristics and hydrological drainage characteristics and therefore a single set of parameters intrinsic length scales of hrus are that they should be large enough to avoid self similarity in soil moisture and snow water equivalent swe so at least 100 m shook and gray 1997 and less than about 3 km to ensure similar inputs from precipitation and snow redistribution and to calculate runoff dornes et al 2008 time steps for calculations in the hru are set by observations and are assumed to be close to hourly modules may be grouped together to repeat the model structure in many sub basins fig 2 shows a general workflow for model development in crhm based on several steps 1 basin delineation and discretization top panel and 2 parameterization 3 simulation and 4 post processing bottom panel for a non group project the basin delineation and discretization use geospatial datasets i e dem landcover soil and bedrock to determine hrus and soil or glacier firn layers group projects using basin discretization require delineation of sub basin groups the parameters defining the routing length gradients and sequences of hrus and sub basins are set based on datasets of stream networks basin delineation is often informed by gis programs but can now be automated using tools such as the functions in r package cshshydrology https cran r project org package cshshydrology parameter values are rarely calibrated for crhm models instead parameter values are usually estimated based on the deduction induction and abduction dia approach which is suited for either gauged or ungauged basins pomeroy et al 2013 once parameter values are determined they can be written to crhm model project prj files using functions in crhmr historically most crhm modelling has used data from meteorological stations as the source of forcing data these data generally require considerable quality control interpolation and extrapolation to make them suitable for forcing models pre processing for crhm models can be done using crhmr which includes functions for data quality analyses and for infilling missing bad values through interpolation and or imputation the package functions can write data in the observation file obs formats used by crhm crhm was originally a windows program requiring a graphic user interface gui that permits intuitive assembly of modules for model creation hru delineation parameter setting order of operation modification and diagnostic model graphics and outputs and links to the help file however the recent refactoring of the program has allowed it to also be compiled as a command line program which enables it to be run on high performance computers it has also resulted in the program running much faster the crhmr package contains functions to execute crhm of either version and uses the wine compatibility layer https www winehq org to run windows compatible executables on linux or macos computers crhm can output the values of almost any of hundreds of variable which can result in very large output files as many of the variables are used for internal purposes their units may be difficult to work with although the output files are all simple text files there can be many output formats depending on user needs crhmr contains functions to read any output file and to post process the values including converting units and plotting time series of variables there are also functions for performing water balances using r and crhmr the entire sequence of modelling in crhm can be automated once the model structure including the program modules and the number of hrus has been decided on and the initial prj file has been created the ability to parameterize and run models automatically aids the model reproducibility as all steps in the model development are recorded in the r code reproducibility has been shown to be crucial for the elevation of hydrological modelling to a more repeatable scientific endeavour knoben et al 2021 3 processes 3 1 overview hydrological process modules in crhm have been developed from the outcomes of intensive field and detailed modelling studies of cold regions and other hydrological processes these modules can be specific to basin setup such as delineating and discretizing the basin conditioning observations for extrapolation and interpolation in the basin or to hydrological calculation needs such as calculation of longwave radiation under forest canopies wind flow over complex terrain or snow albedo decay but most commonly deal with hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration infiltration snowmelt and streamflow discharge fig 3 model processes over a mountain basin crhm has a selection of process descriptions available at different levels of granularity as separate modules or as variants options within a module for each process and also the ability to rapidly create macros as new modules on the fly to explore new hypotheses or algorithms crhm is unique in its range of cold regions hydrology and water quality capabilities with strong physically based calculations of precipitation phase snow redistribution by wind snow interception sublimation sub canopy radiation snowmelt glacier icemelt icemelt under debris snow avalanching infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils hillslope water movement frozen ground dynamics actual evapotranspiration lake evaporation wetland fill and spill soil water movement subsurface preferential flow from tile drainage groundwater flow water chemistry and streamflow it calculates runoff from rainfall and snowmelt as generated by infiltration excess and saturated overland flow meltwater routing through glacier flow over partially frozen soils detention flow shallow subsurface flow preferential flow and groundwater flow water quality inputs to water bodies can also be simulated the user selects the hydrological processes that they wish to simulate from over 97 modules and dozens of variants of these modules https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc crhm module library some modules address a single process with different algorithms assumptions and data and parameter requirements whilst other modules are more comprehensive dealing with for example all processes in snowpacks glaciers or soils there is also the capability to write a new module quickly using the macro feature where the user writes a tentative module from within the platform the macro feature allows users to create simple modules suitable for testing algorithms and for diagnosing crhm model output and is fully described here https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc crhm macros macros can also be used to create groups for reproducing aspects of the model spatially module sequences repeated in different sub basins https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc groups and structures for intercomparing the performance of different groups of modules in an otherwise common model https wiki usask ca display crhmdoc structures which is useful in diagnosing different model structures macro modules that have proven successful or useful have been then converted into permanent modules in the platform whilst there is considerable freedom in these selections and end points for instance a crhm model can be configured only as a snow model or an evapotranspiration model or a soil moisture balance model or as a full streamflow synthesis hydrology model there are some modules that are required for almost all models these modules deal with setting up the basin inputting and adjusting observations to hrus and calculation of radiation fluxes an example of a crhm model flow chart is shown in fig 4 for a partly glacierized mountain basin some of the principal modules are described in the following section most modules have parameters that need to be specified and the physical basis of most modules means that most parameters are physically identifiable crhm was designed so that the user inputs parameters based on their knowledge of the basin gis and remote sensing analysis soil surveys digital elevation models parameters that worked for similar process studies elsewhere or by borrowing parameters from other basins in similar hydroclimatic and ecological regions fig 2 the deductive inductive and abductive dia approach to parameterisation was described by pomeroy et al 2013 and is a recommended method that has shown to be successful in applying crhm in and outside of research basins including ungauged basins where parameter uncertainty is high many crhm models provide reasonable simulations of snowpacks soil moisture and streamflow using parameters set by the dia approach without calibration of parameters from streamflow appendix table 1 however some particularly routing and subsurface parameters are difficult to observe and so limited parameter calibration has been employed to improve streamflow synthesis 3 2 precipitation meteorology radiation canopy adjustments a critical aspect in successfully representing hydrological processes in any model is the treatment of the forcing meteorology assumptions around the extrapolation and interpolation of forcing data can therefore have important implications for model performance a comparison of commonly used precipitation phase partitioning approaches in crhm demonstrated large changes in timing and magnitude of snow and streamflow generation processes over a variety of cold regions research basins harder pomeroy 2014 an obstacle to adoption of physically based process models has been the more complex forcing meteorological data requirements relative to the simpler requirement of conceptual or calibrated model approaches beven 1993 hrachowitz clark 2017 the crhm framework demonstrates that input data demands need not be onerous as a variety of physically guided approaches are employed to ingest synthesize and distribute meteorological data to drive hydrological process representations and represent the climate perturbations necessary to answer research questions first order data requirements from station gridded observation reanalysis or climate model sources include hourly observations of air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation and incoming shortwave radiation when radiation data are not available crhm uses methods described by annandale et al 2001 and sicart et al 2006 to simulate incoming shortwave and longwave radiation from air temperature and humidity data with relatively small errors forcing meteorology is distributed to hrus by elevation slope aspect and location using user defined lapse rates to interpolate air temperature humidity and precipitation observations whilst respecting vapour pressure saturation limits air temperature and precipitation perturbation impacts on hydrological processes can be considered through simple delta change and multiplier functions gleick 1986 hay et al 2000 hydrological process representations require a second order of information to account for the interactions of the meteorological data and the spatial variability of the basin and its land surface precipitation partitioning into rain or snow phases is critical in cold regions and the psychometric energy balance approach of harder and pomeroy 2013 is used to address the well documented dependence of phase upon temperature and humidity harpold et al 2017 jennings et al 2018 in the absence of reliable humidity information alternate approaches from air temperature harder pomeroy 2014 and ice bulb temperature marks et al 2013 thresholds are available wind induced gauge undercatch of snowfall is a persistent challenge in cold regions and is accounted for with nipher goodison et al 1998 and alter shielded corrections smith 2009 the tight coupling of the water and energy balances when considering physical process representation requires detailed accounting of radiation variability and forest interactions basic corrections such as radiation correction for slope and aspect garnier ohmura 1970 are applied at the hru scale shortwave and longwave radiation transmissions are then simulated separately for effects of forest cover accounting for differences amongst continuous forest canopies forest gaps and larger clearings as functions of measurable forest parameters sicart et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2009 ellis et al 2010 wind flow over complex terrain is calculated using the parametric method of walmsley et al 1989 which adjusts wind speed for topographic location based on the results of a boundary layer model 3 3 snow redistribution and sublimation by wind gravity and forest canopies snow redistribution by wind in open environments and by avalanches in steep mountain terrain are important processes for calculating the accumulation of the seasonal snowpack vionnet et al 2021 crhm calculates blowing snow transport and sublimation pomeroy 1989 pomeroy et al 1993 pomeroy and gray 1990 pomeroy and li 2000 pomeroy and male 1992 pomeroy and gray 1995 to estimate hru snowpack erosion and deposition as a mass balance of horizontal snow transport via saltation and suspension and in transit sublimation using precipitation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity as well as information on the snowpack horizontal blowing snow redistribution by wind from one hru to another is determined by considering exposed surface roughness as a function of snow depth and surface characteristics such as vegetation density and height snow can blow into a basin or sub basin from outside of the basin even if they are over a watershed divide three factors are needed for a blowing snow event to occur wind speed greater than the threshold condition li pomeroy 1997 friction from wind at the surface greater than that causing drag on exposed vegetation and bare ground pomeroy gray 1994 and a supply of erodible snow or concurrent snowfall snow is eroded from wind exposed hrus and deposited as drifts in topographically sheltered or well vegetated hrus the blowing snow model in crhm pomeroy et al 2007 was extended to application of the model over mountains and complex terrain by macdonald et al 2009 using a parameterisation to transport snow from source to sink hrus based on their exposed vegetation height and topographic position influencing relative wind speeds and shear stresses this is shown in fig 5 in addition to blowing snow snow is redistributed by gravity in avalanches from higher to lower elevations on steep slopes described by an avalanche module based on the algorithm developed by bernhardt and schulz 2010 snow slides in an avalanche if the minimum snow holding depth and a minimum slope angle are exceeded they suggested values of holding depth of 50 mm w e water equivalent and 25 minimum surface slope for slopes steeper than the minimum slope angle the snow holding depth decreases exponentially this module moves snow downslope from steep hrus to less steep hrus importantly it interacts with the blowing snow calculations the blowing snow module will deposit snow in cornices at high elevation steep slope hrus and the avalanche module will then redistribute this snow down the valley side producing realistic high mountain snow distributions crhm integrates a canopy module to represent the effects of forest canopy on snow rainfall sublimation and evapotranspiration processes in a physically based manner fig 6 forest precipitation interactions capture the interception of rainfall and snowfall in canopies to quantify evaporation and sublimation losses as a function of forest characteristics and snow unloading and drip as a function of ice bulb temperature hedstrom pomeroy 1998 ellis et al 2010 pomeroy et al 1998b in this module snow interception is estimated by the antecedent canopy snow load unloading rate coefficient and maximum interception capacity of the canopy which is determined by the tree species snowfall density and effective leaf area index lai ellis et al 2010 canopy sublimation is estimated by multiplying the intercepted snow load by a physically based sublimation coefficient calculated from turbulent transfer of sensible heat to and water vapour away from an ideal ice sphere and then corrected for the degree of exposure of intercepted snow in the canopy as described by fractal geometry area volume relationships pomeroy et al 1998b under the canopy snowmelt is governed by sub canopy radiation and turbulent transfer relationships and snowmelt and sub canopy rainfall including drip connect to soil infiltration and evapotranspiration modules and eventually to runoff routing modules figs 3 4 6 3 4 energy for snowmelt icemelt and sublimation the energy available for snow firn and ice melt and sublimation from the snow or ice surface is the sum of fluxes due to shortwave and longwave radiation turbulent transfer of sensible heat advection of energy from precipitation internal energy state change in the snowpack and conduction of heat from the ground pomeroy et al 1998a shortwave and longwave radiation are the principal sources of melt energy and the radiation module in crhm simulates incoming shortwave global radiation adjusted to slope and aspect and so includes self shading but not shadowing from surrounding topography in the absence of observations shortwave transmittance can be estimated using diurnal temperature ranges latitude and time of year shook pomeroy 2011a and longwave irradiance can be estimated from shortwave transmittance and air temperature using the algorithm proposed by sicart et al 2006 that modified brutsaert s clear sky longwave algorithm for cloudy conditions sky view factor and terrain or vegetation emission of longwave are also included in the sicart s model and can be significant in mountains plüss ohmura 1997 and forests pomeroy et al 2009 all snowmelt models use an albedo routine that can be selected from amongst seven options including forcing with observed albedo the area albedo change routine of gray and landine 1987 is often used for its consideration of the effects of initiation of snow covered area depletion on areal albedo during melt of shallow prairie snowcovers an alternative module of snow albedo change developed by verseghy 1991 and adopted by essery and etchevers 2004 is based on the age depth density and temperature of the snow layer and is favoured for continuous and deep snowcovers there are three other snow and ice albedo routine options for specialised applications including using observed albedos as model forcing inputs available melt energy can be converted to a melt rate considering the latent heat of fusion and available latent heat by turbulent transfer can be converted to sublimation considering the latent heat of sublimation crhm has several options for melt calculations one is the energy budget snowmelt model ebsm gray landine 1988 a daily timestep processes based parametric semi empirical single layer snowpack snowmelt model based on snowmelt physics described by male and gray 1981 this model is robust has no parameters to set and is well suited for shallow cold canadian prairie snowpacks or for temperate snowpacks where internal energy changes are small it has been customized to ice and firn melt by adjusting its albedo routine and assuming glacier ice and firn are isothermal so all internal energy change goes to icemelt or firnmelt pradhananga pomeroy 2022 the more physically based two layer energy and mass balance snowmelt model snobal marks et al 1998 is used more commonly in crhm to calculate snow melt processes debeer pomeroy 2017 it can simulate the energy and mass balances of deep cold and isothermal snowpacks over glacier and non glacier surfaces the turbulent heat fluxes are obtained using an approach adopted from brutsaert 1982 by marks and dozier 1992 over glaciers the turbulent fluxes can be calculated to account for the katabatic wind commonly found in glacier environment following a parametrization developed by oerlemans and grisogono 2002 and further tested by munro 2004 debris covered glaciers are prominent features of the world s glacierized mountain regions with the presence of supraglacial debris modifying both the glacier ablation patterns and its response to climatic forcing scherler et al 2018 the effects of debris on glacier surface melt are well understood a thin layer of debris less than several centimetres or patchy debris on the glacier surface enhances melt while a thick layer of debris insulates the underlying ice and reduces melt nicholson benn 2006 östrem 1959 a routine by carenzo et al 2016 has been included to calculate debris covered glacier icemelt crhm can also calculate temperature index and radiation index melt which allow it to simulate less physically based modeling approaches for the purposes of intra platform comparisons or model falsifications e g krogh and pomeroy 2021 3 5 glacier mass balance crhm simulates the mass balance of the snow firn ice water equivalents for glaciers along with the glacier surface elevation and glacier water and ice flow routing pradhananga pomeroy 2022 the change in glacier surface elevation is calculated as a function of snow redistribution and accumulation snow conversion to firn firn conversion to ice and ablation of snow firn and ice firn is snow that has survived at least for one summer melt season anderson benson 1963 and its densification and conversion to ice is calculated in three temporal stages adopted from semi empirical steady state approaches and deployed in an 11 layer snow firn ice system many models do not consider firn separately from glacier ice e g li et al 2015 naz et al 2014 wheater et al 2022 however firn has important properties for glacier energetics and hydrology the albedo of firn is lower than that of snow but it is higher than that of ice meltwater routing is slower in firn than in ice hannah gurnell 2001 3 6 evapotranspiration the evaporation module provides several options that allow users to diagnose actual evaporation the water vapour physically transferred to the atmosphere from soil plants and free water surfaces as a complex physical process diagnosing reasonable estimates of evaporation requires consideration for key interactions between the balance of available energy aerodynamic water vapour transfer and the surface water balance earlier module developments included the granger and gray 1989 method which can be applied to unsaturated agricultural surfaces and does not have parameters to set except surface aerodynamic roughness however for the purposes of hydrological modelling previous studies e g armstrong et al 2010 pomeroy et al 2014 needed to modify existing evaporation parameterisations for water limited e g drought via soil moisture coupling or energy limited conditions e g wet conditions via introduction of the penman monteith p m method monteith 1965 evapotranspiration can be modelled more realistically using the p m approach applied under a range of dry to wet conditions parameterisation of the p m method follows the algorithm described by armstrong et al 2008 2010 this approach uses a standard aerodynamic resistance and a modified jarvis type canopy resistance formula verseghy et al 1993 that applies four environmental stress factors describing stomatal controls under suboptimal conditions for plant growth for free water surfaces e g wetlands small lakes and streams a standard priestley taylor formulation priestley taylor 1972 can be applied to estimate actual evaporation assuming advection free conditions for large lakes a bulk transfer formulation the meyer formula is available krogh et al 2015 all evaporation methods withdraw moisture from free water surfaces first then intercepted canopy water figure 6 then ponded surface water and finally stored soil moisture restricted by water availability to conserve the water mass balance 3 7 hillslope soils and groundwater hillslope hydrology involves surface and subsurface water redistribution and interactive processes such as infiltration evapotranspiration overland subsurface and groundwater flows which play critical roles in streamflow generation kirkby 1988 hillslope hydrology derives the inputs from rainfall and snowmelt at the soil surface which either infiltrate to recharge the upper soil layer or run off as overland flow figure 6 the infiltration process in cold regions comprise frozen and unfrozen soils and is influenced by soil texture initial soil moisture saturation initial surface saturation and soil temperature freeze cherry 1979 kane stein 1983 zhao gray 1999 soil moisture is withdrawn by evapotranspiration into the atmosphere from the rooting depth which is controlled by plant types soil texture and biophysical properties of vegetation armstrong et al 2010 in the unsaturated zone water moves vertically from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer via pressure gradients and gravity and excess water from the lower soil layer percolates vertically to the saturated zone recharging groundwater lateral subsurface flow in the unsaturated zone and lateral groundwater flow in the saturated zone redistributes water based on hydraulic gradients along the hillslope both subsurface and groundwater flows are important flow pathways in streamflow generation and are complicated by local heterogeneities in hillslopes graham et al 2010 and hydrogeological characteristics underneath the hillslope hayashi 2020 surface overland flow generated by infiltration excess or saturation excess mechanisms is the other flow pathway in streamflow generation and can be delayed by detention layers such as loose organic material on forest floor keith et al 2010 or temporal snow damming fang et al 2013a b in areas with heavy soils and intense agricultural activity artificial subsurface drainage structures i e tile drainage also influence subsurface water redistribution processes and affect streamflow generation crhm calculates the overland subsurface and groundwater flows and simulates the groundwater surface water interactions using a soil module the soil module was revised from an original soil moisture balance routine developed by leavesley et al 1983 and has been modified by recent studies to account for cold regions processes dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2010 2013 pomeroy et al 2016a the soil module now estimates soil moisture and groundwater storage depressional storage subsurface flow in soil layers groundwater flow and surface overland flow with detention layer configuration the flow rates are calculated using darcy s law parameterized using the pedotransfer relationship developed by brooks and corey 1964 the soil module interacts with evapotranspiration infiltration and freeze thaw algorithm modules to estimate evaporation loss and infiltration and simulate freezing thawing dynamics on water movement in soil layers a detailed description of these modules for simulating hillslope hydrology is provided in fang et al 2013a b and pomeroy et al 2016a a new tile drainage module has been developed to calculate the tile outflow rate from tile drainage networks based on soil moisture it uses an extended version of hooghoudt s equation hooghoudt 1940 that accounts for the effect of soil capillary fringe on drainable soil water skaggs 1980 crhm has some limitations in simulating groundwater surface interactions and groundwater systems the assumption of surface tension in pore spaces being dominant over gravity is a limitation when simulating preferential flows in subsurface and groundwater layers where coarse textured and unconsolidated materials overlaying impeding layers or bedrock the simple bucket conceptualization of the groundwater component is another limitation in simulating groundwater fed streamflow in first order alpine basins that are controlled by complex groundwater storage discharge dynamics hayashi 2020 3 8 frozen soils and permafrost the presence of frozen soils plays a key hydrological role on cold regions hydrology driving the energy and mass fluxes exchange between the ground and the atmosphere in places with permafrost or seasonally frozen soils infiltration rates depend not only on soils characteristics and available water but also on the degree of ground thaw and soil s water ice content scherler et al 2010 crhm includes a set of physically based algorithms to represent processes related to ground freeze and thaw and infiltration into frozen soils infiltration into frozen soil is characterized by two flow regimes a transient and a quasi steady state regime zhao et al 1997 the transient regime occurs immediately after water starts infiltrating where the infiltration rate and heat transfer decrease rapidly as the soil temperature increases through conduction the quasi steady state is characterized by gradual changes in the infiltration rate with time and soil warming is driven by latent heat released by the refreezing of melted water supplied from upper layers zhao et al 1997 realistically representing infiltration into frozen soils and subsurface storage and flow is thus critical to simulate the hydrological regime of cold regions basins walvoord kurylyk 2016 infiltration into frozen soils is represented following gray et al 2001 where infiltration is first classified as unlimited restricted and limited infiltration under limited conditions depends on initial surface saturation average soil saturation and temperature and infiltration opportunity time and is calculated using a parametric representation of a finite element heat and mass transfer model zhao et al 1997 zhao gray 1997 1999 or a simpler model derived from observations in the canadian prairies fitted into a physically based framework and forced by the degree of soil saturation and peak snow accumulation before melt gray et al 1986 crhm has three different modules options based on xg 2013 hayashi et al 2007 and van wijk 1963 and more variants to calculate soil freezing fronts most algorithms that represent freezing and thawing fronts are based on the stefan equation juminikis 1977 that includes heat exchange through conduction and water phase change in homogeneous soils modified versions of the stefan equation have been implemented to represent multilayered soils fox 1992 hayashi et al 2007 woo et al 2004 xie and gough 2013 other solutions to the freezing and thawing front problem that also incorporate advected heat flux have been developed by lunardini 1998 as shown by kurylyk et al 2014 simpler algorithms based on a temperature index have also been included such as the n factor woo et al 2007 the most preferred options is the xg algorithm as it provides an intermediate degree of complexity fast computation and allows the calculation of freezing and thawing fronts over multilayered soils xie and gough 2013 the xg module in crhm uses a multi layer simplified solution of stefan s equation xie and gough 2013 to represent frost table dynamics freezing and thawing in partially frozen soils the xg algorithm assumes a linear temperature profile in the thawed soil layers to represent heat transfer in multi layered soils with heterogenous soil properties xg in crhm divides the soil into several numerical layers with variable depth to compute the progression of the thawing freezing front in which each layer has its own properties e g porosity and thermal conductivity ground surface temperature is used as the upper boundary condition which can be estimated using the radiative conductive convection rcc method of williams et al 2015 or a temperature index algorithm woo et al 2007 for the snow free period and can be estimated using a conduction approach luce tarboton 2010 by coupling to the energetics of the snobal snowpack module for the snow covered period as the thawing front advances through the summer subsurface water storage capacity increases proportionally to the maximum subsurface capacity where there is permafrost infiltration is restricted by the position of the frost table and the subsurface water storage capacity frost table and infiltration into frozen soils are tightly coupled with the snowpack evapotranspiration infiltration and soil moisture processes for example ground thaw does not start until the snowpack is completely depleted evapotranspiration cannot access water below the frost table and the thermal conductivity of the soil layers depend on the soil moisture content which in turn depends on lateral water redistribution in permafrost soils the non frozen soil layer between the ground surface and the uppermost permafrost layer defines the active layer which varies spatially e g north versus south facing slopes carey woo 2005 and temporally through the season as the air temperature raises after the winter ground thaw primarily depends on the energy available to warm the soil and the soil s heat conductivity capacity which in turn depends on factors such as water ice content porosity and texture ling zhang 2004 zhao et al 1997 the depth of the active layer controls the available soil depth capacity for water transport and storage mediating runoff generation for example quinton and gray 2001 showed that the hydraulic conductivity of organic soils can decrease several orders of magnitude with depth krogh et al 2017 and krogh pomeroy 2021 describe crhm s representation of permafrost dynamics and model validation in detail 3 9 depressional storage and variable contributing areas for runoff generation much of the prairies of western canada and the northern united states lie within the prairie pothole region where the hydrography is dominated by millions of surface depressions known as potholes or sloughs these depressions trap surface runoff which in canada is predominantly from the spring melt of the accumulated winter snowpack because much of the region is underlain by glacial till which generally has very low hydraulic conductivities the infiltration of the water is restricted van der kamp hayashi 1998 when depressions are filled additional runoff or direct precipitation will flow overland to neighbouring depressions the phenomenon being known as fill and spill runoff spence woo 2003 fill and spill influenced runoff occurs not only in the prairies but in the circumpolar boreal forest arctic tundra and other wetland and lake dominated regions with moderate topography and so is a globally important streamflow generation mechanism the trapping and release of fill and spill runoff depends on water storage in the depressions fig 7 therefore the fraction of a basin dominated by depressions that can contribute flow to the outlet also varies with surface water storage when depressions in a basin have available storage capacity they can retain surface runoff and the area contributing flow to these depressions does not contribute flow to the basin outlet conversely when depressions are filled then they cannot retain runoff and their contributing area can contribute flow to the basin outlet the relationship between the storages of water and the contributing fractions of prairie basins is nonlinear and hysteretic due to the very large numbers of state variables water storages in the depressions and their complex interactions shook et al 2013 shook et al 2021 most hydrological models are unable to simulate varying contributing fractions of basins although several hydraulic models have been developed to address the problem including the wetland dem ponding model shook et al 2013 and fluxos overland costa et al 2020 unfortunately these models are computationally expensive and cannot be easily incorporated within hydrological models the pothole cascade model pcm shook et al 2013 is an alternative it is a relatively simple model that simulates fill and spill from depressional storage based on the explicit representation of flow sequences to arrangements of individual depressions fig 8 the model has been shown to produce connected contributing fractions similar to those of the more complex models shook et al 2013 the pcm has been incorporated in crhm by using hrus to simulate networks of connecting depressions fig 8 although the number of depressions in a given basin is much greater than can be simulated by crhm the model is able to compensate by simulating a representative fraction of the depression network with each depression being represented by a hru with its own runoff contributing area the outflow from the modelled fraction is then scaled to represent the entire basin this approach has been applied successfully to several prairie basins pomeroy et al 2012b 2014 3 10 nutrient dynamics crhm has been extended to simulate water quality concentrations and fluxes of nitrogen n five species and phosphorus p five species based on the research of roste 2015 and costa et al 2017 and based on the water quality process simulations developed in the hype model lindström et al 2010 with similar parameterisation needs this extension is motivated by the recognition that nutrient pollution and eutrophication of major lakes are also major environmental challenges in many cold regions around the world smith et al 2006 2019 cold regions biogeochemistry processes have not been adequately represented by conventional rainfall runoff models costa et al 2020 n and p transport and transformation processes are challenging to simulate due to the effect of seasonal snow cover brooks et al 1996 jones 1987 mladenov et al 2012 soil freezing brooks et al 1996 cade menun et al 2013 clark et al 2009 jones 1999 pellerin et al 2012 peters driscoll 1987 sebestyen et al 2008 snider et al 2017 and lake wetland freeze up on soil plant systems soil biogeochemical cycling microbial activity and plant uptake cober et al 2018 costa et al 2019 elliott 2013 liu et al 2013 2019 white 1973 soil management and agricultural practices such as fertilizer use tillage practices miller et al 1994 timmons et al 1970 ulén 1997 and wetland drainage further hinder the application and effectiveness of existing nutrient models baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2020 irvine et al 2019 van esbroeck et al 2017 models that rely excessively on tuned and lumped parameters are prone to fail to capture the nuances of these processes making them less reliable for future climate projections and non stationary scenarios crhm integrates hydro biogeochemical drivers at agricultural field and sub basin scales for example agricultural activities can be explicitly represented in the model such as fertilizer manure application that can strongly impact the amount of soil nutrients mobilized with runoff other sources such as atmospheric deposition and plant residue as well as sinks like plant uptake can also be considered chemical transformations calculated include mineralization for n and p nitrification n denitrification n degradation n and p dissolution n and p and dynamic sorption desorption equilibrium p with sediments transformation rates are computed dynamically by modulating reference values determined at 20 c to changes in soil temperature and moisture the ability to capture spatio temporal hydro biogeochemical variations at high temporal resolution during snowmelt via energy budget calculations hourly and sub hourly makes the model exceptionally suited for capturing both streamflow and nutrient export during the short but critical snowmelt period baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2017 kokulan et al 2019 the modelling of nutrient transport phenomena is integrated within many core modules and extends to the runoff and routing calculations in crhm 3 11 streamflow synthesis streamflow synthesis requires simulations of hydrological processes and calculations of flux and state variables in the hydrology cycle to estimate surface runoff subsurface flow groundwater flow and channel precipitation that are the main sources of streamflow for a drainage basin predicting streamflow at the basin outlet involves the routing of surface runoff subsurface flow and groundwater flow as well as channel routing which considers the effects of storage and dynamics of a system such as land surface depression ponds soil layers groundwater or channel on the shape and movement of various flow hydrographs routing can be classified by different criteria 1 lumped flow or distributed flow routing based on spatial and temporal variations 2 hydrological or hydraulic routing based on governing equations and 3 river flow reservoir or overland flow routing based on watercourse type streamflow synthesis is one of the most important aspects in hydrology for flood forecasting reservoir operation and water resource management but it is highly challenging in cold regions because of the strong seasonal dynamics of frozen soil and snow storage for hru routing in a basin crhm can use clark s lag and route algorithm based on time area unit hydrograph theory clark 1945 for subsurface and groundwater flows and clark s algorithm or muskingum method based on a variable discharge storage relationship chow 1964 for surface runoff routing sequence can be from one hru to another hru for clark s algorithm or from one hru to multiple hrus for muskingum method with a modified hack s law to estimate routing lengths from hru areas fang et al 2010 and to allocate amount of routed flow between hrus based on their relative lengths manning s equation is used to estimate the mean flow velocity in the channel with parameters calculated from the channel condition and the gradient of the drainage network for large river basins crhm uses representative basin rb groups to simulate hydrological processes for sub basins and uses a muskingum routing group to connect and route the sub basin streamflow to the outlet of the river basin details of parameterization and setup for crhm streamflow routing are provided in recent studies fang et al 2010 2013 pomeroy et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2014 routing methods in crhm do not incorporate ice jam and backwater into river flow routing and mainly estimate the natural flow without reservoir operations which are some limitations of crhm in streamflow simulation for large and low relief river basins in cold regions however routing on glaciers is considered in that melt from ice and firn melt is routed through linear reservoirs before being released to the soil routine 4 research basin hydrological process diagnosis crhm has a unique capability to integrate with field investigations in research basins to demonstrate the impacts of improved process descriptions on hydrological prediction and to constrain calculations of hydrological processes from the results of process studies in the basin as it is a modelling platform for scientists it can be changed and developed sequentially to reflect hydrological discoveries and advances in research basins its emphasis on permitting model failure rather than parameter calibration makes the importance of advances in understanding very clear in model outputs model performance metrics against multiple prediction objectives ranging from snow and glaciers to evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater to streamflow discharge and water chemistry are shown in the appendix table 1 the following examples show crhm s application in agricultural forest permafrost and high mountain basins in cold and temperate regions to diagnose specific aspects of how agricultural drainage tillage and fertilizer application permafrost and glaciation impact snowpacks soil moisture groundwater streamflow and hydrochemistry 4 1 impacts of tile drainage on agricultural runoff artificial tile drainage is an essential agricultural management practice in many regions around the world including in cold climates however recent studies suggest that these systems may exacerbate the effect of climate change in increasing nutrient export haghnazari et al 2020 tile drainage systems drain about 14 of farmlands in canada icid 2018 kokulan et al 2019 in southern ontario canada tile drainage is present in 45 of the fields especially in the southwestern part where fine grained and clay soils pose challenges for water management plach et al 2018 van esbroeck et al 2016 many agricultural lands in southern ontario with tile drainage systems have shallow soil layers separated from the deeper groundwater system by an impermeable or semi impermeable layer broughton jutras 2013 these layers with low hydraulic conductivity prevent the free drainage of water from shallow to deeper soil and groundwater systems snowmelt partially frozen soils and freeze thaw events due to large temperature variations in the cold season further contribute to the ponding of water in surface depressions and the need for tile drainage lam et al 2016 macrae et al 2007 macrae et al 2019 during large temperature oscillations heavy rainfall and surface ponding are common and the thick capillary fringe that develops in the fine grained clay and clay loam soils compromises its natural drainage capacity the tile drainage module developed for crhm enables simulation of these cold agricultural regions and evaluation of management options kompanizare et al 2022 tile flow is calculated based on a modified version of the hooghoudt 1940 equation that accounts for capillary fringe development which causes the saturation of soil above the water table and reduces soil drainable water skaggs 1980 fig 9 shows the results obtained for an application to a farm field in southern ontario the model was able to capture the flashy response of the tiles and their effect on the seasonal groundwater table results showed that tile flow was able to rapidly reduce soil moisture and lateral overland flow to adjacent fields the groundwater table oscillated drastically between seasons influencing the tile flow response in the growing season low precipitation and higher evapotranspiration rates often caused minimal tile flows this analysis informs evaluations of tile drainage impacts on lake erie hydrology and water quality 4 2 nutrient export from agricultural basins the crhm water quality modules derived from hype have been used to investigate the dynamics of nitrogen n and phosphorus p in a small basin that contributes to the flow of the red river into lake winnipeg manitoba canada lake winnipeg is the 10th largest in the world and similarly to other lakes in north america such as lake erie has been increasingly threatened by enhanced aquatic productivity and the occurrence of algal schindler et al 2012 due to excessive nutrient load the small basin examined in this study is the steppler basin sb which is located in the headwaters of the south tobacco creek basin stcb sb is a 205 ha agricultural basin comprising 42 farm fields that are used to grow cereal grains and oilseeds on a rotating basis as well as a beef cattle herd beneficial management practices bmps were initiated in 2005 and include a holding pond riparian zone grassed waterway grazing restrictions forage conversion and nutrient management the model was set up to explicitly simulate the 42 individual farm fields in sb meteorological observations were used to force the model hydrology whilst fertilizer manure and plant residue loading information as well as tillage practices were used to force and parameterise the hype water quality modules in crhm model predictions were evaluated against observations at 5 locations in the basin between 2005 and 2011 this included 1 snow water equivalent swe and 2 streamflow for hydrological model validation and 3 two nitrogen species nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 and 4 two phosphorus species soluble reactive phosphorus srp and particulate phosphorous pp for biogeochemical model validation costa et al 2017 liu et al 2014 and mahmood et al 2017 provide details on model setup in this basin fig 10 compares observations and simulations for both hydrological and water quality variables the flashy spring freshet accounted for 21 of the annual streamflow and 30 31 20 and 16 of the annual no3 nh4 srp and pp export load on average the results highlighted the importance of parameterising a water quality model with the amount type placement and timing of fertilizer and manure application as these have strong controls on nutrient export e g duncan et al 2017 grant et al 2019 plach et al 2018 tillage practices i e broadcast incorporated with seeding affect the depth at which nutrient inputs were placed in the soil and also influence nutrient availability to runoff transport the model parameterised with these practices simulated the extremely flashy and episodic discharges of these nutrients during snowmelt freshet this shows the importance of snow and frozen ground hydrological processes along with nutrient dynamics and land use practices in simulating water quality dynamics in cold climate agricultural basins by demonstrating that the crhm with suitable water quality process simulations can predict chemical transport that results from agricultural land management a concrete transformative direction for innovation in basin nutrient modelling in canada and other cold regions is outlined appropriate cold regions hydrological models are needed to provide advanced background hydrology to support comprehensive water quality dynamics simulations 4 3 diagnosing glacier contributions to mountain streamflow the bow river at banff basin brb 2192 km2 originates in the eastern slopes of the canadian rockies and forms a principal headwater of the south saskatchewan river in alberta canada the basin has experienced glacier retreat since the early 20th century and glaciers covered approximately 1 7 of the brb in 2005 bolch et al 2010 glacier coverage is projected to be minimal by the end of the 21st century clarke et al 2015 to investigate recent glacier contributions to streamflow in the brb in order to determine what the losses of streamflow might be in a deglaciated future a crhm model was constructed to simulate relevant snow ice and rainfall runoff streamflow generation processes for high mountains such as blowing snow avalanching snow snow interception and sublimation energy budget snow and glacier melt infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils hillslope water redistribution lake water storage and evaporation evapotranspiration groundwater flow surface and sub surface runoff and open channel flow the hydrological model was entirely parameterised from local research results and observable quantities instead of relying on calibration a high resolution weather model a regional run at 4 km resolution of the weather research and forecasting wrf model li et al 2019 bounded by era interim outputs provided forcing near surface meteorological variables during 2000 2015 a detailed description of the hydrological model setup is provided in fang and pomeroy n d two model simulations were conducted for the brb with glacier 2005 coverage bolch et al 2010 and without glacier minimal coverage expected for the end of the 21st c clarke et al 2015 the model simulation with glacier was evaluated against observed streamflow water survey of canada gauge 05bb001 and the proportional change in the streamflow as result of glacier melt sum of firn and ice melt between the two simulations was used to estimate the glacier contribution to streamflow for the 15 year mean 2000 2015 cold 2002 and warm 2006 years the uncalibrated model provided good predictions of daily streamflow for the brb fig 11 with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 values of 0 75 0 84 and 0 77 and model bias mb fang et al 2013a b values of 0 13 0 19 and 0 11 for the 15 year 2002 and 2006 respectively the 15 year mean annual glacier contribution to streamflow in the brb was 3 7 fig 11a while glacier melt accounted for 1 7 and 5 8 of annual streamflow in the cold 2002 fig 11b and warm 2006 fig 11c years respectively the mean annual glacier contribution to streamflow for bow river at banff during 2000 2015 was lower than the 4 9 mean annual glacier contribution during 2000 2009 estimated by bash and marshall 2014 but higher than the mean annual contribution values of 1 98 estimated for 1952 1993 by hopkinson and young 1998 the 2 2 for 1975 1998 estimated by comeau et al 2009 or the 2 8 for 1976 1998 estimated by demuth et al 2008 these differences likely result from interannual variabilities of streamflow and glacier wastage during these different periods as well as differing estimation methodologies and available forcing data 4 4 arctic droughts and floods arctic hydrology has many challenges for hydrological diagnosis and prediction this remote region is sparsely gauged with few long term research basin laudon et al 2017 which restricts the opportunity to use observations to diagnose hydrological change and to inform the development of hydrological models the arctic supports a wide range of complex biophysical processes bring et al 2016 including the presence of permafrost and or seasonally frozen ground controlling subsurface and surface mass and energy fluxes through thermodynamics these characteristics make northern regions a particularly challenging environment for hydrological models yet hydrological and permafrost thaw predictions are needed to design infrastructure to manage water and to evaluate ecosystem services bring et al 2016 hjort et al 2018 lique et al 2016 schuur et al 2015 a small permafrost underlain arctic basin near inuvik northwest territories canada 16 4 km2 havikpak creek was simulated using crhm krogh et al 2017 to evaluate the contribution of differing hydrological processes to the water balance and streamflow generation using the crhm platform this model configuration incorporates key arctic hydrological processes including snowpack energy balance blowing snow redistribution and sublimation canopy interception ground freeze and thaw infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils evapotranspiration surface and subsurface flow and storage and streamflow routing the permafrost representation see frozen soils and permafrost section is a novel treatment of the ground freeze and thaw algorithm and its interaction with other physical processes three water years dry normal and wet were selected to highlight the interactions between key physical processes at the basin scale fig 12 the example shows the impact of a deeper longer lasting snowpack on the development of the permafrost active layer thickness alt in a dry year with a relatively low 8 cm peak swe the snowpack fully ablated by the end of may allowing an earlier initiation of ground thaw red area fig 12 that resulted in an 80 cm deep alt by the end of the summer in contrast in a wetter year with a much deeper snowpack 180 mm peak swe that fully ablated by june 23 about three weeks later ground thaw initiation was substantially delayed resulting in a shallower end of the summer alt at 64 cm the latter was also influenced by an earlier accumulation of next season snow due to the colder and wetter conditions it is important that such hydrological interactions are properly captured by hydrological models applied to permafrost regions as they impact runoff generation processes and crhm has been shown to adequately represent with little to no calibration most arctic hydrological processes krogh et al 2017 krogh pomeroy 2021 5 diagnosis of land use and climate changes crhm has easy to manipulate parameters that describe land use boundary conditions and also allow systematic changes to forcing meteorology to examine hydrological sensitivity to climate change this provides a useful capability to assess the sensitivity of hydrological processes and basin hydrology to change a few examples of this capability are provided here in diagnoses of the impacts of wetland drainage forest disturbance and climate change on hydrological processes and streamflow generation from local to global scales 5 1 prairie wetland drainage impact on streamflow volume canadian prairie wetlands exist in surface depressions that receive blowing snow transport in the winter causing deep snow accumulations that melt and fill the depressions in spring the impact of depressional storage change on the hydrology of small canadian prairie basins has been unclear because of conflicting conclusions on the degree of impact between studies of runoff in very small scale drainage systems and those of multi year streamflow characteristics of larger basins and because of the compounding effects of climate change dumanski et al 2015 to better understand and predict the impact of wetland drainage on prairie streams due to breaching of depressions resulting in lower elevation outlets crhm was used to create a model that simulates blowing snow redistribution snowmelt infiltration to frozen soils and the fill and spill of networks of depressions at multiple scales pomeroy et al 2014 this crhm model was used to simulate the hydrology of smith creek research basin saskatchewan 400 km2 with various drainage scenarios smith creek research basin has undergone substantial wetland drainage from 1958 when it contained 96 km2 of depressions 24 of the basin area to 43 km2 11 of the basin in 2008 dumanski et al 2015 crhm simulations showed that wetland drainage can increase annual and peak daily flows substantially and that notable increases to estimates of the annual volume and peak daily flow of the flood of record 2011 have derived from drainage to date and will proceed with further wetland drainage restoration of depressional storage from the current extent back to that of 1958 decreased the simulated 2011 flood peak by 32 and the 2011 yearly volume of streamflow by 29 whilst the greatest proportional impacts on the peak daily flows are for dry years substantial impacts on the peak daily discharge of record 2011 from drainage 78 or restoration 32 are notable and important in smith creek and downstream the relative response of total basin flow volume over six hydrological years of simulation 2007 2013 shows a non linear flow response to wetland area change in fig 13 this is a useful metric when assessing the effects of wetland change in smith creek on water supply for large lakes downstream in manitoba that have experienced repeated flooding drainage induced decreases in wetland area by 43 km2 increased the annual flow volume by 55 whilst restoration induced increases in wetland area by 53 km2 decreased the annual flow volume by 26 smith creek is already heavily drained but its flow volumes can still be strongly impacted by further drainage 5 2 mountain forest cover change impact on streamflow the impacts of forest disturbances on streamflow entering calgary alberta canada were investigated using a crhm model of the montane forested elbow river basin 1192 km2 above calgary the model was parameterized from local research results and represent the relevant streamflow generation processes wind redistribution of snow gravitational snow transport on steep mountain slopes glacier accumulation and melt intercepted snow from forest canopies infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils hillslope sub surface water redistribution and evapotranspiration from forests grassland clearings and alpine tundra bias corrected near surface outputs from the weather research and forecasting wrf model bounded by era interim reanalysis during october 2000 september 2015 forced the model air temperature vapour pressure wind speed incoming shortwave radiation and precipitation outputs from the 4 km wrf li et al 2019 were bias corrected using the same outputs from 10 km global environmental multiscale and canadian precipitation analysis gem capa produced by environment and climate change canada generating an initial 10 km bias corrected forcing field additional precipitation bias correction was performed by a double mass curve analysis of streamflow from the model runs using the initial 10 km bias corrected wrf and water survey of canada wsc streamflow observations from the elbow river above calgary the hypotheses to be tested were that disturbance of montane forests by wildfire pine beetle kill and harvesting will increase streamflow volumes and peak flows by reducing evapotranspiration and sublimation from the forest canopy and reducing infiltration to soils through compaction harvesting hydrophobicity wildfire or increased saturation from reduced root withdrawals for evapotranspiration all simulations of forest disturbances were conducted to examine the hydrological sensitivity to disturbance for three types of scenarios wildfire affecting all forests mountain pine beetle dendroctonus ponderosae hopkins infestation of lodgepole pine pinus contorta var latifolia forests salvage harvesting of beetle killed lodgepole pine forests and harvesting of all pine forests forest canopy parameters and soil parameters for infiltration were adjusted for three wildfire severity scenarios ranging from a 20 reduction in forest canopy leaf area for low wildfire severity to an 80 reduction in forest canopy leaf area with development of hydrophobic soils of lower infiltration capacity for the high wildfire severity scenario two lodgepole pine forest harvesting scenarios were created half of the maximum harvest area 25 pine area and the maximum harvest area 50 pine area by adjusting the lodgepole pine forest area forest canopy leaf area and soil storage capacity parameters to reflect the impacts of tree removal and soil compaction from harvesting activities two scenarios for the final stage of mountain pine beetle infestation were set up for both scenarios the entire lodgepole pine forest was impacted by beetle kill with one allowing salvage logging and harvesting related impacts on soils as well as canopy and the other retaining the standing dead lodgepole pine trees and leaving soil storage parameters undisturbed the hydrological impacts of forest disturbance focussed on three main changes to hydrological processes in crhm that set up conditions in which to test the three hypotheses these process changes resulted from model parameters changed to reflect the different forest disturbance scenarios i reduced interception losses of rainfall and snowfall ii faster snowmelt and lower evapotranspiration iii reduced soil moisture storage capacity due to reduced infiltration wetter soils and or soil compaction the results fig 14 show strong streamflow sensitivity to extreme wildfire and modest sensitivity to the impacts of mountain pine beetle followed by salvage logging and a weak sensitivity to forest harvesting the mean annual flow volume over 15 water years for the high wildfire severity scenario increased from 324 mm to 513 mm a 59 increase for the lodgepole pine mountain beetle infestation with salvage logging scenario it increased to 362 mm an 11 increase and for the maximum forest harvest scenario it increased to 340 mm a 5 increase impacts of other forest disturbance scenarios were minor and within 1 5 the simulations were also instructive in examining sensitivity to the recent flood of record the june 2013 flood pomeroy et al 2016b where the reference simulation estimated an event flow volume of 70 140 dam3 high wildfire severity produced the greatest increase in total flow volume to 109 123 dam3 a 56 increase the total flow volume increased to 85 152 dam3 21 increase 90 763 dam3 29 increase for harvest at half maximum and harvest maximum scenarios respectively for mountain pine beetle scenarios the increase in the total flow volume during flood was higher with salvage 101 736 dam3 or 45 increase compared to without salvage logging 80 012 dam3 or 14 increase these results show a strong sensitivity of flood peak volumes to land use in this basin something of concern for the downstream communities 5 3 climate change impacts on mountain snowpacks climate change is expected to alter canadian rockies hydrology substantially because of the importance of snowmelt to streamflow generation pomeroy et al 2012 fang et al 2013a b and the impact of warming on temperature sensitive snow processes woo pomeroy 2012 zhang et al 2000 the canadian rockies region has experienced substantial climate warming and low elevation snowpack decline and is anticipated to undergo further warming due to anthropogenic climate change clarke et al 2015 harder et al 2015 pradhananga pomeroy 2022 to better understand the sensitivity of snow processes to warming pomeroy et al 2015 built a spatially detailed physically based snow hydrology model for marmot creek research basin mcrb alberta canada fig 1 using the crhm platform and used the model to assess the snow hydrology of a high elevation alpine tundra environment 2325 m a s l and two medium elevation environments 1845 m a s l one densely forested spruce fir and the other a small forest clearing 100 m diameter processes modelled included calculation of precipitation phase snow redistribution by wind snow interception and canopy unloading sublimation from blowing intercepted and surface snow and energy budget snowmelt the model was forced with current meteorology from station observations high quality hourly measurements over nine years 2005 2014 and then with perturbed climates with increased temperature holding relative humidity constant allowing vapour pressure to increase based on the delta method increasing temperatures increased the rainfall fraction of precipitation which reduced snow water equivalent swe but also limited blowing snow erodibility warming also enhanced unloading of snow from conifers which reduced sublimation losses and so increased peak swe increasing temperatures accelerated the initiation of snow ablation by increasing incoming longwave turbulent and advected heat fluxes and reducing albedo but advanced ablation into periods of lower insolation that sustained slower snowmelt whilst snowfall in the alpine was proportionately reduced more than the lower elevation sites peak swe was most reduced in the forest and then the clearing blowing snow ablation processes transport and sublimation common in the alpine were reduced more than intercepted snow ablation sublimation processes found in the forest fig 15 as shown in table 1 melt rate reductions with warming were greatest under forest canopies followed by clearings with much smaller reductions found for the high elevation alpine environment this is likely due to the advance of mid summer melting from june and july closer to the solstice period of peak insolation rather than further away as occurred at the lower elevation sites where snow melts in april and may the advance of the snow free date was longest in the forest followed by the alpine and then the clearing environments impacts did not proceed linearly with rising temperatures 2 c of warming led to a shift from snowfall to rainfall dominance a substantial decline in snowpacks and shortening of snow seasons at all elevations however 5 c of warming led to ephemeral low elevation forest snowpacks and an order of magnitude reduction in high elevations snowpacks with snow free dates advancing by from four to six weeks 5 4 global assessment of alpine climate change impacts on snow hydrology the high versatility of crhm for application under contrasting climatic and environmental conditions enables assessment of how snow and hydrological regimes will respond and interact under climate warming lópez moreno et al 2020 thus an idealized virtual alpine basin was synthesized in crhm and simulated for 44 mountainous areas around the world using available long term bias corrected global gridded climatic datasets weedon et al 2014 the results showed that snowpacks worldwide will be reduced by climate warming and a generalized decoupling of mountain river hydrology from snowpack regimes is foreseen in many alpine areas however the study also revealed much complexity behind this generalization because snow and hydrological regimes under the different climatic conditions will respond with differing sensitivity to the same levels of warming fig 16 the variability of the sensitivity of rainfall ratio and peak snow water equivalent swe to warming were closely related to the joint effect of air temperature and humidity however the sensitivity of snowcover duration to warming was more difficult to characterise because of the more complex processes affecting the response of snow accumulation redistribution and melt to changing temperatures e g radiative fluxes wind redistribution and sublimation the sensitivity of snowmelt rate and peak swe to warming were closely related but melt rate sensitivity was substantially lower decreasing mostly between 5 and 10 per c than peak swe sensitivity which decreased mostly between 10 and 30 per c this is because of the proximity of the melt period to the summer solstice warming only slows melt rates when it shifts the melt period into a lower insolation period and this is not the case for some high alpine snow which after solstice and when shifted can melt closer to solstice in a further study lópez moreno et al 2021 used the same modelling approach to conclude that 75 of the same alpine basins will undergo a decrease in the frequency of rain on snow ros events here the differing sensitivities were mostly explained by the current dominant phase of precipitation the duration of snow cover and the average temperature however peak streamflows due to ros are projected to be more intense as a consequence of higher energy inputs and more common isothermal snowpack energy state this type of virtual basin analysis proved to be a good complement to studies performed in mountain research basins with in situ measured meteorological forcing as the virtual basin approach facilitated isolating the effects of differing climatic conditions on the response of snow and hydrology to climate warming 6 conclusions the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm was devised as a tool to better understand the significance of process hydrology investigations in research basins for generation of snowpacks glaciers soil moisture evapotranspiration wetlands and streamflow and has also shown capabilities to assess the impacts of climate and land use change on hydrology the crhm platform allows for multiple representations of forcing data interpolation and extrapolation hydrological model spatial and physical process structure and parameter values with reproducible workflows for each unique model creation it is well suited for model falsification algorithm benchmarking model mimicry and intercomparison and has been deployed for basin hydrology diagnosis prediction land use change analysis water quality climate impact analysis and flood forecasting the development of additional hydrological processes in crhm has been through the incorporation and inclusion of process modules developed by scientists after intensive study of cold regions and other hydrological processes in research basins crhm s capabilities permit the development of hydrological insights through model diagnosis of the role of hydrological processes in controlling snowpack glacier soil moisture evapotranspiration soil thaw groundwater runoff water quality and streamflow regimes examples presented here demonstrate how the regional hydrological diagnosis approaches can be applied for hydrological science investigations and to compare environments over global extents to diagnose cryospheric and hydrological dynamics and their response to disturbance such as climate change and land cover change modelling experiments in crhm to examine hydrological processes model structure and parameterisation have helped to better understand why temperate zone hydrological models have often failed to represent cold regions basin hydrology adequately and the importance of snow glacier and frozen ground processes for representation of the hydrology of cold regions and seasons the model has recently been re engineered to permit platform independence and accelerated calculation and will soon have the ability to use model agnostic automated basin delineation and parameter identification and further development of capabilities for northern peatland evaporation beaver pond water storage sediment erosion and dissolved organic carbon export infiltration to frozen soils on slopes and rock glacier hydrology it is hoped that crhm s story can inspire developments in other hydrological modelling programmes to include structural flexibility snow and ice processes process realism multiphysics approaches uncalibrated parameterisation and strong interactions with field hydrology studies as these have proven scientifically and practically beneficial in the development and
