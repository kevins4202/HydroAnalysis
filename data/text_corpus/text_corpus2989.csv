14945,cyanobacterial bloom represent a growing threat to global water security with fast proliferation they raise great concern due to potential health and socioeconomic concerns algaecides are commonly employed as a mitigative measure to suppress and manage cyanobacteria however recent research on algaecides has a limited phycological focus concentrated predominately on cyanobacteria and chlorophytes without considering phycological diversity generalizations crafted from these algaecide comparisons present a biased perpective to limit the collateral impacts of algaecide interventions on phytoplankton communities it is critical to understand differential phycological sensitivities for establishing optimal dosage and tolerance thresholds this research attempts to fill this knowledge gap and provide effective guidelines to frame cyanobacterial management we investigate the effect of two common algaecides copper sulfate cuso4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on four major phycological divisions chlorophytes cyanobacteria diatoms and mixotrophs all phycological divisions exhibited greater sensitivity to copper sulfate except chlorophytes mixotrophs and cyanobacteria displayed the highest sensitivity to both algaecides with the highest to lowest sensitivity being observed as follows mixotrophs cyanobacteria diatoms and chlorophytes our results suggest that h2o2 represents a comparable alternative to cuso4 for cyanobacterial control however some eukaryotic divisions such as mixotrophs and diatoms mirrored cyanobacteria sensitivity challenging the assumption that h2o2 is a selective cyanocide our findings suggest that optimizing algaecide treatments to suppress cyanobacteria while minimizing potential adverse effects on other phycological members is unattainable an apparent trade off between effective cyanobacterial management and conserving non targeted phycological divisions is expected and should be a prime consideration of lake management graphical abstract

inevitable in many circumstances erratt et al 2022 lürling and mucci 2020 there is a growing demand for effective mitigation measures to control the proliferation of cyanobacteria while being environmentally benign hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and copper sulfate cuso4 are two algaecides routinely administered to suppress and mitigate cyanobacterial blooms barrington et al 2013 bauzá et al 2014 crafton et al 2021 matthijs et al 2012 sandrini et al 2020 wan et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the most widely administered algaecide in freshwater ecosystems is copper commonly dispensed as copper sulfate heatley et al 2002 jančula and maršálek 2011 moore and kellerman 1905 copper restricts photosynthesis jančula and maršálek 2011 inhibits co2 fixation pandey et al 1992 and hinders nitrogen uptake resulting in cell death garc et al 2004 the short term effectiveness of copper sulfate can lead to its overuse which raises concern as prolonged exposure can result in negative environmental impacts leal et al 2018 short term consequences include oxygen depletion resulting from senescing algal biomass which may result in fish kills and accelerates phosphorous cycling promoting future algal production another significant short term side effect is the mass release of cyanotoxins falconer 2001 long term consequences include copper accumulation in lake sediments creating a greater potential to impact non target organisms such as benthic macroinvertebrates and macrophytes zamyadi et al 2020 hydrogen peroxide is widely acknowledged as an environmentally friendly algaecide with the release of hydroxyl radicals resulting in photosynthetic impairment drábková et al 2007a papadimitriou et al 2022 inhibition of photosynthesis restricts physiological processes weakening cells and lowering survival rates piel et al 2020 samuilov et al 2004 hydrogen peroxides non toxic characteristics the capacity to break down into environmentally benign by products have contributed to hydrogen peroxides mounting popularity and gradual transition away from copper sulfate matthijs et al 2012 while laboratory bioassays indicate cyanobacteria having heightened sensitivity to both hydrogen peroxide and copper sulfate apply minimal impact on other phycological divisions barrington et al 2013 calomeni et al 2014 lusty and gobler 2020 matthijs et al 2012 these generalizations are problematic as assumptions are often based on a single organism or select taxonomic groupings e g chlorophytes vs cyanobacteria barrington et al 2013 lusty and gobler 2020 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 a literature survey of half maximal effective concentrations ec50 of freshwater phytoplankton revealed a disproportionate focus on chlorophytes and cyanobacteria with 92 of h2o2 fig 1 a and 88 of cuso4 fig 1b articles focused on these two phycological divisions overlooking important phycological divisions such as diatoms or mixotrophs can create an incomplete understanding of the effect of algaecides on phytoplankton communities algaecide sensitivity of cyanobacteria relative to other eukaryotic algae aside from chlorophytes is not well substantiated this knowledge could have crucial ecological relevance as it could aid in developing management guidelines that limit potential negative consequences on more beneficial phytoplankton this study examined the effect of hydrogen peroxide and copper sulfate two commercially applied algaecides on twelve freshwater algae across four phycological divisions chlorophytes green algae cyanobacteria blue green algae diatoms and mixotrophs the inter and intra specific differences over different algaecide concentrations 0 20 mg l 1 and time points 0 48 hrs were investigated the objective of the current study was to explore the comparative effect of hydrogen peroxide and copper sulfate on major phycological divisions and use the obtained knowledge to frame cyanobacteria management 2 materials and methods 2 1 culturing procedures algal strains table 1 were obtained from the canadian phycological culture centre cpcc and the university of texas culture collection of algae utex twelve strains across four phycological divisions were selected chlorophytes chlamydomonas reinhardtii chlorella kessleri scenedesmus quadricauda cyanobacteria dolichospermum flosaquae microcystis aeruginosa synechococcus sp diatoms asterionella formosa cyclotella meneghiniana navicula pelliculosa and mixotrophs cryptomonas sp dinobryon sp prymnesium parvum the stock cultures were maintained in a batch culture design in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks supplied with a chemically defined medium table 1 media were prepared based on the recipes provided by anderson et al 2005 the cultures were incubated at 20 1 c and a light intensity of 50 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 under a 14 10 h light dark cycle 2 2 experimental procedures cultures were grown in batch culture design in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks and the algal cells were transferred into 55 ml pyrex tubes during the mid exponential growth phase an analytical grade of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 w w fisher chemical and copper sulfate cuso4 5h2o sigma aldrich were used to prepare the stock solutions prior to each bioassay stock solution was added to each tube containing 30 ml of algal culture to achieve the desired h2o2 and cuso4 5h2o concentrations 0 0 5 2 5 5 10 20 mg l 1 each concentration was carried out in triplicate and the algal bioassay conditions for light and temperature followed culturing procedures section 2 1 except for media all strains were grown under conditions similar to environmental conditions 2 3 photosynthetic vitality a phyto pam ii a five excitation wavelength chlorophyll fluorometer walz germany was used to determine photosynthetic efficiency an aliquot of 200 µl of each sample treatment was diluted and the total volume was brought to 4 ml with milli q water the diluted sample was transferred into the cuvette holder and the photochemical quantum yield of ps ii was estimated using the following equation 1 y i e l d f m f f m where f m and f are maximum and minimum fluorescence values respectively the photosynthetic vitality for h2o2 and cuso4 5h2o treated samples was defined as the photosynthetic yield and presented as a percentage 2 4 cellular permeability cellular permeability was measured using sytox green high affinity nucleic acid stain sytox green is a fluorochrome that penetrates cells with a compromised plasma membrane and binds to nucleic acids mehdizadeh allaf and trick 2019 thus offers insight into cell viability i e dead vs living cells sytox green s7020 invitrogen usa was dissolved in pure analytical grade dimethyl sulfoxide dmso to reach a 5 mm concentration the solution was diluted with milli q water to attain a 50 µm working solution and stored at 20 c until use during the experimental procedure the background fluorescence was assessed by adding lugol s iodine solution at a final concentration of 0 5 v v to each sample then sytox green was added to a final concentration of 0 75 μm to the unstained samples and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature prior to analysis 30 μl of each sample was analyzed using a turner designs phytocyt flow cytometer bd bioscience usa at 488 nm excitation and 523 nm emission of sytox green for both stains after subtracting the background fluorescence cell permeability was determined as the average cell bound to sytox green after 3 hours finally the data were normalized between 0 and 100 2 5 cellular mortality cellular mortality was determined using a turner designs phytocyt flow cytometer as a reliable and rapid method for analyzing and separating specific cells chapman et al 2016 and sytox green dye was used as a

analysis of variance anova followed by a tukey test performed by originpro 2017 software the significance of each value and their interactions were calculated at a p level of 0 05 3 results and discussion copper sulfate has been routinely used for over a century to suppress and manage cyanobacterial blooms moore and kellerman 1905 while hydrogen peroxide is a more recent algaecide receiving growing advocacy in response to its selectivity towards cyanobacteria and lack of harmful residual chemicals drábková et al 2007a matthijs et al 2016 despite hydrogen peroxide often being suggested as a safer candidate for cyanobacteria remediation a comprehensive phycological assessment of these two algaecides on major phycological divisions is lacking most studies were founded on model organisms i e single species xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 or have a predominant focus on comparing cyanobacteria to chlorophytes barrington et al 2013 lusty and gobler 2020 cyanobacteria and chlorophytes frequently co dominate during warmer summer months i e peak cyanobacterial bloom period making comparisons a reasonable starting point reynolds 1989 sommer et al 1986 however cyanobacterial blooms are expanding beyond their traditional temporal windows i e summer and now occurring earlier and later creating potential overlap with diverse phycological members e g diatoms and mixotrophs haig et al 2022 leblanc et al 2008 winter et al 2011 therefore it is critical to understand the underlying differential sensitivities and adequately assess how these two algaecides would impact major phytoplankton divisions before formulating generalizations regarding their efficacy for cyanobacteria management this study aims to fill this knowledge gap 3 1 phycological responses cell mortality and photosynthetic vitality an expected inverse correlation was observed between cell mortality and photosynthetic vitality with increased cell mortality leading to a corresponding decrease in photosynthetic vitality cyanobacteria and mixotrophs displayed the highest sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and copper sulfate compared to other phycological divisions whereas chlorophytes exhibited the lowest sensitivity to both algaecide treatments fig 2 mixotrophs displayed higher cell mortality at lower algaecide concentrations with greater than 50 mortality observed with additions 0 5 mg l 1 fig 2a b this response mirrored a reduction in photosynthetic vitality with mixotrophs showing 50 loss in photosynthetic vitality at lower algaecide concentrations fig 2c d cyanobacteria appeared marginally more resistant to hydrogen peroxide compared to mixotrophs with higher concentrations required to achieve 50 mortality 10 mg l 1 fig 2a cyanobacteria mixotrophs and diatoms were more susceptible to copper sulfate showing a significant decline in both cell mortality and photosynthetic vitality at lower concentrations compared to hydrogen peroxide while the chlorophytes were more resistant to copper sulfate in line with previous studies our findings show cyanobacteria exhibit higher mortality and photosynthetic inhibition to the two common algaecides compared to chlorophytes barrington et al 2013 barrington and ghadouani 2008 lusty and gobler 2020 internal cellular structure coupled with differences in oxidative stress management between cyanobacteria and chlorophytes have been considered as factors influencing algaecide effectiveness drábková et al 2007a in fact cyanobacteria lack membrane bound organelles e g protective membranes while eukaryotic phytoplankton have membrane bound organelles which act as a protective barrier preventing physiological impairment e g photosynthesis drábková et al 2007a neilson and durnford 2010 mehdizadeh allaf and peerhossaini 2022 therefore harmful compounds entering cyanobacteria cells are in direct contact with life sustaining organelles increasing the likelihood of metabolic impairment drábková et al 2007a mehdizadeh allaf and peerhossaini 2022 the lack of ascorbate peroxidases a key enzyme for reactive oxygen species ros regulation in cyanobacteria has also been noted as one of the reasons for the sensitivity of cyanobacteria to hydrogen peroxide compared to eukaryotic cells bernroitner et al 2009 latifi et al 2009 passardi et al 2007 while the relationship between cyanobacteria and chlorophytes has been explored further investigation is required to determine the exact response mechanisms to various algaecides across different phytoplankton divisions as other eukaryotic groups remain poorly understood 3 2 cell permeability does cell structure influence cell sensitivity measurements of cell permeability represent a useful indicator of cell fitness as membrane integrity is crucial for protecting intracellular structures from the external environment and maintaining metabolic activity xu et al 2019 cyanobacteria and mixotrophs showed comparable cell permeability displaying the greatest percentage of membrane compromised cells after being exposed to hydrogen peroxide fig 3 b and copper sulfate fig 3c compared to other phycological divisions chlorophytes displayed the lowest decline in cell permeability to both algaecide treatments cell permeability displayed a dose dependent response with increasing algaecide concentrations resulting in greater loss of membrane integrity in all phycological divisions except chlorophytes significant differences were detected between cyanobacteria and other phycological divisions except for mixotrophs we proposed that the composition of the external layer of different phycological divisions could be a major determent modulating algaecide sensitivity fig 3a chlorophytes e g cell walls and diatoms e g frustules possess thicker external layers which not only enhance structural integrity but provide chemical resistance towards select chemicals domozych et al 2012 pančić et al 2019 the greater loss in membrane integrity observed among cyanobacteria could be the result of an external membrane comprised of peptidoglycan hoiczyk and hansel 2000 hydrogen peroxide has been widely used as a bactericide known for its capacity to disrupt peptidoglycan integrity leading to cell death clifford and repine 1982 mikula et al 2012 and copper sulfate has shown similar membrane disrupting effects on cyanobacteria fan et al 2013 it appears peptidoglycan shows less chemical resistance compared to some eukaryotic divisions mixotrophs are a functional grouping comprised of diverse taxonomic lineages e g cryptophytes dinoflagellates chrysophytes etc each showing considerable variation in external membrane composition brett et al 1994 kristiansen and škaloud 2017 while we observed a relatively homogenous response among tested mixotrophs with high loss in membrane integrity fig 3b c this response may reflect that the tested mixotrophs had heightened sensitivity i e cryptophytes with naked cell walls we acknowledge we are missing major lineages e g dinoflagellates and we suspect a greater degree of variation exists among this diverse functional group 3 3 comparing h2o2 and cuso4 sensitivities of phytoplankton ec50 acts as a useful parameter for establishing application thresholds for inhibiting phytoplankton growth wang et al 2018 and was calculated for all phycological divisions after 48 hours table 2 mixotrophs and cyanobacteria showed the lowest ec50 for both algaecides followed by diatoms and chlorophytes all phytoplankton categories were more susceptible to copper sulfate compared to hydrogen peroxide except for green algae p value 0 05 previous studies suggest lower dosages of hydrogen peroxide can be applied to eradicate cyanobacteria with negligible impacts on eukaryotic algae barrington et al 2013 lusty and gobler 2020 matthijs et al 2012 matthijs et al 2016 proposed that hydrogen peroxide should remain 5 mg l 1 to constrain cyanobacteria growth while limiting collateral effects on non target organisms our findings suggest that 7 15 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide fig 4 a would be required to constrain cyanobacteria however even at this dosage there will be detrimental effects on other phycological divisions e g mixotrophs and select diatoms impacting non target phytoplankton is unavoidable given the similar ec50 values between cyanobacteria and mixotrophs our results suggest the statement of hydrogen peroxide as a cyanocide is not tenable even at the lowest administered dose other phycological divisions are negatively impacted phycological responses to copper sulfate were similar with cyanobacteria control 1 14 mg l 1 resulting in collateral effects on eukaryotic algae fig 4b our findings underscore the importance of incorporating phycological diversity into cyanobacteria management to avoid inaccurate generalizations as the use of chlorophytes as a benchmark for eukaryotic algal responses is flawed weenink et al 2022 eukaryotic algae are a polyphyletic grouping encompassing diverse phycological classes falkowski et al 2004 this great diversity results in a wide range of phycological responses as showcased in this study 4 limitations an important consideration for algaecide application is understanding interactions with different biotic and abiotic factors lakes are inherently complex ecosystems and emerging research suggests that environmental conditions such as weather e g sunny vs cloudy conditions piel et al 2020 physicochemical water characteristics e g ph and phytoplankton composition weenink et al 2015 can influence algaecide efficacy for example solar irradiation can significantly impact the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide drábková et al 2007b piel et al 2020 with higher solar radiation accelerating cyanobacteria lysis by eight times compared to reduced solar radiation huo et al 2015 xu et al 2019 additionally high chlorophyte abundance can hamper the suppression of cyanobacteria due to their capacity to rapidly degrade hydrogen peroxide shielding cyanobacteria from damaging oxidative stress weenink et al 2021 another limitation associated with the research design is the limited coverage of each major phycological division although we have a greater representation of phycological diversity compared to current research three representatives of each phycological division represent a small subset and more phycological coverage is necessary to help strengthen generalizations extrapolating findings from bench scale assessments to an ecosystem scale is challenging bridging the gap between lab to lake experiments will require ecological validity using comparative algaecide studies on natural phytoplankton communities that integrate a range of ecological variability 5 recommendations and conclusions advancements in our understanding of cyanobacteria management are essential as cyanobacteria concerns are projected to worsen under future human and climate mediated change brooks et al 2016 elliott 2012 while nutrient reduction measures are crucial for effective cyanobacteria management mitigative approaches are becoming an increasingly integral component of management mitigative measures e g algaecides function as a band aid solution bridging the time required until nutrient reduction targets are achieved our results demonstrate that h2o2 and cuso4 represent comparable algaecide treatments regarding their phycological outcomes each effectively suppresses cyanobacteria but has adverse effects on non target phytoplankton e g mixotrophs and select diatoms comparable outcomes between both algaecides advocate for hydrogen peroxide as it represents an ecologically friendly alternative over copper sulfate however hydrogen peroxide as a selective cyanobacterial agent remains debatable as we demonstrated unintended consequences on other phycological divisions the objective of cyanobacteria management is to reduce cyanobacteria associated risks while avoiding collateral effects on non target organisms modifying algaecide concentrations to create inhospitable conditions for cyanobacteria while preserving eukaryotic phytoplankton may be challenging due to similar sensitivities reported among phycological divisions however scientists and lake managers must consider if the deleterious effects of toxigenic cyanobacteria outweigh the potential adverse impacts of

susceptible to copper sulfate showing a significant decline in both cell mortality and photosynthetic vitality at lower concentrations compared to hydrogen peroxide while the chlorophytes were more resistant to copper sulfate in line with previous studies our findings show cyanobacteria exhibit higher mortality and photosynthetic inhibition to the two common algaecides compared to chlorophytes barrington et al 2013 barrington and ghadouani 2008 lusty and gobler 2020 internal cellular structure coupled with differences in oxidative stress management between cyanobacteria and chlorophytes have been considered as factors influencing algaecide effectiveness drábková et al 2007a in fact cyanobacteria lack membrane bound organelles e g protective membranes while eukaryotic phytoplankton have membrane bound organelles which act as a protective barrier preventing physiological impairment e g photosynthesis drábková et al 2007a neilson and durnford 2010 mehdizadeh allaf and peerhossaini 2022 therefore harmful compounds entering cyanobacteria cells are in direct contact with life sustaining organelles increasing the likelihood of metabolic impairment drábková et al 2007a mehdizadeh allaf and peerhossaini 2022 the lack of ascorbate peroxidases a key enzyme for reactive oxygen species ros regulation in cyanobacteria has also been noted as one of the reasons for the sensitivity of cyanobacteria to hydrogen peroxide compared to eukaryotic cells bernroitner et al 2009 latifi et al 2009 passardi et al 2007 while the relationship between cyanobacteria and chlorophytes has been explored further investigation is required to determine the exact response mechanisms to various algaecides across different phytoplankton divisions as other eukaryotic groups remain poorly understood 3 2 cell permeability does cell structure influence cell sensitivity measurements of cell permeability represent a useful indicator of cell fitness as membrane integrity is crucial for protecting intracellular structures from the external environment and maintaining metabolic activity xu et al 2019 cyanobacteria and mixotrophs showed comparable cell permeability displaying the greatest percentage of membrane compromised cells after being exposed to hydrogen peroxide fig 3 b and copper sulfate fig 3c compared to other phycological divisions chlorophytes displayed the lowest decline in cell permeability to both algaecide treatments cell permeability displayed a dose dependent response with increasing algaecide concentrations resulting in greater loss of membrane integrity in all phycological divisions except chlorophytes significant differences were detected between cyanobacteria and other phycological divisions except for mixotrophs we proposed that the composition of the external layer of different phycological divisions could be a major determent modulating algaecide sensitivity fig 3a chlorophytes e g cell walls and diatoms e g frustules possess thicker external layers which not only enhance structural integrity but provide chemical resistance towards select chemicals domozych et al 2012 pančić et al 2019 the greater loss in membrane integrity observed among cyanobacteria could be the result of an external membrane comprised of peptidoglycan hoiczyk and hansel 2000 hydrogen peroxide has been widely used as a bactericide known for its capacity to disrupt peptidoglycan integrity leading to cell death clifford and repine 1982 mikula et al 2012 and copper sulfate has shown similar membrane disrupting effects on cyanobacteria fan et al 2013 it appears peptidoglycan shows less chemical resistance compared to some eukaryotic divisions mixotrophs are a functional grouping comprised of diverse taxonomic lineages e g cryptophytes dinoflagellates chrysophytes etc each showing considerable variation in external membrane composition brett et al 1994 kristiansen and škaloud 2017 while we observed a relatively homogenous response among tested mixotrophs with high loss in membrane integrity fig 3b c this response may reflect that the tested mixotrophs had heightened sensitivity i e cryptophytes with naked cell walls we acknowledge we are missing major lineages e g dinoflagellates and we suspect a greater degree of variation exists among this diverse functional group 3 3 comparing h2o2 and cuso4 sensitivities of phytoplankton ec50 acts as a useful parameter for establishing application thresholds for inhibiting phytoplankton growth wang et al 2018 and was calculated for all phycological divisions after 48 hours table 2 mixotrophs and cyanobacteria showed the lowest ec50 for both algaecides followed by diatoms and chlorophytes all phytoplankton categories were more susceptible to copper sulfate compared to hydrogen peroxide except for green algae p value 0 05 previous studies suggest lower dosages of hydrogen peroxide can be applied to eradicate cyanobacteria with negligible impacts on eukaryotic algae barrington et al 2013 lusty and gobler 2020 matthijs et al 2012 matthijs et al 2016 proposed that hydrogen peroxide should remain 5 mg l 1 to constrain cyanobacteria growth while limiting collateral effects on non target organisms our findings suggest that 7 15 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide fig 4 a would be required to constrain cyanobacteria however even at this dosage there will be detrimental effects on other phycological divisions e g mixotrophs and select diatoms impacting non target phytoplankton is unavoidable given the similar ec50 values between cyanobacteria and mixotrophs our results suggest the statement of hydrogen peroxide as a cyanocide is not tenable even at the lowest administered dose other phycological divisions are negatively impacted phycological responses to copper sulfate were similar with cyanobacteria control 1 14 mg l 1 resulting in collateral effects on eukaryotic algae fig 4b our findings underscore the importance of incorporating phycological diversity into cyanobacteria management to avoid inaccurate generalizations as the use of chlorophytes as a benchmark for eukaryotic algal responses is flawed weenink et al 2022 eukaryotic algae are a polyphyletic grouping encompassing diverse phycological classes falkowski et al 2004 this great diversity results in a wide range of phycological responses as showcased in this study 4 limitations an important consideration for algaecide application is understanding interactions with different biotic and abiotic factors lakes are inherently complex ecosystems and emerging research suggests that environmental conditions such as weather e g sunny vs cloudy conditions piel et al 2020 physicochemical water characteristics e g ph and phytoplankton composition weenink et al 2015 can influence algaecide efficacy for example solar irradiation can significantly impact the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide drábková et al 2007b piel et al 2020 with higher solar radiation accelerating cyanobacteria lysis by eight times compared to reduced solar radiation huo et al 2015 xu et al 2019 additionally high chlorophyte abundance can hamper the suppression of cyanobacteria due to their capacity to rapidly degrade hydrogen peroxide shielding cyanobacteria from damaging oxidative stress weenink et al 2021 another limitation associated with the research design is the limited coverage of each major phycological division although we have a greater representation of phycological diversity compared to current research three representatives of each phycological division represent a small subset and more phycological coverage is necessary to help strengthen generalizations extrapolating findings from bench scale assessments to an ecosystem scale is challenging bridging the gap between lab to lake experiments will require ecological validity using comparative algaecide studies on natural phytoplankton communities that integrate a range of ecological variability 5 recommendations and conclusions advancements in our understanding of cyanobacteria management are essential as cyanobacteria concerns are projected to worsen under future human and climate mediated change brooks et al 2016 elliott 2012 while nutrient reduction measures are crucial for effective cyanobacteria management mitigative approaches are becoming an increasingly integral component of management mitigative measures e g algaecides function as a band aid solution bridging the time required until nutrient reduction targets are achieved our results demonstrate that h2o2 and cuso4 represent comparable algaecide treatments regarding their phycological outcomes each effectively suppresses cyanobacteria but has adverse effects on non target phytoplankton e g mixotrophs and select diatoms comparable outcomes between both algaecides advocate for hydrogen peroxide as it represents an ecologically friendly alternative over copper sulfate however hydrogen peroxide as a selective cyanobacterial agent remains debatable as we demonstrated unintended consequences on other phycological divisions the objective of cyanobacteria management is to reduce cyanobacteria associated risks while avoiding collateral effects on non target organisms modifying algaecide concentrations to create inhospitable conditions for cyanobacteria while preserving eukaryotic phytoplankton may be challenging due to similar sensitivities reported among phycological divisions however scientists and lake managers must consider if the deleterious effects of toxigenic cyanobacteria outweigh the potential adverse impacts of

14946,chloride ion cl is one of the most common anions in wastewater and saline wastewater but its elusive effects on organics degradation are not clear yet in many cases in this paper the effect of cl on organic compounds degradation is intensively studied in catalytic ozonation of different water matrix it was found that the effect of cl is almost completely reflected by transforming oh to reactive chlorine species rcs which is simultaneously competitive with organics degradation the competition between organics and cl for oh directly determines the ratio of their consumption rate of oh which depends on their concentration and reactivity with oh especially the concentration of organics and solution ph may change greatly during organics degradation process which will correspondingly influence the transformation rate of oh to rcs therefore the effect of cl on organics degradation is not immutable and may dynamically change as the reaction product between cl and oh rcs was also expected to affect the degradation of organics but we found that cl had no significant contribution to the degradation of organics in catalytic ozonation which may due to its reaction with ozone catalytic ozonation of a series of benzoic acid ba with different substituents in chloride contained wastewater was also investigated and the results showed that the electron donating substituents can weaken the inhibition of cl on bas degradation because they increase the reactivity of organics with oh o3 and rcs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saline wastewater catalytic ozonation chloride ions reaction mechanism reactive chlorine species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with wide development of seawater desalination and near zero wastewater discharge saline wastewater with large amount of salt and organics significantly increased in recent years lefebvre and moletta 2006 the removal of organic compounds from which is a great challenge for its threat to ecological environment and the damage to organic membrane or equipment in the following desalination or crystallization processes therefore effective and deep removal of organic compounds from saline wastewater are urgently required hydroxyl radical oh based catalytic ozonation offers a good option due to the high reactivity of oh buxton et al 1988 and the advantages of mild operating conditions low cost and no secondary pollution cao et al 2021 sun et al 2020 however part of inorganic anions in saline wastewater are known as oh scavengers but their exact effects on organics removal were not well evaluated due to different complex reactions and the difficulty in separating certain inorganic anions from wastewater to carry out blank control experiments loh et al 2021 therefore it is quite necessary to objectively and accurately evaluate the impact of inorganic ions in advanced oxidation processes aops and the cost effective to intervene the negative effects of inorganic ions chloride ion cl is one of the most common inorganic anions in wastewater and is usually considered as a oh scavenger grebel et al 2010 comparing with other cations such as nitrate and sulfate with highest valence of n and s cl has the lowest valence state and thus is easily involved in the quite oxidative reaction system of organics degradation chen et al 2022 yang et al 2016 it was reported that cl inhibited the ozonation of polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides li et al 2020 while it can also promote the degradation of p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba in catalytic ozonation process and chloramphenicol in o3 pms process cao et al 2020 wang et al 2016 the opposite effect of cl on different organics degradation was possibly attributed to the rcs formation yang et al 2014 however cl was also reported to have different effects on organic compounds that do not react with rcs zhang et al 2018 the effect of cl was significantly affected by water matrices and organic structures and the difference was even hundreds of times liao et al 2001 to evaluate the comprehensive effect of cl in an actual and complex wastewater and propose more effective intervention strategies it is critical to consider the distinct water matrix along with cl during organics degradation cl has several effects on aops such as transformation of reactive species stability of oxidants and catalytic activity of catalysts among which the first one is the most important jayson et al 1973 wang and wang 2021 however it is very difficult to realize real time detection of the types and concentrations of reactive oxygen species ros and rcs yang et al 2014 a few studies established kinetic models for benzoic acid carbamazepine and perfluorinated compounds in uv aops to calculate the concentration of radicals guan et al 2018 sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 it can evaluate the inhibition of cl on organics degradation by compare the change of the concentration of radicals however the establishment of the model requires reaction rate constants for all elementary reactions which makes it difficult to construct a kinetic model for actual saline wastewater treatment zhang et al established a simplified mathematical model after ignoring some unnecessary elementary reactions to evaluate the effect of cl on organics degradation zhang et al 2018 which can directly correlate the relationship between water matrices and the inhibition of cl on organics degradation however this may have certain limitations in choosing the elementary reactions for example the contribution of cl2 and clo to the degradation of organics was ignored in some model thus the conclusion cannot be adopted to the system where they can play an important role lei et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to establish a more accurate relationship between water matrices and the effect of cl on organics degradation in this work catalytic ozonation of organics in chloride contained saline wastewater with different water matrix was comprehensively studied the relationship between the inhibition of cl on organics degradation and the water matrix was determined by the mathematical derivation of the main elementary reactions and the degradation of nitrobenzene nb nb benzoic acid ba 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob and phenol were selected as free radical probes to evaluated the role of rcs on organics degradation as typical organics degradation intermediates a series of substituted benzoic acid compounds sbacs were also selected to reveal their resistance to cl inhibition with different structures this work can help evaluate the effects of cl on organics degradation in saline wastewater with different water matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical

phenylenediamine dpd was obtained from sigma usa nb were supplied by tianjin fuchen chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 experimental procedures all catalytic ozonation experiments were performed in a 450 ml cylindrical glass reactor at 25 c co2 is used to activate ozone to produce oh to avoid the interfere of organics adsorption on the heterogenous catalyst surface the reactor contained 200 ml of deionized water 1 mg l of co2 certain concentrations of organics and nacl the initial solution ph was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m h2so4 solution to the target value without buffer a mixed gas of o3 and o2 with a flow rate of 100 ml min and o3 concentration of 40 mg l was continuously introduced into the reactor the samples were taken every ten minutes to measure the concentration of organics o3 and hclo in solution 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of the probe compounds and the substituted benzoic acid compounds sbacs was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent series 1200 usa equipped with sb aq column and a uv vis detector more details were listed in table s1 solution ph was measured by a ph meter mettler toledo series fe28 switzerland the concentration of o3 in the solution was determined by the indigo method huang et al 2015 the concentration of hclo in the solution was determined by the dpd method moberg and karlberg 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of cl to the concentration of o3 hclo and ph the degradation of organic pollutants is attributed to direct oxidation of o3 molecules and indirect oxidation of oh in the catalytic ozonation process wang et al 2020 the concentrations of aqueous o3 and hclo in the co2 o3 process with the presence of cl was investigated to evaluate its effect on direct oxidation of o3 fig 1 a shows the concentration of o3 in solution when the concentration of cl varied from 0 to 320 mm the little change trend indicates that cl has no significant effect on the concentration of ozone in solution in the co2 o3 process which is attributed to the very slow reaction rate of cl with o3 k 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 hoigne et al 1985 as a result cl would not have a significant impact on direct ozonation of organic compounds neither affect the production rate of oh via changing the concentration of o3 fig 1b shows the concentration of hclo in solution in the co2 o3 process with different concentration of cl and it increases with higher concentration of cl the formation of hclo is a free radical process in the ozonation process levanov et al 2019 which is generated from the quenching reactions of rcs eqs 1 13 and the disproportionation reaction of cl2 eq 14 therefore the concentration of hclo can indirectly reflect the formation rate of rcs meanwhile the generation of hclo simultaneously increased solution ph fig 1c which was attributed to the consumption of h by the conversion of oh to cl eqs 1 3 jayson et al 1973 and the result confirmed that hclo was the product of rcs quenching 1 cl oh cloh 2 cloh cl oh 3 cloh h cl h2o 4 cl cl cl2 5 cl cl cl2 6 cl2 cl2 cl2 2cl 7 cl2 cl cl2 cl 8 cl2 oh hclo cl 9 hclo oh clo h2o 10 cl clo clo cl 11 cl2 clo clo 2cl 12 2clo oh clo h clo2 13 cl2 ho hclo cl 14 cl2 oh hclo cl 3 2 the effect of water matrices on transformation of oh to rcs 3 2 1 the effect of initial ph the presence of cl will transform oh to rcs and the transformation rate equals to the decrease of the consumption rate of oh on organic degradation or the formation rate of rcs which was reflected by the decrease of the degradation rate of nb because nb can react rapidly with oh but barely reacts with rcs or o3 bulman et al 2019 the decrease of its degradation rate in a complex system with oh o3 and rcs can be completely attributed to the decrease of oh in this work it was used as a probe compound to reflect the effect of water matrices on the transformation of oh to rcs as a reacting substance in the conversion of oh to rcs eqs 1 3 the effect of the concentration of h was firstly studied in co2 catalytic ozonation of nb it was found that ph had no significant effect on the degradation of nb when cl is absent fig s1 in comparison great inhibition occurs in the presence of 160 mm of cl especially at lower ph fig s1 this indicated that the low solution ph is beneficial for the transformation of oh to rcs the ph drops rapidly from 7 to about 3 during the degradation of nb in the presence of cl without ph adjustment fig s2 therefore we further maintain a neutral ph during the reaction with adding naoh solution from time to time to study the role of h on the transformation of oh to rcs text s1 phosphate buffer was not used to maintain the solution ph because it not only kept a stable ph in this system table s2 but also interfered nb degradation at low ph in coexistence with 160 mm of cl fig s2 in the control experiment fig 2 a nb was nearly completely degraded at 40 min while there were 0 22 0 42 and 0 62 mm of nb left at 60 min with 80 160 and 320 mm of cl in the system respectively fig 2b the degradation rate of nb decreased with higher concentration of cl without ph adjustment while those were almost identical with ph adjustment either cl is present or not this indicated that the effect of cl on organics degradation was completely attributed to the transformation of oh to rcs eqs 13 15 in the system with ph adjustment at 7 hclo was hardly generated and it was not influenced by the different concentration of cl fig 2c while the formation rate of hclo greatly increased without ph adjustment fig 2d and higher concentration of cl is beneficial for its generation interestingly when nb is completely degraded at 50 min hclo started to be produced afterward even at neutral ph fig 2c which indicated that the generation of rcs was not only affected by solution ph but also the concentration of coexisted organics comparing to the change of ph the organics degradation plays a more important role in the transformation of oh to rcs and the organics degradation and the rcs formation will interact cl affects the degradation of organics mainly by competing for oh except for organics and scavengers the consumption of oh by other substances can be ignored in aops zhang et al 2018 therefore when cl is absent the production rate of oh is approximately equal to the degradation rate of organics eq 15 15 r o h r o h r k o h r r o h when cl is present the law between organics degradation and rcs formation obeys the eqs 16 20 16 r oh cl r oh r r oh cl k oh r r oh k obs oh cl oh cl 17 oh r oh cl k oh r r k obs oh cl c l 18 r oh r r oh cl k oh r r k oh cl c l 19 r oh r k oh r r oh k oh r r r oh c l k oh r r k obs oh cl c l r oh r r oh r r oh cl r oh c l 20 r oh cl k obs oh cl c l oh k obs oh cl cl r oh cl k oh r r k obs oh cl cl r oh cl r oh r r oh cl r oh r cl where r oh and r o h c l are the production rates of oh when cl is absent or present r oh r is the rate of organics degradation r oh cl is the rate of the rcs formation or the transformation of oh to rcs k oh r is the second order rate constant of oh attacking organic compounds k obs oh cl is the pseudo second order rate constant of the reaction of oh and cl eq 21 which is a function of the concentration of h clemens von sonntag 2012 21 oh cl cl oh as the concentration of o3 in solution was basically unchanged fig 1a the production rate of oh was almost constant in the catalytic ozonation process the k obs oh cl was also constant when the solution ph is constant obviously most of oh is consumed for organic degradation or rcs formation eq 16 and the ratio of oh consumed by rcs formation and organics degradation is equal to k obs oh c l c l k oh r r eq 18 the inhibition of cl on organics degradation is completely due to the transformation of oh to rcs which is equal to the decrease of r oh r or the increase of r oh cl therefore the organics degradation rate is approximately affected by k obs oh c l c l k oh r r which can be considered as the ratio of the ability of cl and organics to compete for oh it is obvious that water matrices determine the distribution ratio of oh in organic degradation and rcs formation especially the four factors cl r solution ph and k oh r it should be mentioned that the solution ph may change during organic degradation and this will also affect the inhibition fig s1 3 2 2 the effect of cl concentration the effect of the concentration of cl on the transformation of oh to rcs was investigated at ph 3 to minimize the effect of ph change fig 3 a shows that the higher concentration of cl led to lower nb degradation rate indicating that high concentration of cl is favorable for rcs formation in addition the decrease of nb degradation rate caused by the decrease of its concentration in the presence of cl is greater than that without cl which was attributed to the increase of cl r because the concentration of cl is 50 200 times higher than nb and they have similar consume rate as a result the oh consumed in rcs formation will gradually increases with the increase of cl r during nb degradation it will enhance the inhibition of cl on nb degradation and ultimately leads to a poor removal rate besides the concentration of nb the change of solution ph also had a significant effect on its degradation in the presence of cl even at ph 3 nb degradation and rcs formation had a significant impact on solution ph fig 3b nb degradation will decrease the solution ph due to the production of degradation intermediates fig s1 which was beneficial to rcs formation but not conducive to nb degradation however rcs formation will increase the solution ph which is not conducive to rcs formation eqs 1 3 the two negative feedback regulation processes make the nb degradation rate and solution ph tend to become stable and at this time the formation and consumption rates of h are almost equal fig 3c shows the effect of the concentration of cl on the formation of hclo the formation rate of hclo changed dramatically during nb degradation which means the formation rate of rcs is not constant when the concentration of cl is 240 mm or 320 mm the rapid formation of hclo and slow degradation rate of nb show that most oh is consumed in rcs formation which increase the solution ph and weaken the rcs formation as a result the ph began to decrease slowly after 20 min and the formation rate of hclo was less than its consumption rate and decrease its concentration when the concentration of cl is 0 160 mm the competition of organics for oh is stronger than that of cl therefore the solution ph decreases firstly and then increases and finally reaches a stable value with the decrease of solution ph and nb concentration the concentration of hclo gradually increased as described above the inhibition of cl on organics degradation will be enhanced with the increase of cl r or the decrease of solution ph in addition the organics degradation will cause a significant change in cl r or ph which will greatly affect the ratio of oh consumed in rcs formation and organics degradation this meant that the effect of cl on organics degradation cannot be evaluated only by the initial water matrices 3 2 3 the effect of initial organics concentration fig 4 a shows that the inhibition of cl on nb degradation will enhanced during nb degradation which can be attribute to the increase of cl r to study the effect of the concentration of organics on the transformation of oh to rcs and exclude the effect of ph the effects of initial concentrations of nb on its degradation rate were studied the increase of initial concentration of nb did not significantly change its degradation rate when cl is absent fig 4a because the formation rate of oh is essentially stable and no other compounds compete with it for oh eq 15 however when cl is present the inhibition of cl on nb degradation decreases with higher concentration of nb indicating that the decrease of cl nb will inhibit the rcs formation higher concentration of organics can significantly promote the competition with cl for oh and thus reduce the inhibition of cl 3 2 4 the effect of the reactivity of organics with oh to study the effect of organics structure on its competitive ability for oh several organics that hardly react with rcs was selected in this work fig 5 shows the effect of 160 mm of cl on the degradation of p nba nb and ba cl almost did not contribute to the degradation of organic compounds fig 6 b and 160 mm cl almost completely inhibited the degradation of p nba fig 7 a therefore the contribution of rcs on p nba nb and ba degradation can be excluded in addition these organics can t be degraded by ozone hoigne et al 1985 thus they only react with oh in the co2 o3 process with 160 mm of cl although the second order reaction rate constants of three organic compounds with oh were quite different k p nba oh 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 k nb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 k ba oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 they showed similar degradation rates when cl is absent fig 5a eq 15 the degradation rates of p nba nb and ba were significantly different when cl is present fig 5b because there is almost no compounds competing oh with organics in the solution without cl therefore the generated oh is almost all used for the degradation of organics which leads to the similar degradation rates of different organics however the inhibition degree of cl on their degradation rate was p nba nb ba which was negatively correlated with k r oh indicating that organics with high reactivity to oh have strong ability to compete with cl for oh therefore the rate of oh converting into rcs is reduced with the k r oh increase obviously the inhibition of cl on organics degradation depends on the competitive ability k oh r r or k obs oh cl cl of organics and cl for oh which determine the ratio of oh consumed in organics degradation or rcs formation therefore reducing the competition of cl for oh or increasing the competitive ability of organics to oh is the most effective method to promote the organics degradation in chloride contained saline wastewater which can also avoid the formation of chlorinated byproducts by preventing rcs formation 3 3 the contribution of rcs to organics degradation as the product of rcs formation rcss also play an important role in organics degradation due to the vastly different reactivity of different rcs with organic compounds it is crucial to determine which rcs plays a major role to the degradation of organic compounds cl has the highest oxidation potential 2 55 ev among all rcss and its reactivity with some organic compounds is even higher than o3 or oh fang et al 2014 the competitive kinetics of ba and nb degradation were studied to determine the contribution of cl to organic compounds degradation huang et al 2019 and it was carried out at ph 1 and the concentration of cl was 0 0 8 mm to enhanced the formation of cl and avoid the reaction between cl and cl fig 6a shows the apparent pseudo zero order kinetic of nb and ba degradation the degradation rate of ba and nb decrease with higher concentration of cl which is due to the increase of the transformation of oh to rcs when the concentration of cl varied from 0 to 0 8 mm the ratio of apparent pseudo zero order reaction rate constant of ba to nb was almost identical they were very close to the ratio of second order rate constant of ba to nb fig 6b which indicates that can be ignored in the co2 o3 process the contribution of cl to ba in the presence of 0 8 mm cl was expressed in eqs 22 27 22 r nb k oh nb nb oh 23 r ba k oh ba ba oh k cl ba cl ba 24 oh r nb k oh nb nb 25 r ba k oh ba ba r nb k oh nb nb k cl ba cl ba the degradation of ba and nb accorded with pseudo zero order kinetic thus the degradation rate of probes was equal to their apparent pseudo zero order kinetic rate constants 26 r ba k obs ba 0 00589 27 k cl ba cl ba k obs ba k oh nb ba k obs nb k oh nb nb 0 000589 the contribution of cl to ba degradation was only 10 which is seriously inconsistent with the total rcs formation rate as the competitive ability of ba for cl is twice as strong as cl at the same concentration zhao et al 2021 this was probably because that cl was quickly converted to clo by o3 naumov and von sonntag 2011 as cl did not give obvious contribution to ba degradation in the co2 o3 process the competition kinetics of free radical probes degradation nb ba dmob and phenol were further studied to determine the role of other rcss contributing to organics degradation fig s5 shows that cl has no effect on the degradation of dmob and promote the degradation of phenol which was due to the conversion of non selective oh to more selective cl2 or clo eqs 1 14 naumov and von sonntag 2011 lei et al 2019 as a result this promoted the degradation of phenol which could react with cl2 and clo at the expense of the degradation of ba and nb which only react with oh or cl yang et al 2014 3 4 the effect of organics structure sbacs are a type of organic pollutants and also typical degradation intermediates of many organics fig 7a 7e shows the effect of cl on the degradation of a series of sbacs the degradation rate follows the order p hba p ma ba p nba p ta when cl is absent which can be attributed to that electron donating groups enhanced the reactivity of sbacs and reactive species hoigne et al 1985 lei et al 2019 luo et al 2018 the degradation rates of p nba and ba are higher than that of p ta containing electron donating groups which is due to the increase of the steady state concentration of oh oh ss fig s6 caused by the self enhanced ozonation huang et al 2015 it was found that cl inhibits the degradation of p nba ba p ta and p ma and its inhibition weakened with stronger electron donating ability of the substituents which follows the order p nba ba p ta p mba p hba it possibly due to the following three reasons 1 the electron donating substituents on sbacs enhance its reactivity with o3 molecules and thus direct ozonation plays a greater role in organics degradation than oh or rcs 2 sbacs containing electron donating groups have higher reactivity with oh thus their competitive ability with cl for oh is enhanced 3 the conversion of oh to cl2 or clo has little effect on sbacs with higher electron density because it has high reactivity with these rcss fig 7f shows the hammett plots of a series of sbacs degradation in the co2 o3 process comparing with ba including p nba p ta p ma and p hba they were linearly correlated with log k k0 except for p nba when cl is absent negative hammett slopes were both observed in the presence or absence of cl which means the electron donating substituents were beneficial to the degradation of sbacs lei et al 2019 p nba showed an abnormal degradation behavior when cl is absent which was attributed to its self enhanced ozonation huang et al 2015 the slope of the hammett plot in the presence of cl was smaller than that without cl it means that the substituents have greater influence on the sbacs degradation in the presence of 160 mm of cl than that without cl which is due to the conversion of non selective oh to the more selective cl2 or clo 4 conclusions in this paper the effect of cl on organic pollutants degradation was systematically studied in the co2 o3 process comprehensively considering various water matrix and structure of organics the effect is almost completely reflected in the transforming oh to rcs which is competitive with organics degradation therefore the transformation rate of oh to rcs was affected by the competition of organics with cl for oh and the ratio of oh consumed by rcs formation and organics degradation is equal to k obs oh c l c l k oh r r adjusting ph is an effective way to reduce the reactivity of cl to oh and avoid the inhibiting effect of cl to organics degradation as the primary rcs from oh transformation cl had no significant contribution to the degradation of organic pollutants cl2 or clo was identified as the contributing rcs to organics degradation which may due to the high reactivity between cl and o3 to produce them the inhibition effect of cl was weakened on the degradation of substituted benzoic acids with strong electron donating substituents due to

14946,chloride ion cl is one of the most common anions in wastewater and saline wastewater but its elusive effects on organics degradation are not clear yet in many cases in this paper the effect of cl on organic compounds degradation is intensively studied in catalytic ozonation of different water matrix it was found that the effect of cl is almost completely reflected by transforming oh to reactive chlorine species rcs which is simultaneously competitive with organics degradation the competition between organics and cl for oh directly determines the ratio of their consumption rate of oh which depends on their concentration and reactivity with oh especially the concentration of organics and solution ph may change greatly during organics degradation process which will correspondingly influence the transformation rate of oh to rcs therefore the effect of cl on organics degradation is not immutable and may dynamically change as the reaction product between cl and oh rcs was also expected to affect the degradation of organics but we found that cl had no significant contribution to the degradation of organics in catalytic ozonation which may due to its reaction with ozone catalytic ozonation of a series of benzoic acid ba with different substituents in chloride contained wastewater was also investigated and the results showed that the electron donating substituents can weaken the inhibition of cl on bas degradation because they increase the reactivity of organics with oh o3 and rcs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saline wastewater catalytic ozonation chloride ions reaction mechanism reactive chlorine species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with wide development of seawater desalination and near zero wastewater discharge saline wastewater with large amount of salt and organics significantly increased in recent years lefebvre and moletta 2006 the removal of organic compounds from which is a great challenge for its threat to ecological environment and the damage to organic membrane or equipment in the following desalination or crystallization processes therefore effective and deep removal of organic compounds from saline wastewater are urgently required hydroxyl radical oh based catalytic ozonation offers a good option due to the high reactivity of oh buxton et al 1988 and the advantages of mild operating conditions low cost and no secondary pollution cao et al 2021 sun et al 2020 however part of inorganic anions in saline wastewater are known as oh scavengers but their exact effects on organics removal were not well evaluated due to different complex reactions and the difficulty in separating certain inorganic anions from wastewater to carry out blank control experiments loh et al 2021 therefore it is quite necessary to objectively and accurately evaluate the impact of inorganic ions in advanced oxidation processes aops and the cost effective to intervene the negative effects of inorganic ions chloride ion cl is one of the most common inorganic anions in wastewater and is usually considered as a oh scavenger grebel et al 2010 comparing with other cations such as nitrate and sulfate with highest valence of n and s cl has the lowest valence state and thus is easily involved in the quite oxidative reaction system of organics degradation chen et al 2022 yang et al 2016 it was reported that cl inhibited the ozonation of polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides li et al 2020 while it can also promote the degradation of p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba in catalytic ozonation process and chloramphenicol in o3 pms process cao et al 2020 wang et al 2016 the opposite effect of cl on different organics degradation was possibly attributed to the rcs formation yang et al 2014 however cl was also reported to have different effects on organic compounds that do not react with rcs zhang et al 2018 the effect of cl was significantly affected by water matrices and organic structures and the difference was even hundreds of times liao et al 2001 to evaluate the comprehensive effect of cl in an actual and complex wastewater and propose more effective intervention strategies it is critical to consider the distinct water matrix along with cl during organics degradation cl has several effects on aops such as transformation of reactive species stability of oxidants and catalytic activity of catalysts among which the first one is the most important jayson et al 1973 wang and wang 2021 however it is very difficult to realize real time detection of the types and concentrations of reactive oxygen species ros and rcs yang et al 2014 a few studies established kinetic models for benzoic acid carbamazepine and perfluorinated compounds in uv aops to calculate the concentration of radicals guan et al 2018 sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 it can evaluate the inhibition of cl on organics degradation by compare the change of the concentration of radicals however the establishment of the model requires reaction rate constants for all elementary reactions which makes it difficult to construct a kinetic model for actual saline wastewater treatment zhang et al established a simplified mathematical model after ignoring some unnecessary elementary reactions to evaluate the effect of cl on organics degradation zhang et al 2018 which can directly correlate the relationship between water matrices and the inhibition of cl on organics degradation however this may have certain limitations in choosing the elementary reactions for example the contribution of cl2 and clo to the degradation of organics was ignored in some model thus the conclusion cannot be adopted to the system where they can play an important role lei et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to establish a more accurate relationship between water matrices and the effect of cl on organics degradation in this work catalytic ozonation of organics in chloride contained saline wastewater with different water matrix was comprehensively studied the relationship between the inhibition of cl on organics degradation and the water matrix was determined by the mathematical derivation of the main elementary reactions and the degradation of nitrobenzene nb nb benzoic acid ba 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob and phenol were selected as free radical probes to evaluated the role of rcs on organics degradation as typical organics degradation intermediates a series of substituted benzoic acid compounds sbacs were also selected to reveal their resistance to cl inhibition with different structures this work can help evaluate the effects of cl on organics degradation in saline wastewater with different water matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents phenol ba p hba nacl naoh h2so4 h3po4 nah2po4 na2hpo4 and potassium indigotrisulfonate were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china p nitrobenzoic acid p nba p methoxybenzoic acid p ma and cobalt sulfate heptahydrate were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china p toluic acid p ta and dmob were purchased from aladdin industrial co ltd china n n diethylp phenylenediamine dpd was obtained from sigma usa nb were supplied by tianjin fuchen chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 experimental procedures all catalytic ozonation experiments were performed in a 450 ml cylindrical glass reactor at 25 c co2 is used to activate ozone to produce oh to avoid the interfere of organics adsorption on the heterogenous catalyst surface the reactor contained 200 ml of deionized water 1 mg l of co2 certain concentrations of organics and nacl the initial solution ph was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m h2so4 solution to the target value without buffer a mixed gas of o3 and o2 with a flow rate of 100 ml min and o3 concentration of 40 mg l was continuously introduced into the reactor the samples were taken every ten minutes to measure the concentration of organics o3 and hclo in solution 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of the probe compounds and the substituted benzoic acid compounds sbacs was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent series 1200 usa equipped with sb aq column and a uv vis detector more details were listed in table s1 solution ph was measured by a ph meter mettler toledo series fe28 switzerland the concentration of o3 in the solution was determined by the indigo method huang et al 2015 the concentration of hclo in the solution was determined by the dpd method moberg and karlberg 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of cl to the concentration of o3 hclo and ph the degradation of organic pollutants is attributed to direct oxidation of o3 molecules and indirect oxidation of oh in the catalytic ozonation process wang et al 2020 the concentrations of aqueous o3 and hclo in the co2 o3 process with the presence of cl was investigated to evaluate its effect on direct oxidation of o3 fig 1 a shows the concentration of o3 in solution when the concentration of cl varied from 0 to 320 mm the little change trend indicates that cl has no significant effect on the concentration of ozone in solution in the co2 o3 process which is attributed to the very slow reaction rate of cl with o3 k 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 hoigne et al 1985 as a result cl would not have a significant impact on direct ozonation of organic compounds neither affect the production rate of oh via changing the concentration of o3 fig 1b shows the concentration of hclo in solution in the co2 o3 process with different concentration of cl and it increases with higher concentration of cl the formation of hclo is a free radical process in the ozonation process levanov et al 2019 which is generated from the quenching reactions of rcs eqs 1 13 and the disproportionation reaction of cl2 eq 14 therefore the concentration of hclo can indirectly reflect the formation rate of rcs meanwhile the generation of hclo simultaneously increased solution ph fig 1c which was attributed to the consumption of h by the conversion of oh to cl eqs 1 3 jayson et al 1973 and the result confirmed that hclo was the product of rcs quenching 1 cl oh cloh 2 cloh cl oh 3 cloh h cl h2o 4 cl cl cl2 5 cl cl cl2 6 cl2 cl2 cl2 2cl 7 cl2 cl cl2 cl 8 cl2 oh hclo cl 9 hclo oh clo h2o 10 cl clo clo cl 11 cl2 clo clo 2cl 12 2clo oh clo h clo2 13 cl2 ho hclo cl 14 cl2 oh hclo cl 3 2 the effect of water matrices on transformation of oh to rcs 3 2 1 the effect of initial ph the presence of cl will transform oh to rcs and the transformation rate equals to the decrease of the consumption rate of oh on organic degradation or the formation rate of rcs which was reflected by the decrease of the degradation rate of nb because nb can react rapidly with oh but barely reacts with rcs or o3 bulman et al 2019 the decrease of its degradation rate in a complex system with oh o3 and rcs can be completely attributed to the decrease of oh in this work it was used as a probe compound to reflect the effect of water matrices on the transformation of oh to rcs as a reacting substance in the conversion of oh to rcs eqs 1 3 the effect of the concentration of h was firstly studied in co2 catalytic ozonation of nb it was found that ph had no significant effect on the degradation of nb when cl is absent fig s1 in comparison great inhibition occurs in the presence of 160 mm of cl especially at lower ph fig s1 this indicated that the low solution ph is beneficial for the transformation of oh to rcs the ph drops rapidly from 7 to about 3 during the degradation of nb in the presence of cl without ph adjustment fig s2 therefore we further maintain a neutral ph during the reaction with adding naoh solution from time to time to study the role of h on the transformation of oh to rcs text s1 phosphate buffer was not used to maintain the solution ph because it not only kept a stable ph in this system table s2 but also interfered nb degradation at low ph in coexistence with 160 mm of cl fig s2 in the control experiment fig 2 a nb was nearly completely degraded at 40 min while there were 0 22 0 42 and 0 62 mm of nb left at 60 min with 80 160 and 320 mm of cl in the system respectively fig 2b the degradation rate of nb decreased with higher concentration of cl without ph adjustment while those were almost identical with ph adjustment either cl is present or not this indicated that the effect of cl on organics degradation was completely attributed to the transformation of oh to rcs eqs 13 15 in the system with ph adjustment at 7 hclo was hardly generated and it was not influenced by the different concentration of cl fig 2c while the formation rate of hclo greatly increased without ph adjustment fig 2d and higher concentration of cl is beneficial for its generation interestingly when nb is completely degraded at 50 min hclo started to be produced afterward even at neutral ph fig 2c which indicated that the generation of rcs was not only affected by solution ph but also the concentration of coexisted organics comparing to the change of ph the organics degradation plays a more important role in the transformation of oh to rcs and the organics degradation and the rcs formation will interact cl affects the degradation of organics mainly by competing for oh except for organics and scavengers the consumption of oh by other substances can be ignored in aops zhang et al 2018 therefore when cl is absent the production rate of oh is approximately equal to the degradation rate of organics eq 15 15 r o h r o h r k o h r r o h when cl is present the law between organics degradation and rcs formation obeys the eqs 16 20 16 r oh cl r oh r r oh cl k oh r r oh k obs oh cl oh cl 17 oh r oh cl k oh r r k obs oh cl c l 18 r oh r r oh cl k oh r r k oh cl c l 19 r oh r k oh r r oh k oh r r r oh c l k oh r r k obs oh cl c l r oh r r oh r r oh cl r oh c l 20 r oh cl k obs oh cl c l oh k obs oh cl cl r oh cl k oh r r k obs oh cl cl r oh cl r oh r r oh cl r oh r cl where r oh and r o h c l are the production rates of oh when cl is absent or present r oh r is the rate of organics degradation r oh cl is the rate of the rcs formation or the transformation of oh to rcs k oh r is the second order rate constant of oh attacking organic compounds k obs oh cl is the pseudo second order rate constant of the reaction of oh and cl eq 21 which is a function of the concentration of h clemens von sonntag 2012 21 oh cl cl oh as the concentration of o3 in solution was basically unchanged fig 1a the production rate of oh was almost constant in the catalytic ozonation process the k obs oh cl was also constant when the solution ph is constant obviously most of oh is consumed for organic degradation or rcs formation eq 16 and the ratio of oh consumed by rcs formation and organics degradation is equal to k obs oh c l c l k oh r r eq 18 the inhibition of cl on organics degradation is completely due to the transformation of oh to rcs which is equal to the decrease of r oh r or the increase of r oh cl therefore the organics degradation rate is approximately affected by k obs oh c l c l k oh r r which can be considered as the ratio of the ability of cl and organics to compete for oh it is obvious that water matrices determine the distribution ratio of oh in organic degradation and rcs formation especially the four factors cl r solution ph and k oh r it should be mentioned that the solution ph may change during organic degradation and this will also affect the inhibition fig s1 3 2 2 the effect of cl concentration the effect of the concentration of cl on the transformation of oh to rcs was investigated at ph 3 to minimize the effect of ph change fig 3 a shows that the higher concentration of cl led to lower nb degradation rate indicating that high concentration of cl is favorable for rcs formation in addition the decrease of nb degradation rate caused by the decrease of its concentration in the presence of cl is greater than that without cl which was attributed to the increase of cl r because the concentration of cl is 50 200 times higher than nb and they have similar consume rate as a result the oh consumed in rcs formation will gradually increases with the increase of cl r during nb degradation it will enhance the inhibition of cl on nb degradation and ultimately leads to a poor removal rate besides the concentration of nb the change of solution ph also had a significant effect on its degradation in the presence of cl even at ph 3 nb degradation and rcs formation had a significant impact on solution ph fig 3b nb degradation will decrease the solution ph due to the production of degradation intermediates fig s1 which was beneficial to rcs formation but not conducive to nb degradation however rcs formation will increase the solution ph which is not conducive to rcs formation eqs 1 3 the two negative feedback regulation processes make the nb degradation rate and solution ph tend to become stable and at this time the formation and consumption rates of h are almost equal fig 3c shows the effect of the concentration of cl on the formation of hclo the formation rate of hclo changed dramatically during nb degradation which means the formation rate of rcs is not constant when the concentration of cl is 240 mm or 320 mm the rapid formation of hclo and slow degradation rate of nb show that most oh is consumed in rcs formation which increase the solution ph and weaken the rcs formation as a result the ph began to decrease slowly after 20 min and the formation rate of hclo was less than its consumption rate and decrease its concentration when the concentration of cl is 0 160 mm the competition of organics for oh is stronger than that of cl therefore the solution ph decreases firstly and then increases and finally reaches a stable value with the decrease of solution ph and nb concentration the concentration of hclo gradually increased as described above the inhibition of cl on organics degradation will be enhanced with the increase of cl r or the decrease of solution ph in addition the organics degradation will cause a significant change in cl r or ph which will greatly affect the ratio of oh consumed in rcs formation and organics degradation this meant that the effect of cl on organics degradation cannot be evaluated only by the initial water matrices 3 2 3 the effect of initial organics concentration fig 4 a shows that the inhibition of cl on nb degradation will enhanced during nb degradation which can be attribute to the increase of cl r to study the effect of the concentration of organics on the transformation of oh to rcs and exclude the effect of ph the effects of initial concentrations of nb on its degradation rate were studied the increase of initial concentration of nb did not significantly change its degradation rate when cl is absent fig 4a because the formation rate of oh is essentially stable and no other compounds compete with it for oh eq 15 however when cl is present the inhibition of cl on nb degradation decreases with higher concentration of nb indicating that the decrease of cl nb will inhibit the rcs formation higher concentration of organics can significantly promote the competition with cl for oh and thus reduce the inhibition of cl 3 2 4 the effect of the reactivity of organics with oh to study the effect of organics structure on its competitive ability for oh several organics that hardly react with rcs was selected in this work fig 5 shows the effect of 160 mm of cl on the degradation of p nba nb and ba cl almost did not contribute to the degradation of organic compounds fig 6 b and 160 mm cl almost completely inhibited the degradation of p nba fig 7 a therefore the contribution of rcs on p nba nb and ba degradation can be excluded in addition these organics can t be degraded by ozone hoigne et al 1985 thus they only react with oh in the co2 o3 process with 160 mm of cl although the second order reaction rate constants of three organic compounds with oh were quite different k p nba oh 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 k nb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 k ba oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 they showed similar degradation rates when cl is absent fig 5a eq 15 the degradation rates of p nba nb and ba were significantly different when cl is present fig 5b because there is almost no compounds competing oh with organics in the solution without cl therefore the generated oh is almost all used for the degradation of organics which leads to the similar degradation rates of different organics however the inhibition degree of cl on their degradation rate was p nba nb ba which was negatively correlated with k r oh indicating that organics with high reactivity to oh have strong ability to compete with cl for oh therefore the rate of oh converting into rcs is reduced with the k r oh increase obviously the inhibition of cl on organics degradation depends on the competitive ability k oh r r or k obs oh cl cl of organics and cl for oh which determine the ratio of oh consumed in organics degradation or rcs formation therefore reducing the competition of cl for oh or increasing the competitive ability of organics to oh is the most effective method to promote the organics degradation in chloride contained saline wastewater which can also avoid the formation of chlorinated byproducts by preventing rcs formation 3 3 the contribution of rcs to organics degradation as the product of rcs formation rcss also play an important role in organics degradation due to the vastly different reactivity of different rcs with organic compounds it is crucial to determine which rcs plays a major role to the degradation of organic compounds cl has the highest oxidation potential 2 55 ev among all rcss and its reactivity with some organic compounds is even higher than o3 or oh fang et al 2014 the competitive kinetics of ba and nb degradation were studied to determine the contribution of cl to organic compounds degradation huang et al 2019 and it was carried out at ph 1 and the concentration of cl was 0 0 8 mm to enhanced the formation of cl and avoid the reaction between cl and cl fig 6a shows the apparent pseudo zero order kinetic of nb and ba degradation the degradation rate of ba and nb decrease with higher concentration of cl which is due to the increase of the transformation of oh to rcs when the concentration of cl varied from 0 to 0 8 mm the ratio of apparent pseudo zero order reaction rate constant of ba to nb was almost identical they were very close to the ratio of second order rate constant of ba to nb fig 6b which indicates that can be ignored in the co2 o3 process the contribution of cl to ba in the presence of 0 8 mm cl was expressed in eqs 22 27 22 r nb k oh nb nb oh 23 r ba k oh ba ba oh k cl ba cl ba 24 oh r nb k oh nb nb 25 r ba k oh ba ba r nb k oh nb nb k cl ba cl ba the degradation of ba and nb accorded with pseudo zero order kinetic thus the degradation rate of probes was equal to their apparent pseudo zero order kinetic rate constants 26 r ba k obs ba 0 00589 27 k cl ba cl ba k obs ba k oh nb ba k obs nb k oh nb nb 0 000589 the contribution of cl to ba degradation was only 10 which is seriously inconsistent with the total rcs formation rate as the competitive ability of ba for cl is twice as strong as cl at the same concentration zhao et al 2021 this was probably because that cl was quickly converted to clo by o3 naumov and von sonntag 2011 as cl did not give obvious contribution to ba degradation in the co2 o3 process the competition kinetics of free radical probes degradation nb ba dmob and phenol were further studied to determine the role of other rcss contributing to organics degradation fig s5 shows that cl has no effect on the degradation of dmob and promote the degradation of phenol which was due to the conversion of non selective oh to more selective cl2 or clo eqs 1 14 naumov and von sonntag 2011 lei et al 2019 as a result this promoted the degradation of phenol which could react with cl2 and clo at the expense of the degradation of ba and nb which only react with oh or cl yang et al 2014 3 4 the effect of organics structure sbacs are a type of organic pollutants and also typical degradation intermediates of many organics fig 7a 7e shows the effect of cl on the degradation of a series of sbacs the degradation rate follows the order p hba p ma ba p nba p ta when cl is absent which can be attributed to that electron donating groups enhanced the reactivity of sbacs and reactive species hoigne et al 1985 lei et al 2019 luo et al 2018 the degradation rates of p nba and ba are higher than that of p ta containing electron donating groups which is due to the increase of the steady state concentration of oh oh ss fig s6 caused by the self enhanced ozonation huang et al 2015 it was found that cl inhibits the degradation of p nba ba p ta and p ma and its inhibition weakened with stronger electron donating ability of the substituents which follows the order p nba ba p ta p mba p hba it possibly due to the following three reasons 1 the electron donating substituents on sbacs enhance its reactivity with o3 molecules and thus direct ozonation plays a greater role in organics degradation than oh or rcs 2 sbacs containing electron donating groups have higher reactivity with oh thus their competitive ability with cl for oh is enhanced 3 the conversion of oh to cl2 or clo has little effect on sbacs with higher electron density because it has high reactivity with these rcss fig 7f shows the hammett plots of a series of sbacs degradation in the co2 o3 process comparing with ba including p nba p ta p ma and p hba they were linearly correlated with log k k0 except for p nba when cl is absent negative hammett slopes were both observed in the presence or absence of cl which means the electron donating substituents were beneficial to the degradation of sbacs lei et al 2019 p nba showed an abnormal degradation behavior when cl is absent which was attributed to its self enhanced ozonation huang et al 2015 the slope of the hammett plot in the presence of cl was smaller than that without cl it means that the substituents have greater influence on the sbacs degradation in the presence of 160 mm of cl than that without cl which is due to the conversion of non selective oh to the more selective cl2 or clo 4 conclusions in this paper the effect of cl on organic pollutants degradation was systematically studied in the co2 o3 process comprehensively considering various water matrix and structure of organics the effect is almost completely reflected in the transforming oh to rcs which is competitive with organics degradation therefore the transformation rate of oh to rcs was affected by the competition of organics with cl for oh and the ratio of oh consumed by rcs formation and organics degradation is equal to k obs oh c l c l k oh r r adjusting ph is an effective way to reduce the reactivity of cl to oh and avoid the inhibiting effect of cl to organics degradation as the primary rcs from oh transformation cl had no significant contribution to the degradation of organic pollutants cl2 or clo was identified as the contributing rcs to organics degradation which may due to the high reactivity between cl and o3 to produce them the inhibition effect of cl was weakened on the degradation of substituted benzoic acids with strong electron donating substituents due to their higher reactivity of with o3 oh or rcs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

14947,organic pollutants removal from water is pressing owing to the great demand for clean water oxidation processes ops are the commonly used method however the efficiency of most ops is limited owing to the poor mass transfer process spatial confinement is a burgeoning way to solve this limitation by use of nanoreactor spatial confinement in ops would i alter the transport characteristics of protons and charges ii bring about molecular orientation and rearrangement iii cause the dynamic redistribution of active sites in catalyst and reduce the entropic barrier that is high in unconfined space so far spatial confinement has been utilized for various ops such as fenton persulfate and photocatalytic oxidation a comprehensive summary and discussion on the fundamental mechanisms of spatial confinement mediated ops is needed herein the application performance and mechanisms of spatial confinement mediated ops are overviewed firstly subsequently the features of spatial confinement and their effects on ops are discussed in detail furthermore environmental influences including environmental ph organic matter and inorganic ions are studied with analyzing their intrinsic connection with the features of spatial confinement in ops lastly challenges and future development direction of spatial confinement mediated ops are proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

natural organic matter aao anodized aluminum oxide cnt carbon nanotube mwcnt multiwalled carbon nanotube data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction large amount of persistent organics released into surface and ground water cause serious pollution and pose a significant threat to living organisms oxidation processes ops are frequently used for organics removal song et al 2022 yang et al 2020 organics are attacked by the oxidizing radicals generated in ops like hydroxyl radicals oh 2 8 v vs she and singlet oxygen 1o2 1 1 v vs she yi et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 however the generation of radicals is slow zhang et al 2022 and only a few radicals participate in organics degradation li et al 2022 great efforts have been made to overcome these restrictions such as adding cocatalyst increasing oxidants concentration e g peroxymonosulfate and h2o2 or introducing external energy e g solar thermal and electric energy wei et al 2022a nevertheless these strategies could not achieve the satisfactory efficiency of ops in actual wastewater treatment due to poor mass transfer process yi et al 2022b therefore the broad application of ops in practical settings is restricted li et al 2019b as a means to accelerate the ops spatial confinement has attracted much attention in recent years shang et al 2022 when the size of spatial restriction is at nanometer scale or smaller known as spatial confinement the phase behavior of matter in confined space will be different from in the bulk phase which has a great effect on oxidation reaction in the beginning traditional spatial restriction at nanometer scale was utilized to improve ops materials with special scaffolds contribute to multiple confined structures including holes cavities or well defined structures e g tubes or layered structure with the development of nanotechnology spatial confinement has been extended to the atomic level restriction like unsaturated coordination of atomic species lin et al 2020 spatial confinement shortens reactant diffusion distance to achieve faster mass and heat transfer faucher et al 2019 and enhances covalent and noncovalent interaction between the guest molecules and the reaction surface especially those distance dependent intermolecular forces like electrostatic interaction chen et al 2014 moreover by enhancing the interaction spatial confinement further promotes their individual behavior like accumulation distribution and binding zhou et al 2020b these contribute to the enrichment of reactants which promotes oxidation reaction thermodynamically the size of restricted space plays an important role in the confinement effect for ops improvement when op is confined in a space with the size decreased to several nanometers or even small in addition to enrichment of reactants the electronic transport characteristics could be altered obviously leading to the change of oxidation system especially the valence electron structure which may even contribute to the quantum mutation ma et al 2022a rajadell et al 2017 consequently the oxidation reaction could be improved thermodynamically and kinetically and the improvement is obvious for instance the reaction kinetics of confined fenton op inside nanoscale 20 nm channels improved 820 times compared to the unconfined fenton op zhang et al 2020b on one hand the confined space enhances the utilization efficiency of enriched reactive radicals in ops the generated reactive radicals are easily quenched by ubiquitous natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate carbonate and other substances existing in environment leading to ultrashort lifetimes 10 6 10 9 s and transfer distance chen et al 2019 it was reported that oh radicals generated from catalyst surface would be consumed within 25 nm of mass transfer distance in aqueous phase thus 25 nm is the critical size to optimize the confinement effect zhang et al 2020b on the other hand the energy barriers of oxidation reaction could be reduced under spatial confinement panić et al 2018 spatial confinement also makes the solid electron donor receptor more active ding et al 2018 and accelerates electron transport by regulating the surface electron properties chen et al 2017 these enable spatial confinement to adjust the reaction kinetics to achieve efficient ops for spatial confinement mediated ops the precise match between the size shape of confined space and substrate is of great significance additionally the nature of oxidation catalysts the hydration properties of pollutant environment ph and redox potential also affect the ops hu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a the ops are elusive under spatial confinement using spatial confinement to promote ops must combine fundamental research with technology applications the relationship between the differences made by spatial confinement and their implications in ops for organics removal needs systematical illustration in this review the application of spatial confinement in ops for organics removal is summarized firstly subsequently the features of spatial confinement and their effects on ops are discussed furthermore environmental influences are studied with analyzing their intrinsic connection with the features of spatial confinement in ops lastly the challenges and future development of spatial confinement mediated ops in actual wastewater treatment are proposed 2 application of spatial confinement in oxidation process amounts of ops have been improved by use of spatial confinement including fenton op persulfate op photocatalytic op and others like ozone electrocaltalysis and spontaneous ops materials with various structures such as holes cavities or well defined structures have been used to provide confined structure the confined structure and its match degree with substrates have great effects on the performance of ops the effects are diverse in different ops which is investigated with analyzing concrete ops in this section the causes of confinement for the variation of reaction efficiency is also discussed 2 1 fenton oxidation 2 1 1 radicals mediated fenton op fenton ops mediated by oh radicals are widely employed in the treatment of organics polluted water li et al 2015 shin et al 2008 the coordination environment of fenton catalysts could affect the redox potentials of fenton ops and binding behaviors with h2o2 leading to different yield of oh kamitani 2021 oh concentration plays an decisive role in fenton op it is worth noting that the existence time of oh in aqueous phase is ultrashort 10 us owing to scavenging by noms this limits the transfer of oh from the generating site to target organics qu et al 2022b zhang et al 2017 because of the short lifetime oh concentration in the bulk phase is low cannot meet the required amount of high efficient fenton ops in organics degradation zeng et al 2014 vast works focus on the improvement of surface catalytic performance tan et al 2022 zhou et al 2020c nevertheless this strategy cannot improve the transfer efficiency of oh from the generated sites to target pollutants li et al 2021b utilizing confined structure as nanoreactor for fenton ops can shorten the mass transfer distance of oh and reduce oh consumption in transfer process for instance magnetic ti3c2 based mxene nanosheets were used to confine nanoscale zero valent iron particles nzvi ti3c2 to catalyze fenton ops for ranitidine degradation ma et al 2021 this confined structure enriched local oh production from h2o2 activation and promoted the embeddedness of ranitidine molecules in the reaction region i e confined lamellar space and then improved the collision frequency of these reactants to achieve high degradation efficiency additionally anodized aluminum oxide aao was used to confine fe3o4 to construct fe3o4 aao nanoreactor with uniformly sized and cylindrical parallel channels fig 1 a zhang et al 2020b in 14 h of fenton ops there were no catalyst deactivation low iron leaching 19 ug l and little ph change 0 05 the half life of para chlorobenzoic acid p cba decomposition was shortened to about 14 s in the fe3o4 aao nanoreactor with pore size 20 nm much less than in the bulk oxidative system with suspended fe3o4 in water 3 2 h the size of confined space has an impact on fenton ops oh concentration confined in the smaller pore range at 20 nm is higher than the pore range at 200 nm leading to faster oxidation reaction the extent of spatial confinement on oh mediated fenton ops kinetics depends on oh concentration and the contact of reactants with oh furthermore the spatial confinement can give fenton ops selectivity the configuration with designed porous materials can block organic molecules larger than the pores which can reduce the catalyst fouling and oh quenching by macromolecular nom sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2021e used zro2 tio2 ceramic membrane cm to embed iron oxychloride feocl which can block the organics with molecular weight larger than 300 kda fig 1b the distance of feocl interlayers is 7 92 å larger than the average size of h2o2 precursor molecules 2 5 å herber and cassell 1982 this enables h2o2 entry to produce oh large surface area available for reaction contributes to the high oh concentration inside cm additionally only a little nom with van der waals diameter 7 92 å can enter feocl cm pores leading to reduced deactivation of oh and feocl sites feocl cm confined the fenton ops within the membrane pores size at 20 nm realizing selective exposure and domain limited oxidation of internal oh to small organics and showed a near complete destruction of organics through single pass treatment 2 1 2 nonradicals mediated fenton like op beside oh radicals mediated fenton ops nonradical pathway is also worthy of attention under spatial confinement yang et al 2019 found a 1o2 mediated iron based fenton like op in a nanoreactor formed by fe2o3 nanoparticles 2 nm confined in the multiwalled carbon nanotube fe2o3 mwcnt with 7 nm inner diameter to explore the effect of spatial confinement fe2o3 nanoparticles were distributed on the mwcnt fe2o3 mwcnt outer surface as another structure the electron spin resonance esr spectra was used to identify the active species generated in various ops oh but no 1o2 were detected in unconfined ops over fe2o3 and fe2o3 mwcnt in contrast nearly no oh but 1o2 were detected in confined fenton ops over fe2o3 mwcnt fig 2 yang et al 2019 moreover the 7 nm size impeded the adsorption of many organic macromolecules into the mwcnt the oxidation rate was linearly proportional to the adsorption affinity of organics on mwcnt inner surface compared to other confined fenton ops table 1 this 1o2 mediated fenton op showed high ph tolerance which can maintain oxidation performance at ph value up to 9 0 spatial confinement inside mwcnts changes the fenton reaction pathway to generate 1o2 but not oh we speculate that there are two stages in the mechanism i two h2o2 molecules are required for the reaction to generate 1o2 in the confined space h2o2 are enriched locally promoting the reaction to generate 1o2 ii electronic state is different in the inner and outer surface of mwcnt the inner surface is electron deficient when confined in mwcnt the conversion of fe iii fe ii that needs the participation of electrons might be inhibited subsequently the reaction of fe ii and h2o2 to generate oh was inhibited 2 2 persulfate oxidation persulfate op including peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 is also an alternative to degrade organic pollutants gao et al 2022 mei et al 2020 wei et al 2022b compared with h2o2 most pms and pds strong oxidants are in the solid form which are easier to be stored and transported qu et al 2022a direct reaction of persulfates with organics is slow to obtain efficient persulfate op activate persulfates to generate reactive species like so4 oh and 1o2 is critical liu et al 2022b apply various catalysts is a commonly used method to active persulfates huang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020a achieving high exposure of active surfaces and edges of catalyst is crucial for persulfates activation xu et al 2022b yi et al 2022a confined structure effectively utilizes the considerable specific surface area to achieve this goal cao et al 2020 and the confinement can realize quick cycling of metals in different valence states like fe iii fe ii cycle wang et al 2020b amounts of persulfate ops have been improved by spatial confinement table 2 chen et al 2019 assembled mos2 nanosheets into a lamellar membrane this two dimensional 2d structure provided large surface area well preserved the active sites mo2 mo6 on surface and shortened the diffusion distance of organics in nano sized interspacings resulting in the increased efficiency of pms activation total degradation of bpa over lamellar mos2 membrane pms system just needs 60 4 ms so4 and oh dominates the oxidation reaction for bisphenol a bpa removal chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a presented a yolk shell structured cotio3 co3o4 with high permeability for guest molecules ions diffusion fig 3 a so4 1o2 and oh were detected via esr in pms activation over cotio3 co3o4 so4 and 1o2 are the dominating reactive species for the oxidation degradation of rhodamine b rhb notably the confined structure also influences the activation pathway of pms in most persulfate ops so4 1o2 and oh are generated and participate in organics oxidation generally pms was activated via the cleavage of o o bond to generate so4 and oh was generated via so4 while 1o2 was generated from the self reaction of so5 chen et al 2019 interestingly it was found that when the space size was reduced to angstrom scale spontaneous dissociation of pms via s o bond cleavage could be promoted to generate more 1o2 meng et al 2022 meng et al 2022 synthesized an angstrom confined co tiox laminar membrane to activate pms for ranitidine degradation fig 3b so4 1o2 and oh are the main reactive oxygen species the adsorption energy eads of pms molecule on co tiox membrane nanochannels increases with the constriction of interlayer free spacing indicating more efficient adsorption dft calculations found the s o bond length increased with the decrease of interlayer free spacing size indicating easier cleavage of s o bond in pms 5 8 å is the critical size value for the spontaneous cleavage of s o bond to generate 1o2 when the confined free spacing size is larger then 5 8 å s o bond in pms was just only stretched but not cleaved besides the angstrom scale confinement enhances the hydrogen bond force between water molecules and co tiox to promote the mass transfer and angstrom confined space improves the electron interaction and effective diffusion of the oxidative system wang et al 2019 such rational design of angstrom confined structure is universal for improving catalytic performance which can be extended to various other membranes constructed by 2d nanomaterials the development of angstrom scale confinement provides breakthroughs for ops in organic pollutants degradation 2 3 photocatalytic oxidation photocatalytic op is also a technique to degrade organics shangguan et al 2022 many works have used spatial confinement to improve the performance of photocatalytic ops table 3 for example confining fe2o3 in hierarchical sio2 tio2 sio2 fe2o3 tio2 sft zhang et al 2020c tio2 nanotube guo et al 2015 gc3n4 zif 8 yuan et al 2021 and mesoporous sb2o3 tio2 yao et al 2021 catalysts showed superior photocatalytic efficiency for organics degradation the generation of photoexcited electrons and holes are of significance to oxidation performance yi et al 2019 the confined structure available for more light absorption is favorable yang et al 2015 used interconnected graphene network to provide confined space to restrict znfe2o4 growth and then highly crystallized graphene znfe2o4 g znfe2o4 photocatalyst was synthesized the interconnected graphene network provided transport channel for photogenerated electrons from znfe2o4 and acted as an electron reservoir to inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes the confined mesoporous structure with ultrasmall grain size promoted the exposure of znfe2o4 crystallized 311 plane and the adsorption of organic pollutants g znfe2o4 can quickly degrade methylene blue mb and the degradation rate reached 1 924 10 7 mol g 1 s 1 ma et al 2022b also fabricated co la decorated g c3n4 nanosheets co la g c3n4 with layer confinement showing outstanding oxygen activation the spatial confinement provided by g c3n4 layers promotes the reactants enrichment and the contact with active sites contributing to high photocatalytic performance for tetracycline tc degradation besides liu et al 2022a prepared a confined pyrite cinder based feocl pyc feocl catalyst that showed good performance on ciprofloxacin cip degradation bai et al 2022 synthesized a confined perylene diimide carbon nanotube pda cnt photocatalyst for remarkably boosted degradation of diclofenac the confinement effect of cnts make pda cnt grow sequentially to form supramolecules electrostatic interaction formed by dispersion forces dominates the stabilization process the conjugation of pda constructed a 3d pathway cnt cnt cnt pda and pda pda which allowed for electrons transfer to the cnt plane that formed an internal electric field to accelerate the transport of photogenerated electrons and holes fig 4 a bai et al 2022 in addition to directly improve the excitation processes of photocatalysts spatial confinement has also been used to alter excitonic effects i e coulomb interactions between photogenerated electrons and holes exciton bound by the coulomb interactions are the dominating photoexcited species that play an important role in molecular oxygen activation qian et al 2020b confinement structure is crucial for excitonic effect wang et al 2017 found the giant electron hole interactions in confined layered structure of bismuth oxybromide and utilized the robust excitonic effect to alter the molecular oxygen activation behavior there is a competitive generation of hot carrier separated electrons and holes and exciton which respectively dominate charge transfer process and energy transfer process charge transfer process requires the adsorption of o2 on photocatalysts to promote electron transfer energy transfer process i e energy transferred from triplet excitons to molecular oxygen is a distance dependent physical process without the requirement for direct contact the hot carriers affect oxygen activation to generate oh o2 and h2o2 while the energy transfer process generates 1o2 via long range dipole dipole coupling fig 4b wang et al 2017 different dominating reactive species are generated 2 4 others i ozone oxidation ozone op is an alternative to treat noms for drinking water owing to its favorable oxidizability and mitigation of membrane fouling capacity gorito et al 2022 liu et al 2020b which has also been applied in the degradation of ibuprofen huang et al 2021b dyes chokshi and ruparelia phenols and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds zhao et al 2021b however the application of ozone op is limited by the low ozone utilization and difficult mass transfer of reactive species spatial confinement can solve these limitations owing to its potential to achieve high exposure of reactive sites and large contact between oxygen radicals and organics he et al 2022 wu et al 2022 a fabricated cm was used to deposit nanoscale fe3o4 catalysts fe3o4 cm to construct a nanoreactor with spatial confinement karnik et al 2005 ozone decomposition on fe3o4 cm surface produced more oh the confined fe3o4 cmnot only showed high efficiency in noms degradation but also reduced membrane fouling and harmful by products like trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids that appeared in chlorine disinfection karnik et al 2005 an interlayer confined 2d mno2 cnt catalytic ozonation membrane was also prepared to remove mb fig 5 a xu et al 2022a i spatial confinement could accelerate the mn ⅳ mn ⅲ cycle contributing to the fast electron transfer to generate oh and o2 ii 2d mno2 tends to provide abundant surface active sites while the interlayer space confined the oxygen radicals and organics in close vicinity besides spatial confinement was utilized to improve the ozone op for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation via anchoring nanosized mn2o3 on ceramic nanofiber membrane mn2o3 cnm yang et al 2022 ozone was mainly decomposed in the confined ceramic nanofiber membrane cnm pores ii electrocatalytic op electrocatalytic oxidation is an environmental friendly method to degrade organic pollutants it uses electrons as the clean reagent additionally h2o2 in cathodes eq 1 and strong oxidative free radicals like oh in anodes eq 2 can be generated by electrocatalysis in situ 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 e o h oh porous cathode with confined space is beneficial for electrocatalytic op on one hand porous structure provides large surface area that can expose more active sites for adsorption and reaction on the other hand a part of solutes will be dissolved when the pore size is shrunken to nanoscale diameter of the soluble hydration solvation sphere zhou et al 2020d partial desolvation could accelerate the electron transfer of porous electrode inside the nanoscale pores and the electro kinetics fu et al 2018 for electrocatalytic op higher exposure of active sites and transfer efficiency of electrons contributes to faster oxidation reaction speed a 3d hierarchical porous carbon cathode tpc 800 cathode was prepared to degrade phenol via electrocatalysis fig 5b zhou et al 2019 most pores of tpc 800 cathode are microporous 2 nm the electrocatalytic oxidation system that uses tpc 800 cathode can degrade 95 41 of phenol 100 mg l in 120 min which is superior to many other cathodes without spatial confinement like reed straw activated carbon 93 06 jin et al 2018 and ceo2 nanographite 93 9 yu et al 2015 iii spontaneous oxidation common advanced ops e g fenton persulfate oxidation photocatalysis electrocatalysis and ozonation in organics degradation show fast reaction but they need the addition of oxidizing agent e g h2o2 pms pds or ozone or external energy e g light thermal or electric energy greatly increasing the application cost compared to them op that can spontaneously occur in natural environment without the demand for chemical reagents or external energy shows better application prospect in organic polluted water treatment clarke et al 2010 kekes et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 spontaneous oxidation based on natural mineral manganese oxide has been applied to the oxidative degradation of many organic pollutants the tailings containing manganese ⅲ oxide can spontaneously oxidize acid azo dyes clarke et al 2010 sodium manganese hydroxide can spontaneously degrade acetaminophen kekes et al 2020 and benzoic acid compounds zhao et al 2020 generally manganese oxide spontaneously degrades organics by inducing intermolecular coupling reaction and adsorbs these pollutants and their degradation intermediates dec and bollag 1995 however these spontaneous ops are so slow that cannot meet the application requirement of efficient treatment on organic polluted water using acids to adjust the solution ph to acid stage can accelerate the spontaneous op wang and cheng 2015 but acidic ph is not suitable for water treatment spatial confinement is an alternative to address the issue wang et al 2021c at neutrality ph the surface of manganese oxides is negatively charged owing to the zero charge point 4 6 husnain et al 2020 when manganese oxides are confined in a nanoscale space protons acting as the counterions enter the confined space leading to a ph decrease inside the confined space xiao et al 2022 increasing local proton concentration around manganese oxides is the key of spatial confinement to improve the spontaneous op on organics degradation zhang et al 2021c used cm to construct confined space to load mn3o4 which can effectively degrade chlorophenol fig 5c mean field donnan theory indicated the ph inside the pore of mn3o4 cm dropped from 7 0 to 5 2 when the pore size was decreased to 5 nm molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the concentration of protons h3o was higher on the pore surface than in the bulk aqueous phase on the other hand the available surface area of the nanoreactor 5 nm exposed to the volume of treated water is about 400 times higher than the batch reactor mn3o4 powder dispersed in the treated water the decreased ph value and larger exposed available surface play important roles in promoting the oxidative reaction rate moreover mn3o4 cm can maintain its oxidative activity in complex environment these confined spontaneous ops are environmental friendly because manganese oxides are natural minerals with low ecotoxicity and no demand for chemical reagents that may cause secondary pollution nevertheless to evaluate the risk of spatial confinement mediated ops the detection of transformation products is indispensable secondary pollution is rather caused by the transformation products of the primary organic pollutants 3 features of spatial confinement in ops based on above discussion three features of spatial confinement in ops are concluded quick proton and charge transfer changed molecular structure and behavior and new active sites fig 6 local enrichment of protons or charges might enhance the interaction between reactants and confined surface leading to the ordered molecular behavior meng et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c this favors the enrichment of organic molecules and oxidant molecules promoting ops from thermodynamic perspective transport and enrichment of protons and charges would result in an electric potential difference in the inner outer surface and tends to form new reaction sites wang et al 2021c these could reduce the activation energy barrier or change reaction pathway improving ops kinetically yang et al 2019 the phase behavior of matter in confined space are complex in this section we elaborate on each feature with analyzing the phase behavior 3 1 quick transport of proton and charge proton and charge transfer is a ubiquitous component of various chemical reactions which exquisitely depends on matter structure and transport distance wraight 2006 spatial confinement can promote the transfer process ultrafast proton transfer was achieved in confined hydrophobic nanochannels constructed by cnts tunuguntla et al 2016 the inner surface of cnts weakly interact with water molecules to form one dimensional hydrogen bonded water chains lee chang et al 2010 protons are transferred along the hydrogen bonded water chains which shows fast transfer rate tunuguntla et al 2016 also found that the proton transfer rate was higher in 0 8 nm diameter cnt than in 1 5 nm indicating the scale of confined space has an influence on proton transfer protons transfer may cause the change of ph locally for example protons acting as counterions enter the space that confined manganese oxides zero charge point 4 6 in neutral conditions leading to a ph decrease inside the confined space husnain et al 2020 the protons concentration on the surface of confined pore is higher than in the bulk aqueous phase and ph value inside the pore is reduced xiao et al 2022 the reduced ph value inside the pore is negatively correlated with the scale of confined space owing to the positive correlation between charge density in volume and the decreased pore size the interaction of charge transfer with medium polarization has an impact on proton transfer the distance that proton can transfer is less than a covalent bond length so a long distance proton transfer requires persistent charge rearrangement krishtalik 2000 in most cases substantial charge density redistribution accompanies with proton transfer zhang et al 2021a the redistribution of charge on the surface of confined space will alter the local electron distribution tunuguntla et al 2016 in electrons redistribution process the electric potential inside the space could be enhanced by overlapping the double electric layers of charged surfaces wang et al 2021c for instance cnt with curvature walls show unique π electron distribution at the inner outer surface the π electrons in inner wall surface were transferred to outer surface causing an electric potential difference pan and bao 2011 the different electric potential influenced the charge transfer and redistribution and the catalyst confined in cnts showed altered electronic states surface potential energy and catalytic activity shifa and vomiero 2019 spatial confinement also altered the electron transfer in nanoporous carbon electrodes li et al 2017 and confining sulfur in narrow diameter cnt s cnts revealed enhanced electrochemical reactivity fu et al 2018 electron density difference maps δρ ρs cnt ρcnt showed a dynamic visualization of electronic rearrangement which meant electrons transfer from the encapsulated sulfur to surrounding cnt dynamically fu et al 2018 3 2 change on molecular structure and behavior when molecules are confined in an ultrasmall space molecular structure will be changed zhang et al 2021d for instance sorin and pande 2006 found that protein helices were denatured in narrow cnts ascribed to the reduced free energy cost of hydrogen bonding between confined water and proteins orientational structure and local ordering of benzene molecules were also altered when they were confined in 4 85 7 90 å micropores of zeolite mobil crystalline material 41 mcm 41 compared to in the bulk phase falkowska et al 2018 some organics like ibuprofen and benzoic acid in mesopores of mcm 41 was in a highly mobile state azais et al 2010 skorupska et al 2014 additionally argyris et al 2010 found that the distribution and mobility of ions e g na cs and cl was determined by the unique structure and dynamics of water under spatial confinement the hydration number of ions was altered by spatial confinement affecting the reaction of hydrated ions with the adsorption sites zhang et al 2021b xue et al 2022 spatial confinement show the ability to promote the ordering of molecules like the sequential growth of pda in pda cnt bai et al 2022 the ordered behavior eliminates the diffusion limitation occurring in the bulk as well as helps reactants get close to reactive sites more easily which can improve ops efficiently zhang et al 2021d for example the process where n boc l amino acid molecules react with amine monolayer to form amide bonds normally needs the assistance of high temperature and high pressure sullivan et al 2004 zhou et al 2018 found that spatial confinement could enable the reaction of amide bonds formation to occur at normal temperature and pressure lipidic cubic mesophases was used to be a host for reaction and confined space was formed in the continuous lipid bilayer in the confined space the n boc l amino acid molecules were forcedly placed close to amine monolayer furthermore reactants get easier access to active sites that uniformly distributed on the interface between lipid bilayer and water channels 3 3 creation of new active sites confining oxidation catalysts in nanoscale space can achieve the redistribution and enrichment of reaction active sites for ops dutta and lee 2021 li et al 2020 grosso giordano et al 2019 explored the effect of confined tiiv active sites on olefin epoxidation catalysis spatial confinement led to the dynamic redistribution of tiiv active sites and the transition state structures formed by association of reactants at active sites became easier owing to the reduced entropic barriers compared to that in unconfined space the redistribution of tiiv active sites in confined space is manifested by altering the metal coordination environment paolucci et al 2017 cirujano et al 2017 used solid state crystallization to confine metal organic framework mof nanocrystals in mesoporous materials compared to the bulk mof spatial confinement enriched the coordination vacancies at outer nanocrystal surface and resulted in higher exposure of active sites furthermore various studies found that nanocrystals with quantum confinement revealed surface autocatalytic effects wu et al 2009 and provided enriched active sites jia et al 2021 additionally the unsaturated active sites can be retained in confined structure which could promote electron transfer hu et al 2020a for example coordinatively unsaturated iron sites were confined in graphene matrix to catalyze the oxidation of benzene deng et al 2015 the formation of feo intermediate structure is a key step for benzene oxidation fu et al 2010 used silica to confine the coordinately unsaturated ferrous sites confinement effect stabilizes the unsaturated ferrous sites via strong adhesion between ferrous oxides and metal substrates zhang et al 2020a controlled the unsaturated nitrogen coordination at twisted surfaces in porous single crystals to create ordered active sites coordinatively unsaturated metal nitrogen active sites were confined on porous nitride single crystals surface 4 environmental influences in actual application of spatial confinement mediated ops environmental influences cannot be ignored based on above discussion it can be found there is a tight connection between confinement features and environmental influences in ops the application of spatial confinement brings about a change on ph and behavior of organics and ions in turn environmental ph co exist organics and ions also affect the application of spatial confinement environmental ph plays an important role in the transport of protons and charge the electrostatic interaction between the reactants and reactive surface is affected by the co existed organics and inorganic ions falkowska et al 2018 in this section environmental influences are studied with analyzing their intrinsic connection with confinement features in ops fig 7 4 1 environmental ph transport of protons and charges affects environmental ph while environmental ph influences the function of spatial confinement on ops improvement it was found that protons can quickly transferred under spatial confinement shi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b environmental ph and the ph at point of zero charge determine proton transfer process when environmental ph is less than the zero charge point of catalyst the catalyst surface is negative charged zhang et al 2021c at this point protons acting as the counterions transfer to the negative charged surface to achieve interfacial charge balance macha et al 2019 furthermore ph alters the charge distribution of catalyst surface which affects the adsorption of organics for example yao et al 2021 found a negative correlation between ph value and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa oxidation efficiency presumably because the reduced adsorption pfoa the acid dissociation constant is 2 8 is more likely to show deprotonation state and catalyst surface tends to be negatively charged with the increased ph value the adsorption of deprotonated pfoa on negatively charged catalyst surface is weak in addition environmental ph directly affects the decomposition of oxidants generally the activity of o3 is weakened for ops in acidic ph yang et al 2020 the decomposition rate of h2o2 and pms are higher in acidic ph because h2o2 molecules tend to be decomposed to o2 and h2o while pms are decomposed to so4 2 o2 and h2o in alkaline condition yang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 for example in the core shell fe3o4 pedot h2o2 system decomposition rate of h2o2 at ph 4 5 was higher than ph 7 5 and 9 0 shin et al 2008 in the nzvi ti3c2 h2o2 system ranitidine removal achieved 92 7 at ph 3 0 72 2 at ph 8 0 but only 37 2 at ph 9 0 ma et al 2021 higher ph shows stronger inhibition on h2o2 decomposition li et al 2021a found both the strongly acid ph 1 0 and highly alkali ph 11 0 were disadvantage for rhb degradation in the cotio3 co3o4 pms system pms decomposition was low in strongly acidic environment while the deprotonation of pms to generate so5 2 easily occurred in highly alkaline condition although oxidants decomposition is reduced the performance of most spatial confinement mediated ops is still considerable this is because the transfer distance was shortened and the contact between reactants and active sites was enhanced in confined structure besides the influence of ph is negligible for nonradical pathway mediated ops for example fe2o3 mwcnt shows good ph stability for oxidation of mb yang et al 2019 4 2 organic matter in ops there is a competition between co existing organic matter and target organics for active sites and reactive species for example mei et al 2020 found humic acid ubiquitous organics would shield the active sites and competitively consume radicals in pms ops under spatial confinement the competition could be reduced because some confined structure can block the organics with large molecular weight zhang et al 2021e and the varied structure of confined water may deplete hydrogen bonding of water which would lead to a stronger hydrogen bond interaction with organics to achieve effective adsorption to promote reaction oh et al 2019 zhao et al 2021a however the adsorption is non selective and effective for both target organic pollutants and co exist organic matter the competition still exists and cannot be ignored in ops ma et al 2017 4 3 inorganic ions spatial confinement can change the distribution and dynamics of ions via altering the structure and properties of water including hydration number of ions hydrogen bond network and even the entropy enthalpy and free energy of water pascal tod et al 2011 chakraborty et al 2017 tang et al 2022 in turn owing to the unique properties of confined water molecules hydrated ions may influence the charge distribution of confined structure via forming electrostatic binding or hydrogen bond in addition ions can quench free radicals as a consequence inorganic ions tend to have a negative effect on most radicals mediated ops generally co3 2 hco3 cl and no3 ubiquitous ions in water matrix could quench radicals to generate less reactive radicals including co3 hco3 cl and no3 for example mei et al 2020 found cl and no3 inhibited mb degradation via quenching the generated so4 and oh in the fe3o4 mgsio3 pms system however co3 2 promoted mb degradation and the promotion was ascribed to the quick reaction of the generated co3 with electron rich compounds n ch3 2 of mb mei et al 2020 notably inorganic ions have little effect on nonradical 1o2 besides some inorganic ions can complex with metal species which could greatly reduce the formation of high valent metal oxo species like the impeded formation of high valent iron oxo species by h2po4 li et al 2019a li et al 2021a also found hpo4 2 can bind to cobalt sites which inhibit rhb degradation in cotio3 co3o4 pms system 5 conclusions and perspectives functional nanoporous materials that possess spatial confinement have been used as the host oxidation mediator or reaction reservoirs to catalyze ops for organic pollutants removal from water at a micro level the confined ultrasmall space restricts the electronic motion and then alters the electronic properties and structure that may lead to quantum mutation as well as change the transition state to lower the activation energy barriers sun et al 2013 wang et al 2020a additionally charges redistribution on the inner surface would result from spatial confinement which will change the reaction state of the active sites and benefit the accumulation of excess charges around the active sites leading to the enhanced adsorption and oxidation reaction farnesi camellone et al 2016 in macro view space confinement enables the surface inside pores with charge contrary to the target pollutants or oxidative agents to improve their interaction it enhances reactants enrichment or products discharge to accelerate the oxidation reaction zhang et al 2019 and even alters the reaction kinetics by changing the reaction pathway prieto et al 2021 the organics and short lived radicals are enriched locally owing to the reduced mass transfer distance and lower consumption of available reactants the interactions between confined space and either oxidizing agent catalysts or organics essentially alter the redox reaction energy diagram and reaction pathway additionally nanoporous structure providing spatial confinement enables the materials to possess high surface area and exposure of active sites this is beneficial for the interaction e g electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond of catalysts surface and reactants as well as the stabilization of catalyst on the host material contributing to efficient ops the chemical and physical processes in the confined space depend on the chemical characters of treated water and surface properties of nano space like surface electrostatic potential kovaleva et al 2018 to expand the application of spatial confinement mediated ops the following aspects should be noted i unique water molecules behavior water molecules show different behavior in confined space gilles et al 2016 beaumont et al 2021 wang et al 2021a for example water molecules interact with inner pores of hydrophobic cnts to form hydrogen bonded water chains and the water chains can accelerate proton and charge transfer lee chang et al 2010 additionally the changed properties and dynamics of confined water will affect the behavior of co existed organics and inorganic ions de aquino et al 2019 influence of spatial confinement on solvation status that may affect the adsorption and oxidation reaction needs further discussion ii secondary pollution owing to the added chemical reactants and incomplete degradation of organic pollutants secondary pollution often occurs in ops the addition of chemical reactants needs to be control more importantly the transformation products should be detected and identified to get the possible reaction pathways the toxicity test and risk evaluation of transformation products is indispensable besides potential pollution caused by the added catalysts is also a noteworthy issue for example mof catalysts were constructed by the coordination of metal and organics theoretically strong acid alkali or high temperature can promote the decomposition of mof which might generate harmful organics and the recycling of catalysts remains a concern for large scale application iii advanced test methods and fundamental research spatial confinement effect are mostly studied via computational simulation tunuguntla et al 2016 molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore the process that spatial confinement denatures protein helices sorin and pande 2006 molecular dynamics simulations combined with interfacial charge balance theory were used to study proton density redistribution zhang et al 2021c advanced characterization and test methods are lacked moreover owing to the complexity of water matrix and the difficulty of transition state capture and identification in ops relevant studies on the effect of spatial confinement on the transition states are inadequate qian et al 2020a zhang et al 2021d to study spatial confinement effect on ops more accurately more fundamental research is needed iv controllable cost various materials are utilized as the support for spatial confinement mediated ops like cnts mofs and natural porous zeolites the selection of supporting materials to provide confined structure is important there are many aspects to be consider such as the match degree between confined structure and substrate the stability and applicability of materials in various conditions and production cost furthermore the cost of confined catalyst in supporting materials also needs control from the aspect of actual application the economic efficiency of spatial confinement mediated ops is very important therefore the selected catalyst and supporting materials should be rich in resources cheap in price stable in property and eco friendly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14947,organic pollutants removal from water is pressing owing to the great demand for clean water oxidation processes ops are the commonly used method however the efficiency of most ops is limited owing to the poor mass transfer process spatial confinement is a burgeoning way to solve this limitation by use of nanoreactor spatial confinement in ops would i alter the transport characteristics of protons and charges ii bring about molecular orientation and rearrangement iii cause the dynamic redistribution of active sites in catalyst and reduce the entropic barrier that is high in unconfined space so far spatial confinement has been utilized for various ops such as fenton persulfate and photocatalytic oxidation a comprehensive summary and discussion on the fundamental mechanisms of spatial confinement mediated ops is needed herein the application performance and mechanisms of spatial confinement mediated ops are overviewed firstly subsequently the features of spatial confinement and their effects on ops are discussed in detail furthermore environmental influences including environmental ph organic matter and inorganic ions are studied with analyzing their intrinsic connection with the features of spatial confinement in ops lastly challenges and future development direction of spatial confinement mediated ops are proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

natural organic matter aao anodized aluminum oxide cnt carbon nanotube mwcnt multiwalled carbon nanotube data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction large amount of persistent organics released into surface and ground water cause serious pollution and pose a significant threat to living organisms oxidation processes ops are frequently used for organics removal song et al 2022 yang et al 2020 organics are attacked by the oxidizing radicals generated in ops like hydroxyl radicals oh 2 8 v vs she and singlet oxygen 1o2 1 1 v vs she yi et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 however the generation of radicals is slow zhang et al 2022 and only a few radicals participate in organics degradation li et al 2022 great efforts have been made to overcome these restrictions such as adding cocatalyst increasing oxidants concentration e g peroxymonosulfate and h2o2 or introducing external energy e g solar thermal and electric energy wei et al 2022a nevertheless these strategies could not achieve the satisfactory efficiency of ops in actual wastewater treatment due to poor mass transfer process yi et al 2022b therefore the broad application of ops in practical settings is restricted li et al 2019b as a means to accelerate the ops spatial confinement has attracted much attention in recent years shang et al 2022 when the size of spatial restriction is at nanometer scale or smaller known as spatial confinement the phase behavior of matter in confined space will be different from in the bulk phase which has a great effect on oxidation reaction in the beginning traditional spatial restriction at nanometer scale was utilized to improve ops materials with special scaffolds contribute to multiple confined structures including holes cavities or well defined structures e g tubes or layered structure with the development of nanotechnology spatial confinement has been extended to the atomic level restriction like unsaturated coordination of atomic species lin et al 2020 spatial confinement shortens reactant diffusion distance to achieve faster mass and heat transfer faucher et al 2019 and enhances covalent and noncovalent interaction between the guest molecules and the reaction surface especially those distance dependent intermolecular forces like electrostatic interaction chen et al 2014 moreover by enhancing the interaction spatial confinement further promotes their individual behavior like accumulation distribution and binding zhou et al 2020b these contribute to the enrichment of reactants which promotes oxidation reaction thermodynamically the size of restricted space plays an important role in the confinement effect for ops improvement when op is confined in a space with the size decreased to several nanometers or even small in addition to enrichment of reactants the electronic transport characteristics could be altered obviously leading to the change of oxidation system especially the valence electron structure which may even contribute to the quantum mutation ma et al 2022a rajadell et al 2017 consequently the oxidation reaction could be improved thermodynamically and kinetically and the improvement is obvious for instance the reaction kinetics of confined fenton op inside nanoscale 20 nm channels improved 820 times compared to the unconfined fenton op zhang et al 2020b on one hand the confined space enhances the utilization efficiency of enriched reactive radicals in ops the generated reactive radicals are easily quenched by ubiquitous natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate carbonate and other substances existing in environment leading to ultrashort lifetimes 10 6 10 9 s and transfer distance chen et al 2019 it was reported that oh radicals generated from catalyst surface would be consumed within 25 nm of mass transfer distance in aqueous phase thus 25 nm is the critical size to optimize the confinement effect zhang et al 2020b on the other hand the energy barriers of oxidation reaction could be reduced under spatial confinement panić et al 2018 spatial confinement also makes the solid electron donor receptor more active ding et al 2018 and accelerates electron transport by regulating the surface electron properties chen et al 2017 these enable spatial confinement to adjust the reaction kinetics to achieve efficient ops for spatial confinement mediated ops the precise match between the size shape of confined space and substrate is of great significance additionally the nature of oxidation catalysts the hydration properties of pollutant environment ph and redox potential also affect the ops hu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a the ops are elusive under spatial confinement using spatial confinement to promote ops must combine fundamental research with technology applications the relationship between the differences made by spatial confinement and their implications in ops for organics removal needs systematical illustration in this review the application of spatial confinement in ops for organics removal is summarized firstly subsequently the features of spatial confinement and their effects on ops are discussed furthermore environmental influences are studied with analyzing their intrinsic connection with the features of spatial confinement in ops lastly the challenges and future development of spatial confinement mediated ops in actual wastewater treatment are proposed 2 application of spatial confinement in oxidation process amounts of ops have been improved by use of spatial confinement including fenton op persulfate op photocatalytic op and others like ozone electrocaltalysis and spontaneous ops materials with various structures such as holes cavities or well defined structures have been used to provide confined structure the confined structure and its match degree with substrates have great effects on the performance of ops the effects are diverse in different ops which is investigated with analyzing concrete ops in this section the causes of confinement for the variation of reaction efficiency is also discussed 2 1 fenton oxidation 2 1 1 radicals mediated fenton op fenton ops mediated by oh radicals are widely employed in the treatment of organics polluted water li et al 2015 shin et al 2008 the coordination environment of fenton catalysts could affect the redox potentials of fenton ops and binding behaviors with h2o2 leading to different yield of oh kamitani 2021 oh concentration plays an decisive role in fenton op it is worth noting that the existence time of oh in aqueous phase is ultrashort 10 us owing to scavenging by noms this limits the transfer of oh from the generating site to target organics qu et al 2022b zhang et al 2017 because of the short lifetime oh concentration in the bulk phase is low cannot meet the required amount of high efficient fenton ops in organics degradation zeng et al 2014 vast works focus on the improvement of surface catalytic performance tan et al 2022 zhou et al 2020c nevertheless this strategy cannot improve the transfer efficiency of oh from the generated sites to target pollutants li et al 2021b utilizing confined structure as nanoreactor for fenton ops can shorten the mass transfer distance of oh and reduce oh consumption in transfer process for instance magnetic ti3c2 based mxene nanosheets were used to confine nanoscale zero valent iron particles nzvi ti3c2 to catalyze fenton ops for ranitidine degradation ma et al 2021 this confined structure enriched local oh production from h2o2 activation and promoted the embeddedness of ranitidine molecules in the reaction region i e confined lamellar space and then improved the collision frequency of these reactants to achieve high degradation efficiency additionally anodized aluminum oxide aao was used to confine fe3o4 to construct fe3o4 aao nanoreactor with uniformly sized and cylindrical parallel channels fig 1 a zhang et al 2020b in 14 h of fenton ops there were no catalyst deactivation low iron leaching 19 ug l and little ph change 0 05 the half life of para chlorobenzoic acid p cba decomposition was shortened to about 14 s in the fe3o4 aao nanoreactor with pore size 20 nm much less than in the bulk oxidative system with suspended fe3o4 in water 3 2 h the size of confined space has an impact on fenton ops oh concentration confined in the smaller pore range at 20 nm is higher than the pore range at 200 nm leading to faster oxidation reaction the extent of spatial confinement on oh mediated fenton ops kinetics depends on oh concentration and the contact of reactants with oh furthermore the spatial confinement can give fenton ops selectivity the configuration with designed porous materials can block organic molecules larger than the pores which can reduce the catalyst fouling and oh quenching by macromolecular nom sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2021e used zro2 tio2 ceramic membrane cm to embed iron oxychloride feocl which can block the organics with molecular weight larger than 300 kda fig 1b the distance of feocl interlayers is 7 92 å larger than the average size of h2o2 precursor molecules 2 5 å herber and cassell 1982 this enables h2o2 entry to produce oh large surface area available for reaction contributes to the high oh concentration inside cm additionally only a little nom with van der waals diameter 7 92 å can enter feocl cm pores leading to reduced deactivation of oh and feocl sites feocl cm confined the fenton ops within the membrane pores size at 20 nm realizing selective exposure and domain limited oxidation of internal oh to small organics and showed a near complete destruction of organics through single pass treatment 2 1 2 nonradicals mediated fenton like op beside oh radicals mediated fenton ops nonradical pathway is also worthy of attention under spatial confinement yang et al 2019 found a 1o2 mediated iron based fenton like op in a nanoreactor formed by fe2o3 nanoparticles 2 nm confined in the multiwalled carbon nanotube fe2o3 mwcnt with 7 nm inner diameter to explore the effect of spatial confinement fe2o3 nanoparticles were distributed on the mwcnt fe2o3 mwcnt outer surface as another structure the electron spin resonance esr spectra was used to identify the active species generated in various ops oh but no 1o2 were detected in unconfined ops over fe2o3 and fe2o3 mwcnt in contrast nearly no oh but 1o2 were detected in confined fenton ops over fe2o3 mwcnt fig 2 yang et al 2019 moreover the 7 nm size impeded the adsorption of many organic macromolecules into the mwcnt the oxidation rate was linearly proportional to the adsorption affinity of organics on mwcnt inner surface compared to other confined fenton ops table 1 this 1o2 mediated fenton op showed high ph tolerance which can maintain oxidation performance at ph value up to 9 0 spatial confinement inside mwcnts changes the fenton reaction pathway to generate 1o2 but not oh we speculate that there are two stages in the mechanism i two h2o2 molecules are required for the reaction to generate 1o2 in the confined space h2o2 are enriched locally promoting the reaction to generate 1o2 ii electronic state is different in the inner and outer surface of mwcnt the inner surface is electron deficient when confined in mwcnt the conversion of fe iii fe ii that needs the participation of electrons might be inhibited subsequently the reaction of fe ii and h2o2 to generate oh was inhibited 2 2 persulfate oxidation persulfate op including peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 is also an alternative to degrade organic pollutants gao et al 2022 mei et al 2020 wei et al 2022b compared with h2o2 most pms and pds strong oxidants are in the solid form which are easier to be stored and transported qu et al 2022a direct reaction of persulfates with organics is slow to obtain efficient persulfate op activate persulfates to generate reactive species like so4 oh and 1o2 is critical liu et al 2022b apply various catalysts is a commonly used method to active persulfates huang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020a achieving high exposure of active surfaces and edges of catalyst is crucial for persulfates activation xu et al 2022b yi et al 2022a confined structure effectively utilizes the considerable specific surface area to achieve this goal cao et al 2020 and the confinement can realize quick cycling of metals in different valence states like fe iii fe ii cycle wang et al 2020b amounts of persulfate ops have been improved by spatial confinement table 2 chen et al 2019 assembled mos2 nanosheets into a lamellar membrane this two dimensional 2d structure provided large surface area well preserved the active sites mo2 mo6 on surface and shortened the diffusion distance of organics in nano sized interspacings resulting in the increased efficiency of pms activation total degradation of bpa over lamellar mos2 membrane pms system just needs 60 4 ms so4 and oh dominates the oxidation reaction for bisphenol a bpa removal chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a presented a yolk shell structured cotio3 co3o4 with high permeability for guest molecules ions diffusion fig 3 a so4 1o2 and oh were detected via esr in pms activation over cotio3 co3o4 so4 and 1o2 are the dominating reactive species for the oxidation degradation of rhodamine b rhb notably the confined structure also influences the activation pathway of pms in most persulfate ops so4 1o2 and oh are generated and participate in organics oxidation generally pms was activated via the cleavage of o o bond to generate so4 and oh was generated via so4 while 1o2 was generated from the self reaction of so5 chen et al 2019 interestingly it was found that when the space size was reduced to angstrom scale spontaneous dissociation of pms via s o bond cleavage could be promoted to generate more 1o2 meng et al 2022 meng et al 2022 synthesized an angstrom confined co tiox laminar membrane to activate pms for ranitidine degradation fig 3b so4 1o2 and oh are the main reactive oxygen species the adsorption energy eads of pms molecule on co tiox membrane nanochannels increases with the constriction of interlayer free spacing indicating more efficient adsorption dft calculations found the s o bond length increased with the decrease of interlayer free spacing size indicating easier cleavage of s o bond in pms 5 8 å is the critical size value for the spontaneous cleavage of s o bond to generate 1o2 when the confined free spacing size is larger then 5 8 å s o bond in pms was just only stretched but not cleaved besides the angstrom scale confinement enhances the hydrogen bond force between water molecules and co tiox to promote the mass transfer and angstrom confined space improves the electron interaction and effective diffusion of the oxidative system wang et al 2019 such rational design of angstrom confined structure is universal for improving catalytic performance which can be extended to various other membranes constructed by 2d nanomaterials the development of angstrom scale confinement provides breakthroughs for ops in organic pollutants degradation 2 3 photocatalytic oxidation photocatalytic op is also a technique to degrade organics shangguan et al 2022 many works have used spatial confinement to improve the performance of photocatalytic ops table 3 for example confining fe2o3 in hierarchical sio2 tio2 sio2 fe2o3 tio2 sft zhang et al 2020c tio2 nanotube guo et al 2015 gc3n4 zif 8 yuan et al 2021 and mesoporous sb2o3 tio2 yao et al 2021 catalysts showed superior photocatalytic efficiency for organics degradation the generation of photoexcited electrons and holes are of significance to oxidation performance yi et al 2019 the confined structure available for more light absorption is favorable yang et al 2015 used interconnected graphene network to provide confined space to restrict znfe2o4 growth and then highly crystallized graphene znfe2o4 g znfe2o4 photocatalyst was synthesized the interconnected graphene network provided transport channel for photogenerated electrons from znfe2o4 and acted as an electron reservoir to inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes the confined mesoporous structure with ultrasmall grain size promoted the exposure of znfe2o4 crystallized 311 plane and the adsorption of organic pollutants g znfe2o4 can quickly degrade methylene blue mb and the degradation rate reached 1 924 10 7 mol g 1 s 1 ma et al 2022b also fabricated co la decorated g c3n4 nanosheets co la g c3n4 with layer confinement showing outstanding oxygen activation the spatial confinement provided by g c3n4 layers promotes the reactants enrichment and the contact with active sites contributing to high photocatalytic performance for tetracycline tc degradation besides liu et al 2022a prepared a confined pyrite cinder based feocl pyc feocl catalyst that showed good performance on ciprofloxacin cip degradation bai et al 2022 synthesized a confined perylene diimide carbon nanotube pda cnt photocatalyst for remarkably boosted degradation of diclofenac the confinement effect of cnts make pda cnt grow sequentially to form supramolecules electrostatic interaction formed by dispersion forces dominates the stabilization process the conjugation of pda constructed a 3d pathway cnt cnt cnt pda and pda pda which allowed for electrons transfer to the cnt plane that formed an internal electric field to accelerate the transport of photogenerated electrons and holes fig 4 a bai et al 2022 in addition to directly improve the excitation processes of photocatalysts spatial confinement has also been used to alter excitonic effects i e coulomb interactions between photogenerated electrons and holes exciton bound by the coulomb interactions are the dominating photoexcited species that play an important role in molecular oxygen activation qian et al 2020b confinement structure is crucial for excitonic effect wang et al 2017 found the giant electron hole interactions in confined layered structure of bismuth oxybromide and utilized the robust excitonic effect to alter the molecular oxygen activation behavior there is a competitive generation of hot carrier separated electrons and holes and exciton which respectively dominate charge transfer process and energy transfer process charge transfer process requires the adsorption of o2 on photocatalysts to promote electron transfer energy transfer process i e energy transferred from triplet excitons to molecular oxygen is a distance dependent physical process without the requirement for direct contact the hot carriers affect oxygen activation to generate oh o2 and h2o2 while the energy transfer process generates 1o2 via long range dipole dipole coupling fig 4b wang et al 2017 different dominating reactive species are generated 2 4 others i ozone oxidation ozone op is an alternative to treat noms for drinking water owing to its favorable oxidizability and mitigation of membrane fouling capacity gorito et al 2022 liu et al 2020b which has also been applied in the degradation of ibuprofen huang et al 2021b dyes chokshi and ruparelia phenols and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds zhao et al 2021b however the application of ozone op is limited by the low ozone utilization and difficult mass transfer of reactive species spatial confinement can solve these limitations owing to its potential to achieve high exposure of reactive sites and large contact between oxygen radicals and organics he et al 2022 wu et al 2022 a fabricated cm was used to deposit nanoscale fe3o4 catalysts fe3o4 cm to construct a nanoreactor with spatial confinement karnik et al 2005 ozone decomposition on fe3o4 cm surface produced more oh the confined fe3o4 cmnot only showed high efficiency in noms degradation but also reduced membrane fouling and harmful by products like trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids that appeared in chlorine disinfection karnik et al 2005 an interlayer confined 2d mno2 cnt catalytic ozonation membrane was also prepared to remove mb fig 5 a xu et al 2022a i spatial confinement could accelerate the mn ⅳ mn ⅲ cycle contributing to the fast electron transfer to generate oh and o2 ii 2d mno2 tends to provide abundant surface active sites while the interlayer space confined the oxygen radicals and organics in close vicinity besides spatial confinement was utilized to improve the ozone op for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation via anchoring nanosized mn2o3 on ceramic nanofiber membrane mn2o3 cnm yang et al 2022 ozone was mainly decomposed in the confined ceramic nanofiber membrane cnm pores ii electrocatalytic op electrocatalytic oxidation is an environmental friendly method to degrade organic pollutants it uses electrons as the clean reagent additionally h2o2 in cathodes eq 1 and strong oxidative free radicals like oh in anodes eq 2 can be generated by electrocatalysis in situ 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 e o h oh porous cathode with confined space is beneficial for electrocatalytic op on one hand porous structure provides large surface area that can expose more active sites for adsorption and reaction on the other hand a part of solutes will be dissolved when the pore size is shrunken to nanoscale diameter of the soluble hydration solvation sphere zhou et al 2020d partial desolvation could accelerate the electron transfer of porous electrode inside the nanoscale pores and the electro kinetics fu et al 2018 for electrocatalytic op higher exposure of active sites and transfer efficiency of electrons contributes to faster oxidation reaction speed a 3d hierarchical porous carbon cathode tpc 800 cathode was prepared to degrade phenol via electrocatalysis fig 5b zhou et al 2019 most pores of tpc 800 cathode are microporous 2 nm the electrocatalytic oxidation system that uses tpc 800 cathode can degrade 95 41 of phenol 100 mg l in 120 min which is superior to many other cathodes without spatial confinement like reed straw activated carbon 93 06 jin et al 2018 and ceo2 nanographite 93 9 yu et al 2015 iii spontaneous oxidation common advanced ops e g fenton persulfate oxidation photocatalysis electrocatalysis and ozonation in organics degradation show fast reaction but they need the addition of oxidizing agent e g h2o2 pms pds or ozone or external energy e g light thermal or electric energy greatly increasing the application cost compared to them op that can spontaneously occur in natural environment without the demand for chemical reagents or external energy shows better application prospect in organic polluted water treatment clarke et al 2010 kekes et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 spontaneous oxidation based on natural mineral manganese oxide has been applied to the oxidative degradation of many organic pollutants the tailings containing manganese ⅲ oxide can spontaneously oxidize acid azo dyes clarke et al 2010 sodium manganese hydroxide can spontaneously degrade acetaminophen kekes et al 2020 and benzoic acid compounds zhao et al 2020 generally manganese oxide spontaneously degrades organics by inducing intermolecular coupling reaction and adsorbs these pollutants and their degradation intermediates dec and bollag 1995 however these spontaneous ops are so slow that cannot meet the application requirement of efficient treatment on organic polluted water using acids to adjust the solution ph to acid stage can accelerate the spontaneous op wang and cheng 2015 but acidic ph is not suitable for water treatment spatial confinement is an alternative to address the issue wang et al 2021c at neutrality ph the surface of manganese oxides is negatively charged owing to the zero charge point 4 6 husnain et al 2020 when manganese oxides are confined in a nanoscale space protons acting as the counterions enter the confined space leading to a ph decrease inside the confined space xiao et al 2022 increasing local proton concentration around manganese oxides is the key of spatial confinement to improve the spontaneous op on organics degradation zhang et al 2021c used cm to construct confined space to load mn3o4 which can effectively degrade chlorophenol fig 5c mean field donnan theory indicated the ph inside the pore of mn3o4 cm dropped from 7 0 to 5 2 when the pore size was decreased to 5 nm molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the concentration of protons h3o was higher on the pore surface than in the bulk aqueous phase on the other hand the available surface area of the nanoreactor 5 nm exposed to the volume of treated water is about 400 times higher than the batch reactor mn3o4 powder dispersed in the treated water the decreased ph value and larger exposed available surface play important roles in promoting the oxidative reaction rate moreover mn3o4 cm can maintain its oxidative activity in complex environment these confined spontaneous ops are environmental friendly because manganese oxides are natural minerals with low ecotoxicity and no demand for chemical reagents that may cause secondary pollution nevertheless to evaluate the risk of spatial confinement mediated ops the detection of transformation products is indispensable secondary pollution is rather caused by the transformation products of the primary organic pollutants 3 features of spatial confinement in ops based on above discussion three features of spatial confinement in ops are concluded quick proton and charge transfer changed molecular structure and behavior and new active sites fig 6 local enrichment of protons or charges might enhance the interaction between reactants and confined surface leading to the ordered molecular behavior meng et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c this favors the enrichment of organic molecules and oxidant molecules promoting ops from thermodynamic perspective transport and enrichment of protons and charges would result in an electric potential difference in the inner outer surface and tends to form new reaction sites wang et al 2021c these could reduce the activation energy barrier or change reaction pathway improving ops kinetically yang et al 2019 the phase behavior of matter in confined space are complex in this section we elaborate on each feature with analyzing the phase behavior 3 1 quick transport of proton and charge proton and charge transfer is a ubiquitous component of various chemical reactions which exquisitely depends on matter structure and transport distance wraight 2006 spatial confinement can promote the transfer process ultrafast proton transfer was achieved in confined hydrophobic nanochannels constructed by cnts tunuguntla et al 2016 the inner surface of cnts weakly interact with water molecules to form one dimensional hydrogen bonded water chains lee chang et al 2010 protons are transferred along the hydrogen bonded water chains which shows fast transfer rate tunuguntla et al 2016 also found that the proton transfer rate was higher in 0 8 nm diameter cnt than in 1 5 nm indicating the scale of confined space has an influence on proton transfer protons transfer may cause the change of ph locally for example protons acting as counterions enter the space that confined manganese oxides zero charge point 4 6 in neutral conditions leading to a ph decrease inside the confined space husnain et al 2020 the protons concentration on the surface of confined pore is higher than in the bulk aqueous phase and ph value inside the pore is reduced xiao et al 2022 the reduced ph value inside the pore is negatively correlated with the scale of confined space owing to the positive correlation between charge density in volume and the decreased pore size the interaction of charge transfer with medium polarization has an impact on proton transfer the distance that proton can transfer is less than a covalent bond length so a long distance proton transfer requires persistent charge rearrangement krishtalik 2000 in most cases substantial charge density redistribution accompanies with proton transfer zhang et al 2021a the redistribution of charge on the surface of confined space will alter the local electron distribution tunuguntla et al 2016 in electrons redistribution process the electric potential inside the space could be enhanced by overlapping the double electric layers of charged surfaces wang et al 2021c for instance cnt with curvature walls show unique π electron distribution at the inner outer surface the π electrons in inner wall surface were transferred to outer surface causing an electric potential difference pan and bao 2011 the different electric potential influenced the charge transfer and redistribution and the catalyst confined in cnts showed altered electronic states surface potential energy and catalytic activity shifa and vomiero 2019 spatial confinement also altered the electron transfer in nanoporous carbon electrodes li et al 2017 and confining sulfur in narrow diameter cnt s cnts revealed enhanced electrochemical reactivity fu et al 2018 electron density difference maps δρ ρs cnt ρcnt showed a dynamic visualization of electronic rearrangement which meant electrons transfer from the encapsulated sulfur to surrounding cnt dynamically fu et al 2018 3 2 change on molecular structure and behavior when molecules are confined in an ultrasmall space molecular structure will be changed zhang et al 2021d for instance sorin and pande 2006 found that protein helices were denatured in narrow cnts ascribed to the reduced free energy cost of hydrogen bonding between confined water and proteins orientational structure and local ordering of benzene molecules were also altered when they were confined in 4 85 7 90 å micropores of zeolite mobil crystalline material 41 mcm 41 compared to in the bulk phase falkowska et al 2018 some organics like ibuprofen and benzoic acid in mesopores of mcm 41 was in a highly mobile state azais et al 2010 skorupska et al 2014 additionally argyris et al 2010 found that the distribution and mobility of ions e g na cs and cl was determined by the unique structure and dynamics of water under spatial confinement the hydration number of ions was altered by spatial confinement affecting the reaction of hydrated ions with the adsorption sites zhang et al 2021b xue et al 2022 spatial confinement show the ability to promote the ordering of molecules like the sequential growth of pda in pda cnt bai et al 2022 the ordered behavior eliminates the diffusion limitation occurring in the bulk as well as helps reactants get close to reactive sites more easily which can improve ops efficiently zhang et al 2021d for example the process where n boc l amino acid molecules react with amine monolayer to form amide bonds normally needs the assistance of high temperature and high pressure sullivan et al 2004 zhou et al 2018 found that spatial confinement could enable the reaction of amide bonds formation to occur at normal temperature and pressure lipidic cubic mesophases was used to be a host for reaction and confined space was formed in the continuous lipid bilayer in the confined space the n boc l amino acid molecules were forcedly placed close to amine monolayer furthermore reactants get easier access to active sites that uniformly distributed on the interface between lipid bilayer and water channels 3 3 creation of new active sites confining oxidation catalysts in nanoscale space can achieve the redistribution and enrichment of reaction active sites for ops dutta and lee 2021 li et al 2020 grosso giordano et al 2019 explored the effect of confined tiiv active sites on olefin epoxidation catalysis spatial confinement led to the dynamic redistribution of tiiv active sites and the transition state structures formed by association of reactants at active sites became easier owing to the reduced entropic barriers compared to that in unconfined space the redistribution of tiiv active sites in confined space is manifested by altering the metal coordination environment paolucci et al 2017 cirujano et al 2017 used solid state crystallization to confine metal organic framework mof nanocrystals in mesoporous materials compared to the bulk mof spatial confinement enriched the coordination vacancies at outer nanocrystal surface and resulted in higher exposure of active sites furthermore various studies found that nanocrystals with quantum confinement revealed surface autocatalytic effects wu et al 2009 and provided enriched active sites jia et al 2021 additionally the unsaturated active sites can be retained in confined structure which could promote electron transfer hu et al 2020a for example coordinatively unsaturated iron sites were confined in graphene matrix to catalyze the oxidation of benzene deng et al 2015 the formation of feo intermediate structure is a key step for benzene oxidation fu et al 2010 used silica to confine the coordinately unsaturated ferrous sites confinement effect stabilizes the unsaturated ferrous sites via strong adhesion between ferrous oxides and metal substrates zhang et al 2020a controlled the unsaturated nitrogen coordination at twisted surfaces in porous single crystals to create ordered active sites coordinatively unsaturated metal nitrogen active sites were confined on porous nitride single crystals surface 4 environmental influences in actual application of spatial confinement mediated ops environmental influences cannot be ignored based on above discussion it can be found there is a tight connection between confinement features and environmental influences in ops the application of spatial confinement brings about a change on ph and behavior of organics and ions in turn environmental ph co exist organics and ions also affect the application of spatial confinement environmental ph plays an important role in the transport of protons and charge the electrostatic interaction between the reactants and reactive surface is affected by the co existed organics and inorganic ions falkowska et al 2018 in this section environmental influences are studied with analyzing their intrinsic connection with confinement features in ops fig 7 4 1 environmental ph transport of protons and charges affects environmental ph while environmental ph influences the function of spatial confinement on ops improvement it was found that protons can quickly transferred under spatial confinement shi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b environmental ph and the ph at point of zero charge determine proton transfer process when environmental ph is less than the zero charge point of catalyst the catalyst surface is negative charged zhang et al 2021c at this point protons acting as the counterions transfer to the negative charged surface to achieve interfacial charge balance macha et al 2019 furthermore ph alters the charge distribution of catalyst surface which affects the adsorption of organics for example yao et al 2021 found a negative correlation between ph value and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa oxidation efficiency presumably because the reduced adsorption pfoa the acid dissociation constant is 2 8 is more likely to show deprotonation state and catalyst surface tends to be negatively charged with the increased ph value the adsorption of deprotonated pfoa on negatively charged catalyst surface is weak in addition environmental ph directly affects the decomposition of oxidants generally the activity of o3 is weakened for ops in acidic ph yang et al 2020 the decomposition rate of h2o2 and pms are higher in acidic ph because h2o2 molecules tend to be decomposed to o2 and h2o while pms are decomposed to so4 2 o2 and h2o in alkaline condition yang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 for example in the core shell fe3o4 pedot h2o2 system decomposition rate of h2o2 at ph 4 5 was higher than ph 7 5 and 9 0 shin et al 2008 in the nzvi ti3c2 h2o2 system ranitidine removal achieved 92 7 at ph 3 0 72 2 at ph 8 0 but only 37 2 at ph 9 0 ma et al 2021 higher ph shows stronger inhibition on h2o2 decomposition li et al 2021a found both the strongly acid ph 1 0 and highly alkali ph 11 0 were disadvantage for rhb degradation in the cotio3 co3o4 pms system pms decomposition was low in strongly acidic environment while the deprotonation of pms to generate so5 2 easily occurred in highly alkaline condition although oxidants decomposition is reduced the performance of most spatial confinement mediated ops is still considerable this is because the transfer distance was shortened and the contact between reactants and active sites was enhanced in confined structure besides the influence of ph is negligible for nonradical pathway mediated ops for example fe2o3 mwcnt shows good ph stability for oxidation of mb yang et al 2019 4 2 organic matter in ops there is a competition between co existing organic matter and target organics for active sites and reactive species for example mei et al 2020 found humic acid ubiquitous organics would shield the active sites and competitively consume radicals in pms ops under spatial confinement the competition could be reduced because some confined structure can block the organics with large molecular weight zhang et al 2021e and the varied structure of confined water may deplete hydrogen bonding of water which would lead to a stronger hydrogen bond interaction with organics to achieve effective adsorption to promote reaction oh et al 2019 zhao et al 2021a however the adsorption is non selective and effective for both target organic pollutants and co exist organic matter the competition still exists and cannot be ignored in ops ma et al 2017 4 3 inorganic ions spatial confinement can change the distribution and dynamics of ions via altering the structure and properties of water including hydration number of ions hydrogen bond network and even the entropy enthalpy and free energy of water pascal tod et al 2011 chakraborty et al 2017 tang et al 2022 in turn owing to the unique properties of confined water molecules hydrated ions may influence the charge distribution of confined structure via forming electrostatic binding or hydrogen bond in addition ions can quench free radicals as a consequence inorganic ions tend to have a negative effect on most radicals mediated ops generally co3 2 hco3 cl and no3 ubiquitous ions in water matrix could quench radicals to generate less reactive radicals including co3 hco3 cl and no3 for example mei et al 2020 found cl and no3 inhibited mb degradation via quenching the generated so4 and oh in the fe3o4 mgsio3 pms system however co3 2 promoted mb degradation and the promotion was ascribed to the quick reaction of the generated co3 with electron rich compounds n ch3 2 of mb mei et al 2020 notably inorganic ions have little effect on nonradical 1o2 besides some inorganic ions can complex with metal species which could greatly reduce the formation of high valent metal oxo species like the impeded formation of high valent iron oxo species by h2po4 li et al 2019a li et al 2021a also found hpo4 2 can bind to cobalt sites which inhibit rhb degradation in cotio3 co3o4 pms system 5 conclusions and perspectives functional nanoporous materials that possess spatial confinement have been used as the host oxidation mediator or reaction reservoirs to catalyze ops for organic pollutants removal from water at a micro level the confined ultrasmall space restricts the electronic motion and then alters the electronic properties and structure that may lead to quantum mutation as well as change the transition state to lower the activation energy barriers sun et al 2013 wang et al 2020a additionally charges redistribution on the inner surface would result from spatial confinement which will change the reaction state of the active sites and benefit the accumulation of excess charges around the active sites leading to the enhanced adsorption and oxidation reaction farnesi camellone et al 2016 in macro view space confinement enables the surface inside pores with charge contrary to the target pollutants or oxidative agents to improve their interaction it enhances reactants enrichment or products discharge to accelerate the oxidation reaction zhang et al 2019 and even alters the reaction kinetics by changing the reaction pathway prieto et al 2021 the organics and short lived radicals are enriched locally owing to the reduced mass transfer distance and lower consumption of available reactants the interactions between confined space and either oxidizing agent catalysts or organics essentially alter the redox reaction energy diagram and reaction pathway additionally nanoporous structure providing spatial confinement enables the materials to possess high surface area and exposure of active sites this is beneficial for the interaction e g electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond of catalysts surface and reactants as well as the stabilization of catalyst on the host material contributing to efficient ops the chemical and physical processes in the confined space depend on the chemical characters of treated water and surface properties of nano space like surface electrostatic potential kovaleva et al 2018 to expand the application of spatial confinement mediated ops the following aspects should be noted i unique water molecules behavior water molecules show different behavior in confined space gilles et al 2016 beaumont et al 2021 wang et al 2021a for example water molecules interact with inner pores of hydrophobic cnts to form hydrogen bonded water chains and the water chains can accelerate proton and charge transfer lee chang et al 2010 additionally the changed properties and dynamics of confined water will affect the behavior of co existed organics and inorganic ions de aquino et al 2019 influence of spatial confinement on solvation status that may affect the adsorption and oxidation reaction needs further discussion ii secondary pollution owing to the added chemical reactants and incomplete degradation of organic pollutants secondary pollution often occurs in ops the addition of chemical reactants needs to be control more importantly the transformation products should be detected and identified to get the possible reaction pathways the toxicity test and risk evaluation of transformation products is indispensable besides potential pollution caused by the added catalysts is also a noteworthy issue for example mof catalysts were constructed by the coordination of metal and organics theoretically strong acid alkali or high temperature can promote the decomposition of mof which might generate harmful organics and the recycling of catalysts remains a concern for large scale application iii advanced test methods and fundamental research spatial confinement effect are mostly studied via computational simulation tunuguntla et al 2016 molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore the process that spatial confinement denatures protein helices sorin and pande 2006 molecular dynamics simulations combined with interfacial charge balance theory were used to study proton density redistribution zhang et al 2021c advanced characterization and test methods are lacked moreover owing to the complexity of water matrix and the difficulty of transition state capture and identification in ops relevant studies on the effect of spatial confinement on the transition states are inadequate qian et al 2020a zhang et al 2021d to study spatial confinement effect on ops more accurately more fundamental research is needed iv controllable cost various materials are utilized as the support for spatial confinement mediated ops like cnts mofs and natural porous zeolites the selection of supporting materials to provide confined structure is important there are many aspects to be consider such as the match degree between confined structure and substrate the stability and applicability of materials in various conditions and production cost furthermore the cost of confined catalyst in supporting materials also needs control from the aspect of actual application the economic efficiency of spatial confinement mediated ops is very important therefore the selected catalyst and supporting materials should be rich in resources cheap in price stable in property and eco friendly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

widely practised in many industries including for water treatment by removing fine particles from the fluid filtration can be defined as any process in which the removal of fine particles from a suspension a two phase system containing fines in a fluid is carried out by the passage of the suspension through a porous medium granular and membrane filtrations are the two common filtration types varying in removal particle size fig 1 in granular filtration the turbidity of suspension is usually about 10 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit i e the particle phase is very dilute and particle size generally ranges from 10 to 100 μm in diameter the common granular materials include sand anthracite coal garnet and ilmenite with their sizes ranging from 0 2 to 2 0 mm kramer et al 2021 the membrane filtration includes microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membranes these membranes very much in the pore size the range of which being 0 001 10 μm and the size of the rejected particles hoslett et al 2018 the membrane thickness ranges from about 0 1 to 0 6 mm with homogeneous and asymmetric inner structures zhang et al 2018b fig 1 summarises the membrane filtration and granular filtration based on the varying particle size ranges in practice filter fouling is a long standing challenge to filtration performance as the flux will decline severely and lower or terminate the filtration processes due to the complexity of compositions and physicochemical properties of particle foulant the complexity of hydrodynamics conditions e g fluid and foulant dynamics and the complexity of filter microscale structures the theoretical understanding of these processes is lacking especially at the microscale theoretically the fundamental multidisciplinary fluid and particle dynamics underpin the filter fouling filter fouling involves fluid particle flow dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales from the flow region scale of filtration operation to the representative elementary volume rev scale of foulant transportation in the filter and the pore scale of foulant interaction with the filter surface fig 2 the frameworks of microscale fluid and particle dynamics can be used not only to study and understand the complex liquid particle flow but also to optimise and scale up these processes thus this fundamental understanding can provide a rigorous basis for quantitative modelling optimization and scale up the filtration processes previous reviews on filtration or filter fouling have focused on the technical and engineering aspects at the macroscale such as operating conditions and feed suspension properties and fouling models cescon and jiang 2020 meng et al 2017 but reviews were not done on the fundamentals of microscale fluid and particle dynamics in the filtration processes this review will present the central importance of microscale fluid and particle dynamics of the filtration processes from the perspective of fundamental understanding fig 3 shows the roadmap of this review the review is organised as follows the basics of microscale fluid and particle dynamics in the filtration process are summarised in section 2 the methodologies for investigating the filtration process including experimental observation and numerical simulations are briefly introduced in section 3 the previous studies of microscale fluid and particle dynamics mainly in granular filtration and microfiltration membrane are comprehensively reviewed in section 4 which includes a review on microscale fluid dynamics in terms of drag force fd fluid velocity profile fvp intrinsic permeability ki and hydraulic tortuosity th and a review on microscale particle dynamics in terms of particle straining particle absorption and particle accumulation the summary is outlined in section 5 and the challenges and outlook regarding the microscale fluid and particle dynamics are discussed in section 6 this review aims to provide a basis for the readers interested in the microscale exploration of the filtration process highlighting challenges and unexplored aspects of this broad topic and giving guidance on future research efforts 2 microscale basics of filtration processes fundamentally filtration involves three phases particle fines fluid and filter fig 4 the particle phase may present several dynamic behaviours including straining absorption and accumulation the fluid phase can induce microscale underlying long range hydrodynamic phenomena including fd on particles fvp in the filter ki and th of the filter the hydrodynamic phenomena play an essential role in determining the particle dynamics in the filter fig 4 shows the microscale fluid and particle dynamics involved in the filtration process note that the force that the fluid exerts on the particles is a combination of multiple forces including drag pressure gradient virtual mass basset saffman and magnus forces nijssen et al 2021 the fd is considered to be the main fluid particle force and is the driving force for particle movement deen et al 2007 for reducing the numerical model complexity only the fd is normally accounted for in the simulations reasonable simulation results can still be obtained while only considering drag force ma et al 2022 2 1 basics of fluid dynamic in filtration 2 1 1 drag force fd drag force fd is the predominant cause of particle transportation during the filtration process the fluid velocity field fluid and particle viscosity and solid shape and size all play an important role in determining fd proportion and the squared relationship between fd and velocity are found for low speed and high speed respectively where the distinction between low and high speed is measured by the reynolds number re also fd tends to decrease fluid velocity relative to the granular particle in the fluid s path rong et al 2013 viscosity is a complex phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a simple proportional relationship between the drag force and velocity where the viscous effect represents an irreversible phenomenon leading to the generation of entropy waleed ahmed khan et al 2018 on the other hand fd is proportional to the cross sectional area of a solid with different shapes and sizes in recent studies of filtration e g wang et al 2018 and sorci et al 2020 the focus had been on fd and the studies identified fd as a key parameter for some numerical models development for use in the filtration processes and thus should be investigated in more detail 2 1 2 fluid velocity profile fvp the fluid velocity profile fvp is a result of many factors the magnitude of the velocity and the characteristics of the flow direction and changes due to the shape of the filter namely increase decrease in the velocity magnitude due to the filter geometry li et al 2001 fvp can help understand how the fluid behaves while it is transported through the filter note that fvp arises due to a relative motion between a solid and a fluid in recent studies of filtration e g aramideh et al 2018 and sakurai and ishihara 2018 fvp was studied and identified as a key parameter for describing particle concentration distribution in the filter where heterogeneous fluid velocity in space would lead to the localization of particle concentration which in turn leads to clogging or fouling of part of the filter song et al 2020 2 1 3 intrinsic permeability ki the permeability k can measure the filter s ability to allow fluids to pass through it the microstructure parameters of the filter such as pore size thickness and porosity ε together with the fluid properties i e density and viscosity of the flowing fluid ghassemi and pak 2011 all have a considerable effect on k at the macroscopic level and the limit of creeping flow regimes the k is described by darcy s law δ p μ l f i l t e r u k where p µ lfilter and u are the pressure drop dynamic viscosity filter length and fluid velocity respectively in recent years interest in k i is on the rise which is specifically related to the filter microstructure parameters on space availability for fluid flow correlations used for assessing k i are developed around filter microstructure parameters crittenden et al 2012 based on such as carman 1997 kozeny 1927 c k and hagen poiseuille h p stokes 1880 correlations li et al 2006 introduced two parameters k1 and k2 to improve the c k correlation to describe the impact of the deformations and changes in particle packing during the sintering process and are expressed as 1 k i d p k 2 k 1 ε 3 1 ε 2 where k1 is a constant and k2 implies particles shape and aggregate style on the membrane pore size dp is the particle diameter the value of k1 and k2 are 2 499 107 m 0 892 and 1 108 respectively which were regressed by the water permeability experiment data li et al 2006 provided the ceramic membrane is regarded as a bundle of capillaries the h p correlation can be used to predict the permeability li et al 2006 shown as follows 2 k i d p 2 ε 128 as the c k and h p correlations indicate ki is highly sensitive to the qualitative and quantitative changes in the filter microstructure parameters such as the pore size and ε lu et al 2016 ki can be used as an essential indicator to evaluate the filter clogging or fouling rate in filtration processes in recent studies on filtration e g nishiyama and yokoyama 2017 and fu et al 2021 guo 2015 ma et al 2018 ki was studied and identified as a key parameter for the prediction of the filter fouling with their results indicating that ki is an indicator of the filter s capability for the suspension to pass through and thus further studies should be done in the future 2 1 4 hydraulic tortuosity th the hydraulic tortuosity th is commonly used to describe fluid flow pathways in the filter the definition of th is given as clennell 1997 3 t h l h l where lh denotes the length of the effective hydraulic flow path as illustrated in fig 5 and l is the straight line distance through the porous media in the macroscopic flow direction duda et al 2011 and matyka and koza 2012 developed a correlation directly calculates th from the steady state fluid velocity field avoiding the difficulty of identifying individual streamlines as shown below 4 t h ω v r d ω ω v f l o w d i r e c t i o n r d ω v v f l o w d i r e c t i o n where v f l o w d i r e c t i o n r denotes the velocity component over the pore space ω parallel to the macroscopic flow direction at point r eq 4 is widely used as it significantly simplifies the calculation of th for porous media with complicated geometries it is worth mentioning that eq 4 is based on two assumptions the fluid is incompressible and the fluid flow is not re entrant the re entrant effect is negligible for laminar flow with a low re passing through the filter th is greatly affected by the filter morphology such as ε and pore size distribution fu et al 2021 th is an effective indicator that quantifies the complexity of the filter structure and evaluates the anti fouling filter performance hu et al 2020 in recent studies on filtration e g guo 2015 and fu et al 2021 th was investigated and identified as a critical parameter for evaluating the filter s anti fouling performance th is a direct indicator of the filter complex structure thus it should be further examined 2 2 basics of particle dynamic in filtration during the filtration process particle dynamics describes the particle motions through the filter the internal external filter cakes describe the particle dynamic at the representative elementary volume rev scale which are caused by the microscale particle straining and absorption and accumulation respectively boek et al 2012 as shown in fig 6 2 2 1 internal filter cake 2 2 1 1 particle straining particle straining occurs when a pore is completely sealed by the particles fig 7 factors such as pore and particle size distributions affect the filter straining ability zhao et al 2016 a larger pore size raychoudhury et al 2014 and fewer particles barton and buchberger 2007 improve the straining performance particle straining leads to considerable resistance to filtration giving rise to a sharp decline in the filtrate flux rate under constant pressure conditions and a severe increase in the applied pressure for operation under constant flux conditions during filtration iritani 2013 in recent studies of filtration e g barton and buchberger 2007 and zhao et al 2016 particle straining is studied and identified as a key parameter that causes filter fouling when the filter structure effect is evident 2 2 1 2 particle absorption particle absorption is a process in which particles smaller than the pore sizes are continuously transported and absorbed into the pore wall surface simate 2015 sedimentation hydrodynamic dispersion and interception are three key mechanisms of particle absorption fig 8 in recent studies of filtration e g simate 2015 and osiptsov 2017 these mechanisms have been investigated and particle absorption has been identified as the primary cause of filter fouling when the particle property effect is evident thus particle absorption should be further studied in future work sedimentation the particles with a density significantly greater than water tend to deviate from fluid streamlines due to gravitational forces particle size fluid and particle density and fluid velocity field all play an important role in determining sedimentation performance osiptsov 2017 sedimentation performance increased with reduced surface fluid speeds and larger suspended particle size hoyal et al 1997 hydrodynamic dispersion diffusion of brownian particles in the presence of an external flow field where the particles will deviate from the fluid streamlines particle diffusion is determined by particle size fluid velocity and temperature recent research finds that particle diffusion is proportional to the local strain rate consistent with a local quasi static picture and is inversely proportional to the depth of the particles below the granular surface wandersman et al 2012 interception the particles remaining centred on fluid streamlines that pass over the granular particle surface at a distance of half the particle diameter or less will be intercepted choi et al 2014 decreasing the pore size would increase the interception performance bao et al 2012 2 2 2 external filter cake the external filter cake is caused by microscale particle accumulation which is formed on the media surface the filter cake acts as a dynamic filter and can retain smaller particles possibly minimizing particle absorption and improving filtration effectiveness but the filter cake also gives rise to a sharp decline in the filtrate flux due to cake compression during filtration the pore and particle size distributions play an important role in particle accumulation broeckmann et al 2006 in recent studies of filtration e g zhang et al 2013 and yao et al 2018 particle accumulation has been investigated and identified as a major cause of filter fouling when the fluid property effect is noticeable 3 methodologies for filtration studies at microscale in this section the main experimental and numerical methods for studying the fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process are introduced particle image velocimetry piv high speed photography and other methods are introduced in the experimental part and the computational fluid method cfd and discrete element method dem being introduced in the numerical part it is worth to mention that several existing mathematical models can provide us with an overall filtration efficiency but no detailed description of microscale events that happened in the filtration processes although these existing mathematical models of filtration are beyond the scope of this study the relevant references are still cited and reviewed here to highlight the review at microscale the yao model yao et al 1971 rt model rajagopalan and tien 1976 and te model tufenkji and elimelech 2004 can be used to examine the effect of important variables on filter performance however filtration efficiency changes with time are not addressed in these three mathematical models more sophisticated models have been developed to incorporate time dependant phenomena such as ripening darby et al 1992 but it is unable to predict changes in particle removal or head loss when the design or operating conditions change to examine the change in filter performance as solids collect within the filter bed phenomenological filter models have been developed such as the deep bed filtration model dbfm boek et al 2012 3 1 experimental methods fig 9 summarises the available experimental methods for studying fluid and particle dynamics in the filtration process in brief the traditional approach in fluid and particle dynamics research was to exclusively focus on the final static result by optical microscopy van zanten et al 2010 electron microscopy meister and blume 2017 and x ray microscopy storozhenko et al 2015 for optical microscopy an optical resolution of the final results of about 1 μm could be achieved while results can probe into smaller scales using electron and x ray microscopy with a resolution of maybe as high as 0 05 nm however to make further progress in the understanding of the fluid and particle dynamics process dynamical measurements would be necessary and the development in piv spatial resolution of about 1 10 μm and high speed photography spatial resolution of about 1 μm have made such process possible 3 1 1 particle image velocimetry piv is an optical flow visualisation method obtaining instantaneous velocity measurements and related properties in fluids thus it can be used to understand micro scale particle velocity profiles during the filtration process fig 10 a shows the piv set up and the measured local and instantaneous velocities however due to the complex relationship between measurement errors and experimental parameters quantifying the piv uncertainty is far from a trivial task and has often relied upon subjective considerations sciacchitano 2019 recognizing the importance of methodologies for the objective and reliable uncertainty quantification uq of experimental data several piv uq approaches have been proposed in recent years that aim to determine objective uncertainty bounds in piv measurements such as a priori uq and a posteriori uq approaches piv can measure the flow field simultaneously of the entire two dimensional cross section of the filter also particle seeding techniques are applied for piv measurements under extreme high speed conditions where fine and non agglomerated particles are used as tracers chen et al 2017 however piv cannot perfectly follow fluid motion which is mainly ascribed to calibration errors truncation errors in space or time unresolved or under resolved length or time scale or peak locking sciacchitano 2019 3 1 2 high speed photography high speed photography is the method of taking pictures of very fast phenomena allowing for detailed visualization of the fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process by acquiring a series of image frames captured at high temporal and spatial resolution fuller 2009 its working principle depends on the frame rate and exposure time illumination and triggering xing et al 2017 fig 10b shows the schematic of the arrangement of high speed photography carried out with the four high speed cameras and the measured wake structure behind falling and rising spheres however due to the complex measurement conditions the wide application of high speed photography in fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process has still a long way to go xing et al 2017 for example the frame rate and exposure time are smaller under the dynamic impact which poses challenges to the resolutions of high speed cameras therefore a high speed camera with a higher spatial and temporal resolution is always in demand high speed photography will be able to individually follow the progress of filtration or it can be displayed rapidly in sequence as a movie film in slow motion however high speed photography cannot perfectly capture the filtration dynamics properties due to the properties such as high stiffness brittleness and heterogeneity in most filters 3 1 3 other methods in addition to the aforementioned piv and high speed photography methods several other tools were also used to study fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process in the past the dynamics of fluid can be tracked by the laser based piv and laser doppler anemometry lda neumann et al 2009 on the other hand the dynamics of particles can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging mri skuntz et al 2018 and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr o neill et al 2016 the particle s granular temperature which characterizes the velocity fluctuation can be directly detected by magnetic resonance velocimetry mrv reci et al 2018 note that these methods can only track a small number of particles under more strict operation conditions such as adjusted room temperature and larger space and produce results lower in resolution these methods are not described here due to their limited applicability in the studies of filtration processes at the microscale 3 2 numerical methods numerical modelling and simulation as an alternative has become a powerful tool for studying the fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process currently cfd and dem are widely used to simulate the fluid and particle phases respectively and have been applied in the filtration process in this section the details of cfd dem and coupled cfd dem are introduced in the context of the filtration process and features 3 2 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyse and solve problems that involve fluid flows shen et al 2008 2011 2009 cui et al 2020 yu and shen 2018 the mass and momentum equations are briefly described below the details of which can be found in alves et al 2021 the generalized equation for conservation of mass in a control volume is given below 5 u 0 the momentum equation is 6 ρ f u t p τ ρ f g where u is the velocity vector ρ f is the fluid density t is time g is the gravitational acceleration and τ is the stress tensor describing the fluid rheology finite difference method fdm as reviewed by popescu and popescu 2014 finite element method fem as reviewed by morgan and peraire 1998 and finite volume method fvm as reviewed by boudet 2012 have been developed to solve eqs 5 and 6 on an eulerian grid fdm is conceptually easy to formulate but difficult to accommodate complex geometries the use of fdm is limited in filtration studies since filtration processes are associated with complex microscale geometries keir and jegatheesan 2013 fem is very flexible in terms of geometry and mesh elements but cannot obtain local conservation fem is limited in filtration studies especially for pore scale studies for revealing the underlying filtration mechanisms baker 2016 the principle of fvm is local conservation ensuring local and global flux balance and its formulation can be based on fdm or fem fvm has geometrical flexibility and is applicable in filtration studies especially pore scale studies due to its local conservation feature shen et al 2016 2014 yu and shen 2018 unlike the previous methods that solve the eqs 5 and 6 of macroscopic properties the lattice boltzmann method lbm models the fluid consisting of fictive particles and such particles perform consecutive propagation and collision processes over a discrete lattice lbm is capable of dealing with complex boundaries and incorporating microscopic interactions which has been widely applied in filtration studies song et al 2022 2020 fvm based cfd software packages are available such as ansys fluent liu and shen 2019 zhuo and shen 2020 and openfoam xie et al 2021 yue et al 2019 lbm based cfd software package is also available such as palabos they are widely used for studying filtration processes at different scales these cfd programs can provide insight into the filtration process s detailed fluid flow behaviour and help the designer arrive at an optimum design based on the virtual performance analysis meanwhile cfd analysis can help find the parameter important for the filtration process keir and jegatheesan 2013 note that from a numerical point of view the energy equation considering temperature variations brings no significance to fluid flow during the filtration process which is not covered in this review alves et al 2021 3 2 2 discrete element method dem dem is any of a family of numerical methods for computing the motion and effect of a large number of small particles where newton s second law determines the translational and rotational movements of particles xie et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 the conventional governing equations of particles can be modified by adding the fluid particle interaction force f f i and torque t f i 7 m i d v i d t j f i j n f i j t f g i f f i 8 i i d ω i d t j t i j m i j t f i where mi and ii denote the mass and moment of inertia of particle i respectively v i and ω i are the translational velocity and angular velocities respectively f g is the gravitational force f i j n and f i j t represent the normal and tangential contact forces where the static and dynamic frictions are considered in calculating the friction force in f i j t torque t i j is generated by tangential forces and causes particle i to rotate m i j is the rolling friction torque that opposes the rotation of the i th particle fig 11 shows a collision of two arbitrary shape particles i and j the dem is very closely related to molecular dynamics but the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees of freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries including polyhedra guo and curtis 2015 filtration is a complex flow process associated with nonspherical flexible or cohesive particles where different dem models may be implemented to describe these particles related information can be found in the supplementary material 3 2 3 cfd dem coupling the filtration processes typically involve particle liquid flow cfd dem is the most promising approach for modelling the fluid and particle flow during the filtration process especially fluid and particle dynamics at the microscale cfd dem is divided into three different models unresolved cfd dem semi resolved cfd dem and fully resolved cfd dem generally the filtration process can be associated with three different length scales region scale representative elementary volume rev scale and pore scale he et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 12 the three methods of fully resolved cfd dem unresolved cfd dem and semi resolved cfd dem are carried out for the applicable scale and fluid mesh size to particle mesh size ratio as shown in figs 13 and 14 in general the smaller the fluid mesh size to particle diameter ratio the more accurate the simulation but the larger the calculation cost it is suitable for a smaller scale study the fluid to particle mesh size ratio is 3 0 1 0 and 0 1 for unresolved cfd dem semi resolved cfd dem and fully resolved cfd dem respectively and its applicable scale are region scale rev scale and pore scale respectively these concepts are reviewed below more details on the coupling schemes on the unresolved cfd dem semi resolved cfd dem and fully resolved cfd dem can be found in the supplementary material 4 recent experimental and numerical studies in this section the major finds from previous studies on fluid and particle dynamics in membrane and granular filtration processes are summarised in two groups experimental and numerical methods 4 1 fluid dynamic orientated studies 4 1 1 drag force fd drag force correlations that can be used on the multiphase flow models such as two fluid models tfm zhou 2016 and or the discrete particle method dpm zhu et al 2011 for the numerical study of the filtration process have been proposed particles with arbitrary shapes are associated with the filtration processes table 1 shows the list of fd correlations for spherical and non spherical particles and their applications in different filtration processes for experimental studies hölzer and sommerfeld 2008 proposed a simple correlation for the standard drag coefficient i e a single stationary particle in a uniform flow of arbitrary shaped particles using a large number of experimental data from the literature which can be used for the unresolved and semi resolved numerical studies of any type of filtration processes compared to experimental based studies numerical simulation is an alternative due to its lower cost and better controllability as a resolved cfd method the lattice boltzmann method lbm can simulate fluid flows in complex geometries with detailed fluid field information around the surface of geometries widely used for drag force studies for example drag force correlations applicable for sphere rong et al 2013 ellipsoid rong et al 2015 cubes chen and müller 2018 and cylinders song et al 2021a have been proposed using lbm allowing for the unresolved and semi resolved numerical study of the various filtration process such as granular and ceramic membrane filtration 4 1 2 fluid velocity profile fvp the relationship between pore structures and fvp has been studied mainly by using numerical methods with the objectives of optimisation filter pore structure design and prediction of filtration performance resolved and unresolved cfd have been applied a qualitative relationship between fluid velocity and the filter s porosity has been found by unresolved cfd simulations of a seepage flow through a 3d reconstructed filter based on ct imaging zhang et al 2018a more quantitative results have been delivered with the improvement of the mesh resolution in resolved cfd spatially fluctuating velocity field and the 3d pore space distribution are correlated by high resolution dns simulations of the flow through the filter of two distinct pore structures arising from three dimensional assemblies of overlapping and nonoverlapping spheres aramideh et al 2018 in recent work a detailed fvp near sand particle surface was described and the critical flow velocity and an effective filter surface were proposed which were then used to quantitatively estimate the sand filtration performance song et al 2020 fig 15 shows the velocity distributions for a sand filtration system and pore structure distributions of the sand filter song et al 2020 4 1 3 intrinsic permeability ki the relationship between ki and void ratio and distribution of pores in the filter have been studied with the aim of filter design optimisation in the experimental method the user defined laboratory set up has been applied where it is easy to perform tests on the laboratory constant falling head permeability and field permeability tm 1995 the measured permeability obtained by using laboratory constant and falling head permeability tests is not representative of the field permeability because the filter is destroyed due to sampling techniques in contrast the development of field permeability tests avoids sample disturbance problems hall and trb 2004 kanitpong et al 2005 pumping tests provides an average value of the coefficient of permeability at the test site and are usually used for field permeability tests sahin 2016 for example it is reported that permeability values for silty sand and sand filter lie within the range between 10 3 and 10 6 m s sand size ranges were proved to have a considerable effect on the permeability values carter and bentley 1991 the numerical method lbm a resolved cfd method is mainly applied for quantitative studies it is reported that ki decreases with increased pore structure complexity and surface area of a filter when the factor pded the ratio of max pore diameter to min pore diameter of a filter is used in a study carried out using gpu enhanced multiple relaxation time lbm ma et al 2018 a ki correlation suitable for an asymmetric membrane was proposed as a function of pore size ε and layer thickness h of both top and intermediate layers using a one way coupling lbm dem model song et al 2022 fig 16 shows that ki increases with increased pore size and ε song et al 2022 4 1 4 hydraulic tortuosity th a quantitative relationship between th and filter morphology has been developed with the aim of filter design optimisation mainly by using the resolved cfd a correlation based on the van genuchten type function was proposed for the prediction of th obtained by a series of finite element simulations of the fluid flow through a porous filter saomoto and katagiri 2015 a new hydraulic tortuosity th correlation was proposed by song et al 2021b which is specifically for an elliptical particle filter with the particle shape and filter ε being taken into consideration and was formulated using a pore scale lbm dem model fig 17 shows that th decreases with increased porosity koponen et al 1996 song et al 2021b 4 2 particle dynamic orientated studies 4 2 1 internal filter cake 4 2 1 1 particle straining filter s pore structure and material properties and chemical and physical properties of the fluid are found to affect the particle straining in an experimental study the pore throat trapping due to the physical capture of avalanches and flocculates instead of individual particles was observed in an angular filter crushed limestone by digital photography barton and buchberger 2007 the ionic strength of the water was found to contribute to particle straining by capillary tensiometers with an electronic balance torkzaban et al 2008 particle straining was monitored by computed tomography ct scanning along with pressure measurements and it was concluded that the filter structure arrangement determines the localities where the particle straining happens khan et al 2020 fig 18 shows an experimental set up used in the particle straining study in the studies of numerical methods semi resolved and resolved cfd dem were applied for example particle straining was found to be related to the representative particle size ratio in a numerical study based on semi resolved cfd dem simulations of the particle transport in a base soil filter system zou et al 2013 the complex dependence particle straining behaviour on re and granular filter geometries was investigated by the dns dem method udono and sakai 2017 also it is reported that particle straining is mainly controlled by the particle size the results being obtained by using the semi resolved cfd dem feng et al 2020 fig 19 shows their results obtained by a cfd dem method in a study on particle migration in a porous media 4 2 1 2 particle absorption particle absorption is determined mainly by factors such as filter pore size distribution operation condition particle surface property shape and size in the experimental methods domain quantitatively conclusions have been made for example by developing a spectrophotometer system a linear regression model between particle absorption coefficient and particle composition has been proposed roesler 1998 in another study the particle absorption coefficient of a quartz particle filter was reported by using a laser heating technique in conjunction with laser transmissivity measurements presser 2012 moreover dynamic high speed photography observations were conducted by dersoir et al 2019 to study the particle absorption process especially how particles are absorbed onto the pore wall forming aggregates that eventually merge and block the pore fig 20 shows their typical results on the particle absorption and accumulation in a pore dersoir et al 2019 in studies using the numerical method unresolved and semi resolved cfd dem were applied to evaluate particle treatment and model efficiency absorption of cylindrical particles at the static filter surface was simulated by an unresolved cfd dem along with the multi sphere approach for comparison and the results show that the time for pores to be clogged by the absorbed particle decreased with decreased particle sphericity radjai et al 2017 in a different study cohesive particles were investigated and found to occur at the opening of sand filters by using the coarse grid unresolved and the smoothed unresolved cfd dem razavi et al 2021 a semi resolved cfd dem model with improved computational efficiency was developed to study fine particle absorption within a granular filter consisting of fine and coarse particles cheng et al 2018 further a semi resolved cfd dem was developed by xie et al 2021 based on a smoothed volume distribution model svdm and they found finding that particle absorption by particle bridging caused by the particle absorption and particle locking were the main filtration mechanisms fig 21 shows their typical results on the fine particle migration process of the fluid fine coarse particle system obtained using the unresolved cfd dem model 4 2 2 external filter cake filter geometry fluid and particle property and shape affect external filter cake formation particle accumulation during the filtration process especially for membrane filtration in an experimental investigation an sem energy dispersive x ray analyser edx was used to characterise the structure of the accumulated particles cake layers formed under different fluid flow conditions in terms of physical chemical and microbiological aspects and it was observed that where the filter cake has a loose outer surface compared to the cake at the bottom gao et al 2011 in a separate study the real time particle velocimetry module measurements were performed to evaluate the particle concentration and cake growth during filtration of spherical latex particles and found that membrane geometry has a pronounced influence on the formation of the first deposited layers and this effect persists throughout the later cake growth valencia et al 2020 fig 22 shows a schematic of the experimental set up of the particle velocimetry module and the observed particle accumulation on the membrane surface in the case of the numerical method unresolved and resolved cfd dem were applied to investigate particle accumulation dynamic observation of the initial growth of a cluster at the wall of a membrane microchannel was achieved by an unresolved cfd dem method complying with qualitative experimental features of the fouling process namely cluster morphology the possibility of break up and resuspension and linear growth rate of the cluster projected area onto the channel wall trofa et al 2019 the non spherical particle accumulation was investigated by an unresolved cfd dem method along with a multi sphere model and the results showed that the final void fraction of the accumulated particle cakes increased with decreasing sphericity of the non spherical particle deshpande et al 2020 also an unresolved cfd dem model was used to highlight the effect of flow conditions particle volume fraction cohesion forces and contraction angle on particle accumulation mechanism in a membrane microchannel trofa et al 2021 further they used the resolved cfd dem to identify a more detailed particle accumulation process using an lbm dem model the particle friction coefficient was found to have a core effect on the particle accumulation process where particles first get deposited near the pore entrance trapping subsequent particles mino et al 2018 further an lbm dem model was used to characterise the filter cake resistance effect in terms of the process energy effort with the model enabling the 4 way coupling to consider particle fluid and particle particle and filter medium interactions puderbach et al 2021 fig 23 a shows the simulation results of the unresolved cfd dem where the initial growth of a cluster at the wall of a slit microchannel can be observed and fig 23b shows the comparison with the experimental results trofa et al 2019 5 future issues and outlook 1 there is always a great demand for advanced direct experimental observation techniques for characterizing the fluid particle flow field with a sufficient spatial resolution to quantitatively understand the dynamics of the fluid and particles at the microscale resolved cfd dem models with a higher interfacial force discretization are in need for large scale fluid and particle dynamics meanwhile more precise fundamental models considering the fluid particle interactions such as the fd model virtual mass and bosset force models should be developed and implemented in unresolved and semi resolved cfd dem to improve their accuracy to study the fluid and particle dynamics at the microscale also emphasis should be given to the dem model development that accounts for non spherical flexible and cohesive particles 2 more efforts should be put into mechanism development of determining the fd under different conditions which can help increase the accuracy and applicable range of the fd correlations allowing application in such as industrial scale numerical studies more research on the mechanism development of how fvp controls the particle level forces and determines the behaviours of particles is suggested future research should be conducted to determine the mechanism development of the effect of the real filter complex microstructure on ki the comprehensive effect on th due to mechanism development on the complex filter microstructure is needed to be evaluated finally a thorough investigation of the relationships between fd fvp ki and th is also increasing in demand which will result in the correlations describing or the relationship between such as ki and th fvp and th fvp and fd ki for filters with different morphologies 3 the development of new correlations is in demand for the purpose of more effective quantitative prediction of the particle dynamics and the confirmation of the critical condition for the straining absorption and accumulation happening respectively further studies are suggested to be carried out on the development of the combined physical and chemical effect controlling the different microscale particle dynamics during membrane fouling 4 the underlying mechanism development of how the fluid and particle dynamics intersect with each other during filtration is a need for example how the fvp controls particle dynamics how ki and th reflect the filter morphologies and predicting the particle dynamics in addition investigations on how the dynamics of microscale fluid and particles in the microscale determine macroscale behaviours are suggested by paying attention on such as the applicable conditions and limitations 6 conclusions the review provides a comprehensive overview of microscale fluid and particle dynamics in filtration processes for water treatment and particle technology communities several key topics in filtration processes drag force fluid velocity profile intrinsic permeability and hydraulic tortuosity in microscale fluid dynamics and particle straining absorption and accumulation in microscale particle dynamics are identified and discussed also presented are several key experimental and important computational techniques cfd dem with different resolution scales for investigating filtration processes at microscale considering their applicability and capability the major findings in previous studies on these key topics are comprehensively reviewed in terms of microscale fluid and particle dynamics based on these future research is discussed in terms of techniques scopes and links the key conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the filtration process is based on three phases particle fluid and filter the particle component has dynamic behaviours which include straining absorption and accumulation the fluid component can induce microscale underlying long range hydrodynamic phenomena which include fd on particles fvp in the filter and ki and th of the filter 2 fd is essential to understand the fluid particle interactions and thus similarly important are its correlations applicable for different filtration processes which have been widely investigated in the cases of such as particles with spherical shapes and non spherical shapes fvp can cause localization of particle concentration and lead to filter fouling understanding the relationship between pore structures and fvp can help optimize the filter pore structure design ki is an important indicator to evaluate the filter fouling rate which is highly sensitive to the qualitative and quantitative changes of the filter microstructure parameters such as the pore size and ε th works as an effective indicator that quantifies the complexity of the filter structure and evaluates the filter anti fouling performance which is also greatly affected by the filter microstructures 3 experimental studies of the fluid and particle dynamics have been conducted using piv high speed photography and other methods such as lda mri and nmr the experimental methods can provide qualitative information about the fluid velocity field and also can visualize the fluid and particle dynamics processes however most experimental methods can only provide qualitative information and fail to provide quantitative information of fluid particle flows such as particle particle interactions 4 numerical methods cfd and dem are used to simulate the fluid and particle phases in the filtration process based on the resolution of the fluid phase the cfd dem is divided into unresolved semi resolved and resolved type numerical methods in the unresolved and semi resolved cfd dem fd correlations are used to characterize particle fluid interaction on the other hand resolved cfd dem does not require drag force models because particles are represented not by point masses but by considering their shape in the grid and imposing no slip conditions at the boundary the coupled dem cfd approach is a promising alternative for modelling particle fluid systems since it can capture the discrete nature of the particle phase while maintaining computational tractability the unresolved semi resolved and resolved cfd dem are applicable for the region scale rev scale and pore scale to investigate the filtration process respectively 5 fd correlations based on spherical and non spherical particles can be used on the multiphase flow models for the numerical study of the filtration process fvp is found to be related to particle velocity distribution ki is greatly affected by filter morphology existing ki correlations are proposed for filters that can be considered as a homogeneous material the filter s pore size controls the th which is still insufficient to understand the effect of the filter s inner structure on th 6 particle straining absorption and accumulation result from the physicochemical composition of the feed solution operating conditions and filter characteristics the physicochemical properties of individual feed particles such as shape and size determine the particle dynamics due to specific interactions between the filter and the particles in water operating parameters including feed velocity and feed concentration play a direct effect on particle dynamics the intrinsic characteristic of the filter such as surface roughness pore size and distribution have an important influence on particle filter interactions and thus on particle dynamics disclosure statement the authors are not aware of any biases that might

widely practised in many industries including for water treatment by removing fine particles from the fluid filtration can be defined as any process in which the removal of fine particles from a suspension a two phase system containing fines in a fluid is carried out by the passage of the suspension through a porous medium granular and membrane filtrations are the two common filtration types varying in removal particle size fig 1 in granular filtration the turbidity of suspension is usually about 10 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit i e the particle phase is very dilute and particle size generally ranges from 10 to 100 μm in diameter the common granular materials include sand anthracite coal garnet and ilmenite with their sizes ranging from 0 2 to 2 0 mm kramer et al 2021 the membrane filtration includes microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membranes these membranes very much in the pore size the range of which being 0 001 10 μm and the size of the rejected particles hoslett et al 2018 the membrane thickness ranges from about 0 1 to 0 6 mm with homogeneous and asymmetric inner structures zhang et al 2018b fig 1 summarises the membrane filtration and granular filtration based on the varying particle size ranges in practice filter fouling is a long standing challenge to filtration performance as the flux will decline severely and lower or terminate the filtration processes due to the complexity of compositions and physicochemical properties of particle foulant the complexity of hydrodynamics conditions e g fluid and foulant dynamics and the complexity of filter microscale structures the theoretical understanding of these processes is lacking especially at the microscale theoretically the fundamental multidisciplinary fluid and particle dynamics underpin the filter fouling filter fouling involves fluid particle flow dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales from the flow region scale of filtration operation to the representative elementary volume rev scale of foulant transportation in the filter and the pore scale of foulant interaction with the filter surface fig 2 the frameworks of microscale fluid and particle dynamics can be used not only to study and understand the complex liquid particle flow but also to optimise and scale up these processes thus this fundamental understanding can provide a rigorous basis for quantitative modelling optimization and scale up the filtration processes previous reviews on filtration or filter fouling have focused on the technical and engineering aspects at the macroscale such as operating conditions and feed suspension properties and fouling models cescon and jiang 2020 meng et al 2017 but reviews were not done on the fundamentals of microscale fluid and particle dynamics in the filtration processes this review will present the central importance of microscale fluid and particle dynamics of the filtration processes from the perspective of fundamental understanding fig 3 shows the roadmap of this review the review is organised as follows the basics of microscale fluid and particle dynamics in the filtration process are summarised in section 2 the methodologies for investigating the filtration process including experimental observation and numerical simulations are briefly introduced in section 3 the previous studies of microscale fluid and particle dynamics mainly in granular filtration and microfiltration membrane are comprehensively reviewed in section 4 which includes a review on microscale fluid dynamics in terms of drag force fd fluid velocity profile fvp intrinsic permeability ki and hydraulic tortuosity th and a review on microscale particle dynamics in terms of particle straining particle absorption and particle accumulation the summary is outlined in section 5 and the challenges and outlook regarding the microscale fluid and particle dynamics are discussed in section 6 this review aims to provide a basis for the readers interested in the microscale exploration of the filtration process highlighting challenges and unexplored aspects of this broad topic and giving guidance on future research efforts 2 microscale basics of filtration processes fundamentally filtration involves three phases particle fines fluid and filter fig 4 the particle phase may present several dynamic behaviours including straining absorption and accumulation the fluid phase can induce microscale underlying long range hydrodynamic phenomena including fd on particles fvp in the filter ki and th of the filter the hydrodynamic phenomena play an essential role in determining the particle dynamics in the filter fig 4 shows the microscale fluid and particle dynamics involved in the filtration process note that the force that the fluid exerts on the particles is a combination of multiple forces including drag pressure gradient virtual mass basset saffman and magnus forces nijssen et al 2021 the fd is considered to be the main fluid particle force and is the driving force for particle movement deen et al 2007 for reducing the numerical model complexity only the fd is normally accounted for in the simulations reasonable simulation results can still be obtained while only considering drag force ma et al 2022 2 1 basics of fluid dynamic in filtration 2 1 1 drag force fd drag force fd is the predominant cause of particle transportation during the filtration process the fluid velocity field fluid and particle viscosity and solid shape and size all play an important role in determining fd proportion and the squared relationship between fd and velocity are found for low speed and high speed respectively where the distinction between low and high speed is measured by the reynolds number re also fd tends to decrease fluid velocity relative to the granular particle in the fluid s path rong et al 2013 viscosity is a complex phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a simple proportional relationship between the drag force and velocity where the viscous effect represents an irreversible phenomenon leading to the generation of entropy waleed ahmed khan et al 2018 on the other hand fd is proportional to the cross sectional area of a solid with different shapes and sizes in recent studies of filtration e g wang et al 2018 and sorci et al 2020 the focus had been on fd and the studies identified fd as a key parameter for some numerical models development for use in the filtration processes and thus should be investigated in more detail 2 1 2 fluid velocity profile fvp the fluid velocity profile fvp is a result of many factors the magnitude of the velocity and the characteristics of the flow direction and changes due to the shape of the filter namely increase decrease in the velocity magnitude due to the filter geometry li et al 2001 fvp can help understand how the fluid behaves while it is transported through the filter note that fvp arises due to a relative motion between a solid and a fluid in recent studies of filtration e g aramideh et al 2018 and sakurai and ishihara 2018 fvp was studied and identified as a key parameter for describing particle concentration distribution in the filter where heterogeneous fluid velocity in space would lead to the localization of particle concentration which in turn leads to clogging or fouling of part of the filter song et al 2020 2 1 3 intrinsic permeability ki the permeability k can measure the filter s ability to allow fluids to pass through it the microstructure parameters of the filter such as pore size thickness and porosity ε together with the fluid properties i e density and viscosity of the flowing fluid ghassemi and pak 2011 all have a considerable effect on k at the macroscopic level and the limit of creeping flow regimes the k is described by darcy s law δ p μ l f i l t e r u k where p µ lfilter and u are the pressure drop dynamic viscosity filter length and fluid velocity respectively in recent years interest in k i is on the rise which is specifically related to the filter microstructure parameters on space availability for fluid flow correlations used for assessing k i are developed around filter microstructure parameters crittenden et al 2012 based on such as carman 1997 kozeny 1927 c k and hagen poiseuille h p stokes 1880 correlations li et al 2006 introduced two parameters k1 and k2 to improve the c k correlation to describe the impact of the deformations and changes in particle packing during the sintering process and are expressed as 1 k i d p k 2 k 1 ε 3 1 ε 2 where k1 is a constant and k2 implies particles shape and aggregate style on the membrane pore size dp is the particle diameter the value of k1 and k2 are 2 499 107 m 0 892 and 1 108 respectively which were regressed by the water permeability experiment data li et al 2006 provided the ceramic membrane is regarded as a bundle of capillaries the h p correlation can be used to predict the permeability li et al 2006 shown as follows 2 k i d p 2 ε 128 as the c k and h p correlations indicate ki is highly sensitive to the qualitative and quantitative changes in the filter microstructure parameters such as the pore size and ε lu et al 2016 ki can be used as an essential indicator to evaluate the filter clogging or fouling rate in filtration processes in recent studies on filtration e g nishiyama and yokoyama 2017 and fu et al 2021 guo 2015 ma et al 2018 ki was studied and identified as a key parameter for the prediction of the filter fouling with their results indicating that ki is an indicator of the filter s capability for the suspension to pass through and thus further studies should be done in the future 2 1 4 hydraulic tortuosity th the hydraulic tortuosity th is commonly used to describe fluid flow pathways in the filter the definition of th is given as clennell 1997 3 t h l h l where lh denotes the length of the effective hydraulic flow path as illustrated in fig 5 and l is the straight line distance through the porous media in the macroscopic flow direction duda et al 2011 and matyka and koza 2012 developed a correlation directly calculates th from the steady state fluid velocity field avoiding the difficulty of identifying individual streamlines as shown below 4 t h ω v r d ω ω v f l o w d i r e c t i o n r d ω v v f l o w d i r e c t i o n where v f l o w d i r e c t i o n r denotes the velocity component over the pore space ω parallel to the macroscopic flow direction at point r eq 4 is widely used as it significantly simplifies the calculation of th for porous media with complicated geometries it is worth mentioning that eq 4 is based on two assumptions the fluid is incompressible and the fluid flow is not re entrant the re entrant effect is negligible for laminar flow with a low re passing through the filter th is greatly affected by the filter morphology such as ε and pore size distribution fu et al 2021 th is an effective indicator that quantifies the complexity of the filter structure and evaluates the anti fouling filter performance hu et al 2020 in recent studies on filtration e g guo 2015 and fu et al 2021 th was investigated and identified as a critical parameter for evaluating the filter s anti fouling performance th is a direct indicator of the filter complex structure thus it should be further examined 2 2 basics of particle dynamic in filtration during the filtration process particle dynamics describes the particle motions through the filter the internal external filter cakes describe the particle dynamic at the representative elementary volume rev scale which are caused by the microscale particle straining and absorption and accumulation respectively boek et al 2012 as shown in fig 6 2 2 1 internal filter cake 2 2 1 1 particle straining particle straining occurs when a pore is completely sealed by the particles fig 7 factors such as pore and particle size distributions affect the filter straining ability zhao et al 2016 a larger pore size raychoudhury et al 2014 and fewer particles barton and buchberger 2007 improve the straining performance particle straining leads to considerable resistance to filtration giving rise to a sharp decline in the filtrate flux rate under constant pressure conditions and a severe increase in the applied pressure for operation under constant flux conditions during filtration iritani 2013 in recent studies of filtration e g barton and buchberger 2007 and zhao et al 2016 particle straining is studied and identified as a key parameter that causes filter fouling when the filter structure effect is evident 2 2 1 2 particle absorption particle absorption is a process in which particles smaller than the pore sizes are continuously transported and absorbed into the pore wall surface simate 2015 sedimentation hydrodynamic dispersion and interception are three key mechanisms of particle absorption fig 8 in recent studies of filtration e g simate 2015 and osiptsov 2017 these mechanisms have been investigated and particle absorption has been identified as the primary cause of filter fouling when the particle property effect is evident thus particle absorption should be further studied in future work sedimentation the particles with a density significantly greater than water tend to deviate from fluid streamlines due to gravitational forces particle size fluid and particle density and fluid velocity field all play an important role in determining sedimentation performance osiptsov 2017 sedimentation performance increased with reduced surface fluid speeds and larger suspended particle size hoyal et al 1997 hydrodynamic dispersion diffusion of brownian particles in the presence of an external flow field where the particles will deviate from the fluid streamlines particle diffusion is determined by particle size fluid velocity and temperature recent research finds that particle diffusion is proportional to the local strain rate consistent with a local quasi static picture and is inversely proportional to the depth of the particles below the granular surface wandersman et al 2012 interception the particles remaining centred on fluid streamlines that pass over the granular particle surface at a distance of half the particle diameter or less will be intercepted choi et al 2014 decreasing the pore size would increase the interception performance bao et al 2012 2 2 2 external filter cake the external filter cake is caused by microscale particle accumulation which is formed on the media surface the filter cake acts as a dynamic filter and can retain smaller particles possibly minimizing particle absorption and improving filtration effectiveness but the filter cake also gives rise to a sharp decline in the filtrate flux due to cake compression during filtration the pore and particle size distributions play an important role in particle accumulation broeckmann et al 2006 in recent studies of filtration e g zhang et al 2013 and yao et al 2018 particle accumulation has been investigated and identified as a major cause of filter fouling when the fluid property effect is noticeable 3 methodologies for filtration studies at microscale in this section the main experimental and numerical methods for studying the fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process are introduced particle image velocimetry piv high speed photography and other methods are introduced in the experimental part and the computational fluid method cfd and discrete element method dem being introduced in the numerical part it is worth to mention that several existing mathematical models can provide us with an overall filtration efficiency but no detailed description of microscale events that happened in the filtration processes although these existing mathematical models of filtration are beyond the scope of this study the relevant references are still cited and reviewed here to highlight the review at microscale the yao model yao et al 1971 rt model rajagopalan and tien 1976 and te model tufenkji and elimelech 2004 can be used to examine the effect of important variables on filter performance however filtration efficiency changes with time are not addressed in these three mathematical models more sophisticated models have been developed to incorporate time dependant phenomena such as ripening darby et al 1992 but it is unable to predict changes in particle removal or head loss when the design or operating conditions change to examine the change in filter performance as solids collect within the filter bed phenomenological filter models have been developed such as the deep bed filtration model dbfm boek et al 2012 3 1 experimental methods fig 9 summarises the available experimental methods for studying fluid and particle dynamics in the filtration process in brief the traditional approach in fluid and particle dynamics research was to exclusively focus on the final static result by optical microscopy van zanten et al 2010 electron microscopy meister and blume 2017 and x ray microscopy storozhenko et al 2015 for optical microscopy an optical resolution of the final results of about 1 μm could be achieved while results can probe into smaller scales using electron and x ray microscopy with a resolution of maybe as high as 0 05 nm however to make further progress in the understanding of the fluid and particle dynamics process dynamical measurements would be necessary and the development in piv spatial resolution of about 1 10 μm and high speed photography spatial resolution of about 1 μm have made such process possible 3 1 1 particle image velocimetry piv is an optical flow visualisation method obtaining instantaneous velocity measurements and related properties in fluids thus it can be used to understand micro scale particle velocity profiles during the filtration process fig 10 a shows the piv set up and the measured local and instantaneous velocities however due to the complex relationship between measurement errors and experimental parameters quantifying the piv uncertainty is far from a trivial task and has often relied upon subjective considerations sciacchitano 2019 recognizing the importance of methodologies for the objective and reliable uncertainty quantification uq of experimental data several piv uq approaches have been proposed in recent years that aim to determine objective uncertainty bounds in piv measurements such as a priori uq and a posteriori uq approaches piv can measure the flow field simultaneously of the entire two dimensional cross section of the filter also particle seeding techniques are applied for piv measurements under extreme high speed conditions where fine and non agglomerated particles are used as tracers chen et al 2017 however piv cannot perfectly follow fluid motion which is mainly ascribed to calibration errors truncation errors in space or time unresolved or under resolved length or time scale or peak locking sciacchitano 2019 3 1 2 high speed photography high speed photography is the method of taking pictures of very fast phenomena allowing for detailed visualization of the fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process by acquiring a series of image frames captured at high temporal and spatial resolution fuller 2009 its working principle depends on the frame rate and exposure time illumination and triggering xing et al 2017 fig 10b shows the schematic of the arrangement of high speed photography carried out with the four high speed cameras and the measured wake structure behind falling and rising spheres however due to the complex measurement conditions the wide application of high speed photography in fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process has still a long way to go xing et al 2017 for example the frame rate and exposure time are smaller under the dynamic impact which poses challenges to the resolutions of high speed cameras therefore a high speed camera with a higher spatial and temporal resolution is always in demand high speed photography will be able to individually follow the progress of filtration or it can be displayed rapidly in sequence as a movie film in slow motion however high speed photography cannot perfectly capture the filtration dynamics properties due to the properties such as high stiffness brittleness and heterogeneity in most filters 3 1 3 other methods in addition to the aforementioned piv and high speed photography methods several other tools were also used to study fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process in the past the dynamics of fluid can be tracked by the laser based piv and laser doppler anemometry lda neumann et al 2009 on the other hand the dynamics of particles can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging mri skuntz et al 2018 and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr o neill et al 2016 the particle s granular temperature which characterizes the velocity fluctuation can be directly detected by magnetic resonance velocimetry mrv reci et al 2018 note that these methods can only track a small number of particles under more strict operation conditions such as adjusted room temperature and larger space and produce results lower in resolution these methods are not described here due to their limited applicability in the studies of filtration processes at the microscale 3 2 numerical methods numerical modelling and simulation as an alternative has become a powerful tool for studying the fluid and particle dynamics during the filtration process currently cfd and dem are widely used to simulate the fluid and particle phases respectively and have been applied in the filtration process in this section the details of cfd dem and coupled cfd dem are introduced in the context of the filtration process and features 3 2 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyse and solve problems that involve fluid flows shen et al 2008 2011 2009 cui et al 2020 yu and shen 2018 the mass and momentum equations are briefly described below the details of which can be found in alves et al 2021 the generalized equation for conservation of mass in a control volume is given below 5 u 0 the momentum equation is 6 ρ f u t p τ ρ f g where u is the velocity vector ρ f is the fluid density t is time g is the gravitational acceleration and τ is the stress tensor describing the fluid rheology finite difference method fdm as reviewed by popescu and popescu 2014 finite element method fem as reviewed by morgan and peraire 1998 and finite volume method fvm as reviewed by boudet 2012 have been developed to solve eqs 5 and 6 on an eulerian grid fdm is conceptually easy to formulate but difficult to accommodate complex geometries the use of fdm is limited in filtration studies since filtration processes are associated with complex microscale geometries keir and jegatheesan 2013 fem is very flexible in terms of geometry and mesh elements but cannot obtain local conservation fem is limited in filtration studies especially for pore scale studies for revealing the underlying filtration mechanisms baker 2016 the principle of fvm is local conservation ensuring local and global flux balance and its formulation can be based on fdm or fem fvm has geometrical flexibility and is applicable in filtration studies especially pore scale studies due to its local conservation feature shen et al 2016 2014 yu and shen 2018 unlike the previous methods that solve the eqs 5 and 6 of macroscopic properties the lattice boltzmann method lbm models the fluid consisting of fictive particles and such particles perform consecutive propagation and collision processes over a discrete lattice lbm is capable of dealing with complex boundaries and incorporating microscopic interactions which has been widely applied in filtration studies song et al 2022 2020 fvm based cfd software packages are available such as ansys fluent liu and shen 2019 zhuo and shen 2020 and openfoam xie et al 2021 yue et al 2019 lbm based cfd software package is also available such as palabos they are widely used for studying filtration processes at different scales these cfd programs can provide insight into the filtration process s detailed fluid flow behaviour and help the designer arrive at an optimum design based on the virtual performance analysis meanwhile cfd analysis can help find the parameter important for the filtration process keir and jegatheesan 2013 note that from a numerical point of view the energy equation considering temperature variations brings no significance to fluid flow during the filtration process which is not covered in this review alves et al 2021 3 2 2 discrete element method dem dem is any of a family of numerical methods for computing the motion and effect of a large number of small particles where newton s second law determines the translational and rotational movements of particles xie et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 the conventional governing equations of particles can be modified by adding the fluid particle interaction force f f i and torque t f i 7 m i d v i d t j f i j n f i j t f g i f f i 8 i i d ω i d t j t i j m i j t f i where mi and ii denote the mass and moment of inertia of particle i respectively v i and ω i are the translational velocity and angular velocities respectively f g is the gravitational force f i j n and f i j t represent the normal and tangential contact forces where the static and dynamic frictions are considered in calculating the friction force in f i j t torque t i j is generated by tangential forces and causes particle i to rotate m i j is the rolling friction torque that opposes the rotation of the i th particle fig 11 shows a collision of two arbitrary shape particles i and j the dem is very closely related to molecular dynamics but the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees of freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries including polyhedra guo and curtis 2015 filtration is a complex flow process associated with nonspherical flexible or cohesive particles where different dem models may be implemented to describe these particles related information can be found in the supplementary material 3 2 3 cfd dem coupling the filtration processes typically involve particle liquid flow cfd dem is the most promising approach for modelling the fluid and particle flow during the filtration process especially fluid and particle dynamics at the microscale cfd dem is divided into three different models unresolved cfd dem semi resolved cfd dem and fully resolved cfd dem generally the filtration process can be associated with three different length scales region scale representative elementary volume rev scale and pore scale he et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 12 the three methods of fully resolved cfd dem unresolved cfd dem and semi resolved cfd dem are carried out for the applicable scale and fluid mesh size to particle mesh size ratio as shown in figs 13 and 14 in general the smaller the fluid mesh size to particle diameter ratio the more accurate the simulation but the larger the calculation cost it is suitable for a smaller scale study the fluid to particle mesh size ratio is 3 0 1 0 and 0 1 for unresolved cfd dem semi resolved cfd dem and fully resolved cfd dem respectively and its applicable scale are region scale rev scale and pore scale respectively these concepts are reviewed below more details on the coupling schemes on the unresolved cfd dem semi resolved cfd dem and fully resolved cfd dem can be found in the supplementary material 4 recent experimental and numerical studies in this section the major finds from previous studies on fluid and particle dynamics in membrane and granular filtration processes are summarised in two groups experimental and numerical methods 4 1 fluid dynamic orientated studies 4 1 1 drag force fd drag force correlations that can be used on the multiphase flow models such as two fluid models tfm zhou 2016 and or the discrete particle method dpm zhu et al 2011 for the numerical study of the filtration process have been proposed particles with arbitrary shapes are associated with the filtration processes table 1 shows the list of fd correlations for spherical and non spherical particles and their applications in different filtration processes for experimental studies hölzer and sommerfeld 2008 proposed a simple correlation for the standard drag coefficient i e a single stationary particle in a uniform flow of arbitrary shaped particles using a large number of experimental data from the literature which can be used for the unresolved and semi resolved numerical studies of any type of filtration processes compared to experimental based studies numerical simulation is an alternative due to its lower cost and better controllability as a resolved cfd method the lattice boltzmann method lbm can simulate fluid flows in complex geometries with detailed fluid field information around the surface of geometries widely used for drag force studies for example drag force correlations applicable for sphere rong et al 2013 ellipsoid rong et al 2015 cubes chen and müller 2018 and cylinders song et al 2021a have been proposed using lbm allowing for the unresolved and semi resolved numerical study of the various filtration process such as granular and ceramic membrane filtration 4 1 2 fluid velocity profile fvp the relationship between pore structures and fvp has been studied mainly by using numerical methods with the objectives of optimisation filter pore structure design and prediction of filtration performance resolved and unresolved cfd have been applied a qualitative relationship between fluid velocity and the filter s porosity has been found by unresolved cfd simulations of a seepage flow through a 3d reconstructed filter based on ct imaging zhang et al 2018a more quantitative results have been delivered with the improvement of the mesh resolution in resolved cfd spatially fluctuating velocity field and the 3d pore space distribution are correlated by high resolution dns simulations of the flow through the filter of two distinct pore structures arising from three dimensional assemblies of overlapping and nonoverlapping spheres aramideh et al 2018 in recent work a detailed fvp near sand particle surface was described and the critical flow velocity and an effective filter surface were proposed which were then used to quantitatively estimate the sand filtration performance song et al 2020 fig 15 shows the velocity distributions for a sand filtration system and pore structure distributions of the sand filter song et al 2020 4 1 3 intrinsic permeability ki the relationship between ki and void ratio and distribution of pores in the filter have been studied with the aim of filter design optimisation in the experimental method the user defined laboratory set up has been applied where it is easy to perform tests on the laboratory constant falling head permeability and field permeability tm 1995 the measured permeability obtained by using laboratory constant and falling head permeability tests is not representative of the field permeability because the filter is destroyed due to sampling techniques in contrast the development of field permeability tests avoids sample disturbance problems hall and trb 2004 kanitpong et al 2005 pumping tests provides an average value of the coefficient of permeability at the test site and are usually used for field permeability tests sahin 2016 for example it is reported that permeability values for silty sand and sand filter lie within the range between 10 3 and 10 6 m s sand size ranges were proved to have a considerable effect on the permeability values carter and bentley 1991 the numerical method lbm a resolved cfd method is mainly applied for quantitative studies it is reported that ki decreases with increased pore structure complexity and surface area of a filter when the factor pded the ratio of max pore diameter to min pore diameter of a filter is used in a study carried out using gpu enhanced multiple relaxation time lbm ma et al 2018 a ki correlation suitable for an asymmetric membrane was proposed as a function of pore size ε and layer thickness h of both top and intermediate layers using a one way coupling lbm dem model song et al 2022 fig 16 shows that ki increases with increased pore size and ε song et al 2022 4 1 4 hydraulic tortuosity th a quantitative relationship between th and filter morphology has been developed with the aim of filter design optimisation mainly by using the resolved cfd a correlation based on the van genuchten type function was proposed for the prediction of th obtained by a series of finite element simulations of the fluid flow through a porous filter saomoto and katagiri 2015 a new hydraulic tortuosity th correlation was proposed by song et al 2021b which is specifically for an elliptical particle filter with the particle shape and filter ε being taken into consideration and was formulated using a pore scale lbm dem model fig 17 shows that th decreases with increased porosity koponen et al 1996 song et al 2021b 4 2 particle dynamic orientated studies 4 2 1 internal filter cake 4 2 1 1 particle straining filter s pore structure and material properties and chemical and physical properties of the fluid are found to affect the particle straining in an experimental study the pore throat trapping due to the physical capture of avalanches and flocculates instead of individual particles was observed in an angular filter crushed limestone by digital photography barton and buchberger 2007 the ionic strength of the water was found to contribute to particle straining by capillary tensiometers with an electronic balance torkzaban et al 2008 particle straining was monitored by computed tomography ct scanning along with pressure measurements and it was concluded that the filter structure arrangement determines the localities where the particle straining happens khan et al 2020 fig 18 shows an experimental set up used in the particle straining study in the studies of numerical methods semi resolved and resolved cfd dem were applied for example particle straining was found to be related to the representative particle size ratio in a numerical study based on semi resolved cfd dem simulations of the particle transport in a base soil filter system zou et al 2013 the complex dependence particle straining behaviour on re and granular filter geometries was investigated by the dns dem method udono and sakai 2017 also it is reported that particle straining is mainly controlled by the particle size the results being obtained by using the semi resolved cfd dem feng et al 2020 fig 19 shows their results obtained by a cfd dem method in a study on particle migration in a porous media 4 2 1 2 particle absorption particle absorption is determined mainly by factors such as filter pore size distribution operation condition particle surface property shape and size in the experimental methods domain quantitatively conclusions have been made for example by developing a spectrophotometer system a linear regression model between particle absorption coefficient and particle composition has been proposed roesler 1998 in another study the particle absorption coefficient of a quartz particle filter was reported by using a laser heating technique in conjunction with laser transmissivity measurements presser 2012 moreover dynamic high speed photography observations were conducted by dersoir et al 2019 to study the particle absorption process especially how particles are absorbed onto the pore wall forming aggregates that eventually merge and block the pore fig 20 shows their typical results on the particle absorption and accumulation in a pore dersoir et al 2019 in studies using the numerical method unresolved and semi resolved cfd dem were applied to evaluate particle treatment and model efficiency absorption of cylindrical particles at the static filter surface was simulated by an unresolved cfd dem along with the multi sphere approach for comparison and the results show that the time for pores to be clogged by the absorbed particle decreased with decreased particle sphericity radjai et al 2017 in a different study cohesive particles were investigated and found to occur at the opening of sand filters by using the coarse grid unresolved and the smoothed unresolved cfd dem razavi et al 2021 a semi resolved cfd dem model with improved computational efficiency was developed to study fine particle absorption within a granular filter consisting of fine and coarse particles cheng et al 2018 further a semi resolved cfd dem was developed by xie et al 2021 based on a smoothed volume distribution model svdm and they found finding that particle absorption by particle bridging caused by the particle absorption and particle locking were the main filtration mechanisms fig 21 shows their typical results on the fine particle migration process of the fluid fine coarse particle system obtained using the unresolved cfd dem model 4 2 2 external filter cake filter geometry fluid and particle property and shape affect external filter cake formation particle accumulation during the filtration process especially for membrane filtration in an experimental investigation an sem energy dispersive x ray analyser edx was used to characterise the structure of the accumulated particles cake layers formed under different fluid flow conditions in terms of physical chemical and microbiological aspects and it was observed that where the filter cake has a loose outer surface compared to the cake at the bottom gao et al 2011 in a separate study the real time particle velocimetry module measurements were performed to evaluate the particle concentration and cake growth during filtration of spherical latex particles and found that membrane geometry has a pronounced influence on the formation of the first deposited layers and this effect persists throughout the later cake growth valencia et al 2020 fig 22 shows a schematic of the experimental set up of the particle velocimetry module and the observed particle accumulation on the membrane surface in the case of the numerical method unresolved and resolved cfd dem were applied to investigate particle accumulation dynamic observation of the initial growth of a cluster at the wall of a membrane microchannel was achieved by an unresolved cfd dem method complying with qualitative experimental features of the fouling process namely cluster morphology the possibility of break up and resuspension and linear growth rate of the cluster projected area onto the channel wall trofa et al 2019 the non spherical particle accumulation was investigated by an unresolved cfd dem method along with a multi sphere model and the results showed that the final void fraction of the accumulated particle cakes increased with decreasing sphericity of the non spherical particle deshpande et al 2020 also an unresolved cfd dem model was used to highlight the effect of flow conditions particle volume fraction cohesion forces and contraction angle on particle accumulation mechanism in a membrane microchannel trofa et al 2021 further they used the resolved cfd dem to identify a more detailed particle accumulation process using an lbm dem model the particle friction coefficient was found to have a core effect on the particle accumulation process where particles first get deposited near the pore entrance trapping subsequent particles mino et al 2018 further an lbm dem model was used to characterise the filter cake resistance effect in terms of the process energy effort with the model enabling the 4 way coupling to consider particle fluid and particle particle and filter medium interactions puderbach et al 2021 fig 23 a shows the simulation results of the unresolved cfd dem where the initial growth of a cluster at the wall of a slit microchannel can be observed and fig 23b shows the comparison with the experimental results trofa et al 2019 5 future issues and outlook 1 there is always a great demand for advanced direct experimental observation techniques for characterizing the fluid particle flow field with a sufficient spatial resolution to quantitatively understand the dynamics of the fluid and particles at the microscale resolved cfd dem models with a higher interfacial force discretization are in need for large scale fluid and particle dynamics meanwhile more precise fundamental models considering the fluid particle interactions such as the fd model virtual mass and bosset force models should be developed and implemented in unresolved and semi resolved cfd dem to improve their accuracy to study the fluid and particle dynamics at the microscale also emphasis should be given to the dem model development that accounts for non spherical flexible and cohesive particles 2 more efforts should be put into mechanism development of determining the fd under different conditions which can help increase the accuracy and applicable range of the fd correlations allowing application in such as industrial scale numerical studies more research on the mechanism development of how fvp controls the particle level forces and determines the behaviours of particles is suggested future research should be conducted to determine the mechanism development of the effect of the real filter complex microstructure on ki the comprehensive effect on th due to mechanism development on the complex filter microstructure is needed to be evaluated finally a thorough investigation of the relationships between fd fvp ki and th is also increasing in demand which will result in the correlations describing or the relationship between such as ki and th fvp and th fvp and fd ki for filters with different morphologies 3 the development of new correlations is in demand for the purpose of more effective quantitative prediction of the particle dynamics and the confirmation of the critical condition for the straining absorption and accumulation happening respectively further studies are suggested to be carried out on the development of the combined physical and chemical effect controlling the different microscale particle dynamics during membrane fouling 4 the underlying mechanism development of how the fluid and particle dynamics intersect with each other during filtration is a need for example how the fvp controls particle dynamics how ki and th reflect the filter morphologies and predicting the particle dynamics in addition investigations on how the dynamics of microscale fluid and particles in the microscale determine macroscale behaviours are suggested by paying attention on such as the applicable conditions and limitations 6 conclusions the review provides a comprehensive overview of microscale fluid and particle dynamics in filtration processes for water treatment and particle technology communities several key topics in filtration processes drag force fluid velocity profile intrinsic permeability and hydraulic tortuosity in microscale fluid dynamics and particle straining absorption and accumulation in microscale particle dynamics are identified and discussed also presented are several key experimental and important computational techniques cfd dem with different resolution scales for investigating filtration processes at microscale considering their applicability and capability the major findings in previous studies on these key topics are comprehensively reviewed in terms of microscale fluid and particle dynamics based on these future research is discussed in terms of techniques scopes and links the key conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the filtration process is based on three phases particle fluid and filter the particle component has dynamic behaviours which include straining absorption and accumulation the fluid component can induce microscale underlying long range hydrodynamic phenomena which include fd on particles fvp in the filter and ki and th of the filter 2 fd is essential to understand the fluid particle interactions and thus similarly important are its correlations applicable for different filtration processes which have been widely investigated in the cases of such as particles with spherical shapes and non spherical shapes fvp can cause localization of particle concentration and lead to filter fouling understanding the relationship between pore structures and fvp can help optimize the filter pore structure design ki is an important indicator to evaluate the filter fouling rate which is highly sensitive to the qualitative and quantitative changes of the filter microstructure parameters such as the pore size and ε th works as an effective indicator that quantifies the complexity of the filter structure and evaluates the filter anti fouling performance which is also greatly affected by the filter microstructures 3 experimental studies of the fluid and particle dynamics have been conducted using piv high speed photography and other methods such as lda mri and nmr the experimental methods can provide qualitative information about the fluid velocity field and also can visualize the fluid and particle dynamics processes however most experimental methods can only provide qualitative information and fail to provide quantitative information of fluid particle flows such as particle particle interactions 4 numerical methods cfd and dem are used to simulate the fluid and particle phases in the filtration process based on the resolution of the fluid phase the cfd dem is divided into unresolved semi resolved and resolved type numerical methods in the unresolved and semi resolved cfd dem fd correlations are used to characterize particle fluid interaction on the other hand resolved cfd dem does not require drag force models because particles are represented not by point masses but by considering their shape in the grid and imposing no slip conditions at the boundary the coupled dem cfd approach is a promising alternative for modelling particle fluid systems since it can capture the discrete nature of the particle phase while maintaining computational tractability the unresolved semi resolved and resolved cfd dem are applicable for the region scale rev scale and pore scale to investigate the filtration process respectively 5 fd correlations based on spherical and non spherical particles can be used on the multiphase flow models for the numerical study of the filtration process fvp is found to be related to particle velocity distribution ki is greatly affected by filter morphology existing ki correlations are proposed for filters that can be considered as a homogeneous material the filter s pore size controls the th which is still insufficient to understand the effect of the filter s inner structure on th 6 particle straining absorption and accumulation result from the physicochemical composition of the feed solution operating conditions and filter characteristics the physicochemical properties of individual feed particles such as shape and size determine the particle dynamics due to specific interactions between the filter and the particles in water operating parameters including feed velocity and feed concentration play a direct effect on particle dynamics the intrinsic characteristic of the filter such as surface roughness pore size and distribution have an important influence on particle filter interactions and thus on particle dynamics disclosure statement the authors are not aware of any biases that might

14949,groundwater is a crucial resource across agricultural civil and industrial sectors the prediction of groundwater pollution due to various chemical components is vital for planning policymaking and management of groundwater resources in the last two decades the application of machine learning ml techniques for groundwater quality gwq modeling has grown exponentially this review assesses all supervised semi supervised unsupervised and ensemble ml models implemented to predict any groundwater quality parameter making this the most extensive modern review on this topic neural networks are the most used ml model in gwq modeling their usage has declined in recent years giving rise to more accurate or advanced techniques such as deep learning or unsupervised algorithms iran and the united

used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater is a rapidly decaying vital resource groundwater quality gwq is a rising issue worldwide due to extensive agricultural and industrial activities and proper management is essential as groundwater provides almost half of all drinking water globally water et al 2016 however groundwater quality is influenced by a variety of environmental and anthropological factors alagha et al 2014 liu et al 2005 understanding these factors is an important step in developing appropriate management strategies machine learning ml is an effective tool for extracting predictive models from data a subset of artificial intelligence ml models use inductive hypothesis to analyze and learn the rules from data without relying on a determined system of equations they show great potential in discovering intrinsic patterns from data and making accurate predictions of water quality parameters in freshwater resources both surface and groundwater ml techniques are capable of learning features with high dimensionality and nonlinear relationships with the help of modern computational hardware and architecture gupta 2021 sze et al

emerge in recent years with a remarkable leap forward in performance key parameters extensively collected from groundwater such as ph nitrate concentration etc can be used to train ml models groundwater quality can be predicted or analyzed by inferring the various stages of the trained model although ml has been applied to predict groundwater quality in many studies there is no modern comprehensive literature review on ml techniques for gwq modeling a parallel study exists a comprehensive survey of artificial intelligence ai techniques for surface water quality modeling tiyasha et al 2020b some recent reviews for groundwater quality only survey techniques for specific parameters che nordin et al 2021 haghbin et al 2021 or focus on specific models kumari et al 2016 shen 2018 others while covering a wide range of models and parameter prediction lack the comprehensiveness owed to the subject haghbin et al 2021 malakar et al 2021 mosaffa et al 2022 in this work we provide a comprehensive review of ml in gw quality modeling covering various contaminants for prediction and a broad range of algorithms the first section is a meta analysis of the literature covering topics such as study focus model inputs publications years and study areas and distribution of models the second part of the paper is a bibliographic review of the literature by ml model category type as shown in fig 1 the model categories were organized by learning type supervised semi supervised unsupervised and ensemble supervised learning was divided into eight categories ann fuzzy svm decision

category conflicting case studies are highlighted intentionally as part of this effort the last section of the paper highlights the results of the general analysis and the bibliographic review and outlines future directions and opportunities for researchers 1 1 introduction to the machine learning process and techniques the training of machine learning models is a process of finding an optimal parameter set of the predictive model through closed form solutions or iterative updating of its parameters through optimization many techniques have been proposed to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning models the input of the machine learning model should be carefully selected for reducing the computational complexity of the machine learning model and improving its predictive performance dimensionality reduction techniques can effectively reduce the input features to mitigate the sparsity of the high dimensional data for better similarity measurement feature learning is also beneficial to extracting effective features as the input of the machine learning model for specific tasks cross validation dividing the dataset as a training dataset and a validation dataset helps to improve the generalization of the predictive model by avoiding overfitting data augmentation can be used to increase the amount of training datasets when the size of the collected dataset is small various optimization methods provide ways of finding the optimal model parameters by reaching a global minima of the loss function gradient descent is the most popular optimization method for differentiable loss functions adaptive learning rate methods help gradient descent find the optimal parameters effectively and efficiently 2 general analysis of trends 2 1 study focus or model prediction fig 2 displays the study focuses for articles on ml in groundwater quality from 1994 to 2022 based on our literature review from nitrate contamination was the most popular study focus with 87 articles focusing on this subject many of these articles repetitively addressed the same problem that is if a certain ml model is viable for nitrate contaminant prediction see section 3 1 1 2 nitrate is a well monitored compound and has been for decades especially in the countries with a prevailing focus on this topic leading to a wealth of data for testing ml models water quality index wqi is the second most studied focus where the authors aim to improve the classification of water quality in a study area fuzzy methods are popular for this purpose due to their ability to deal with uncertainties vadiati et al 2016 a variety of other hydrochemical compounds have been studied such as electrical conductivity ec total dissolved hardness tdh etc these parameters are more common as inputs for ml models in many studies as discussed below in section 2 2 2 2 input parameters and timescales in total there were over 300 unique input parameter types used among all studies only 26 of these parameters were used by 16 or more studies as shown in fig 3 a the most used parameter was ph with 70 studies 35 including it in their input database other chemical water properties commonly used were ec and tds all drastic parameters were also used by more than 15 studies see supplementary material for drastic model explanation fig 3b presents an analysis of the number of input parameters of all studies using ml for groundwater quality and provides a useful insight into algorithm optimization often a goal of these studies is to provide an estimation of water quality using easily obtained data while still providing reasonable accuracy shekofteh et al 2012 many authors have decided 4 6 parameters meets these criteria 26 of all studies used input parameters in this range as often only a few parameters significantly contribute to a model s performance wang et al 2018 wheeler et al 2015 however physiochemical parameters such as cations and anions are easily measured together resulting in a large amount of hydrochemical parameter inputs for certain studies keskin et al 2015 fig 4 contains the data collection routine timescales for all studies over half of all studies did not report the timescale used when collecting data often data was drawn from multiple databases and so temporal resolution was not reported the most common collection timescale reported was seasonally which is useful in areas with seasonal events such as monsoons wagh et al 2017 2 3 machine learning models publications with a focus on supervised models comprise much of all literature unsupervised and ensemble learning techniques make up just 10 and 7 of all published literature respectively only one paper used a semi supervised technique vesselinov et al 2018 within the supervised models ann is the most common model for gw quality modeling it should be noted that many of these papers used several models and fig 5 only lists the model type focus of the papers 2 4 performance metrics fig 6 a displays the most common performance metrics used for model analysis for supervised semi supervised and ensemble learning for unsupervised learning there are no direct metrics for evaluation and must be analyzed case by case rmse is the most used metric followed by the coefficient of determination r2 in total over 50 different performance metrics were used by studies to assess performance most studies used more than one metric to assess performance as shown in fig 6b 2 5 historical trends as with many ml topics the application to groundwater quality modeling has increased rapidly in the last two decades fig 2 fig 7 visualizes the rapid growth that occurred after 2008 papers were collected by october of 2022 so the number of papers in that calendar year will likely be higher uncommon or advanced learning types like unsupervised and ensemble learning have not shown the same growth as supervised learning uncommon or advanced learning types like unsupervised and ensemble learning have not shown the same growth as supervised learning 2 5 1 geographical trends the most studied groundwater systems in the world are in iran with 50 papers studying aquifers or wells in the country the united states contains the second most studied groundwater systems with 39 papers much of central and south america has not been studied at all as well as several countries in europe and asia the continent of africa has been studied twice ouedraogo and vanclooster 2016 ouedraogo et al 2019 but the democratic republic of congo is the only individual country that has been studied kihumba et al 2015 iran had one of the most explosive increases of scientific publications in the world since the turn of the century with a staggering 21 average annual increase in published scientific articles worldbank n d the united states is the next world leader in ml gwq modeling the united states congress started the national water quality assessment nawqa program in 1991 to collect surface and groundwater data in a high quality and consistent manner u s g s n d making it an ideal location for groundwater quality modeling 3 bibliographic review 3 1 supervised learning supervised learning is one of the modalities of fitting a function from samples of input and output pairs this review will focus on the most popular supervised learning algorithms in the domain of

generally contribute to the larger field these studies reached the conclusion that ann back propagation neural network bpann feed forward neural network ffann multi layer perceptron mlp and bayesian neural network bnn were suitable to model groundwater quality with their choice of model architecture in the specific study area beerala et al 2019 darwishe et al 2017 elhatip and kömür 2008 gemitzi et al 2009 heidarzadeh 2017 huang et al 2011 kheradpisheh et al 2015 maiti et al 2013 maria et al 2022 modrogan et al 2010 mohammadi et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2017 sirat 2013 sunayana et al 2020 wagh et al 2018 wagh et al 2017 wang et al 2006 3 1 1 2 1 nitrate leaching prediction bpann or bpnn which is a type of ann trained by error correction learning of backpropagation rumelhart et al 1985 1986 using stochastic gradient descent was used to evaluate nitrate leaching potential in agricultural fields kaluli et al 1998 nitrate contamination through drip irrigation systems li et al 2004 and nitrate concentration in a study area with monsoons charulatha et al 2017 using different variables most of the work showed reasonable prediction of nitrate concentration with r2 values between 0 8 0 9 four separate ann models chittaranjan and k 2000 were used to predict pesticide and nitrate contamination in different types of rural wells the models performed very well during training above 95 for all four but not during testing with an accuracy between 80 and 90 percent for drilled and driven wells but only 50 for predicting nitrate in dug and bored wells another study compared the metamodeling technique multidimensional kriging to radial basis function neural network rbfnn for nitrate leaching modeling using simulated data rbfnn is one type of ffnn whose connections between nodes do not form a cycle or loop and uses radial basis function rbf as activation function the kriging model performed slightly better than the rbfnn model only in some conditions piñeros garcet et al 2006 metamodels made of anns were developed to predict nitrate leaching in the unsaturated zone all performed very well in testing except for the simple model nolan et al 2012 ann was used to modify the drastic index results were compared to a composite drastic index and a nitrate vulnerability index and found that the ann had the highest accuracy of the three baghapour et al 2016 multiple linear regression mlr principal component regression pcr ann and principal component coupled with ann pc ann were applied for application to nitrate prediction and found that pc ann performed the best for both pre and post monsoon charulatha et al 2017 previously pc ann was found to have a lower mean absolute error in predicting arsenic in southeast asian countries than mlr or ann cho et al 2011 3 1 1 2 2 ann for modeling hydrogeologic variables and groundwater quality a multi layer ffnn was used to estimate unknown groundwater pollution sources and hydraulic conductivity porosity and dispersivity singh and datta 2004 data for the study was simulated by a physical model allowing the authors to add varying uncertainty levels the study found that the model performance decreased as the dataset uncertainty increased another work used a gauss newton ann to model pedotransfer functions the model was able to work with as little as two variables and was superior to a least squares fit model fuentes et al 2014 ann with quick propagation qpann was evaluated as an option for groundwater salinity mediation banerjee et al 2011 the model was trained with 2 years of real time field data and used to develop a pumping schedule that can stabilize salinity of groundwater below 2 5 of the seawater for a span of 5 years a practical study coupled a wireless water quality network wwqn with an ann model to give real time predictions of groundwater quality kılıçaslan et al 2014 innovative ann architecture for example rbfnn coupled with a fuzzy cluster method was found to increase the efficiency for groundwater quality prediction azimi et al 2019 an extreme learning machine elm model a ffnn that utilizes moore penrose generalized inversion to set its weights without updating them was found to be most efficient and had the highest predictive performance in comparison to mlp and svm models when used to predict the level of fluoride contamination in the groundwater barzegar et al 2017 mlp was used as a surrogate model for bayesian based differential evolution adaptive metropolis with discrete sampling markov chain to reduce the computational cost for a contaminant source simulation and was found to reduce simulation time by over 80 percent while keeping model results fairly accurate an et al 2022 3 1 1 2 3 comparison between ann and statistical learning methods and among multiple ann models comparisons between ann and other statistical learning methods are commonly found bpnn was found to have lower predictive error for estimating nitrate and electrical conductivity when comparing with linear regression lr or mlr in multiple studies laafou et al 2016 ramasamy et al 2003 zare et al 2011 ann however performed the worst in another study when compared with boosted regression tree brt bayesian network mlr and random forest regression rfr for nitrate contamination nolan et al 2015 ggap rbf network was compared to three sequential learning algorithms for nitrate prediction in groundwater and was found to be more successful at prediction wang et al 2005 ann performed the best in estimating groundwater electrical conductivity when compared to several kriging and co kriging models maroufpoor et al 2019 comparisons among multiple nn models are also commonly reported in groundwater quality modeling modular neural network mnn and classical ann models were compared for nitrate prediction and found that the mnn outperformed the best ann model but not better than a traditional model developed by modflow for the steady state ground water flow model and mt3d for nitrate fate and transport almasri and kaluarachchi 2005b twelve different bpnn architectures were compared for predicting nitrate contamination in a shallow aquifer and the levenberg marquardt algorithm based bpnn was selected as the best with a model correlation coefficient of 0 93 yesilnacar et al 2008 bpnn outperformed rbfnn and anfis models for pesticide prediction in domestic wells sahoo et al 2005 and better than rbfnn for nitrate prediction zaqoot et al 2018 however another work compared brnn and rbfnn and found no statistically significant difference in performance ehteshami et al 2016 bpnn and rbfnn models were compared for both nitrate contamination and drainage flow in agricultural fields and the rbfnn model outperformed the bpnn model for both inputs that included and excluded field tillage data sharma et al 2003 mlp was found to be the best network with a correlation of 0 9773 when comparing with two other neural network models i e rbfnn and generalized regression neural network grnn al mahallawi et al 2012 mlp was compared to convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm for predicting wqi in malaysia lstm performed the best on the dataset for nearly all performance measures sheikh khozani et al 2022 lstm mlr and ann models were compared for prediction of irrigation groundwater quality parameters for this study ann performed the best since the lstm model was not very generalizable to the testing data kouadri et al 2022 3 1 1 3 ann model assessment ann has proven to be a viable method for predicting groundwater quality variables such as nitrate concentration as shown in fig 5b ann models are the most popular algorithm in groundwater quality modeling due to their high accuracy and ease of implementation based on the predictions they have applications for management purposes such as well installation chittaranjan and k 2000 and water remediation banerjee et al 2011 kılıçaslan et al 2014 ann also has large flexibility in the number of input parameters it can provide reasonable estimates of nitrate concentrations with as few as 4 input parameters r 2 0 93 maria et al 2022 yesilnacar et al 2008 or as many as 41 parameters mae 7 nolan et al 2015 the applicability of ann with a small number of parameters is especially useful as comprehensive datasets are rare and difficult to use using a few easily measurable parameters makes it feasible for local and municipal governments to apply ann models often the performance of the ann model is highly dependent on selection of input parameters and model architecture traditional ann performs more poorly than bnn and brt at high numbers of input parameters due to overfitting nolan et al 2015 svm and anfis models have been shown to provide higher accuracy predictions of ec tds khaki et al 2015 and arsenic concentrations park et al 2016 than anns however results are not consistent with model performance due to uncertainties in feature selection and model architecture ann has outperformed anfis in two studies khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 sahoo et al 2005 and has shown no statistical difference with svm in two others dixon 2009 khalil et al 2005 many studies found more advanced ann models such as rbfnn and rbfnn performed better than traditional ann models several studies reported opposite results ehteshami et al 2016 sahoo et al 2005 zaqoot et al 2018 genetic algorithms have been proven to boost ann accuracy almasri and kaluarachchi 2005a moasherip0f and abadip4f 2012 as well as principal component analysis charulatha et al 2017 cho et al 2011 in a similar vein committee neural networks improve the predictive accuracy of multiple types of neural networks barzegar et al 2018 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 thus ann can be modified to improve performance instead of being replaced with another model altogether despite a recent decline it will likely be the dominant ml algorithm in groundwater and surface water quality for years 3 1 2 fuzzy methods 3 1 2 1 introduction to fuzzy methods fuzzy method or analysis is one of the modalities to solve problems with uncertainty where the fuzzy logic cintula et al 2021 zadeh 1965 is utilized neuro fuzzy system nfs berenji and khedkar 1992 buckley and hayashi 1994 buckley and yoichi 1995 halgamuge and glesner 1994 combines artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic to learn the parameters in fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules using backpropagation or genetic algorithm or other optimization tools they are especially useful for classification problems where a wqi is modified or improved through fuzzy methods 3 1 2 2 applications of fuzzy methods in groundwater quality modeling 3 1 2 2 1 viability of neuro fuzzy methods for groundwater quality modeling and wqi classification dixon et al 2001 was the reported that a neuro fuzzy method with the trapezoidal membership function can be used to predict groundwater vulnerability this model was most sensitive to soil structure properties and land use variables another work varied the number of fuzzy sets the rule weights and the membership functions and found that the trapezoidal membership function was the least sensitive to permutations in the model setup dixon 2005 adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis is the most widely used approach of nfs anfis models have been used to predict nitrate contamination in agricultural lands jebastina and prince arulraj 2018 and potato fields shekofteh et al 2012 with satisfactory performance an anfis model linked to latin hypercube sampling to propagate uncertainty of the model parameters was used to estimate global arsenic concentrations with the highest model performance at an r square of 0 65 amini et al 2008 anfis was found to outperform the traditional tds based method for estimating ec tutmez et al 2006 and could estimate how ec affected the water composition of the study area a study found that the number of parameters was the only significant factor on the performance of anfis and the parameter combination was non significant mousavi and amiri 2012 when applied to predict nitrate concentration in an agricultural district of india the performance of anfis increased with the increase of parameters and achieved a determination coefficient of close to 90 with only 5 variables jebastina and prince arulraj 2018 neuro fuzzy methods have been used to classify agricultural groundwater pollution dahiya et al 2007 muhammetoglu and yardimci 2006 a mamdani fuzzy inference model was applied to predict three wqis and performed well for both wet and dry seasons vadiati et al 2016 anfis was used to train models under average climate and extreme temperature conditions to modify a drinking water quality index radfard et al 2019 another work found weights of evidence wofe a statistical categorical predictor 7 classifications provided higher quality results than neuro fuzzy for wqi prediction uhan 2012 3 1 2 2 2 other neuro fuzzy models different types of neuro fuzzy methods were applied to gwq modeling co active anfis canfis is an extension of anfis with capabilities of taking any number of input output pairs and typically performs better when mapping nonlinear function canfis was found to have satisfactory performance for groundwater quality assessment gholami et al 2017 and also performed better than ann and self organizing map som for wqi prediction gholami et al 2022 catastrophe fuzzy membership functions were used to improve both the general drastic and pesticide drastic methods sadeghfam et al 2016 a fuzzy linear optimization model was applied to find optimal factor weights for the drastic index asadi et al 2017 a fuzzy logic control system was used for improving bioremediation control systems in situ the system was able to reduce the contamination from significantly to slightly contaminated hu et al 2003 3 1 2 2 3 comparative studies of anfis to other ml models a few works performed comparative studies of anfis to other ml models al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 khaki et al 2015 khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 the anfis with generalized bell membership function was found to perform the best for predicting both tds and ec when comparing with ffnn and a cascade forward network khaki et al 2015 an anfis model outperformed ann and mlr models for all performance metrics for predicting tds and ec al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 however another study compared ann and geostatistical methods for spatial prediction of ec and found that the ann model outperformed anfis and the geostatistical methods khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 3 1 2 3 neuro fuzzy model assessment fuzzy models are perhaps the most user friendly models with their linguistic outputs and ability to manage uncertainties their usefulness in classification problems makes them a popular choice for wqi problems in general fuzzy models are capable of successfully classifying groundwater quality and improving traditional wqis such as drastic asadi et al 2017 sadeghfam et al 2016 fuzzy models are not only used for classification problems anfis models can outperform ann models in predicting tds and ec if proper types and functions are used al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 khaki et al 2015 anfis improves on the benefits of ann with the advantage of fuzzy reasoning leading to problem simplification and noise reduction and thus more accurate results al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 however in one study khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 ann was found to be a superior model over anfis for ec prediction the study used only three parameters for the best model whereas eleven khaki et al 2015 and six al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 parameters were used in other studies results likely come from the purely nonlinear approach in parameter optimization and the fuzzy inference system reflecting ambiguity of observed data khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 possibly it is simply a problem of the number of parameters which lets the fuzzy inference system overcompensate for any errors in the limited data regardless anfis and other fuzzy models are excellent methods for predicting a variety of groundwater contamination parameters and predicting water quality for management purposes it is also a faster method than ann khaki et al 2015 giving it a practical advantage in implementation 3 1 3 support vector machine svm 3 1 3 1 introduction of svm svm is a versatile ml model which can solve classification and regression tasks in its most basic form svm is a maximum margin classifier that maximizes the width of the gap between distinct categories because the naive maximum margin classifier uses hard margin for separation it is sensitive to outliers svm overcomes this issue by utilizing a support vector classifier or soft margin classifier cortes and vapnik 1995 that finds the optimal soft margin that gives the best classification score through cross validation among support vectors within the range of soft margin smv can also perform non linear classification by utilizing a kernel trick boser et al 1992 additional introduction of svm can be found in the supporting information s2 2 4 3 1 3 2 application of svm in groundwater quality modeling svm has been applied largely to predict nitrate concentrations in groundwater except for three studies which focused on other contaminants such as sodium and arsenic isazadeh et al 2017 liu et al 2020 park et al 2016 the validity of svm for nitrate contamination prediction was assessed and shown to be satisfactory arabgol et al 2016 a study integrated svm into the parametric agricultural nitrate hazard index ipnoa model rizeei et al 2018 lr was used for weighting optimization of the svm before the final prediction was made which led to a higher accuracy than the regular ipnoa 91 32 and 85 3 respectively liu et al s work j liu et al 2020 marked the first successful effort to apply one class svm to groundwater anomaly detection with real time data svm was compared with ann models in multiple studies dixon 2009 isazadeh et al 2017 khalil et al 2005 park et al 2016 when compared with a locally weighted projection regression lwpr and relevance vector machine rvm a method similar to svm but that uses bayesian inference to provide probabilistic classification for nitrate prediction khalil et al 2005 rvm performed the best followed by svm and ann which was attributed to model architecture choices and may not be consistent in all study areas when compared for nitrate prediction svm and nn performed similarly in the validation phase 0 55 and 0 59 accuracy respectively feature selection did not improve accuracy but did lower the number of necessary variables for prediction dixon 2009 when compared for ec sodium and sulfate concentration prediction svm had lower uncertainty than ffnn isazadeh et al 2017 ann and svm were compared for identifying groundwater arsenic concentrations and svm was found to be more accurate park et al 2016 svm along with classification and regression tree cart and random forest rf was evaluated as part of a wrapper selection study for optimizing feature selection for nitrate prediction models rodriguez galiano et al 2018 the highest performing svm model was sequential forward selection svm however the best cart and the best rf model were superior to sfs svm 3 1 3 3 svm model assessment svm models have been found to accurately predict nitrate concentration arabgol et al 2016 khalil et al 2005 and other hydrochemical compounds isazadeh et al 2017 park et al 2016 additionally they have advantages over ann models for example svm models do not rely critically on network structure selection the biggest weakness of ann they are also less prone to overfitting because there is no need for iterative training in addition they are faster khalil et al 2005 despite these advantages results are not conclusive on svm superiority over ann for groundwater quality modeling svm models still rely on kernel function selection which may affect results as they use different methods to map data into higher dimensions researchers should expect results of these comparisons to be dependent on model architecture area specific and not generalizable to other research areas e g surface water svm was shown to be inferior to cart and rf for feature selection rodriguez galiano et al 2018 but superior to brt and multi discriminant analysis mda for nitrate contamination prediction sajedi hosseini et al 2018 as with all models discussed here an ensemble approach was able to improve svm individual performance sajedi hosseini et al 2018 regardless svm is a sturdy model capable of achieving low uncertainty under reasonable computational demands isazadeh et al 2017 most studies on svm are recent and there is clearly still work left on this topic 3 1 4 regression models 3 1 4 1 introduction to regression models the regression model predicts the dependent variable from one or more independent variables through a function that estimates their relationships regression analysis is generally used for predicting the target value of missing input other than the training samples 3 1 4 2 application of regression models in groundwater quality modeling several of the earliest studies used a ml logistic regression model to accurately predict nitrate contaminations a liu et al 2005 nolan et al 2002 selenium thresholds nolan and clark 1997 and groundwater vulnerability teso et al 1996 these models are now often used as a benchmark comparison to demonstrate alternate model superiority more advanced regression models such as multivariate regression multiple linear regression mlr and regression trees were later introduced to study nitrate contamination and source pollution boy roura et al 2013 kihumba et al 2015 mattern et al 2009 nolan 2001 mlr is still a useful modern tool mlr outperformed ann for predicting water quality index types in nigeria akakuru et al 2022 3 1 4 3 regression model assessment lr and mlr have been shown repeatedly to be superior to computationally costly physical models but in the current research meta they are the benchmark for the lowest acceptable accuracy for example rf models are highly superior to lr models ouedraogo et al 2019 tesoriero et al 2017 wheeler et al 2015 3 1 5 decision tree and random forest 3 1 5 1 introduction to decision tree and random forest decision trees dt are a type of supervised ml where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter and trees consist of decision nodes and leaves the random forest rf is a classification algorithm consisting of many dts rf randomly selects observations and features to build each individual tree to create an uncorrelated forest of trees biau and scornet 2016 3 1 5 2 application of decision tree and random forest in groundwater quality modeling one study used only dt to predict water quality classifications which was found to be more precise and efficient than principal component analysis saghebian et al 2014 rf was used to predict nitrate and arsenic concentrations and allowed for a general assessment of the vulnerability of basin fill aquifers anning et al 2012 when used to predict pollution in agricultural groundwater an rf model only needed four explanatory variables when driving forces such as anthropological effects were added to water quality parameters v rodriguez galiano et al 2014 rf was used to locate the sources and flow paths of dissolved organic nitrogen don in groundwater based on landscape characteristics b wang et al 2018 in conjunction with a fuzzy method rf was able to determine the wqi and groundwater quality index gqi norouzi and moghaddam 2020 rf has shown satisfactory performance for fluoride modeling in india j e podgorski et al 2018 and arsenic modeling in uruguay wu et al 2021 rf was supplemented with global information system gis for spatiotemporal assessment and prediction of groundwater nitrate contamination with a high accuracy judeh et al 2022 at a large scale rf and quantile rf were used with the european water framework to estimate national redox and nitrate groundwater conditions at high resolution knoll et al 2020 a methodology was proposed to accommodate the computational demands of large datasets using rf and national scale predictions of groundwater redox class for new zealand were presented wilson et al 2020 rf with shapley additive explanations shap was compared to kriging to derive insight on nitrate modeling was found to be more accurate than the traditional method w li et al 2022 rf and a generalized boosted regression model were combined into a final model for analysis of physiochemical parameter relationships by creating spatial maps showing relationships between manganeses iron and arsenic podgorski et al 2022 classification and regression tree cart model was used for prediction of gwqi assessment in india which achieved low error and produced results for the soil types by gwqi singha et al 2022 rf performed better for nearly all benchmarks when comparing to linear regression for predicting the occurrence of redox active constituents in groundwater tesoriero et al 2017 rf has been found to be superior to mlr regression tree linear regression kriging models generalized additive model gam cart brt rf svm naïve bayes and c4 a tree based algorithm for modeling nitrate in private wells in rural areas wheeler et al 2015 at the continental scale issoufou ouedraogo et al 2019 in the arab emirates khan et al 2021 and using exclusively spatial predictors knoll et al 2019 rf has also been found to be superior multiple discriminant analysis mda and brt for susceptibility prediction of groundwater hardness mosavi et al 2020 and ann for prediction of wqi in an urban area anjum et al 2021 five tree based models were used for arsenic risk prediction in a region in india rf optimized forest cost sensitive forest cs forest split point and attribute reduced classifier spaarc and reduced error pruning rep tree the most accurate was optimized forest with rf close behind while the least accurate was cs forest and rep tree kumar and pati 2022 random forest was found to have the best classification performance for groundwater arsenic prediction compared to dt mlp and naïve bayes algorithm siddharth kumar and pati 2022 rf and a k nearest neighbor knn model had the highest accuracy for prediction of water quality class in india compared to linear discriminant analysis cart and svm models mogaraju 2022 a study used numerical model outputs as predictors to create a hybrid boosted regression tree model i e dts with continuous outcome for predicting nitrate concentration ransom et al 2017 a conditional inference forest cif a dt that utilizes unbiased recursive partitioning of dependent variables based on the value of correlations was paired with a physical model in a groundwater vulnerability analysis the metamodel allowed for multiple simulations of the computationally expensive physical model with a higher than 60 agreement in gw sites for predicted classes soriano et al 2021 3 1 5 3 decision tree and random forest model assessment rf models are less of a black box than other ml models that is researchers may glean information about parameters connections b wang et al 2018 however rf models can struggle with accuracy and availability of anthropologic data knoll et al 2020 v rodriguez galiano et al 2014 additionally the size of the tree based algorithm can be a restriction 3 1 6 comparative studies 3 1 6 1 introduction to comparative studies some studies compare models without intention of selecting a best model and optimizing it for the study area or without intention of comparing a novel model to a base model these studies are collected in this section 3 1 6 2 application of comparative studies in groundwater quality modeling four algorithms mlp anfis svm and gene expression programming gep were compared for estimating tds and gep was found to be superior jafari et al 2019 rf demonstrated a slightly lower error than anfis logistic regression mode lrm fuzzy and adaptive fuzzy regression afr for groundwater arsenic prediction bindal and singh 2019 bpnn evolutionary polynomial regression epr and the naive bayes model nbm were compared across seven performance metrics for predicting nitrogen concentration on a weekly basis no single model significantly outperformed any of the others in all analysis markus et al 2010 additive regression ar surpassed the accuracy of svm m5p tree model m5p and random subspace rss for wqi prediction in india elbeltagi et al 2022 thirteen ml algorithms were compared for dissolved organic nitrogen prediction in an urban setting bagged mars rf and cubist a rule based model that utilizes decision tree and regression quinlan and others 1992 were the most optimal models with the most generalizability benya wang et al 2016 for comparison of seven ml algorithms for arsenic prediction cubist performed the best in training however rf and bagged tree were the best models for internal validation de menezes et al 2020 svm was found to have superior performance to rf flexible discriminant analysis fda mixture discriminant analysis mda brt and mars for groundwater salinity mapping mosavi et al 2021 hosseini et al found that instance based k nearest neighbors outperformed kstar m5p locally weighted learning and regression by discretization for fluoride contamination prediction khosravi et al 2020 3 1 6 3 comparative studies assessment comparative studies contain models that have only appeared once in ml gwq modeling literature these studies serve the purpose of assessing less common models for completion of the literature however it is important to note that these studies do not necessarily agree on model superiority and should be taken on a case by case basis for example one study concluded that svm was the most accurate of six models including mars for groundwater salinity mapping mosavi et al 2021 however another found that of their thirteen models tested for dissolved organic nitrogen prediction mars was among the top three whereas two different svm models were not benya wang et al 2016 this example reinforces the danger of generalizability in comparative studies 3 1 7 optimization techniques optimization techniques are practices of optimizing the performance of the predictive model from various aspects widely used techniques include efficient searching for the optimal parameter set of the model feature engineering for effective feature learning and improving the stability and accuracy of learning algorithms 3 1 7 1 introduction to genetic algorithms genetic algorithms gas katoch et al 2021 lambora et al 2019 yang 2020 inspired by natural selection are part of evolutionary algorithms eas which are generic population based metaheuristic optimization algorithms genetic algorithms utilize biologically inspired operations like mutation crossover and selection to provide solutions for optimization and search genetic algorithms can deal with complex problems across diverse types of optimizations to make genetic algorithms converge the parameters of the specific genetic algorithm need to be carefully selected and a wide range of options exists a brief description on gas particularly on variations of gas mentioned in the sections below can be found in the supporting information section 2 2 5 3 1 7 2 application of genetic algorithms in groundwater quality modeling 3 1 7 2 1 improving model performance with ga bpnn and ga have been integrated and was found to perform better than other ann models for nitrate prediction almasri and kaluarachchi 2005a moasherip0f and abadip4f 2012 the bee algorithm ba a population based algorithm that mimics the food foraging behavior of honeybee colonies with good convergence to the global optimum was used with bpnn for prediction of water pollution sources which showed significantly higher accuracy than the unmodified bpnn keskin et al 2015 an fnn svr hybrid model was optimized with ga and needed less parameters than mlr hosseini and mahjouri 2014 the viability of elm modified by crow search algorithm csa for predicting groundwater quality was evaluated and found to be more accurate than the unmodified elm liu et al 2017 and to raise the accuracy of anfis for prediction of specific conductance zounemat kermani et al 2022 pso and ga optimization of anfis were not found to be statistically different for modeling ec ph and cl jalalkamali 2015 for wqi prediction a pso naïve bayes classifier slightly outperformed a pso svm model agrawal et al 2021 pso was also used with nn and empirical bayesian kriging for prediction of physiochemical and metallic parameters in an island area de jesus et al 2021 senoro et al 2022 the firefly algorithm ffa a global optimization algorithm inspired by flashing behavior of firefly insects was shown to improve performance in ann anfis svm mars and rf models for prediction of groundwater parameters of which svm ffa and ann ffa were the most robust a combination of pca pso and svm was optimized to evaluate water quality category the pca pso svm model performed better than the pso svm the svm and a bpnn model and had a 99 percent accuracy ni et al 2022 3 1 7 2 2 ga comparative studies several studies compared the performance of multiple genetic algorithms against each other banadkooki et al 2020 kisi et al 2019 ritzel et al 1994 pareto ga was found to be superior to a vector evaluated ga for solving a multi objective groundwater pollution containment problem ritzel et al 1994 continuous genetic algorithm cga was found to be overall superior to pso and ant colony optimization for continuous domains acor for training and optimization of anfis for modeling ec total hardness and sodium adsorption ratio sar in groundwater kisi et al 2019 moth flame optimization mfo and cat swarm optimization cso have also showed better performance in optimization of anfis for tds compared to pso and three other gas banadkooki et al 2020 three studies compared gas against other algorithms aryafar et al 2019 najafzadeh et al 2022 wu et al 2017 ga was compared to generalized linear regression decision tree and gradient boosted tree for nitrate prediction wu et al 2017 while the ga did the least over underestimating of the models it was not very robust when comparing genetic programming gp to ann and anfis for estimating th tds and ec the gp model was superior aryafar et al 2019 evolutionary polynomial regression epr and gene expression programming gep were compared against m5 model tree and multivariate adaptive regression spline mars for wqi prediction and epr had the highest accuracy najafzadeh et al 2022 gep was also used to predict salinity and ec in iran khalaj et al 2019 3 1 7 3 genetic algorithm model assessment ga is a popular method for improving model results with a wide range of options they provide advantages over ann and anfis models by structural independence and protection from over fitting and early convergence due to their crossover and mutation operators aryafar et al 2019 they are also remarkably consistent every study that modified existing algorithms found that gas improve model performance additionally they can work with as few as three parameters banadkooki et al 2020 jalalkamali 2015 or more than 10 parameters hosseini and mahjouri 2014 ransom et al 2017 more evolutionary models have been tested in recent years such as csa and pso there is not a clear consensus from the literature if these newer models have an advantage in groundwater quality modeling jalalkamali 2015 kisi et al 2019 however the new models are just as viable for predicting groundwater quality keskin et al 2015 liu et al 2017 because of their consistency flexibility and compatibility with other models gas will continue to be a useful tool for researchers 3 1 7 4 introduction to wavelet transform wavelet transform chui 1992 daubechies 1992 debnath and shah 2002 was proposed to solve constant time and frequency resolution caused by the fixed length of the window used in short time fourier transform stft wavelet transform uses wavelet as the basis function rather than the window function to realize multiresolution analysis by controlling the width of the wavelet and its central frequency wavelet transform and its discrete version discrete wavelet transform dwt akansu and haddad 1992 are effective tools of doing feature engineering to select optimal features from raw data as training data wavelet transform can also be directly used in ml architectures like wavelet neural networks wnn alexandridis and zapranis 2013 which combine wavelet analysis with neural networks to approximate deterministic functions 3 1 7 5 application of wavelet transform in groundwater quality modeling wavelet transform is a common surface water modeling technique but few studies have used wavelet transform techniques for groundwater quality modeling a study used electromagnetic sensor arrays as input for a mlp with wavelet transform for feature selection to estimate groundwater quality the model could predict nitrate and sulfur concentration even in the presence of other contamination nor et al 2015 another study optimized a mlp with a wavelet neural network wnn and bpnn for assessing shallow groundwater quality yang et al 2017 wavelet transform along with self organizing map som and mutual information mi was used to extract features for modeling nitrate time series with ffnn the hybrid coupling improved the performance of the ffnn by up to 39 and was able to predict nitrate load in the study area s sub basins and outlet nourani et al 2017 3 1 7 6 wavelet transform model assessment wavelet transform can decompose non stationary data nourani et al 2017 this temporal preprocessing can improve models as it can find trends discontinuities and other data anomalies that other preprocessing techniques might miss yang et al 2017 thus far it has only been applied to improve an mlp model and ann models and used in preprocessing for a hybrid ffnn model while wavelet transform has some flexibility in selection of the mother wavelet this does affect results and can compound on ann model architecture selections yang et al 2017 however wavelet transform is a useful tool for improving results if the complexity of application is not an issue 3 1 7 7 introduction to bagging and boosting boosting is an ensemble learning method for reducing variance and overfitting in a sequential way by adjusting the weight of sample as each base model is evaluated hastie et al 2009 gradient boosting gbt or boosted regression tree brt friedman 2002 hastie et al 2009 is an ensemble learning model using decision trees as base models 3 1 7 8 application of bagging and boosting in groundwater quality modeling brt has been used for predicting arsenic chakraborty et al 2020 m l erickson et al 2018 lombard et al 2021 manganese melinda l erickson elliott brown stackelberg ransom reddy et al 2021 ph stackelberg et al 2021 redox conditions melinda l erickson et al 2021 and nitrate concentration ransom et al 2022 in various glacial aquifer systems in the united states brt was found to be a cheap and reliable method for real time groundwater level and nitrate concentration predication mettu and latifi 2021 extreme gradient boosting xgb a specific implementation of gradient boosting with regularization to improve the generalization of the model was found to be superior to dnn and mlr for mapping groundwater salinity sahour et al 2020 and ann and svm for nitrate and pesticide prediction bedi et al 2020 xgb performed the best for improving a groundwater vulnerability prediction framework when compared with adaboost rf light gradient boosting machine lgbm and categorical boosting catboost barzegar et al 2021 adaptive boosting adaboost was found in two instances to have higher predictive performances than rf ann and svr for predicting irrigation water quality although the svr and ann models showed higher generalization potential el bilali et al 2021 trabelsi and ali 2022 random forest regression rfr the extreme gradient boosting regression xgbr the catboost regression cbr and the light gradient boosting regression lgbr were compared for salinity prediction in coastal aquifers with the cbr model reaching the best accuracy and stability tran et al 2021 however for arsenic prediction rf was found to have better capabilities chakraborty et al 2020 for nitrate xgboost showed superior performance ransom et al 2022 3 1 7 9 bagging and boosting model assessment the robustness and computational restrictions of a model can be addressed with boosting a popular method is xgb although others exist and have been studied for gw quality modeling xgb has been shown to have higher accuracy than ann dnn and mlr models for prediction of nitrate salinity and pesticides in groundwater bedi et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 it is also comparable to svm bedi et al 2020 although generalized boosted models gbm and brt are not as accurate mosavi et al 2021 benya wang et al 2016 3 1 8 deep learning 3 1 8 1 introduction to deep learning deep learning is part of ann based machine learning algorithms whose network architecture is constructed with multilayer perceptron mlp to achieve better predictive capability while maintaining a moderate complexity of the network deep learning methods are capable of effectively modeling complex relationships from observations its training and inferencing performance can be improved by leveraging modern hardware accelerated parallelization 3 1 8 2 application of deep learning in groundwater quality modeling the deep neural network dnn emulator was found to be able to model simple contaminant transport much faster than mlp for contaminant transport modeling yu et al 2020 recently dnns have been compared to several models for both ammonium perović et al 2021 and wqi singha et al 2021 prediction and provided remarkably high predictive performance r2 0 996 singha et al 2021 a dnn model showed significant improvement over ann and svr models for ammonium prediction in alluvial groundwater perović et al 2021 for prediction of wqi and entropy water quality index ewqi dnn performed better than gbm and extreme gradient boosting xgb results for the boosting methods are mixed for the two indices raheja et al 2022 cnn and dnn outperformed rf and xgb for estimation of groundwater quality parameters such as tds potential salinity sodium adsorption ratio and chloride in a coastal aquifer using only ec and ph as input parameters taşan et al 2022 however for nitrate prediction in an unconfined aquifer xgb was more accurate than a dnn and mlr model gholami and booij 2022 a dnn was used for point source identification in a simulated groundwater quality scenario the authors projected the high dimensional problem into a lower dimension and so the proposed network provided a good surrogate of a transport system without losing accuracy with the autoregressive strategy reducing the dnn computational time mo et al 2019 3 1 8 3 deep learning model assessment deep learning is a promising field of study in computer science and especially in groundwater quality modeling while the number of case studies is still small deep neural networks have consistently performed better than conventional ml models such as ann for supervised groundwater quality modeling perović et al 2021 singha et al 2021 taşan et al 2022 although deep learning network is an effective type of predictive model with capability of modeling complex functions on high dimension input several aspects have to be taken care of while training the network for example a larger amount of training data is needed to train a complex deep learning network with good generalizability practices like regularization are also necessary to prevent the model from overfitting 3 2 semi supervised 3 2 1 introduction to semi supervised ml models semi supervised learning chapelle et al 2009 zhu and goldberg 2009 zhu 2005 is a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning and it utilizes a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training the success of semi supervised learning depends on the critical assumptions which are continuity cluster and manifold popular semi supervised learning includes self training mixture models co training multi view learning graph based methods low density separation and semi supervised support vector machines 3 2 2 application of semi supervised ml models in groundwater quality modeling a study proposed a new groundwater contaminant source identification method which used a non negative matrix factorization nmf method for blind source separation bss coupled with a custom semi supervised clustering algorithm vesselinov et al 2018 the authors had previously applied this method to identify the sources of pressure fluctuations in water alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 the semi supervised k means clustering algorithm could unmix the geochemical signatures in the observations and identify the contaminant sources and was found to be capable of identifying both the number of groundwater types and the original concentration of the contaminant sources from mixtures without any mixing ratio or site information 3 2 3 semi supervised model assessment semi supervised algorithms are rare in water quality modeling as of 2020 they had not been used for river water quality modeling tiyasha et al 2020a and have been only used once for gwq modeling as of 2022 the method provided promising results and could be an emerging topic for researchers focused on contaminant source identification 3 3 ensemble learning 3 3 1 introduction of ensemble learning ensemble learning haykin and network 2004 opitz and maclin 1999 polikar 2006 is a modality of ml where multiple base learning models weak learners are aggregated to obtain better predictive performance than any of the base learning models alone the aggregation is achieved by using meta algorithms like bagging boosting and stacking in this review models are grouped into committee neural networks cnn ensemble fuzzy models and others 3 3 2 application of ensemble learning in groundwater quality modeling 3 3 2 1 committee neural networks committee machine or committee neural network cnn haykin and network 2004 is a type of ensemble learning utilizing multiple neural networks as base models and combining the predictions of base models into a final prediction with higher accuracy a cnn of three nn models i e mlp rbfnn and grnn were compared for groundwater salinity prediction and the cnn outperformed any individual model in rmse and r2 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 a cnn was used with elm mars m5 and svr for improving drastic predictions in terms of the correlation coefficient r and willmott index d cnn was clearly superior to any individual method barzegar et al 2018 ensemble of anns was compared to ann with early stopping and ann with bayesian regularization for prediction of wqi but did not higher correlation coefficient in both training and testing data set than the bayesian regularization algorithm sakizadeh 2016 3 3 2 2 ensemble fuzzy models ensemble fuzzy models yang et al 2006 combine various fuzzy logic methods with ensemble learning for better performance ensemble fuzzy models have been applied exclusively to improving drastic method performance a few studies barzegar et al 2016 fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2013 used supervised committee machine with artificial intelligence scmai to predict fluoride concentration and improve the drastic method each study ran sugeno fuzzy logic sfl mamdani fuzzy logic ann and neuro fuzzy nf individually for the problem before testing the scmai some results showed that they each fit the data for fluoride prediction similarly nadiri et al 2013 nf was shown to be the best of the individual models in one study area fijani et al 2013 and in another both nf and sfl performed very well barzegar et al 2016 all studies observed that the scmai was able to further improve on any individual model s performance another study found that in the validation phase for improving drastic performance supervised committee fuzzy logic scfl and committee fuzzy logic cfl had higher correlation coefficients than three individual fuzzy logic models nadiri et al 2017 3 3 2 3 other ensemble models three different ml types brt mda and svm and an ensemble of these three models were compared for groundwater risk assessment for a region in iran and the ensemble approach surpassed all individual models sajedi hosseini et al 2018 two similar studies reached the same conclusion for an area of pakistan awais et al 2021 and a different iran region rokhshad et al 2021 radial basis neural networks rbnn support vector regression svr and ensemble random forest regression rfr were compared for nitrate contamination evaluation the ensemble model performed the best elzain et al 2022 rf gradient boosted machine svm and ann along with bagging ensemble model were used to model nitrate concentration in private wells no model performed well r2 0 33 and final rf model outperformed the bagging ensemble models messier et al 2019 a 2022 study compared bagging bagged decision trees random forest and extra trees boosting adaboost and stochastic gradient boosting and ensemble methods logistic regression knn decision tree svm and naïve bayes for wqi prediction the highest accuracy was achieved by the ensemble model bagged decision trees and gradient boosting shrivastava et al 2022 3 3 3 ensemble model assessment ensemble models are a powerful tool for gw quality prediction virtually all ensemble modeling studies have shown that cnns ensemble fuzzy models and ensemble models of other ml algorithms can improve predictive capabilities an ensemble approach can eliminate weaknesses of each individual model and provide a more robust prediction however ensemble models are not always perfect advancements for example one study found that an rf model had a higher r2 value than the bagging ensemble model which used r2 as the only performance metric messier et al 2019 another study found that the cnn had the lowest rmse but not the highest r2 value but it also outperformed any individual model in terms of correlation coefficient r and willmott index of agreement barzegar et al 2018 in general ensemble models outperform other models in various performance metrics barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 elzain et al 2022 although they may have lower r2 values 3 4 unsupervised learning unsupervised learning barlow 1989 hinton et al 1999 is an algorithm that can discover hidden patterns and insights from the dataset without labels common unsupervised learning tasks include clustering association and principal component analysis pca 3 4 1 self organizing maps som 3 4 1 1 introduction of som self organizing map som also known as self organizing feature map sofm or kohonen self organizing feature maps ksofm kohonen 1982 kohonen et al 1996 kohonen and honkela 2007 is an unsupervised neural network that clusters high dimensional data and transforms high dimensional features into low dimensional two dimensional features while preserving symmetrical relationships between samples 3 4 1 2 application of self organizing maps in groundwater quality modeling soms have been used for point source identification modification of neural networks prediction of hydrochemical parameters and in conjunction with clustering hong and rosen 2001 nakagawa et al 2016 nourani et al 2015 the first study to use som generated u matrix maps which allowed the authors to find site specific correlations between variables by comparing these maps to the real world hong and rosen 2001 som was able to provide high quality area specific interpretable results to classify the groundwater data choi et al 2014 when som was used with a ffnn to model the som ffnn method improved the accuracy of predictions 84 5 and 17 for modeling ec and tds respectively on average with regard to the mlr model nourani et al 2015 a modified som msom was found to perform better than three supervised mlas i e lda brt and rf in predicting oxic mixed and anoxic conditions for a groundwater redox condition study in an agriculturally dominant region friedel et al 2020 svm with pca and hierarchal clustering analysis hca was used for identifying hydrological pathways and ion sources in aquifer systems in japan rahman et al 2022 som was coupled with clustering algorithms in several studies a study used som with k means and ward s algorithms for clustering to identify surface and groundwater chemistry classes and determined pathways for certain chemicals nakagawa et al 2016 som and fuzzy c means fcm clustering were able to identify distinct and interpretable clustering groups when evaluating urban lee et al 2019 and som with hierarchal clustering hca achieved this for regional groundwater quality zhong et al 2022 3 4 1 3 som model assessment soms offer insights into parameter connections and point source identification as well as improvements on predictions of gwq parameters they can capture insight on complex variable relationships with no a priori knowledge of physical transport mechanisms the application of som in groundwater quality modeling is still an emerging field and has little generalizability overall soms can be useful tools for local or regional groundwater management 3 4 2 clustering 3 4 2 1 introduction to clustering clustering rokach and maimon 2005 xu and wunsch 2008 is an unsupervised ml task that automatically separates data into groups according to the similarities of samples specified by certain type of distance metric clustering has been used to identify unknown connections among parameters and improve other ml techniques k means algorithm forgy 1965 lloyd 1982 macqueen and others 1967 is a centroid model for partitioning data into k clusters through iteration where each cluster is represented by a single mean vector 3 4 2 2 application of clustering in groundwater quality modeling clustering such as factor analysis fa cluster analysis ca and k means clustering was used to understand variable relationships factor analysis fa and cluster analysis ca were used along with a hydrochemical model package phreeqc to model hydrochemical properties of a small island aquifer inspecting the elements of each cluster led to explain the three most significant processes affecting the groundwater aquifer aris et al 2011 k means clustering was used to understand spatial variations in groundwater chemistry to identify pathways and study the effects of industrial and agricultural activities on two aquifers fabbrocino et al 2019 hybrid bn was used to apply probabilistic clustering for assessing groundwater quality and predictive uncertainty which optimized the number of samples needed for an accurate estimate by ignoring samples with high error probability aguilera et al 2013 hierarchal clustering analysis hca method was used in a similar manner to visualize hydrochemical links in algeria hca identified three water quality groups and allowed the authors to draw links between hydraulic pathways and geology selmane et al 2022 clustering was also used to improve existing ml methods the effect of k means clustering on two ml techniques ann and svm was evaluated for predicting nitrate concentration the clustered aggregate svm performed slightly better than the clustered ann alagha et al 2014 quantile regression qr and uncertainty estimation based on local errors and clustering uneec were applied to ml models svm rf and k nn in groundwater nitrate contamination prediction the uneec methods had similar predictive performance statistics as rf but better than svm 3 4 2 3 clustering model assessment clustering methods for studying relationships among parameters is a useful tool they have been shown to provide information on processes affecting aquifers aris et al 2011 fabbrocino et al 2019 but much like som the results are not generalizable to other study areas however clustering can be an excellent preprocessing tool for other ml algorithms such as ann and svm alagha et al 2014 or for assessing uncertainties rahmati et al 2019 while it is difficult to compare methods there are more user friendly parameter assessment methods som and more rigorous model enhancement methods ensemble ga than clustering however it can be an appropriate tool where uncertainties are an important aspect of a study 3 4 3 artificial intelligence with multiple frameworks aifm a few studies used multiple ml frameworks in parallel or sequential to construct a comprehensive unsupervised learning pipeline for better data analysis and pattern discovery for specific domains to improve the basic drastic framework bdf see section 2 2 for a brief explanation of the drastic framework one study used bdf parallel to aimf with least squares svm ls svm and fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf to map aquifer vulnerability both frameworks were weak on their own when using n as measure of vulnerability however the aimf strategy with ls svm produced a high accuracy in testing another study used four drastic variations with svm for the aimf the aimf was able to enhance the correlation of coefficient value to nearly double of the best drastic variation nadiri et al 2018 various combinations of ann neuro fuzzy fuzzy logic gep svm ga bdf and fcf were used in supervised and unsupervised ensemble techniques for modeling a tropical island aquifer the best model combined the unsupervised bdf and bdf fcf with the supervised bdf ga and bdf gep using ls svm displaying the advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning types nadiri et al 2019 unsupervised combinations of gqi and gwqi indexes were applied twice to predict iran groundwater quality and this combination performed better when compared to nitrate arsenic maps in that regions najib et al 2022 sedghi and nadiri 2022 like supervised ensemble models multiple frameworks combine several models at once however the models combined are variations of the bdf which are unsupervised the models can also be combined in some supervised method nadiri et al 2018 2018 multiple frameworks can clearly enhance the performance of the unsupervised frameworks for prediction of groundwater quality parameters nadiri et al 2018 2018 for problems with an unsupervised problem set multiple frameworks can be a powerful tool for the enhancements of weaker frameworks 4 conclusions and future work groundwater quality modeling using ml continues to grow as a field this review covered over 200 papers on ml water quality modeling for prediction and management of groundwater as concise and accessible as possible without risking oversimplification the first part of the study analyzed the literature as a group and uncovered important trends the amount of work on this topic increased rapidly in the early 2010 s and continues to grow in recent years fig 2 the world leaders in publications in this field are iran and the united states fig 8 nitrate is by far the most studied groundwater quality parameter fig 2 a great many parameters are viable for these types of prediction fig 3a although the number of parameters used often hovers between 3 and 8 to take advantage of readily available data or 13 20 to take advantage of common hydrochemical parameters fig 3b a wealth of models has been applied to groundwater quality modeling for supervised learning models ann is the most common followed by fuzzy natural and svm fig 5b additionally interest in unsupervised and alternative supervised models has increased rapidly in the last 12 years the second part of the assessment focused on the results from each publication by model type a brief description of the basic model type gave a basic understanding of the use then an in depth bibliography and a model assessment focused on the strengths and weaknesses of each model ann models are the most popular algorithm due to their high accuracy ease of implementation and flexibility in number of input parameters the performance of ann models are highly dependent on selection of input parameters and model architecture as such performance of ann models compared to other model types such as svm or anfis or other ann model types such as rbfnn is not consistent svm and fuzzy methods are also heavily dependent on architecture and hyperparameter selection increasing the likelihood of conflicting results model optimization techniques such as wavelet transform and genetic algorithms intend to eliminate some heuristic error in the base models but don t always achieve this methods such as random forest and deep learning show more constant results when compared to other model types the random forest model achieves high accuracy from its model structure and can manage large missing and outlier data well ensemble learning attains this as well and is another promising avenue for groundwater quality modeling deep learning can also achieve high accuracy and can manage unstructured data well however these models are all black box models while potentially highly useful for gw quality management they do not offer much insight for researchers as groundwater modeling through ml continues to expand there are several areas for future researchers that should be addressed which are discussed in the following section 4 1 future work 4 1 1 implementation of best practices machine learning for hydrology especially forecasting methods is facing a modern evaluation of historical misapplication gharib and davies 2021 zheng et al 2018 wavelet transform especially is prone to error often resulting from data preprocessing and handling du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 as the interest in ml for managing and forecasting gw quality grows it is important to understand the missteps and limitations of these models especially when related to data selection and handling without proper implementation of current standards and best practices for steps like data splitting model architecture and model evaluation results from the expanding field will be muddied with errata 4 1 2 cessation of duplicate studies many papers on ann only described how an ann model may be applied to a certain study area they did not provide any innovate data pre or postprocessing ideas or amplify or modify the model to a degree that contributed significantly to the literature this repetition is a trap for authors to avoid 4 1 3 application of deep learning deep learning is a rapidly developing field of machine learning that shows promise in hydrology shen 2018 so far it has been applied minimally to gw quality modeling mo et al 2019 perović et al 2021 singha et al 2021 making this one of the biggest and most exciting opportunities in groundwater research with the growth of gw water data collection lifelong learning ll parisi et al 2019 is a promising direction to solve the catastrophic forgetting issue when training an existing network on newly collected data meta learning hospedales et al 2022 gives a systematic solution to automatically learn a learning model from datasets with good optimization on the hyperparameters for higher prediction accuracy with a cheaper training process this will generally help researchers discover insight for designing suitable learning algorithms in gw water research 4 1 4 explainable ai explainable ai xai is another emerging tool in machine learning unlike many models discussed in this paper such as ann which are black box models xai is a theory that aims to provide interpretation and visualization to users on the processes studied through various techniques samek et al 2019 a big weakness of current ml studies right now is the caveat that all results may only hold in the specific study area which has led to several discrepancies among model performance results for practical studies to make an impact they must be applicable outside of the study area and xai will be a useful tool for this purpose as human explainable results will allow for larger generalizability 4 1 5 exploration of underrepresented models many models have only been studied once for gw quality modeling and the highest performers along with models that have never been applied to the subject should be explored further similarly model enhancement techniques such as genetic algorithms have not been applied to all models and implemented in gwq modeling 4 1 6 accessibility of supplementary materials to allow for greater standards and stricter benchmarks it is suggested that more researchers allow materials such as code and data to be open source and available to the public the advantages of more databases are clear but freely available code would allow for validation across multiple study areas and potentially provide insights from one group to another 4 1 7 application to new study areas many studies took advantage of the massive and historical datasets available in areas such as iran and the united states there are large areas of the world that have not had groundwater quality assessment through ml and could benefit from the analysis the models will also be tested for robustness through this method 4 1 8 inclusion of infrequently used parameters many parameters such as anthropological effects or long term climate conditions are difficult to obtain or estimate for a dataset however they can be powerful indicators in the present and their exclusion in a dataset may invalidate the model after future changes in the study area researchers should consider a wide variety of input parameters to account for this 4 1 9 practical application of machine learning for groundwater quality management this review has displayed overwhelming evidence of the power of machine learning for groundwater quality modeling groundwater quality management is short in this area application of machine learning for this purpose would reduce the cost in both time and resources of testing for groundwater quality the bulk of literature aims to evaluate the viability of machine learning for groundwater quality forecasting to increase the accuracy and accessibility of groundwater quality prediction but the literature does not provide clear steps to bridge the gap between academia and industrial and governmental management an increased cooperation between data scientists and municipal authorities such as increased open source machine learning code and results adaptation of water quality monitoring systems with machine learning in mind and increased local funding for machine learning projects is necessary so that the proper evaluation and management of groundwater can be guided by machine learning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14949,groundwater is a crucial resource across agricultural civil and industrial sectors the prediction of groundwater pollution due to various chemical components is vital for planning policymaking and management of groundwater resources in the last two decades the application of machine learning ml techniques for groundwater quality gwq modeling has grown exponentially this review assesses all supervised semi supervised unsupervised and ensemble ml models implemented to predict any groundwater quality parameter making this the most extensive modern review on this topic neural networks are the most used ml model in gwq modeling their usage has declined in recent years giving rise to more accurate or advanced techniques such as deep learning or unsupervised algorithms iran and the united states lead the world in areas modeled with a wealth of historical data available nitrate has been modeled most exhaustively targeted by nearly half of all studies advancements in future work will be made with further implementation of deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence or other cutting edge techniques application of these techniques for sparsely studied variables the modeling of new or unique study areas and the implementation of ml techniques for groundwater quality management keywords machine learning deep learning groundwater quality ai data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater is a rapidly decaying vital resource groundwater quality gwq is a rising issue worldwide due to extensive agricultural and industrial activities and proper management is essential as groundwater provides almost half of all drinking water globally water et al 2016 however groundwater quality is influenced by a variety of environmental and anthropological factors alagha et al 2014 liu et al 2005 understanding these factors is an important step in developing appropriate management strategies machine learning ml is an effective tool for extracting predictive models from data a subset of artificial intelligence ml models use inductive hypothesis to analyze and learn the rules from data without relying on a determined system of equations they show great potential in discovering intrinsic patterns from data and making accurate predictions of water quality parameters in freshwater resources both surface and groundwater ml techniques are capable of learning features with high dimensionality and nonlinear relationships with the help of modern computational hardware and architecture gupta 2021 sze et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 optimized for machine learning algorithms mlas especially for deep learning emmert streib et al 2020 lecun et al 2015 shrestha and mahmood 2019 data centric ml methods started to emerge in recent years with a remarkable leap forward in performance key parameters extensively collected from groundwater such as ph nitrate concentration etc can be used to train ml models groundwater quality can be predicted or analyzed by inferring the various stages of the trained model although ml has been applied to predict groundwater quality in many studies there is no modern comprehensive literature review on ml techniques for gwq modeling a parallel study exists a comprehensive survey of artificial intelligence ai techniques for surface water quality modeling tiyasha et al 2020b some recent reviews for groundwater quality only survey techniques for specific parameters che nordin et al 2021 haghbin et al 2021 or focus on specific models kumari et al 2016 shen 2018 others while covering a wide range of models and parameter prediction lack the comprehensiveness owed to the subject haghbin et al 2021 malakar et al 2021 mosaffa et al 2022 in this work we provide a comprehensive review of ml in gw quality modeling covering various contaminants for prediction and a broad range of algorithms the first section is a meta analysis of the literature covering topics such as study focus model inputs publications years and study areas and distribution of models the second part of the paper is a bibliographic review of the literature by ml model category type as shown in fig 1 the model categories were organized by learning type supervised semi supervised unsupervised and ensemble supervised learning was divided into eight categories ann fuzzy svm decision tree and random forest linear regression comparative deep learning and optimization techniques optimization techniques were further divided into bagging and boosting genetic algorithms and wavelet transform unsupervised learning was divided into three categories self organizing map som multiple frameworks mf and clustering studies were placed into these categories based on the primary algorithm studied the bibliographic review consists of 1 a theoretical overview of the basic model structure 2 a brief review of the application of the model in gw quality modeling by topic and 3 an assessment of the model based on factors such as accuracy applicability ease range of use these model assessment sections are intended to compare results and summarize the large body of work in each model category conflicting case studies are highlighted intentionally as part of this effort the last section of the paper highlights the results of the general analysis and the bibliographic review and outlines future directions and opportunities for researchers 1 1 introduction to the machine learning process and techniques the training of machine learning models is a process of finding an optimal parameter set of the predictive model through closed form solutions or iterative updating of its parameters through optimization many techniques have been proposed to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning models the input of the machine learning model should be carefully selected for reducing the computational complexity of the machine learning model and improving its predictive performance dimensionality reduction techniques can effectively reduce the input features to mitigate the sparsity of the high dimensional data for better similarity measurement feature learning is also beneficial to extracting effective features as the input of the machine learning model for specific tasks cross validation dividing the dataset as a training dataset and a validation dataset helps to improve the generalization of the predictive model by avoiding overfitting data augmentation can be used to increase the amount of training datasets when the size of the collected dataset is small various optimization methods provide ways of finding the optimal model parameters by reaching a global minima of the loss function gradient descent is the most popular optimization method for differentiable loss functions adaptive learning rate methods help gradient descent find the optimal parameters effectively and efficiently 2 general analysis of trends 2 1 study focus or model prediction fig 2 displays the study focuses for articles on ml in groundwater quality from 1994 to 2022 based on our literature review from nitrate contamination was the most popular study focus with 87 articles focusing on this subject many of these articles repetitively addressed the same problem that is if a certain ml model is viable for nitrate contaminant prediction see section 3 1 1 2 nitrate is a well monitored compound and has been for decades especially in the countries with a prevailing focus on this topic leading to a wealth of data for testing ml models water quality index wqi is the second most studied focus where the authors aim to improve the classification of water quality in a study area fuzzy methods are popular for this purpose due to their ability to deal with uncertainties vadiati et al 2016 a variety of other hydrochemical compounds have been studied such as electrical conductivity ec total dissolved hardness tdh etc these parameters are more common as inputs for ml models in many studies as discussed below in section 2 2 2 2 input parameters and timescales in total there were over 300 unique input parameter types used among all studies only 26 of these parameters were used by 16 or more studies as shown in fig 3 a the most used parameter was ph with 70 studies 35 including it in their input database other chemical water properties commonly used were ec and tds all drastic parameters were also used by more than 15 studies see supplementary material for drastic model explanation fig 3b presents an analysis of the number of input parameters of all studies using ml for groundwater quality and provides a useful insight into algorithm optimization often a goal of these studies is to provide an estimation of water quality using easily obtained data while still providing reasonable accuracy shekofteh et al 2012 many authors have decided 4 6 parameters meets these criteria 26 of all studies used input parameters in this range as often only a few parameters significantly contribute to a model s performance wang et al 2018 wheeler et al 2015 however physiochemical parameters such as cations and anions are easily measured together resulting in a large amount of hydrochemical parameter inputs for certain studies keskin et al 2015 fig 4 contains the data collection routine timescales for all studies over half of all studies did not report the timescale used when collecting data often data was drawn from multiple databases and so temporal resolution was not reported the most common collection timescale reported was seasonally which is useful in areas with seasonal events such as monsoons wagh et al 2017 2 3 machine learning models publications with a focus on supervised models comprise much of all literature unsupervised and ensemble learning techniques make up just 10 and 7 of all published literature respectively only one paper used a semi supervised technique vesselinov et al 2018 within the supervised models ann is the most common model for gw quality modeling it should be noted that many of these papers used several models and fig 5 only lists the model type focus of the papers 2 4 performance metrics fig 6 a displays the most common performance metrics used for model analysis for supervised semi supervised and ensemble learning for unsupervised learning there are no direct metrics for evaluation and must be analyzed case by case rmse is the most used metric followed by the coefficient of determination r2 in total over 50 different performance metrics were used by studies to assess performance most studies used more than one metric to assess performance as shown in fig 6b 2 5 historical trends as with many ml topics the application to groundwater quality modeling has increased rapidly in the last two decades fig 2 fig 7 visualizes the rapid growth that occurred after 2008 papers were collected by october of 2022 so the number of papers in that calendar year will likely be higher uncommon or advanced learning types like unsupervised and ensemble learning have not shown the same growth as supervised learning uncommon or advanced learning types like unsupervised and ensemble learning have not shown the same growth as supervised learning 2 5 1 geographical trends the most studied groundwater systems in the world are in iran with 50 papers studying aquifers or wells in the country the united states contains the second most studied groundwater systems with 39 papers much of central and south america has not been studied at all as well as several countries in europe and asia the continent of africa has been studied twice ouedraogo and vanclooster 2016 ouedraogo et al 2019 but the democratic republic of congo is the only individual country that has been studied kihumba et al 2015 iran had one of the most explosive increases of scientific publications in the world since the turn of the century with a staggering 21 average annual increase in published scientific articles worldbank n d the united states is the next world leader in ml gwq modeling the united states congress started the national water quality assessment nawqa program in 1991 to collect surface and groundwater data in a high quality and consistent manner u s g s n d making it an ideal location for groundwater quality modeling 3 bibliographic review 3 1 supervised learning supervised learning is one of the modalities of fitting a function from samples of input and output pairs this review will focus on the most popular supervised learning algorithms in the domain of groundwater quality modeling including artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis deep learning decision tree and random forest regression models comparative studies and optimization techniques 3 1 1 artificial neural network ann 3 1 1 1 introduction of ann ann kleene 2016 yegnanarayana 2009 inspired by biological neural networks is a unified framework that automatically learns parameters of the predictive model from data this automatic process of updating parameters is generally achieved by backpropagation anns generally consist of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer different ann models can be created by modifying various architectures input structures and layers brief descriptions of various ann models introduced in this section can be found in the supplementary materials s2 2 2 3 1 1 2 application of ann in groundwater quality modeling fifteen studies focused on the applicability of neural networks to model groundwater quality including predicting nitrate leaching hydrological variables and groundwater quality they compared input output selections address data gaps or practical applications or generally contribute to the larger field these studies reached the conclusion that ann back propagation neural network bpann feed forward neural network ffann multi layer perceptron mlp and bayesian neural network bnn were suitable to model groundwater quality with their choice of model architecture in the specific study area beerala et al 2019 darwishe et al 2017 elhatip and kömür 2008 gemitzi et al 2009 heidarzadeh 2017 huang et al 2011 kheradpisheh et al 2015 maiti et al 2013 maria et al 2022 modrogan et al 2010 mohammadi et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2017 sirat 2013 sunayana et al 2020 wagh et al 2018 wagh et al 2017 wang et al 2006 3 1 1 2 1 nitrate leaching prediction bpann or bpnn which is a type of ann trained by error correction learning of backpropagation rumelhart et al 1985 1986 using stochastic gradient descent was used to evaluate nitrate leaching potential in agricultural fields kaluli et al 1998 nitrate contamination through drip irrigation systems li et al 2004 and nitrate concentration in a study area with monsoons charulatha et al 2017 using different variables most of the work showed reasonable prediction of nitrate concentration with r2 values between 0 8 0 9 four separate ann models chittaranjan and k 2000 were used to predict pesticide and nitrate contamination in different types of rural wells the models performed very well during training above 95 for all four but not during testing with an accuracy between 80 and 90 percent for drilled and driven wells but only 50 for predicting nitrate in dug and bored wells another study compared the metamodeling technique multidimensional kriging to radial basis function neural network rbfnn for nitrate leaching modeling using simulated data rbfnn is one type of ffnn whose connections between nodes do not form a cycle or loop and uses radial basis function rbf as activation function the kriging model performed slightly better than the rbfnn model only in some conditions piñeros garcet et al 2006 metamodels made of anns were developed to predict nitrate leaching in the unsaturated zone all performed very well in testing except for the simple model nolan et al 2012 ann was used to modify the drastic index results were compared to a composite drastic index and a nitrate vulnerability index and found that the ann had the highest accuracy of the three baghapour et al 2016 multiple linear regression mlr principal component regression pcr ann and principal component coupled with ann pc ann were applied for application to nitrate prediction and found that pc ann performed the best for both pre and post monsoon charulatha et al 2017 previously pc ann was found to have a lower mean absolute error in predicting arsenic in southeast asian countries than mlr or ann cho et al 2011 3 1 1 2 2 ann for modeling hydrogeologic variables and groundwater quality a multi layer ffnn was used to estimate unknown groundwater pollution sources and hydraulic conductivity porosity and dispersivity singh and datta 2004 data for the study was simulated by a physical model allowing the authors to add varying uncertainty levels the study found that the model performance decreased as the dataset uncertainty increased another work used a gauss newton ann to model pedotransfer functions the model was able to work with as little as two variables and was superior to a least squares fit model fuentes et al 2014 ann with quick propagation qpann was evaluated as an option for groundwater salinity mediation banerjee et al 2011 the model was trained with 2 years of real time field data and used to develop a pumping schedule that can stabilize salinity of groundwater below 2 5 of the seawater for a span of 5 years a practical study coupled a wireless water quality network wwqn with an ann model to give real time predictions of groundwater quality kılıçaslan et al 2014 innovative ann architecture for example rbfnn coupled with a fuzzy cluster method was found to increase the efficiency for groundwater quality prediction azimi et al 2019 an extreme learning machine elm model a ffnn that utilizes moore penrose generalized inversion to set its weights without updating them was found to be most efficient and had the highest predictive performance in comparison to mlp and svm models when used to predict the level of fluoride contamination in the groundwater barzegar et al 2017 mlp was used as a surrogate model for bayesian based differential evolution adaptive metropolis with discrete sampling markov chain to reduce the computational cost for a contaminant source simulation and was found to reduce simulation time by over 80 percent while keeping model results fairly accurate an et al 2022 3 1 1 2 3 comparison between ann and statistical learning methods and among multiple ann models comparisons between ann and other statistical learning methods are commonly found bpnn was found to have lower predictive error for estimating nitrate and electrical conductivity when comparing with linear regression lr or mlr in multiple studies laafou et al 2016 ramasamy et al 2003 zare et al 2011 ann however performed the worst in another study when compared with boosted regression tree brt bayesian network mlr and random forest regression rfr for nitrate contamination nolan et al 2015 ggap rbf network was compared to three sequential learning algorithms for nitrate prediction in groundwater and was found to be more successful at prediction wang et al 2005 ann performed the best in estimating groundwater electrical conductivity when compared to several kriging and co kriging models maroufpoor et al 2019 comparisons among multiple nn models are also commonly reported in groundwater quality modeling modular neural network mnn and classical ann models were compared for nitrate prediction and found that the mnn outperformed the best ann model but not better than a traditional model developed by modflow for the steady state ground water flow model and mt3d for nitrate fate and transport almasri and kaluarachchi 2005b twelve different bpnn architectures were compared for predicting nitrate contamination in a shallow aquifer and the levenberg marquardt algorithm based bpnn was selected as the best with a model correlation coefficient of 0 93 yesilnacar et al 2008 bpnn outperformed rbfnn and anfis models for pesticide prediction in domestic wells sahoo et al 2005 and better than rbfnn for nitrate prediction zaqoot et al 2018 however another work compared brnn and rbfnn and found no statistically significant difference in performance ehteshami et al 2016 bpnn and rbfnn models were compared for both nitrate contamination and drainage flow in agricultural fields and the rbfnn model outperformed the bpnn model for both inputs that included and excluded field tillage data sharma et al 2003 mlp was found to be the best network with a correlation of 0 9773 when comparing with two other neural network models i e rbfnn and generalized regression neural network grnn al mahallawi et al 2012 mlp was compared to convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm for predicting wqi in malaysia lstm performed the best on the dataset for nearly all performance measures sheikh khozani et al 2022 lstm mlr and ann models were compared for prediction of irrigation groundwater quality parameters for this study ann performed the best since the lstm model was not very generalizable to the testing data kouadri et al 2022 3 1 1 3 ann model assessment ann has proven to be a viable method for predicting groundwater quality variables such as nitrate concentration as shown in fig 5b ann models are the most popular algorithm in groundwater quality modeling due to their high accuracy and ease of implementation based on the predictions they have applications for management purposes such as well installation chittaranjan and k 2000 and water remediation banerjee et al 2011 kılıçaslan et al 2014 ann also has large flexibility in the number of input parameters it can provide reasonable estimates of nitrate concentrations with as few as 4 input parameters r 2 0 93 maria et al 2022 yesilnacar et al 2008 or as many as 41 parameters mae 7 nolan et al 2015 the applicability of ann with a small number of parameters is especially useful as comprehensive datasets are rare and difficult to use using a few easily measurable parameters makes it feasible for local and municipal governments to apply ann models often the performance of the ann model is highly dependent on selection of input parameters and model architecture traditional ann performs more poorly than bnn and brt at high numbers of input parameters due to overfitting nolan et al 2015 svm and anfis models have been shown to provide higher accuracy predictions of ec tds khaki et al 2015 and arsenic concentrations park et al 2016 than anns however results are not consistent with model performance due to uncertainties in feature selection and model architecture ann has outperformed anfis in two studies khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 sahoo et al 2005 and has shown no statistical difference with svm in two others dixon 2009 khalil et al 2005 many studies found more advanced ann models such as rbfnn and rbfnn performed better than traditional ann models several studies reported opposite results ehteshami et al 2016 sahoo et al 2005 zaqoot et al 2018 genetic algorithms have been proven to boost ann accuracy almasri and kaluarachchi 2005a moasherip0f and abadip4f 2012 as well as principal component analysis charulatha et al 2017 cho et al 2011 in a similar vein committee neural networks improve the predictive accuracy of multiple types of neural networks barzegar et al 2018 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 thus ann can be modified to improve performance instead of being replaced with another model altogether despite a recent decline it will likely be the dominant ml algorithm in groundwater and surface water quality for years 3 1 2 fuzzy methods 3 1 2 1 introduction to fuzzy methods fuzzy method or analysis is one of the modalities to solve problems with uncertainty where the fuzzy logic cintula et al 2021 zadeh 1965 is utilized neuro fuzzy system nfs berenji and khedkar 1992 buckley and hayashi 1994 buckley and yoichi 1995 halgamuge and glesner 1994 combines artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic to learn the parameters in fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules using backpropagation or genetic algorithm or other optimization tools they are especially useful for classification problems where a wqi is modified or improved through fuzzy methods 3 1 2 2 applications of fuzzy methods in groundwater quality modeling 3 1 2 2 1 viability of neuro fuzzy methods for groundwater quality modeling and wqi classification dixon et al 2001 was the reported that a neuro fuzzy method with the trapezoidal membership function can be used to predict groundwater vulnerability this model was most sensitive to soil structure properties and land use variables another work varied the number of fuzzy sets the rule weights and the membership functions and found that the trapezoidal membership function was the least sensitive to permutations in the model setup dixon 2005 adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis is the most widely used approach of nfs anfis models have been used to predict nitrate contamination in agricultural lands jebastina and prince arulraj 2018 and potato fields shekofteh et al 2012 with satisfactory performance an anfis model linked to latin hypercube sampling to propagate uncertainty of the model parameters was used to estimate global arsenic concentrations with the highest model performance at an r square of 0 65 amini et al 2008 anfis was found to outperform the traditional tds based method for estimating ec tutmez et al 2006 and could estimate how ec affected the water composition of the study area a study found that the number of parameters was the only significant factor on the performance of anfis and the parameter combination was non significant mousavi and amiri 2012 when applied to predict nitrate concentration in an agricultural district of india the performance of anfis increased with the increase of parameters and achieved a determination coefficient of close to 90 with only 5 variables jebastina and prince arulraj 2018 neuro fuzzy methods have been used to classify agricultural groundwater pollution dahiya et al 2007 muhammetoglu and yardimci 2006 a mamdani fuzzy inference model was applied to predict three wqis and performed well for both wet and dry seasons vadiati et al 2016 anfis was used to train models under average climate and extreme temperature conditions to modify a drinking water quality index radfard et al 2019 another work found weights of evidence wofe a statistical categorical predictor 7 classifications provided higher quality results than neuro fuzzy for wqi prediction uhan 2012 3 1 2 2 2 other neuro fuzzy models different types of neuro fuzzy methods were applied to gwq modeling co active anfis canfis is an extension of anfis with capabilities of taking any number of input output pairs and typically performs better when mapping nonlinear function canfis was found to have satisfactory performance for groundwater quality assessment gholami et al 2017 and also performed better than ann and self organizing map som for wqi prediction gholami et al 2022 catastrophe fuzzy membership functions were used to improve both the general drastic and pesticide drastic methods sadeghfam et al 2016 a fuzzy linear optimization model was applied to find optimal factor weights for the drastic index asadi et al 2017 a fuzzy logic control system was used for improving bioremediation control systems in situ the system was able to reduce the contamination from significantly to slightly contaminated hu et al 2003 3 1 2 2 3 comparative studies of anfis to other ml models a few works performed comparative studies of anfis to other ml models al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 khaki et al 2015 khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 the anfis with generalized bell membership function was found to perform the best for predicting both tds and ec when comparing with ffnn and a cascade forward network khaki et al 2015 an anfis model outperformed ann and mlr models for all performance metrics for predicting tds and ec al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 however another study compared ann and geostatistical methods for spatial prediction of ec and found that the ann model outperformed anfis and the geostatistical methods khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 3 1 2 3 neuro fuzzy model assessment fuzzy models are perhaps the most user friendly models with their linguistic outputs and ability to manage uncertainties their usefulness in classification problems makes them a popular choice for wqi problems in general fuzzy models are capable of successfully classifying groundwater quality and improving traditional wqis such as drastic asadi et al 2017 sadeghfam et al 2016 fuzzy models are not only used for classification problems anfis models can outperform ann models in predicting tds and ec if proper types and functions are used al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 khaki et al 2015 anfis improves on the benefits of ann with the advantage of fuzzy reasoning leading to problem simplification and noise reduction and thus more accurate results al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 however in one study khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 ann was found to be a superior model over anfis for ec prediction the study used only three parameters for the best model whereas eleven khaki et al 2015 and six al mukhtar and al yaseen 2019 parameters were used in other studies results likely come from the purely nonlinear approach in parameter optimization and the fuzzy inference system reflecting ambiguity of observed data khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 possibly it is simply a problem of the number of parameters which lets the fuzzy inference system overcompensate for any errors in the limited data regardless anfis and other fuzzy models are excellent methods for predicting a variety of groundwater contamination parameters and predicting water quality for management purposes it is also a faster method than ann khaki et al 2015 giving it a practical advantage in implementation 3 1 3 support vector machine svm 3 1 3 1 introduction of svm svm is a versatile ml model which can solve classification and regression tasks in its most basic form svm is a maximum margin classifier that maximizes the width of the gap between distinct categories because the naive maximum margin classifier uses hard margin for separation it is sensitive to outliers svm overcomes this issue by utilizing a support vector classifier or soft margin classifier cortes and vapnik 1995 that finds the optimal soft margin that gives the best classification score through cross validation among support vectors within the range of soft margin smv can also perform non linear classification by utilizing a kernel trick boser et al 1992 additional introduction of svm can be found in the supporting information s2 2 4 3 1 3 2 application of svm in groundwater quality modeling svm has been applied largely to predict nitrate concentrations in groundwater except for three studies which focused on other contaminants such as sodium and arsenic isazadeh et al 2017 liu et al 2020 park et al 2016 the validity of svm for nitrate contamination prediction was assessed and shown to be satisfactory arabgol et al 2016 a study integrated svm into the parametric agricultural nitrate hazard index ipnoa model rizeei et al 2018 lr was used for weighting optimization of the svm before the final prediction was made which led to a higher accuracy than the regular ipnoa 91 32 and 85 3 respectively liu et al s work j liu et al 2020 marked the first successful effort to apply one class svm to groundwater anomaly detection with real time data svm was compared with ann models in multiple studies dixon 2009 isazadeh et al 2017 khalil et al 2005 park et al 2016 when compared with a locally weighted projection regression lwpr and relevance vector machine rvm a method similar to svm but that uses bayesian inference to provide probabilistic classification for nitrate prediction khalil et al 2005 rvm performed the best followed by svm and ann which was attributed to model architecture choices and may not be consistent in all study areas when compared for nitrate prediction svm and nn performed similarly in the validation phase 0 55 and 0 59 accuracy respectively feature selection did not improve accuracy but did lower the number of necessary variables for prediction dixon 2009 when compared for ec sodium and sulfate concentration prediction svm had lower uncertainty than ffnn isazadeh et al 2017 ann and svm were compared for identifying groundwater arsenic concentrations and svm was found to be more accurate park et al 2016 svm along with classification and regression tree cart and random forest rf was evaluated as part of a wrapper selection study for optimizing feature selection for nitrate prediction models rodriguez galiano et al 2018 the highest performing svm model was sequential forward selection svm however the best cart and the best rf model were superior to sfs svm 3 1 3 3 svm model assessment svm models have been found to accurately predict nitrate concentration arabgol et al 2016 khalil et al 2005 and other hydrochemical compounds isazadeh et al 2017 park et al 2016 additionally they have advantages over ann models for example svm models do not rely critically on network structure selection the biggest weakness of ann they are also less prone to overfitting because there is no need for iterative training in addition they are faster khalil et al 2005 despite these advantages results are not conclusive on svm superiority over ann for groundwater quality modeling svm models still rely on kernel function selection which may affect results as they use different methods to map data into higher dimensions researchers should expect results of these comparisons to be dependent on model architecture area specific and not generalizable to other research areas e g surface water svm was shown to be inferior to cart and rf for feature selection rodriguez galiano et al 2018 but superior to brt and multi discriminant analysis mda for nitrate contamination prediction sajedi hosseini et al 2018 as with all models discussed here an ensemble approach was able to improve svm individual performance sajedi hosseini et al 2018 regardless svm is a sturdy model capable of achieving low uncertainty under reasonable computational demands isazadeh et al 2017 most studies on svm are recent and there is clearly still work left on this topic 3 1 4 regression models 3 1 4 1 introduction to regression models the regression model predicts the dependent variable from one or more independent variables through a function that estimates their relationships regression analysis is generally used for predicting the target value of missing input other than the training samples 3 1 4 2 application of regression models in groundwater quality modeling several of the earliest studies used a ml logistic regression model to accurately predict nitrate contaminations a liu et al 2005 nolan et al 2002 selenium thresholds nolan and clark 1997 and groundwater vulnerability teso et al 1996 these models are now often used as a benchmark comparison to demonstrate alternate model superiority more advanced regression models such as multivariate regression multiple linear regression mlr and regression trees were later introduced to study nitrate contamination and source pollution boy roura et al 2013 kihumba et al 2015 mattern et al 2009 nolan 2001 mlr is still a useful modern tool mlr outperformed ann for predicting water quality index types in nigeria akakuru et al 2022 3 1 4 3 regression model assessment lr and mlr have been shown repeatedly to be superior to computationally costly physical models but in the current research meta they are the benchmark for the lowest acceptable accuracy for example rf models are highly superior to lr models ouedraogo et al 2019 tesoriero et al 2017 wheeler et al 2015 3 1 5 decision tree and random forest 3 1 5 1 introduction to decision tree and random forest decision trees dt are a type of supervised ml where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter and trees consist of decision nodes and leaves the random forest rf is a classification algorithm consisting of many dts rf randomly selects observations and features to build each individual tree to create an uncorrelated forest of trees biau and scornet 2016 3 1 5 2 application of decision tree and random forest in groundwater quality modeling one study used only dt to predict water quality classifications which was found to be more precise and efficient than principal component analysis saghebian et al 2014 rf was used to predict nitrate and arsenic concentrations and allowed for a general assessment of the vulnerability of basin fill aquifers anning et al 2012 when used to predict pollution in agricultural groundwater an rf model only needed four explanatory variables when driving forces such as anthropological effects were added to water quality parameters v rodriguez galiano et al 2014 rf was used to locate the sources and flow paths of dissolved organic nitrogen don in groundwater based on landscape characteristics b wang et al 2018 in conjunction with a fuzzy method rf was able to determine the wqi and groundwater quality index gqi norouzi and moghaddam 2020 rf has shown satisfactory performance for fluoride modeling in india j e podgorski et al 2018 and arsenic modeling in uruguay wu et al 2021 rf was supplemented with global information system gis for spatiotemporal assessment and prediction of groundwater nitrate contamination with a high accuracy judeh et al 2022 at a large scale rf and quantile rf were used with the european water framework to estimate national redox and nitrate groundwater conditions at high resolution knoll et al 2020 a methodology was proposed to accommodate the computational demands of large datasets using rf and national scale predictions of groundwater redox class for new zealand were presented wilson et al 2020 rf with shapley additive explanations shap was compared to kriging to derive insight on nitrate modeling was found to be more accurate than the traditional method w li et al 2022 rf and a generalized boosted regression model were combined into a final model for analysis of physiochemical parameter relationships by creating spatial maps showing relationships between manganeses iron and arsenic podgorski et al 2022 classification and regression tree cart model was used for prediction of gwqi assessment in india which achieved low error and produced results for the soil types by gwqi singha et al 2022 rf performed better for nearly all benchmarks when comparing to linear regression for predicting the occurrence of redox active constituents in groundwater tesoriero et al 2017 rf has been found to be superior to mlr regression tree linear regression kriging models generalized additive model gam cart brt rf svm naïve bayes and c4 a tree based algorithm for modeling nitrate in private wells in rural areas wheeler et al 2015 at the continental scale issoufou ouedraogo et al 2019 in the arab emirates khan et al 2021 and using exclusively spatial predictors knoll et al 2019 rf has also been found to be superior multiple discriminant analysis mda and brt for susceptibility prediction of groundwater hardness mosavi et al 2020 and ann for prediction of wqi in an urban area anjum et al 2021 five tree based models were used for arsenic risk prediction in a region in india rf optimized forest cost sensitive forest cs forest split point and attribute reduced classifier spaarc and reduced error pruning rep tree the most accurate was optimized forest with rf close behind while the least accurate was cs forest and rep tree kumar and pati 2022 random forest was found to have the best classification performance for groundwater arsenic prediction compared to dt mlp and naïve bayes algorithm siddharth kumar and pati 2022 rf and a k nearest neighbor knn model had the highest accuracy for prediction of water quality class in india compared to linear discriminant analysis cart and svm models mogaraju 2022 a study used numerical model outputs as predictors to create a hybrid boosted regression tree model i e dts with continuous outcome for predicting nitrate concentration ransom et al 2017 a conditional inference forest cif a dt that utilizes unbiased recursive partitioning of dependent variables based on the value of correlations was paired with a physical model in a groundwater vulnerability analysis the metamodel allowed for multiple simulations of the computationally expensive physical model with a higher than 60 agreement in gw sites for predicted classes soriano et al 2021 3 1 5 3 decision tree and random forest model assessment rf models are less of a black box than other ml models that is researchers may glean information about parameters connections b wang et al 2018 however rf models can struggle with accuracy and availability of anthropologic data knoll et al 2020 v rodriguez galiano et al 2014 additionally the size of the tree based algorithm can be a restriction 3 1 6 comparative studies 3 1 6 1 introduction to comparative studies some studies compare models without intention of selecting a best model and optimizing it for the study area or without intention of comparing a novel model to a base model these studies are collected in this section 3 1 6 2 application of comparative studies in groundwater quality modeling four algorithms mlp anfis svm and gene expression programming gep were compared for estimating tds and gep was found to be superior jafari et al 2019 rf demonstrated a slightly lower error than anfis logistic regression mode lrm fuzzy and adaptive fuzzy regression afr for groundwater arsenic prediction bindal and singh 2019 bpnn evolutionary polynomial regression epr and the naive bayes model nbm were compared across seven performance metrics for predicting nitrogen concentration on a weekly basis no single model significantly outperformed any of the others in all analysis markus et al 2010 additive regression ar surpassed the accuracy of svm m5p tree model m5p and random subspace rss for wqi prediction in india elbeltagi et al 2022 thirteen ml algorithms were compared for dissolved organic nitrogen prediction in an urban setting bagged mars rf and cubist a rule based model that utilizes decision tree and regression quinlan and others 1992 were the most optimal models with the most generalizability benya wang et al 2016 for comparison of seven ml algorithms for arsenic prediction cubist performed the best in training however rf and bagged tree were the best models for internal validation de menezes et al 2020 svm was found to have superior performance to rf flexible discriminant analysis fda mixture discriminant analysis mda brt and mars for groundwater salinity mapping mosavi et al 2021 hosseini et al found that instance based k nearest neighbors outperformed kstar m5p locally weighted learning and regression by discretization for fluoride contamination prediction khosravi et al 2020 3 1 6 3 comparative studies assessment comparative studies contain models that have only appeared once in ml gwq modeling literature these studies serve the purpose of assessing less common models for completion of the literature however it is important to note that these studies do not necessarily agree on model superiority and should be taken on a case by case basis for example one study concluded that svm was the most accurate of six models including mars for groundwater salinity mapping mosavi et al 2021 however another found that of their thirteen models tested for dissolved organic nitrogen prediction mars was among the top three whereas two different svm models were not benya wang et al 2016 this example reinforces the danger of generalizability in comparative studies 3 1 7 optimization techniques optimization techniques are practices of optimizing the performance of the predictive model from various aspects widely used techniques include efficient searching for the optimal parameter set of the model feature engineering for effective feature learning and improving the stability and accuracy of learning algorithms 3 1 7 1 introduction to genetic algorithms genetic algorithms gas katoch et al 2021 lambora et al 2019 yang 2020 inspired by natural selection are part of evolutionary algorithms eas which are generic population based metaheuristic optimization algorithms genetic algorithms utilize biologically inspired operations like mutation crossover and selection to provide solutions for optimization and search genetic algorithms can deal with complex problems across diverse types of optimizations to make genetic algorithms converge the parameters of the specific genetic algorithm need to be carefully selected and a wide range of options exists a brief description on gas particularly on variations of gas mentioned in the sections below can be found in the supporting information section 2 2 5 3 1 7 2 application of genetic algorithms in groundwater quality modeling 3 1 7 2 1 improving model performance with ga bpnn and ga have been integrated and was found to perform better than other ann models for nitrate prediction almasri and kaluarachchi 2005a moasherip0f and abadip4f 2012 the bee algorithm ba a population based algorithm that mimics the food foraging behavior of honeybee colonies with good convergence to the global optimum was used with bpnn for prediction of water pollution sources which showed significantly higher accuracy than the unmodified bpnn keskin et al 2015 an fnn svr hybrid model was optimized with ga and needed less parameters than mlr hosseini and mahjouri 2014 the viability of elm modified by crow search algorithm csa for predicting groundwater quality was evaluated and found to be more accurate than the unmodified elm liu et al 2017 and to raise the accuracy of anfis for prediction of specific conductance zounemat kermani et al 2022 pso and ga optimization of anfis were not found to be statistically different for modeling ec ph and cl jalalkamali 2015 for wqi prediction a pso naïve bayes classifier slightly outperformed a pso svm model agrawal et al 2021 pso was also used with nn and empirical bayesian kriging for prediction of physiochemical and metallic parameters in an island area de jesus et al 2021 senoro et al 2022 the firefly algorithm ffa a global optimization algorithm inspired by flashing behavior of firefly insects was shown to improve performance in ann anfis svm mars and rf models for prediction of groundwater parameters of which svm ffa and ann ffa were the most robust a combination of pca pso and svm was optimized to evaluate water quality category the pca pso svm model performed better than the pso svm the svm and a bpnn model and had a 99 percent accuracy ni et al 2022 3 1 7 2 2 ga comparative studies several studies compared the performance of multiple genetic algorithms against each other banadkooki et al 2020 kisi et al 2019 ritzel et al 1994 pareto ga was found to be superior to a vector evaluated ga for solving a multi objective groundwater pollution containment problem ritzel et al 1994 continuous genetic algorithm cga was found to be overall superior to pso and ant colony optimization for continuous domains acor for training and optimization of anfis for modeling ec total hardness and sodium adsorption ratio sar in groundwater kisi et al 2019 moth flame optimization mfo and cat swarm optimization cso have also showed better performance in optimization of anfis for tds compared to pso and three other gas banadkooki et al 2020 three studies compared gas against other algorithms aryafar et al 2019 najafzadeh et al 2022 wu et al 2017 ga was compared to generalized linear regression decision tree and gradient boosted tree for nitrate prediction wu et al 2017 while the ga did the least over underestimating of the models it was not very robust when comparing genetic programming gp to ann and anfis for estimating th tds and ec the gp model was superior aryafar et al 2019 evolutionary polynomial regression epr and gene expression programming gep were compared against m5 model tree and multivariate adaptive regression spline mars for wqi prediction and epr had the highest accuracy najafzadeh et al 2022 gep was also used to predict salinity and ec in iran khalaj et al 2019 3 1 7 3 genetic algorithm model assessment ga is a popular method for improving model results with a wide range of options they provide advantages over ann and anfis models by structural independence and protection from over fitting and early convergence due to their crossover and mutation operators aryafar et al 2019 they are also remarkably consistent every study that modified existing algorithms found that gas improve model performance additionally they can work with as few as three parameters banadkooki et al 2020 jalalkamali 2015 or more than 10 parameters hosseini and mahjouri 2014 ransom et al 2017 more evolutionary models have been tested in recent years such as csa and pso there is not a clear consensus from the literature if these newer models have an advantage in groundwater quality modeling jalalkamali 2015 kisi et al 2019 however the new models are just as viable for predicting groundwater quality keskin et al 2015 liu et al 2017 because of their consistency flexibility and compatibility with other models gas will continue to be a useful tool for researchers 3 1 7 4 introduction to wavelet transform wavelet transform chui 1992 daubechies 1992 debnath and shah 2002 was proposed to solve constant time and frequency resolution caused by the fixed length of the window used in short time fourier transform stft wavelet transform uses wavelet as the basis function rather than the window function to realize multiresolution analysis by controlling the width of the wavelet and its central frequency wavelet transform and its discrete version discrete wavelet transform dwt akansu and haddad 1992 are effective tools of doing feature engineering to select optimal features from raw data as training data wavelet transform can also be directly used in ml architectures like wavelet neural networks wnn alexandridis and zapranis 2013 which combine wavelet analysis with neural networks to approximate deterministic functions 3 1 7 5 application of wavelet transform in groundwater quality modeling wavelet transform is a common surface water modeling technique but few studies have used wavelet transform techniques for groundwater quality modeling a study used electromagnetic sensor arrays as input for a mlp with wavelet transform for feature selection to estimate groundwater quality the model could predict nitrate and sulfur concentration even in the presence of other contamination nor et al 2015 another study optimized a mlp with a wavelet neural network wnn and bpnn for assessing shallow groundwater quality yang et al 2017 wavelet transform along with self organizing map som and mutual information mi was used to extract features for modeling nitrate time series with ffnn the hybrid coupling improved the performance of the ffnn by up to 39 and was able to predict nitrate load in the study area s sub basins and outlet nourani et al 2017 3 1 7 6 wavelet transform model assessment wavelet transform can decompose non stationary data nourani et al 2017 this temporal preprocessing can improve models as it can find trends discontinuities and other data anomalies that other preprocessing techniques might miss yang et al 2017 thus far it has only been applied to improve an mlp model and ann models and used in preprocessing for a hybrid ffnn model while wavelet transform has some flexibility in selection of the mother wavelet this does affect results and can compound on ann model architecture selections yang et al 2017 however wavelet transform is a useful tool for improving results if the complexity of application is not an issue 3 1 7 7 introduction to bagging and boosting boosting is an ensemble learning method for reducing variance and overfitting in a sequential way by adjusting the weight of sample as each base model is evaluated hastie et al 2009 gradient boosting gbt or boosted regression tree brt friedman 2002 hastie et al 2009 is an ensemble learning model using decision trees as base models 3 1 7 8 application of bagging and boosting in groundwater quality modeling brt has been used for predicting arsenic chakraborty et al 2020 m l erickson et al 2018 lombard et al 2021 manganese melinda l erickson elliott brown stackelberg ransom reddy et al 2021 ph stackelberg et al 2021 redox conditions melinda l erickson et al 2021 and nitrate concentration ransom et al 2022 in various glacial aquifer systems in the united states brt was found to be a cheap and reliable method for real time groundwater level and nitrate concentration predication mettu and latifi 2021 extreme gradient boosting xgb a specific implementation of gradient boosting with regularization to improve the generalization of the model was found to be superior to dnn and mlr for mapping groundwater salinity sahour et al 2020 and ann and svm for nitrate and pesticide prediction bedi et al 2020 xgb performed the best for improving a groundwater vulnerability prediction framework when compared with adaboost rf light gradient boosting machine lgbm and categorical boosting catboost barzegar et al 2021 adaptive boosting adaboost was found in two instances to have higher predictive performances than rf ann and svr for predicting irrigation water quality although the svr and ann models showed higher generalization potential el bilali et al 2021 trabelsi and ali 2022 random forest regression rfr the extreme gradient boosting regression xgbr the catboost regression cbr and the light gradient boosting regression lgbr were compared for salinity prediction in coastal aquifers with the cbr model reaching the best accuracy and stability tran et al 2021 however for arsenic prediction rf was found to have better capabilities chakraborty et al 2020 for nitrate xgboost showed superior performance ransom et al 2022 3 1 7 9 bagging and boosting model assessment the robustness and computational restrictions of a model can be addressed with boosting a popular method is xgb although others exist and have been studied for gw quality modeling xgb has been shown to have higher accuracy than ann dnn and mlr models for prediction of nitrate salinity and pesticides in groundwater bedi et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 it is also comparable to svm bedi et al 2020 although generalized boosted models gbm and brt are not as accurate mosavi et al 2021 benya wang et al 2016 3 1 8 deep learning 3 1 8 1 introduction to deep learning deep learning is part of ann based machine learning algorithms whose network architecture is constructed with multilayer perceptron mlp to achieve better predictive capability while maintaining a moderate complexity of the network deep learning methods are capable of effectively modeling complex relationships from observations its training and inferencing performance can be improved by leveraging modern hardware accelerated parallelization 3 1 8 2 application of deep learning in groundwater quality modeling the deep neural network dnn emulator was found to be able to model simple contaminant transport much faster than mlp for contaminant transport modeling yu et al 2020 recently dnns have been compared to several models for both ammonium perović et al 2021 and wqi singha et al 2021 prediction and provided remarkably high predictive performance r2 0 996 singha et al 2021 a dnn model showed significant improvement over ann and svr models for ammonium prediction in alluvial groundwater perović et al 2021 for prediction of wqi and entropy water quality index ewqi dnn performed better than gbm and extreme gradient boosting xgb results for the boosting methods are mixed for the two indices raheja et al 2022 cnn and dnn outperformed rf and xgb for estimation of groundwater quality parameters such as tds potential salinity sodium adsorption ratio and chloride in a coastal aquifer using only ec and ph as input parameters taşan et al 2022 however for nitrate prediction in an unconfined aquifer xgb was more accurate than a dnn and mlr model gholami and booij 2022 a dnn was used for point source identification in a simulated groundwater quality scenario the authors projected the high dimensional problem into a lower dimension and so the proposed network provided a good surrogate of a transport system without losing accuracy with the autoregressive strategy reducing the dnn computational time mo et al 2019 3 1 8 3 deep learning model assessment deep learning is a promising field of study in computer science and especially in groundwater quality modeling while the number of case studies is still small deep neural networks have consistently performed better than conventional ml models such as ann for supervised groundwater quality modeling perović et al 2021 singha et al 2021 taşan et al 2022 although deep learning network is an effective type of predictive model with capability of modeling complex functions on high dimension input several aspects have to be taken care of while training the network for example a larger amount of training data is needed to train a complex deep learning network with good generalizability practices like regularization are also necessary to prevent the model from overfitting 3 2 semi supervised 3 2 1 introduction to semi supervised ml models semi supervised learning chapelle et al 2009 zhu and goldberg 2009 zhu 2005 is a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning and it utilizes a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training the success of semi supervised learning depends on the critical assumptions which are continuity cluster and manifold popular semi supervised learning includes self training mixture models co training multi view learning graph based methods low density separation and semi supervised support vector machines 3 2 2 application of semi supervised ml models in groundwater quality modeling a study proposed a new groundwater contaminant source identification method which used a non negative matrix factorization nmf method for blind source separation bss coupled with a custom semi supervised clustering algorithm vesselinov et al 2018 the authors had previously applied this method to identify the sources of pressure fluctuations in water alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 the semi supervised k means clustering algorithm could unmix the geochemical signatures in the observations and identify the contaminant sources and was found to be capable of identifying both the number of groundwater types and the original concentration of the contaminant sources from mixtures without any mixing ratio or site information 3 2 3 semi supervised model assessment semi supervised algorithms are rare in water quality modeling as of 2020 they had not been used for river water quality modeling tiyasha et al 2020a and have been only used once for gwq modeling as of 2022 the method provided promising results and could be an emerging topic for researchers focused on contaminant source identification 3 3 ensemble learning 3 3 1 introduction of ensemble learning ensemble learning haykin and network 2004 opitz and maclin 1999 polikar 2006 is a modality of ml where multiple base learning models weak learners are aggregated to obtain better predictive performance than any of the base learning models alone the aggregation is achieved by using meta algorithms like bagging boosting and stacking in this review models are grouped into committee neural networks cnn ensemble fuzzy models and others 3 3 2 application of ensemble learning in groundwater quality modeling 3 3 2 1 committee neural networks committee machine or committee neural network cnn haykin and network 2004 is a type of ensemble learning utilizing multiple neural networks as base models and combining the predictions of base models into a final prediction with higher accuracy a cnn of three nn models i e mlp rbfnn and grnn were compared for groundwater salinity prediction and the cnn outperformed any individual model in rmse and r2 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 a cnn was used with elm mars m5 and svr for improving drastic predictions in terms of the correlation coefficient r and willmott index d cnn was clearly superior to any individual method barzegar et al 2018 ensemble of anns was compared to ann with early stopping and ann with bayesian regularization for prediction of wqi but did not higher correlation coefficient in both training and testing data set than the bayesian regularization algorithm sakizadeh 2016 3 3 2 2 ensemble fuzzy models ensemble fuzzy models yang et al 2006 combine various fuzzy logic methods with ensemble learning for better performance ensemble fuzzy models have been applied exclusively to improving drastic method performance a few studies barzegar et al 2016 fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2013 used supervised committee machine with artificial intelligence scmai to predict fluoride concentration and improve the drastic method each study ran sugeno fuzzy logic sfl mamdani fuzzy logic ann and neuro fuzzy nf individually for the problem before testing the scmai some results showed that they each fit the data for fluoride prediction similarly nadiri et al 2013 nf was shown to be the best of the individual models in one study area fijani et al 2013 and in another both nf and sfl performed very well barzegar et al 2016 all studies observed that the scmai was able to further improve on any individual model s performance another study found that in the validation phase for improving drastic performance supervised committee fuzzy logic scfl and committee fuzzy logic cfl had higher correlation coefficients than three individual fuzzy logic models nadiri et al 2017 3 3 2 3 other ensemble models three different ml types brt mda and svm and an ensemble of these three models were compared for groundwater risk assessment for a region in iran and the ensemble approach surpassed all individual models sajedi hosseini et al 2018 two similar studies reached the same conclusion for an area of pakistan awais et al 2021 and a different iran region rokhshad et al 2021 radial basis neural networks rbnn support vector regression svr and ensemble random forest regression rfr were compared for nitrate contamination evaluation the ensemble model performed the best elzain et al 2022 rf gradient boosted machine svm and ann along with bagging ensemble model were used to model nitrate concentration in private wells no model performed well r2 0 33 and final rf model outperformed the bagging ensemble models messier et al 2019 a 2022 study compared bagging bagged decision trees random forest and extra trees boosting adaboost and stochastic gradient boosting and ensemble methods logistic regression knn decision tree svm and naïve bayes for wqi prediction the highest accuracy was achieved by the ensemble model bagged decision trees and gradient boosting shrivastava et al 2022 3 3 3 ensemble model assessment ensemble models are a powerful tool for gw quality prediction virtually all ensemble modeling studies have shown that cnns ensemble fuzzy models and ensemble models of other ml algorithms can improve predictive capabilities an ensemble approach can eliminate weaknesses of each individual model and provide a more robust prediction however ensemble models are not always perfect advancements for example one study found that an rf model had a higher r2 value than the bagging ensemble model which used r2 as the only performance metric messier et al 2019 another study found that the cnn had the lowest rmse but not the highest r2 value but it also outperformed any individual model in terms of correlation coefficient r and willmott index of agreement barzegar et al 2018 in general ensemble models outperform other models in various performance metrics barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 elzain et al 2022 although they may have lower r2 values 3 4 unsupervised learning unsupervised learning barlow 1989 hinton et al 1999 is an algorithm that can discover hidden patterns and insights from the dataset without labels common unsupervised learning tasks include clustering association and principal component analysis pca 3 4 1 self organizing maps som 3 4 1 1 introduction of som self organizing map som also known as self organizing feature map sofm or kohonen self organizing feature maps ksofm kohonen 1982 kohonen et al 1996 kohonen and honkela 2007 is an unsupervised neural network that clusters high dimensional data and transforms high dimensional features into low dimensional two dimensional features while preserving symmetrical relationships between samples 3 4 1 2 application of self organizing maps in groundwater quality modeling soms have been used for point source identification modification of neural networks prediction of hydrochemical parameters and in conjunction with clustering hong and rosen 2001 nakagawa et al 2016 nourani et al 2015 the first study to use som generated u matrix maps which allowed the authors to find site specific correlations between variables by comparing these maps to the real world hong and rosen 2001 som was able to provide high quality area specific interpretable results to classify the groundwater data choi et al 2014 when som was used with a ffnn to model the som ffnn method improved the accuracy of predictions 84 5 and 17 for modeling ec and tds respectively on average with regard to the mlr model nourani et al 2015 a modified som msom was found to perform better than three supervised mlas i e lda brt and rf in predicting oxic mixed and anoxic conditions for a groundwater redox condition study in an agriculturally dominant region friedel et al 2020 svm with pca and hierarchal clustering analysis hca was used for identifying hydrological pathways and ion sources in aquifer systems in japan rahman et al 2022 som was coupled with clustering algorithms in several studies a study used som with k means and ward s algorithms for clustering to identify surface and groundwater chemistry classes and determined pathways for certain chemicals nakagawa et al 2016 som and fuzzy c means fcm clustering were able to identify distinct and interpretable clustering groups when evaluating urban lee et al 2019 and som with hierarchal clustering hca achieved this for regional groundwater quality zhong et al 2022 3 4 1 3 som model assessment soms offer insights into parameter connections and point source identification as well as improvements on predictions of gwq parameters they can capture insight on complex variable relationships with no a priori knowledge of physical transport mechanisms the application of som in groundwater quality modeling is still an emerging field and has little generalizability overall soms can be useful tools for local or regional groundwater management 3 4 2 clustering 3 4 2 1 introduction to clustering clustering rokach and maimon 2005 xu and wunsch 2008 is an unsupervised ml task that automatically separates data into groups according to the similarities of samples specified by certain type of distance metric clustering has been used to identify unknown connections among parameters and improve other ml techniques k means algorithm forgy 1965 lloyd 1982 macqueen and others 1967 is a centroid model for partitioning data into k clusters through iteration where each cluster is represented by a single mean vector 3 4 2 2 application of clustering in groundwater quality modeling clustering such as factor analysis fa cluster analysis ca and k means clustering was used to understand variable relationships factor analysis fa and cluster analysis ca were used along with a hydrochemical model package phreeqc to model hydrochemical properties of a small island aquifer inspecting the elements of each cluster led to explain the three most significant processes affecting the groundwater aquifer aris et al 2011 k means clustering was used to understand spatial variations in groundwater chemistry to identify pathways and study the effects of industrial and agricultural activities on two aquifers fabbrocino et al 2019 hybrid bn was used to apply probabilistic clustering for assessing groundwater quality and predictive uncertainty which optimized the number of samples needed for an accurate estimate by ignoring samples with high error probability aguilera et al 2013 hierarchal clustering analysis hca method was used in a similar manner to visualize hydrochemical links in algeria hca identified three water quality groups and allowed the authors to draw links between hydraulic pathways and geology selmane et al 2022 clustering was also used to improve existing ml methods the effect of k means clustering on two ml techniques ann and svm was evaluated for predicting nitrate concentration the clustered aggregate svm performed slightly better than the clustered ann alagha et al 2014 quantile regression qr and uncertainty estimation based on local errors and clustering uneec were applied to ml models svm rf and k nn in groundwater nitrate contamination prediction the uneec methods had similar predictive performance statistics as rf but better than svm 3 4 2 3 clustering model assessment clustering methods for studying relationships among parameters is a useful tool they have been shown to provide information on processes affecting aquifers aris et al 2011 fabbrocino et al 2019 but much like som the results are not generalizable to other study areas however clustering can be an excellent preprocessing tool for other ml algorithms such as ann and svm alagha et al 2014 or for assessing uncertainties rahmati et al 2019 while it is difficult to compare methods there are more user friendly parameter assessment methods som and more rigorous model enhancement methods ensemble ga than clustering however it can be an appropriate tool where uncertainties are an important aspect of a study 3 4 3 artificial intelligence with multiple frameworks aifm a few studies used multiple ml frameworks in parallel or sequential to construct a comprehensive unsupervised learning pipeline for better data analysis and pattern discovery for specific domains to improve the basic drastic framework bdf see section 2 2 for a brief explanation of the drastic framework one study used bdf parallel to aimf with least squares svm ls svm and fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf to map aquifer vulnerability both frameworks were weak on their own when using n as measure of vulnerability however the aimf strategy with ls svm produced a high accuracy in testing another study used four drastic variations with svm for the aimf the aimf was able to enhance the correlation of coefficient value to nearly double of the best drastic variation nadiri et al 2018 various combinations of ann neuro fuzzy fuzzy logic gep svm ga bdf and fcf were used in supervised and unsupervised ensemble techniques for modeling a tropical island aquifer the best model combined the unsupervised bdf and bdf fcf with the supervised bdf ga and bdf gep using ls svm displaying the advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning types nadiri et al 2019 unsupervised combinations of gqi and gwqi indexes were applied twice to predict iran groundwater quality and this combination performed better when compared to nitrate arsenic maps in that regions najib et al 2022 sedghi and nadiri 2022 like supervised ensemble models multiple frameworks combine several models at once however the models combined are variations of the bdf which are unsupervised the models can also be combined in some supervised method nadiri et al 2018 2018 multiple frameworks can clearly enhance the performance of the unsupervised frameworks for prediction of groundwater quality parameters nadiri et al 2018 2018 for problems with an unsupervised problem set multiple frameworks can be a powerful tool for the enhancements of weaker frameworks 4 conclusions and future work groundwater quality modeling using ml continues to grow as a field this review covered over 200 papers on ml water quality modeling for prediction and management of groundwater as concise and accessible as possible without risking oversimplification the first part of the study analyzed the literature as a group and uncovered important trends the amount of work on this topic increased rapidly in the early 2010 s and continues to grow in recent years fig 2 the world leaders in publications in this field are iran and the united states fig 8 nitrate is by far the most studied groundwater quality parameter fig 2 a great many parameters are viable for these types of prediction fig 3a although the number of parameters used often hovers between 3 and 8 to take advantage of readily available data or 13 20 to take advantage of common hydrochemical parameters fig 3b a wealth of models has been applied to groundwater quality modeling for supervised learning models ann is the most common followed by fuzzy natural and svm fig 5b additionally interest in unsupervised and alternative supervised models has increased rapidly in the last 12 years the second part of the assessment focused on the results from each publication by model type a brief description of the basic model type gave a basic understanding of the use then an in depth bibliography and a model assessment focused on the strengths and weaknesses of each model ann models are the most popular algorithm due to their high accuracy ease of implementation and flexibility in number of input parameters the performance of ann models are highly dependent on selection of input parameters and model architecture as such performance of ann models compared to other model types such as svm or anfis or other ann model types such as rbfnn is not consistent svm and fuzzy methods are also heavily dependent on architecture and hyperparameter selection increasing the likelihood of conflicting results model optimization techniques such as wavelet transform and genetic algorithms intend to eliminate some heuristic error in the base models but don t always achieve this methods such as random forest and deep learning show more constant results when compared to other model types the random forest model achieves high accuracy from its model structure and can manage large missing and outlier data well ensemble learning attains this as well and is another promising avenue for groundwater quality modeling deep learning can also achieve high accuracy and can manage unstructured data well however these models are all black box models while potentially highly useful for gw quality management they do not offer much insight for researchers as groundwater modeling through ml continues to expand there are several areas for future researchers that should be addressed which are discussed in the following section 4 1 future work 4 1 1 implementation of best practices machine learning for hydrology especially forecasting methods is facing a modern evaluation of historical misapplication gharib and davies 2021 zheng et al 2018 wavelet transform especially is prone to error often resulting from data preprocessing and handling du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 as the interest in ml for managing and forecasting gw quality grows it is important to understand the missteps and limitations of these models especially when related to data selection and handling without proper implementation of current standards and best practices for steps like data splitting model architecture and model evaluation results from the expanding field will be muddied with errata 4 1 2 cessation of duplicate studies many papers on ann only described how an ann model may be applied to a certain study area they did not provide any innovate data pre or postprocessing ideas or amplify or modify the model to a degree that contributed significantly to the literature this repetition is a trap for authors to avoid 4 1 3 application of deep learning deep learning is a rapidly developing field of machine learning that shows promise in hydrology shen 2018 so far it has been applied minimally to gw quality modeling mo et al 2019 perović et al 2021 singha et al 2021 making this one of the biggest and most exciting opportunities in groundwater research with the growth of gw water data collection lifelong learning ll parisi et al 2019 is a promising direction to solve the catastrophic forgetting issue when training an existing network on newly collected data meta learning hospedales et al 2022 gives a systematic solution to automatically learn a learning model from datasets with good optimization on the hyperparameters for higher prediction accuracy with a cheaper training process this will generally help researchers discover insight for designing suitable learning algorithms in gw water research 4 1 4 explainable ai explainable ai xai is another emerging tool in machine learning unlike many models discussed in this paper such as ann which are black box models xai is a theory that aims to provide interpretation and visualization to users on the processes studied through various techniques samek et al 2019 a big weakness of current ml studies right now is the caveat that all results may only hold in the specific study area which has led to several discrepancies among model performance results for practical studies to make an impact they must be applicable outside of the study area and xai will be a useful tool for this purpose as human explainable results will allow for larger generalizability 4 1 5 exploration of underrepresented models many models have only been studied once for gw quality modeling and the highest performers along with models that have never been applied to the subject should be explored further similarly model enhancement techniques such as genetic algorithms have not been applied to all models and implemented in gwq modeling 4 1 6 accessibility of supplementary materials to allow for greater standards and stricter benchmarks it is suggested that more researchers allow materials such as code and data to be open source and available to the public the advantages of more databases are clear but freely available code would allow for validation across multiple study areas and potentially provide insights from one group to another 4 1 7 application to new study areas many studies took advantage of the massive and historical datasets available in areas such as iran and the united states there are large areas of the world that have not had groundwater quality assessment through ml and could benefit from the analysis the models will also be tested for robustness through this method 4 1 8 inclusion of infrequently used parameters many parameters such as anthropological effects or long term climate conditions are difficult to obtain or estimate for a dataset however they can be powerful indicators in the present and their exclusion in a dataset may invalidate the model after future changes in the study area researchers should consider a wide variety of input parameters to account for this 4 1 9 practical application of machine learning for groundwater quality management this review has displayed overwhelming evidence of the power of machine learning for groundwater quality modeling groundwater quality management is short in this area application of machine learning for this purpose would reduce the cost in both time and resources of testing for groundwater quality the bulk of literature aims to evaluate the viability of machine learning for groundwater quality forecasting to increase the accuracy and accessibility of groundwater quality prediction but the literature does not provide clear steps to bridge the gap between academia and industrial and governmental management an increased cooperation between data scientists and municipal authorities such as increased open source machine learning code and results adaptation of water quality monitoring systems with machine learning in mind and increased local funding for machine learning projects is necessary so that the proper evaluation and management of groundwater can be guided by machine learning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
