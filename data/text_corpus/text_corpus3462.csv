17310,due to the environmental risks caused by microplastics understanding the sources and characteristics of microplastics and cutting off their routes into the environment are crucial however so far studies on microplastics in the landfill leachate system a major pathway of microplastics into the environment are still limited especially for tiny particles 50 µm that might have higher risks to the environment this study investigated the microplastics in landfill leachate and in leachate treatment works with a size detection limit down to 10 µm the results showed that the microplastics particle and mass concentrations in the untreated leachate were 235 4 17 1 item l and 11 4 0 8 µg l respectively with tiny particles 50 µm accounting for over 50 overall 27 polymeric materials were detected in leachate samples with polyethylene and polypropylene being the most abundant in the untreated leachate the neutral buoyancy of microplastics average density 0 94 g cm3 together with irregular shapes suggested they may be difficult to be removed by sedimentation further exploring the fate of microplastics in leachate treatment works showed that the membrane treatment effectively reduced microplastics loading to 0 14 for particle and 0 01 for mass but the average particle density rose the differences in polymeric materials distribution at different sampling locations and the presence of membrane related polymer in membrane treatment effluent suggested tiny microplastics could be generated and released from membrane systems moreover this study discovered that the sludge dewatering liquor could contain a high amount of microplastics and the estimated particle loading was about 3 6 times higher than that in dewatered sludge this suggested a new approach to microplastics

introduction microplastics as emerging contaminants are attracting increasing attention recently due to their potential risk to the environment the occurrence of microplastics was firstly identified in oceans and it was found to pose severe threatens to marine lives law and thompson 2014 thompson et al 2004 due to the small size of microplastics generally defined as less than 5 mm they can be easily ingested by aquatic species inflicting direct damage on their digestive tract or causing inflammation besseling et al 2014 chen et al 2006 sussarellu et al 2016 microplastics also serve as vectors of persistent organic pollutants pops which are either originated from plastics additives or adsorbed from the ambient water wang et al 2018 these compounds would be further desorbed inside the organisms after injection exacerbating pops bioaccumulation at higher trophic levels through the food chain browne et al 2013 rios et al 2010 recently the detection and identification of microplastics have been extended beyond the marine system which showed that microplastics could ubiquitously exist in both freshwater and terrestrial systems including rivers lakes farmlands urban roads and so on de souza machado et al 2018 li et al 2018 wagner et al 2018 moreover microplastics were also detected in our food purified drinking water and even the air we breathe allen et al 2019 karami et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2018 such wide spread of microplastics suggested that its effective control in different environmental sectors is in an urgent need while to address this need identifying the major sources of microplastics and their routes into the environment is an important premise microplastics are either primary or secondary in origin the primary microplastics are directly manufactured in small sizes such as microbeads and are commonly used as exfoliants in cosmetic products rochman et al 2015 whereas a large proportion of microplastics are secondary which were unintentionally generated from large debris of plastic products through weathering processes such as hydrolysis mechanical abrasion biodegradation and photodegradation alimi et al 2018 our daily life relies heavily on plastics products with global production exceeds 380 million tons in 2015 and a compound annual growth rate of 8 4 geyer et al 2017 it has been estimated that a considerable fraction 21 42 of these plastic products would end up in the municipal solid waste landfills nizzetto et al 2016 which consequently serving as a huge reservoir of plastic wastes as relatively closely sealed plastic wastes in landfills are subjected to severe environmental conditions such as varying ph 4 5 9 high salinity ca 3 41 ms cm fluctuating temperature ca 30 60 c physical stress and microbial degradation which may lead to the fragmentation of plastics to microplastics hanson et al 2010 kawai et al 2012 kjeldsen et al 2002 ogata et al 2016 tupsakhare et al 2020 thus the potential release of microplastics from the landfill is worthy to be investigated for the aim of effective microplastic pollution control by cutting its route into the environment the landfill leachate carrying abundant pollutants is generally considered an important source of pollution releasing from the landfill it has been speculated that landfill has been leaking microplastic through landfill leachate and may consequently introduce them to the surrounding soil however the study on characteristics of microplastics pollution in the landfill leachate is still limited so far early research conducted by kilponen et al 2016 investigated the microplastics in landfill leachate indirectly by characterization waterways receiving the leachate more recently a few studies investigated microplastics in the landfill leachate directly he et al 2019 su et al 2019 the microplastics concentration reported in these two studies were 0 42 24 58 item l and 4 13 item l respectively however the smallest particle sizes detected in these studies are limited to 50 100 μm which may lead to the underestimation of microplastics abundance in the landfill leachate actually the tiny microplastics 50 μm can account for a large proportion 70 in all microplastics found in the water environment and are believed to exert more severe environmental hazards than the larger ones enders et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 therefore identification of tiny microplastics is important for characterizing microplastics in landfill leachate in addition it lacks a systematic investigation of the fate of the microplastics in the landfill leachate treatment processes which is essential for leachate carrying microplastics control therefore this study aims to comprehensively investigate microplastics pollution characteristics in the landfill leachate with a broader size range as the micro raman spectroscopy had higher resolution and sensitivity compared with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy araujo et al 2018 it was applied for microplastics identification and characterization in this study the minimum size of microplastics identified in this study was down to 10 μm the masses of microplastics identified were estimated based on the volume and the density of the particle in addition the microplastics in different leachate treatment units were also analyzed to explore their fate during the treatment based on the results of this study implications on microplastics detection sources and mitigation in the landfill leachate were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics sampling a municipal solid waste landfill in suzhou china was sampled in this study the landfill has a designed load capacity of 2 100 000 m3 and receives 480 t municipal solid wastes per day the landfill leachate was first transported to an equalization basin and then treated through screening a recirculated membrane bioreactor nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro before discharging the details of the leachate treatment processes applied were shown in figure s1 supporting information the microplastics were sampled using a glass jar at six different locations as indicated in figure s1 including equalization basin eb regarded as raw leachate before treatment bioreactor bior membrane tank effluent me final effluent fe rejected water of ro system rw and the dewatered sludge dws two replicates of samples were taken at each location on dec 18 2018 the leachate samples collected at eb were filtered on site through a stack of stainless steel sieves 20 cm in diameter with descending mesh sizes of 150 μm and 10 μm to collect any debris present one liter of the sample was successfully filtered as the blockage of the 10 μm sieves occurs afterward for me fe and rw 40l of water in each sampling point were also filtered on site through with a 10 μm sieve directly the collected debris was washed into a glass bottle with filtered deionized water for further processing due to high solid fractions the bioreactor mixture bior 500 ml and dewatered sludge dws 500g were transferred into stainless steel containers and directly transported to the laboratory for microplastics extraction 2 2 microplastics extraction the wet peroxidation was firstly conducted to remove the natural organic matter in the collected debris bioreactor mixture and dewatered sludge the peroxidation procedure was performed according to which described by tagg et al 2017 with some modification briefly the sample was transferred to a beaker and then treated with 100 ml of fenton reagent 0 05m fe ii and 30 hydrogen peroxide at ph 3 before the reaction the beaker was placed in a cold water bath 10 c to prevent violent boiling at the beginning of the reaction after the boiling subsided the beaker was heated up to 60 c for 30min for full digestion of organic matter due to the high solid content 10 ml of bioreactor mixture and 5 g of sludge was treated in this step also the peroxidation process was repeated twice to achieve the thorough removal of organic matter for these samples after the peroxidation the mixture was filtered through a 10 μm mesh stainless steel sieve and rinsed with 500 ml filtered deionized water to get rid of all reagents then the density separation was performed to remove the inorganic particles in the samples the solids retained by 10 μm mesh were transferred to a 50ml silicate centrifuge tube using zncl2 solution with a density of 1 6 mg ml the tube was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm 134 16g for 10min the supernatant containing the microplastics was vacuum filtered through a gridded nitrocellulose filter with the pore size of 0 45 μm the low speed centrifuge has been applied in many studies to enhance density separation efficiency with the characteristics of microplastics remain unaffected tagg et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 the density separation step was conducted in triplicate to ensure that all potential microplastics particles could be separated from the sample 2 3 microplastics identification using micro raman spectroscopy the micro raman spectrometer hr evolution horiba paris france operated by labspec 6 software horiba paris france was applied to identify the chemical compositions of extracted particles on the gridded filter each particle on the filters was analyzed using a 532 nm frequency doubled nd yag laser laser quantum stockport cheshire united kingdom coupled to an olympus bxfm optical microscope the laser beam was focused through a 50 objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0 75 the confocal hole width was set to 300 μm and the confocal slit width to 100 μm a grating with 600 grooves mm was used to prevent sample destruction and increase the signal noise ratio laser power applied to the samples ranged from 2 to 20 mw depending on the nature of the particles raman spectra were recorded in a range from 150 to 3500 cm 1 and the identification was conducted in duplicate at least for each particle for validation the spectral data were corrected for instrumental artifacts and baseline subtracted using a polynomial fitting algorithm in labspec 6 it was then compared with were compared against a commercial raman library knowital informatics system horiba edition bio rad laboratories inc hercules california usa for material identification because of the large number of particles in some filters such as that from sites of eb bior and dws it was impractical to identify all material present thus the particles on 1 8 to 1 4 area of the filtered were picked randomly according to the grids and thoroughly analyzed as the subsample in addition the shape bead fiber particle and film size and color of each identified microplastic were sorted simultaneously by using the microscope coupled with the raman spectrometer 2 4 quality control for microplastics sampling and extraction to minimize contamination all apparatuses used in the sampling and extraction processes such as glassware stainless steer containers and sieves were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water the sieves and beakers were covered with aluminum foil in the procedure after sampling the filters were placed in glass petri dishes immediately all liquid reagents including deionized water hydrogen peroxide hydrochloric acid and zncl2 solution were filtered with a 0 45μm nitrocellulose filter before use the application of plastic tools was avoided as possible nitrile gloves and cotton lab coats were worn at all times during the sampling process and laboratory work triplicated blank samples were taken to detect possible sources of contamination during sampling and extraction clean sieves 10 μm were left out for the duration of sampling to collect any atmospheric microplastics that may be present it was then processed and analyzed with the same procedures as the leachate samples described above it was found that on average 4 3 microplastics were in the blank samples which mainly consisted of polypropylene pp and polyethylene pe the microplastics counts in blank samples were much lower than the number of microplastics detected in leachate and sludge samples indicating that the results were reliable 2 5 microplastics mass estimation the masses of microplastics were estimated based on the volume and the density according to the method described by simon et al 2018 for the microplastic beads and fragments the volume was estimated by assuming an ellipsoid shape the major axis the longest continuous axis in the center of the particle and the minor axis the longest axis perpendicular to the major axis were measured using the microscope coupled on the raman spectrometer the ratio of the thickness and the minor dimension of the fragments and beads were assumed the same as the ratio of the minor and major dimensions for fragments it was calculated a median value of 0 67 0 20 thus the thickness was estimated at 67 of the minor dimension for beads it was calculated a median value of 0 91 0 05 thus the thickness was estimated at 91 of the minor dimension for the film the volume was estimated by assuming an elliptic cylindrical shape the thickness was evaluated using the microscope by recording vertical displacement when the focal point moved from the top of the microplastics film to the filter bakke and olsson 1986 the volume of fiber was calculated presuming a cylindrical shape with a 40 void fraction the density of different microplastics polymer used in the calculation is listed in table s1 si 3 results 3 1 abundances and polymeric materials of microplastics in untreated leachate and leachate treatment units the abundances and polymer materials of microplastics in the untreated landfill leachate and samples taken at different treatment units were summarized in figure 1 the concentration of microplastics in untreated leachate eb was 235 4 17 1 item l and it increased by 150 times in mixture collected from bioreactor bior 3 51 104 4 0 103item l suggesting the accumulation effect of microplastics in the treatment system after membrane separation the concentration decreased substantially to 3 8 0 5 item l at membrane tank effluent me and further dropped to 0 4 0 1 item l in the final effluent fe which accounted for only 0 16 of that in the untreated leachate in comparison the microplastics in the reject water from the ro system rw was 9 5 0 5 item l which was 23 times higher than ro effluent the dewatered sludge dws usually considered as the sink of microplastics showed a concentration of 598 1 44 6 item gts the polymer materials of microplastics were identified by micro raman spectroscopy and the spectra of some typical polymers were shown in figure s2 in total 27 different kinds of microplastic polymers were identified in all collected samples as illustrated in figure 1 pe and pp are the two most abundant polymers in eb which accounted for 33 0 and 32 4 respectively in contrast the fractions of other polymers detected in eb such as polyamide pa polyvinyl alcohol pva polyvinyl butyral pvb polymethylpentene pmp polyacrylic acid paa poly n butylamethacrylate pbma was closed to or lower than 5 pe and pp also showed high abundances in the sample collected from bior pe 36 2 and pp 25 1 as well as membrane tank effluent pe 33 9 and pp 12 7 some other polymers also presented relatively high abundances in samples collected at these two locations for example the percentage of polyethylene co acrylic acid eaa was 11 4 in bior and the percentage of pvb polyacrylamide pam and polystyrene ps in me were 17 0 8 5 and 8 5 respectively however the materials of microplastics in fe followed a different pattern compared to other samples only five types of polymers were detected with polyaryletherketone paek become the most abundant at 50 in comparison the microplastics in rw showed a higher diversity the pe presented the highest abundance 23 8 which was followed by pva 11 3 pvb 11 3 pp 8 5 and pa 8 5 other polymers such as kevlar polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polybutyl terephthalate pbt and polycaprolactone pcl were also detected but their proportions were low 3 for dws the percentage of pe 17 7 and pp 17 2 were lower than those in eb and bior while the fractions of some other polymers became higher such as pa 17 2 and pva 13 7 in addition the pam was also detected in dws with the proportion being 10 3 3 2 appearance characteristics of microplastics in untreated leachate and leachate treatment units the microplastics detected in the leachate and sludge samples were in different colors shapes and sizes with some examples of their appearances shown in figure 2 among all the detected microplastics over 90 are transparent or yellowish while some 10 were in colors of red pink purple black blue and brown figure s3 the high abundance of transparent and yellowish color suggested that most particles were aged and presented in the landfill system for a long time the size defined as the length of the major axis distributions of the microplastics collected at different locations were summarized and compared in figure 3 a overall the microplastic particle 50 μm accounted for high proportions 52 100 in all collected samples and a significant decrease in microplastic sizes can be observed along the leachate treatment route specifically in the untreated leachate eb the microplastics with the size 100 μm and 50 100 μm accounted for 22 and 26 respectively and the proportion decreased to 16 and 12 for the sample taken from bior meanwhile the proportion of particles in 20 50 μm and 20 μm increased from 46 eb to 60 bior and 7 eb to 12 bior respectively in the me all the microplastics were in the size of 100 μm and the percentage of microplastics in 50 μm was increased to 80 with percentages of particles 20 μm being 17 in the fe all the particles detected were 50 μm and the percentage of microplastics 20 μm increased significantly to 44 for the rw the size distribution was similar to that in membrane tank effluent except that a very small fraction 4 was 100 μm the size distribution of microplastics in dewatered sludge was close to that in the untreated leachate with particles 50μm in the dewatered sludge were slightly higher 57 in dws vs 52 in eb according to the shape the detected microplastics were divided into four different categories i e bead in a spherical shape fiber in a slender shape film in a lamellar shape and fragment in other irregular shapes figure 3b compares the proportion of different microplastic shapes in samples collected at different locations for the microplastics collected in eb bior and me the shape distribution followed similar patterns the fragments made up for the highest proportions in these samples which were 52 eb 58 bior and 58 me respectively in contrast beads accounted for the least with the proportion varied between 2 6 both fibers and films occupied about 20 of the microplastics collected from eb and me while the proportion of films 15 was slightly lower than that of fiber 24 in bior in the final effluent only two shapes were detected that the fragments accounted for 42 and fibers accounted for 57 for microplastics detected from rejected water and dewatered sludge the fraction of films was higher than other samples which were 31 rw and 27 dws respectively in comparison the proportion of fragments in the rw was slightly low at 46 while the proportion of fiber in dws was down to 3 3 3 microplastic mass and density in untreated leachate and leachate treatment units the calculated mass of each microplastic particle was plotted in figure 4 a against its major minor axis and volume in general 80 percent of the particles have a mass less than 0 02 μg and most of them were located in the zone with a major axis 200 μm and a minor axis 50 μm for microplastics particles 50 μm the average mass was only about 5 7 10 3 µg item however some particles have higher masses 0 2 μg which were mainly made from pp and pe and sourced from eb and bior the heaviest microplastic detected in this study is a pp particle collected from the eb with a mass of 0 67 μg as shown in figure 4b the mass of microplastics in eb has a wider deviation than those collected from other sites which should be related to a higher fraction of large particles compared with other groups the mean value of the microplastic mass decreased along with the leachate treatment route which is in accordance with the decrease in particle sizes figure 3b in contrast the average densities of microplastics increased along with the treatment route from 0 94 g cm3 in eb to 1 08 g cm3 however as the deviation in densities was only 16 the density would not have a significant impact on the mass of the particle compared with the size and the volume figure 4c compared the proportion of different polymers based on the mass in samples collected at six locations the proportion of pp particles accounted for the highest in eb though the number of pp particles was less than pe as the density of pp is comparable to pe the higher mass suggested that the pp particles in these samples have larger sizes than pe in addition for some polymers such as paa in eb eaa in me and kevlar in rw although percentages of their particle number were lower than 5 their mass could account for nearly 10 in each sample according to the average mass of microplastics the mass concentrations of different samples were calculated to be 11 4 0 8 μg l eb 0 92 0 10 mg l bior 0 022 0 003 μg l me 9 7 10 4 2 10 4 μg l fe 0 15 0 08 μg l rw and 20 1 5 μg gts dws respectively 3 4 the fate of microplastics in landfill leachate treatment works the membrane bioreactor nanofiltration reverse osmosis mbr nf ro processes applied in the studied landfill have widely been used for the leachate treatment zhang et al 2019 in this process the leachate was firstly treated in a membrane bioreactor with activated sludge and the treated leachate and the sludge were separated through membrane filtration the effluent of mbr was then treated by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis for further purification to understand the fate of microplastics in this commonly used process the microplastics loadings in different treatment units based on both particle and mass concentrations were estimated along the treatment route and summarized in figure 5 the operational parameters used for microplastics loading calculations were listed in table s2 according to the calculation the daily microplastics particle loading and mass loading flowed into the treatment works was 4 7 107 items d and 2 3 g d respectively the loading was then reduced by 98 4 particle and 99 8 mass after the recirculated mbr system after nf and ro treatment the microplastics particle and mass loadings were further reduced to 0 14 particle and 0 01 mass of those in the influent resulting in the daily microplastics discharge of 6 4 104 items d particle and 1 6 10 4 g d mass in the final effluent the considerable reduction in both particle and mass loading of microplastics confirmed that the mbr nf ro treatment processes could effectively reduce microplastics in the landfill leachate the microplastic loadings in the sludge processing route were also estimated as shown in figure 5 the microplastics discharged from the dewatered sludge could reach 1 8 108 items d particle and 6 0 g d mass this indicated that microplastics were significantly accumulated in the leachate treatment sludge which agreed with that observed in the wastewater treatment plant carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 however this study showed the microplastics loading in the excess sludge is much higher than that in the dewatered sludge figure 5 the unbalanced microplastics flow suggested dewatered sludge was not the only sink of the microplastics in the sludge treatment process whereas it may also accumulate the liquor after sludge dewatering to verify this assumption we firstly estimated the microplastics concentration in the sludge supernatant based on the concentrations in the dewatered sludge excess sludge and particle and mass balance the results suggested that sludge dewatering liquor had a microplastics concentration of 3 54 104 item l and 0 92 mg l the particle concentration is over 100 times higher than that in the untreated leachate and the mass concentration is about 65 times higher the high concentration resulted in the microplastics loading of the sludge dewatering liquor about 3 6 times higher particles and 2 6 times higher mass than that in the dewatered sludge for further verification we collected the sludge dewatering liquor on dec 8 2019 for direct microplastics analysis using the same method as described in section 2 the results showed that it had a microplastics concentration of 2 1 104 1 0 103 item l with the polymer types size and shape distribution presented in figure s5 si the measured microplastics concentration was in the same order of magnitude as the estimated results while the difference may be attributed to the variation of sludge characteristics on different sampling dates in a gap of nearly one year later this result further confirms the significant microplastics accumulation in the sludge dewatering liquor which would be recirculated to the leachate treatment system such as the mbr in this study 4 discussion 4 1 correcting the underestimation of microplastics in landfill leachate in this study we investigated the occurrence of microplastics in the landfill leachate with a minimum size of 10 μm the results showed that the particle concentration in untreated leachate is 10 50 times higher than those reported in previous studies he et al 2019 su et al 2019 as listed in table 1 according to the size fractions illustrated in figure 3b it can be estimated that in the tested leachate the particle concentration of microplastics with the size 100 μm was around 52 item l which was in the same order of magnitude as revealed by previous studies he et al 2019 su et al 2019 thus the higher abundance of microplastics observed could be explained by the smaller size it was detected in this study table 1 our study suggested the microplastics with a size smaller than 100 μm can account for 80 of all microplastics in the untreated leachate and the percentage of those 50 μm can over 50 figure 3 such results highlighted the importance of microplastics with smaller sizes in landfill leachate and suggested that applying the smallest size at 50 100 μm in microplastics detection could result in significant underestimation of its particle concentration for mass concentrations it was estimated at 33 μg l in the untreated leachate but is worth to be confirmed through thermoanalytical techniques in the future the thermoanalytical techniques applied for microplastics quantification mainly include thermoextraction and desorption gas chromatography mass spectroscopy ted gc ms and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms dümichen et al 2015 fischer and scholz böttcher 2017 fries et al 2013 fu et al 2020 prata et al 2019 the thermoanalytical techniques could provide mass information of microplastics but they are destructive and provide no information regarding the number size or shape besides the limit of detection of thermoanalytical methods was usually above 0 1 μg thus tiny microplastics 50 μm could not be detected as their mass were lower than 0 1 μg dümichen et al 2017 fischer and scholz böttcher 2017 based on our results microplastics with the size 50 μm could account for 85 of the total mass in untreated leachate thus the minimum size of 50 μm might be adequate for microplastics mass concentration estimation in the untreated leachate sample the differences in the microplastics pollution characteristics based on particle number and mass figure 1 and figure 3 indicated that both particle concentration and mass concentration should be investigated to fully understand microplastics pollution in the environment the comparison of our results with those obtained from wastewater systems suggested that microplastics in untreated leachate might contain more microplastics than the untreated wastewater table 1 long et at 2019 studied seven wastewater treatment plants in china and found that the microplastics concentration was 1 57 13 69 item l with the minimum detection size of 43 μm whereas our result showed that microplastics 43 μm in the untreated leachate was about ten times higher 120 item l moreover a recent study reported by raju et al 2020 showed that the microplastics concentration was 11 8 1 1 item l when the detected size went down to 1 5 μm accordingly the microplastics accumulated in the leachate treatment sludge were over one order of magnitude higher than that observed in the sludge for wastewater treatment table 1 although the differences in microplastics concentrations could also be related to different sampling regions and various detect methods given the high microplastics concentrations landfill leachate can be regarded as an important source of microplastics releasing into the environment and its effective removal is critical for microplastics control 4 2 insights into the sources and behavior of microplastics in the landfill leachate and leachate treatment works the most abundant microplastic materials detected in the untreated leachate were pe and pp which have been widely used in packings containers constructions and consumer products the high abundances of pe and pp were also in accordance with their high production amount accounting for 25 and 15 of the global production geyer et al 2017 in addition pe film was used for seepage control as well as the equalization basin cover in the studied landfill thus the release of microplastics from these films may also contribute to the pe microplastics contamination in the leachate however some frequently used plastic polymers such as pet and pvc showed low abundance or even not detected in the untreated leachate this could be related to the high density of these polymers and the high retention time of the leachate in the equalization basin as the designed retention time of the equalization basin were 70 days heavy microplastics such as pet density 1 2 g cm3 and pvc density 1 38 g cm3 were likely to be settled at the bottom of the basin and thus showed low abundance in the leachate collected these were also supported by the density distribution of microplastics in the untreated leachate figure 4b with about 80 were lower than 1 g cm3 and the mean value of 0 94 g cm3 during the leachate treatment it is noted that although the pore sizes of membranes were tiny at the nanometer scale 50 nm for mbr and 0 1 nm for ro in this study microplastics free effluent still could not be achieved the occurrence of microplastics in the effluent after membrane filtration has also been reported previously lares et al 2018 leslie et al 2017 michielssen et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 with the results 0 4 51 items l in mbr effluent and 0 28 items l ro effluent comparable to ours figure 1 as speculated by some researchers the microplastic detection may be attributed to some membrane defects or simply small openings between pipeworks poerio et al 2019 however the results of our study also suggested that the membrane filtration system itself might generate and release tiny microplastics probably due to the worn out of the system the principal components analysis of microplastics polymeric materials collected at different locations figure s4 showed that the polymeric materials in the ro effluent fe and ro reject water rw were significantly different from those in the untreated leachate eb and bioreactor bior indicating the microplastics in these samples may come from different sources moreover microplastics of polymeric materials commonly used in the membrane system such as pvdf used in mbr system and kevlar peak and pet used in nf ro system were mainly observed in samples related to membrane filtration me fe rw but absent or low in other samples this result also suggested that these microplastics were mainly originated from the membrane system the membrane filtration technology has been widely used in landfill leachate wastewater and drinking water treatment thus cautions should be taken with the possible tiny microplastics generation and release from these systems either into the effluent or the reject water with a comprehensive investigation worthy of being conducted in future it should also be noted that microplastics flow into in untreated leachate and out of in dewatered sludge rejected water and final effluent the studied system is not perfectly balanced this may be related to the daily fluctuation in microplastics concentrations and the special operation pattern of the system as the sludge dewatering was operated about fortnightly the microplastics loading in the dewatered sludge can be regarded as an average value over such a period while the loading in the untreated leachate is temporal loading on the sampling day however the result also showed that the difference in the mass loading is smaller than that in the particle loading suggested that microplastics may be broken into smaller pieces after dewatering or when recirculating in the biological treatment unit this is also supported by the smaller microplastics particle sizes in dewatered sludge and bioreactor than untreated leachate as suggested in figure 3b and figure 4a the processes and mechanisms for the breakage of microplastics in different treatment units were unclear so far however as tiny microplastics and also nano plastics are believed to exert more severe environmental hazards than the larger ones enders et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 the transformation of microplastics in different treatment processes is also worthy of investigation in the future 4 3 implications to the mitigation of microplastics in landfill leachate in practice the landfill leachate can be discharged directly to sewer systems and co treated with domestic wastewater for pollution control however differences in microplastics characteristics in the leachate and wastewater may affect the microplastics removal efficiency in the wastewater treatment plant in the wastewater microplastic fibers could account for a large proportion and may reach 60 90 in some cases lares et al 2018 raju et al 2020 sun et al 2019 however for the untreated leachate fibers only accounted for 21 of the total microplastics detected while the fragment becomes the most abundant 52 figure 3 such difference could be related to different sources of microplastics in wastewater and leachate a significant proportion of microplastics in the wastewater were originated from the laundry effluent which contained a high amount of fibers released from synthetic clothes hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 however the microplastics in landfill leachate were mainly sourced from the breakdown of different kinds of plastic products and thus the proportion of fibers were resembled plastic fiber products end up in the landfill geyer et al 2017 our result of microplastics shape distribution in landfill leachate was supported by kilponen 2016 who found that brook receiving landfill leachate showed a higher fraction of microplastics fragment 20 μm than other urban runoffs indicating fragment accounted for a high proportion in the leachate in conventional wastewater treatment processes it has been reported that microplastics were mainly removed through primary or secondary settling tanks 86 99 8 with fibers showed a higher removal rate than fragments lares et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 however such a settling process may be difficult to remove microplastics sourced from the leachate due to the high fragment ratio and neutral buoyancy average density 0 94 g cm3 as discussed above also the tiny microplastics which accounted for a large proportion in the leachate were more likely to escape from the treatment processes than large ones mintenig et al 2017 thus the removal efficiency of microplastics may be lower for a wastewater treatment plant receiving a high proportion of landfill leachate and additional measures should be taken if necessary the landfill leachate can also be treated separately on site our results confirmed that the mbr nf ro treatment processes could effectively reduce microplastics in the landfill leachate but meanwhile microplastics can be significantly accumulated in the sludge dewatering liquor with loading much higher than that in the dewatered sludge in the studied treatment work sludge was dewatered by a centrifugal dehydrator and the water in the sludge was separated with solids basically based on different densities thus it is likely that the microplastics with densities low than water were prone to stay in the water phase after dewatering which is supported by a high fraction of low density plastics in liquor figure s5 and increased particle density in dewatering sludge figure 3 the accumulation of microplastics in sludge dewatering liquor indicated centrifugal dewatering could be useful to separate low density microplastics from the sewage sludge this implies a new approach for microplastics control in the biological leachate treatment system in practice the dewatering liquor is usually recirculated to the beginning of the biological treatment process thus if microplastics in the sludge dewatering liquor could be separated e g through flotation or filtration their recirculation in the biological treatment system could be avoided and the microplastics accumulation in biological treatment sludge could be reduced this is expected to consequently decrease the microplastics in the secondary effluent and dewatered sludge two major microplastics releasing pathways to the environment as well as alleviated the possible decomposition of microplastics into tiny pieces when recirculated in treatment processes 5 conclusions this study investigated the tiny microplastics 10 µm in the landfill leachate and their fate in leachate treatment works and the following conclusions can be drawn the microplastics particle and mass concentrations in untreated leachate in the studied landfill were 235 4 17 1 item l and 11 4 0 8 µg l respectively as over 50 of microplastics in untreated landfill leachate were in the size of less than 50 µm applying the smallest size of 50 100 μm for microplastics detection in leachate samples could result in underestimation of the particle concentration polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant polymeric materials and the irregular fragment was the most abundant shape in the untreated leachate the shape distribution together with the neutral buoyancy of microplastics in the leachate suggested they may be difficult to remove by sedimentation the membrane bioreactor nanofiltration reverse osmosis treatment processes effectively reduced both particle and mass loadings of microplastics however tiny microplastics could also generate and released from membrane treatment systems the sludge dewatering liquor can contain a high amount of microplastics with the estimated loading much higher than that in dewatered sludge thus separating microplastics from sludge dewatering liquor could be beneficial to microplastics pollution control declaration of competing interest

17310,due to the environmental risks caused by microplastics understanding the sources and characteristics of microplastics and cutting off their routes into the environment are crucial however so far studies on microplastics in the landfill leachate system a major pathway of microplastics into the environment are still limited especially for tiny particles 50 µm that might have higher risks to the environment this study investigated the microplastics in landfill leachate and in leachate treatment works with a size detection limit down to 10 µm the results showed that the microplastics particle and mass concentrations in the untreated leachate were 235 4 17 1 item l and 11 4 0 8 µg l respectively with tiny particles 50 µm accounting for over 50 overall 27 polymeric materials were detected in leachate samples with polyethylene and polypropylene being the most abundant in the untreated leachate the neutral buoyancy of microplastics average density 0 94 g cm3 together with irregular shapes suggested they may be difficult to be removed by sedimentation further exploring the fate of microplastics in leachate treatment works showed that the membrane treatment effectively reduced microplastics loading to 0 14 for particle and 0 01 for mass but the average particle density rose the differences in polymeric materials distribution at different sampling locations and the presence of membrane related polymer in membrane treatment effluent suggested tiny microplastics could be generated and released from membrane systems moreover this study discovered that the sludge dewatering liquor could contain a high amount of microplastics and the estimated particle loading was about 3 6 times higher than that in dewatered sludge this suggested a new approach to microplastics

introduction microplastics as emerging contaminants are attracting increasing attention recently due to their potential risk to the environment the occurrence of microplastics was firstly identified in oceans and it was found to pose severe threatens to marine lives law and thompson 2014 thompson et al 2004 due to the small size of microplastics generally defined as less than 5 mm they can be easily ingested by aquatic species inflicting direct damage on their digestive tract or causing inflammation besseling et al 2014 chen et al 2006 sussarellu et al 2016 microplastics also serve as vectors of persistent organic pollutants pops which are either originated from plastics additives or adsorbed from the ambient water wang et al 2018 these compounds would be further desorbed inside the organisms after injection exacerbating pops bioaccumulation at higher trophic levels through the food chain browne et al 2013 rios et al 2010 recently the detection and identification of microplastics have been extended beyond the marine system which showed that microplastics could ubiquitously exist in both freshwater and terrestrial systems including rivers lakes farmlands urban roads and so on de souza machado et al 2018 li et al 2018 wagner et al 2018 moreover microplastics were also detected in our food purified drinking water and even the air we breathe allen et al 2019 karami et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2018 such wide spread of microplastics suggested that its effective control in different environmental sectors is in an urgent need while to address this need identifying the major sources of microplastics and their routes into the environment is an important premise microplastics are either primary or secondary in origin the primary microplastics are directly manufactured in small sizes such as microbeads and are commonly used as exfoliants in cosmetic products rochman et al 2015 whereas a large proportion of microplastics are secondary which were unintentionally generated from large debris of plastic products through weathering processes such as hydrolysis mechanical abrasion biodegradation and photodegradation alimi et al 2018 our daily life relies heavily on plastics products with global production exceeds 380 million tons in 2015 and a compound annual growth rate of 8 4 geyer et al 2017 it has been estimated that a considerable fraction 21 42 of these plastic products would end up in the municipal solid waste landfills nizzetto et al 2016 which consequently serving as a huge reservoir of plastic wastes as relatively closely sealed plastic wastes in landfills are subjected to severe environmental conditions such as varying ph 4 5 9 high salinity ca 3 41 ms cm fluctuating temperature ca 30 60 c physical stress and microbial degradation which may lead to the fragmentation of plastics to microplastics hanson et al 2010 kawai et al 2012 kjeldsen et al 2002 ogata et al 2016 tupsakhare et al 2020 thus the potential release of microplastics from the landfill is worthy to be investigated for the aim of effective microplastic pollution control by cutting its route into the environment the landfill leachate carrying abundant pollutants is generally considered an important source of pollution releasing from the landfill it has been speculated that landfill has been leaking microplastic through landfill leachate and may consequently introduce them to the surrounding soil however the study on characteristics of microplastics pollution in the landfill leachate is still limited so far early research conducted by kilponen et al 2016 investigated the microplastics in landfill leachate indirectly by characterization waterways receiving the leachate more recently a few studies investigated microplastics in the landfill leachate directly he et al 2019 su et al 2019 the microplastics concentration reported in these two studies were 0 42 24 58 item l and 4 13 item l respectively however the smallest particle sizes detected in these studies are limited to 50 100 μm which may lead to the underestimation of microplastics abundance in the landfill leachate actually the tiny microplastics 50 μm can account for a large proportion 70 in all microplastics found in the water environment and are believed to exert more severe environmental hazards than the larger ones enders et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 therefore identification of tiny microplastics is important for characterizing microplastics in landfill leachate in addition it lacks a systematic investigation of the fate of the microplastics in the landfill leachate treatment processes which is essential for leachate carrying microplastics control therefore this study aims to comprehensively investigate microplastics pollution characteristics in the landfill leachate with a broader size range as the micro raman spectroscopy had higher resolution and sensitivity compared with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy araujo et al 2018 it was applied for microplastics identification and characterization in this study the minimum size of microplastics identified in this study was down to 10 μm the masses of microplastics identified were estimated based on the volume and the density of the particle in addition the microplastics in different leachate treatment units were also analyzed to explore their fate during the treatment based on the results of this study implications on microplastics detection sources and mitigation in the landfill leachate were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics sampling a municipal solid waste landfill in suzhou china was sampled in this study the landfill has a designed load capacity of 2 100 000 m3 and receives 480 t municipal solid wastes per day the landfill leachate was first transported to an equalization basin and then treated through screening a recirculated membrane bioreactor nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro before discharging the details of the leachate treatment processes applied were shown in figure s1 supporting information the microplastics were sampled using a glass jar at six different locations as indicated in figure s1 including equalization basin eb regarded as raw leachate before treatment bioreactor bior membrane tank effluent me final effluent fe rejected water of ro system rw and the dewatered sludge dws two replicates of samples were taken at each location on dec 18 2018 the leachate samples collected at eb were filtered on site through a stack of stainless steel sieves 20 cm in diameter with descending mesh sizes of 150 μm and 10 μm to collect any debris present one liter of the sample was successfully filtered as the blockage of the 10 μm sieves occurs afterward for me fe and rw 40l of water in each sampling point were also filtered on site through with a 10 μm sieve directly the collected debris was washed into a glass bottle with filtered deionized water for further processing due to high solid fractions the bioreactor mixture bior 500 ml and dewatered sludge dws 500g were transferred into stainless steel containers and directly transported to the laboratory for microplastics extraction 2 2 microplastics extraction the wet peroxidation was firstly conducted to remove the natural organic matter in the collected debris bioreactor mixture and dewatered sludge the peroxidation procedure was performed according to which described by tagg et al 2017 with some modification briefly the sample was transferred to a beaker and then treated with 100 ml of fenton reagent 0 05m fe ii and 30 hydrogen peroxide at ph 3 before the reaction the beaker was placed in a cold water bath 10 c to prevent violent boiling at the beginning of the reaction after the boiling subsided the beaker was heated up to 60 c for 30min for full digestion of organic matter due to the high solid content 10 ml of bioreactor mixture and 5 g of sludge was treated in this step also the peroxidation process was repeated twice to achieve the thorough removal of organic matter for these samples after the peroxidation the mixture was filtered through a 10 μm mesh stainless steel sieve and rinsed with 500 ml filtered deionized water to get rid of all reagents then the density separation was performed to remove the inorganic particles in the samples the solids retained by 10 μm mesh were transferred to a 50ml silicate centrifuge tube using zncl2 solution with a density of 1 6 mg ml the tube was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm 134 16g for 10min the supernatant containing the microplastics was vacuum filtered through a gridded nitrocellulose filter with the pore size of 0 45 μm the low speed centrifuge has been applied in many studies to enhance density separation efficiency with the characteristics of microplastics remain unaffected tagg et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 the density separation step was conducted in triplicate to ensure that all potential microplastics particles could be separated from the sample 2 3 microplastics identification using micro raman spectroscopy the micro raman spectrometer hr evolution horiba paris france operated by labspec 6 software horiba paris france was applied to identify the chemical compositions of extracted particles on the gridded filter each particle on the filters was analyzed using a 532 nm frequency doubled nd yag laser laser quantum stockport cheshire united kingdom coupled to an olympus bxfm optical microscope the laser beam was focused through a 50 objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0 75 the confocal hole width was set to 300 μm and the confocal slit width to 100 μm a grating with 600 grooves mm was used to prevent sample destruction and increase the signal noise ratio laser power applied to the samples ranged from 2 to 20 mw depending on the nature of the particles raman spectra were recorded in a range from 150 to 3500 cm 1 and the identification was conducted in duplicate at least for each particle for validation the spectral data were corrected for instrumental artifacts and baseline subtracted using a polynomial fitting algorithm in labspec 6 it was then compared with were compared against a commercial raman library knowital informatics system horiba edition bio rad laboratories inc hercules california usa for material identification because of the large number of particles in some filters such as that from sites of eb bior and dws it was impractical to identify all material present thus the particles on 1 8 to 1 4 area of the filtered were picked randomly according to the grids and thoroughly analyzed as the subsample in addition the shape bead fiber particle and film size and color of each identified microplastic were sorted simultaneously by using the microscope coupled with the raman spectrometer 2 4 quality control for microplastics sampling and extraction to minimize contamination all apparatuses used in the sampling and extraction processes such as glassware stainless steer containers and sieves were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water the sieves and beakers were covered with aluminum foil in the procedure after sampling the filters were placed in glass petri dishes immediately all liquid reagents including deionized water hydrogen peroxide hydrochloric acid and zncl2 solution were filtered with a 0 45μm nitrocellulose filter before use the application of plastic tools was avoided as possible nitrile gloves and cotton lab coats were worn at all times during the sampling process and laboratory work triplicated blank samples were taken to detect possible sources of contamination during sampling and extraction clean sieves 10 μm were left out for the duration of sampling to collect any atmospheric microplastics that may be present it was then processed and analyzed with the same procedures as the leachate samples described above it was found that on average 4 3 microplastics were in the blank samples which mainly consisted of polypropylene pp and polyethylene pe the microplastics counts in blank samples were much lower than the number of microplastics detected in leachate and sludge samples indicating that the results were reliable 2 5 microplastics mass estimation the masses of microplastics were estimated based on the volume and the density according to the method described by simon et al 2018 for the microplastic beads and fragments the volume was estimated by assuming an ellipsoid shape the major axis the longest continuous axis in the center of the particle and the minor axis the longest axis perpendicular to the major axis were measured using the microscope coupled on the raman spectrometer the ratio of the thickness and the minor dimension of the fragments and beads were assumed the same as the ratio of the minor and major dimensions for fragments it was calculated a median value of 0 67 0 20 thus the thickness was estimated at 67 of the minor dimension for beads it was calculated a median value of 0 91 0 05 thus the thickness was estimated at 91 of the minor dimension for the film the volume was estimated by assuming an elliptic cylindrical shape the thickness was evaluated using the microscope by recording vertical displacement when the focal point moved from the top of the microplastics film to the filter bakke and olsson 1986 the volume of fiber was calculated presuming a cylindrical shape with a 40 void fraction the density of different microplastics polymer used in the calculation is listed in table s1 si 3 results 3 1 abundances and polymeric materials of microplastics in untreated leachate and leachate treatment units the abundances and polymer materials of microplastics in the untreated landfill leachate and samples taken at different treatment units were summarized in figure 1 the concentration of microplastics in untreated leachate eb was 235 4 17 1 item l and it increased by 150 times in mixture collected from bioreactor bior 3 51 104 4 0 103item l suggesting the accumulation effect of microplastics in the treatment system after membrane separation the concentration decreased substantially to 3 8 0 5 item l at membrane tank effluent me and further dropped to 0 4 0 1 item l in the final effluent fe which accounted for only 0 16 of that in the untreated leachate in comparison the microplastics in the reject water from the ro system rw was 9 5 0 5 item l which was 23 times higher than ro effluent the dewatered sludge dws usually considered as the sink of microplastics showed a concentration of 598 1 44 6 item gts the polymer materials of microplastics were identified by micro raman spectroscopy and the spectra of some typical polymers were shown in figure s2 in total 27 different kinds of microplastic polymers were identified in all collected samples as illustrated in figure 1 pe and pp are the two most abundant polymers in eb which accounted for 33 0 and 32 4 respectively in contrast the fractions of other polymers detected in eb such as polyamide pa polyvinyl alcohol pva polyvinyl butyral pvb polymethylpentene pmp polyacrylic acid paa poly n butylamethacrylate pbma was closed to or lower than 5 pe and pp also showed high abundances in the sample collected from bior pe 36 2 and pp 25 1 as well as membrane tank effluent pe 33 9 and pp 12 7 some other polymers also presented relatively high abundances in samples collected at these two locations for example the percentage of polyethylene co acrylic acid eaa was 11 4 in bior and the percentage of pvb polyacrylamide pam and polystyrene ps in me were 17 0 8 5 and 8 5 respectively however the materials of microplastics in fe followed a different pattern compared to other samples only five types of polymers were detected with polyaryletherketone paek become the most abundant at 50 in comparison the microplastics in rw showed a higher diversity the pe presented the highest abundance 23 8 which was followed by pva 11 3 pvb 11 3 pp 8 5 and pa 8 5 other polymers such as kevlar polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polybutyl terephthalate pbt and polycaprolactone pcl were also detected but their proportions were low 3 for dws the percentage of pe 17 7 and pp 17 2 were lower than those in eb and bior while the fractions of some other polymers became higher such as pa 17 2 and pva 13 7 in addition the pam was also detected in dws with the proportion being 10 3 3 2 appearance characteristics of microplastics in untreated leachate and leachate treatment units the microplastics detected in the leachate and sludge samples were in different colors shapes and sizes with some examples of their appearances shown in figure 2 among all the detected microplastics over 90 are transparent or yellowish while some 10 were in colors of red pink purple black blue and brown figure s3 the high abundance of transparent and yellowish color suggested that most particles were aged and presented in the landfill system for a long time the size defined as the length of the major axis distributions of the microplastics collected at different locations were summarized and compared in figure 3 a overall the microplastic particle 50 μm accounted for high proportions 52 100 in all collected samples and a significant decrease in microplastic sizes can be observed along the leachate treatment route specifically in the untreated leachate eb the microplastics with the size 100 μm and 50 100 μm accounted for 22 and 26 respectively and the proportion decreased to 16 and 12 for the sample taken from bior meanwhile the proportion of particles in 20 50 μm and 20 μm increased from 46 eb to 60 bior and 7 eb to 12 bior respectively in the me all the microplastics were in the size of 100 μm and the percentage of microplastics in 50 μm was increased to 80 with percentages of particles 20 μm being 17 in the fe all the particles detected were 50 μm and the percentage of microplastics 20 μm increased significantly to 44 for the rw the size distribution was similar to that in membrane tank effluent except that a very small fraction 4 was 100 μm the size distribution of microplastics in dewatered sludge was close to that in the untreated leachate with particles 50μm in the dewatered sludge were slightly higher 57 in dws vs 52 in eb according to the shape the detected microplastics were divided into four different categories i e bead in a spherical shape fiber in a slender shape film in a lamellar shape and fragment in other irregular shapes figure 3b compares the proportion of different microplastic shapes in samples collected at different locations for the microplastics collected in eb bior and me the shape distribution followed similar patterns the fragments made up for the highest proportions in these samples which were 52 eb 58 bior and 58 me respectively in contrast beads accounted for the least with the proportion varied between 2 6 both fibers and films occupied about 20 of the microplastics collected from eb and me while the proportion of films 15 was slightly lower than that of fiber 24 in bior in the final effluent only two shapes were detected that the fragments accounted for 42 and fibers accounted for 57 for microplastics detected from rejected water and dewatered sludge the fraction of films was higher than other samples which were 31 rw and 27 dws respectively in comparison the proportion of fragments in the rw was slightly low at 46 while the proportion of fiber in dws was down to 3 3 3 microplastic mass and density in untreated leachate and leachate treatment units the calculated mass of each microplastic particle was plotted in figure 4 a against its major minor axis and volume in general 80 percent of the particles have a mass less than 0 02 μg and most of them were located in the zone with a major axis 200 μm and a minor axis 50 μm for microplastics particles 50 μm the average mass was only about 5 7 10 3 µg item however some particles have higher masses 0 2 μg which were mainly made from pp and pe and sourced from eb and bior the heaviest microplastic detected in this study is a pp particle collected from the eb with a mass of 0 67 μg as shown in figure 4b the mass of microplastics in eb has a wider deviation than those collected from other sites which should be related to a higher fraction of large particles compared with other groups the mean value of the microplastic mass decreased along with the leachate treatment route which is in accordance with the decrease in particle sizes figure 3b in contrast the average densities of microplastics increased along with the treatment route from 0 94 g cm3 in eb to 1 08 g cm3 however as the deviation in densities was only 16 the density would not have a significant impact on the mass of the particle compared with the size and the volume figure 4c compared the proportion of different polymers based on the mass in samples collected at six locations the proportion of pp particles accounted for the highest in eb though the number of pp particles was less than pe as the density of pp is comparable to pe the higher mass suggested that the pp particles in these samples have larger sizes than pe in addition for some polymers such as paa in eb eaa in me and kevlar in rw although percentages of their particle number were lower than 5 their mass could account for nearly 10 in each sample according to the average mass of microplastics the mass concentrations of different samples were calculated to be 11 4 0 8 μg l eb 0 92 0 10 mg l bior 0 022 0 003 μg l me 9 7 10 4 2 10 4 μg l fe 0 15 0 08 μg l rw and 20 1 5 μg gts dws respectively 3 4 the fate of microplastics in landfill leachate treatment works the membrane bioreactor nanofiltration reverse osmosis mbr nf ro processes applied in the studied landfill have widely been used for the leachate treatment zhang et al 2019 in this process the leachate was firstly treated in a membrane bioreactor with activated sludge and the treated leachate and the sludge were separated through membrane filtration the effluent of mbr was then treated by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis for further purification to understand the fate of microplastics in this commonly used process the microplastics loadings in different treatment units based on both particle and mass concentrations were estimated along the treatment route and summarized in figure 5 the operational parameters used for microplastics loading calculations were listed in table s2 according to the calculation the daily microplastics particle loading and mass loading flowed into the treatment works was 4 7 107 items d and 2 3 g d respectively the loading was then reduced by 98 4 particle and 99 8 mass after the recirculated mbr system after nf and ro treatment the microplastics particle and mass loadings were further reduced to 0 14 particle and 0 01 mass of those in the influent resulting in the daily microplastics discharge of 6 4 104 items d particle and 1 6 10 4 g d mass in the final effluent the considerable reduction in both particle and mass loading of microplastics confirmed that the mbr nf ro treatment processes could effectively reduce microplastics in the landfill leachate the microplastic loadings in the sludge processing route were also estimated as shown in figure 5 the microplastics discharged from the dewatered sludge could reach 1 8 108 items d particle and 6 0 g d mass this indicated that microplastics were significantly accumulated in the leachate treatment sludge which agreed with that observed in the wastewater treatment plant carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 however this study showed the microplastics loading in the excess sludge is much higher than that in the dewatered sludge figure 5 the unbalanced microplastics flow suggested dewatered sludge was not the only sink of the microplastics in the sludge treatment process whereas it may also accumulate the liquor after sludge dewatering to verify this assumption we firstly estimated the microplastics concentration in the sludge supernatant based on the concentrations in the dewatered sludge excess sludge and particle and mass balance the results suggested that sludge dewatering liquor had a microplastics concentration of 3 54 104 item l and 0 92 mg l the particle concentration is over 100 times higher than that in the untreated leachate and the mass concentration is about 65 times higher the high concentration resulted in the microplastics loading of the sludge dewatering liquor about 3 6 times higher particles and 2 6 times higher mass than that in the dewatered sludge for further verification we collected the sludge dewatering liquor on dec 8 2019 for direct microplastics analysis using the same method as described in section 2 the results showed that it had a microplastics concentration of 2 1 104 1 0 103 item l with the polymer types size and shape distribution presented in figure s5 si the measured microplastics concentration was in the same order of magnitude as the estimated results while the difference may be attributed to the variation of sludge characteristics on different sampling dates in a gap of nearly one year later this result further confirms the significant microplastics accumulation in the sludge dewatering liquor which would be recirculated to the leachate treatment system such as the mbr in this study 4 discussion 4 1 correcting the underestimation of microplastics in landfill leachate in this study we investigated the occurrence of microplastics in the landfill leachate with a minimum size of 10 μm the results showed that the particle concentration in untreated leachate is 10 50 times higher than those reported in previous studies he et al 2019 su et al 2019 as listed in table 1 according to the size fractions illustrated in figure 3b it can be estimated that in the tested leachate the particle concentration of microplastics with the size 100 μm was around 52 item l which was in the same order of magnitude as revealed by previous studies he et al 2019 su et al 2019 thus the higher abundance of microplastics observed could be explained by the smaller size it was detected in this study table 1 our study suggested the microplastics with a size smaller than 100 μm can account for 80 of all microplastics in the untreated leachate and the percentage of those 50 μm can over 50 figure 3 such results highlighted the importance of microplastics with smaller sizes in landfill leachate and suggested that applying the smallest size at 50 100 μm in microplastics detection could result in significant underestimation of its particle concentration for mass concentrations it was estimated at 33 μg l in the untreated leachate but is worth to be confirmed through thermoanalytical techniques in the future the thermoanalytical techniques applied for microplastics quantification mainly include thermoextraction and desorption gas chromatography mass spectroscopy ted gc ms and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms dümichen et al 2015 fischer and scholz böttcher 2017 fries et al 2013 fu et al 2020 prata et al 2019 the thermoanalytical techniques could provide mass information of microplastics but they are destructive and provide no information regarding the number size or shape besides the limit of detection of thermoanalytical methods was usually above 0 1 μg thus tiny microplastics 50 μm could not be detected as their mass were lower than 0 1 μg dümichen et al 2017 fischer and scholz böttcher 2017 based on our results microplastics with the size 50 μm could account for 85 of the total mass in untreated leachate thus the minimum size of 50 μm might be adequate for microplastics mass concentration estimation in the untreated leachate sample the differences in the microplastics pollution characteristics based on particle number and mass figure 1 and figure 3 indicated that both particle concentration and mass concentration should be investigated to fully understand microplastics pollution in the environment the comparison of our results with those obtained from wastewater systems suggested that microplastics in untreated leachate might contain more microplastics than the untreated wastewater table 1 long et at 2019 studied seven wastewater treatment plants in china and found that the microplastics concentration was 1 57 13 69 item l with the minimum detection size of 43 μm whereas our result showed that microplastics 43 μm in the untreated leachate was about ten times higher 120 item l moreover a recent study reported by raju et al 2020 showed that the microplastics concentration was 11 8 1 1 item l when the detected size went down to 1 5 μm accordingly the microplastics accumulated in the leachate treatment sludge were over one order of magnitude higher than that observed in the sludge for wastewater treatment table 1 although the differences in microplastics concentrations could also be related to different sampling regions and various detect methods given the high microplastics concentrations landfill leachate can be regarded as an important source of microplastics releasing into the environment and its effective removal is critical for microplastics control 4 2 insights into the sources and behavior of microplastics in the landfill leachate and leachate treatment works the most abundant microplastic materials detected in the untreated leachate were pe and pp which have been widely used in packings containers constructions and consumer products the high abundances of pe and pp were also in accordance with their high production amount accounting for 25 and 15 of the global production geyer et al 2017 in addition pe film was used for seepage control as well as the equalization basin cover in the studied landfill thus the release of microplastics from these films may also contribute to the pe microplastics contamination in the leachate however some frequently used plastic polymers such as pet and pvc showed low abundance or even not detected in the untreated leachate this could be related to the high density of these polymers and the high retention time of the leachate in the equalization basin as the designed retention time of the equalization basin were 70 days heavy microplastics such as pet density 1 2 g cm3 and pvc density 1 38 g cm3 were likely to be settled at the bottom of the basin and thus showed low abundance in the leachate collected these were also supported by the density distribution of microplastics in the untreated leachate figure 4b with about 80 were lower than 1 g cm3 and the mean value of 0 94 g cm3 during the leachate treatment it is noted that although the pore sizes of membranes were tiny at the nanometer scale 50 nm for mbr and 0 1 nm for ro in this study microplastics free effluent still could not be achieved the occurrence of microplastics in the effluent after membrane filtration has also been reported previously lares et al 2018 leslie et al 2017 michielssen et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 with the results 0 4 51 items l in mbr effluent and 0 28 items l ro effluent comparable to ours figure 1 as speculated by some researchers the microplastic detection may be attributed to some membrane defects or simply small openings between pipeworks poerio et al 2019 however the results of our study also suggested that the membrane filtration system itself might generate and release tiny microplastics probably due to the worn out of the system the principal components analysis of microplastics polymeric materials collected at different locations figure s4 showed that the polymeric materials in the ro effluent fe and ro reject water rw were significantly different from those in the untreated leachate eb and bioreactor bior indicating the microplastics in these samples may come from different sources moreover microplastics of polymeric materials commonly used in the membrane system such as pvdf used in mbr system and kevlar peak and pet used in nf ro system were mainly observed in samples related to membrane filtration me fe rw but absent or low in other samples this result also suggested that these microplastics were mainly originated from the membrane system the membrane filtration technology has been widely used in landfill leachate wastewater and drinking water treatment thus cautions should be taken with the possible tiny microplastics generation and release from these systems either into the effluent or the reject water with a comprehensive investigation worthy of being conducted in future it should also be noted that microplastics flow into in untreated leachate and out of in dewatered sludge rejected water and final effluent the studied system is not perfectly balanced this may be related to the daily fluctuation in microplastics concentrations and the special operation pattern of the system as the sludge dewatering was operated about fortnightly the microplastics loading in the dewatered sludge can be regarded as an average value over such a period while the loading in the untreated leachate is temporal loading on the sampling day however the result also showed that the difference in the mass loading is smaller than that in the particle loading suggested that microplastics may be broken into smaller pieces after dewatering or when recirculating in the biological treatment unit this is also supported by the smaller microplastics particle sizes in dewatered sludge and bioreactor than untreated leachate as suggested in figure 3b and figure 4a the processes and mechanisms for the breakage of microplastics in different treatment units were unclear so far however as tiny microplastics and also nano plastics are believed to exert more severe environmental hazards than the larger ones enders et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 the transformation of microplastics in different treatment processes is also worthy of investigation in the future 4 3 implications to the mitigation of microplastics in landfill leachate in practice the landfill leachate can be discharged directly to sewer systems and co treated with domestic wastewater for pollution control however differences in microplastics characteristics in the leachate and wastewater may affect the microplastics removal efficiency in the wastewater treatment plant in the wastewater microplastic fibers could account for a large proportion and may reach 60 90 in some cases lares et al 2018 raju et al 2020 sun et al 2019 however for the untreated leachate fibers only accounted for 21 of the total microplastics detected while the fragment becomes the most abundant 52 figure 3 such difference could be related to different sources of microplastics in wastewater and leachate a significant proportion of microplastics in the wastewater were originated from the laundry effluent which contained a high amount of fibers released from synthetic clothes hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 however the microplastics in landfill leachate were mainly sourced from the breakdown of different kinds of plastic products and thus the proportion of fibers were resembled plastic fiber products end up in the landfill geyer et al 2017 our result of microplastics shape distribution in landfill leachate was supported by kilponen 2016 who found that brook receiving landfill leachate showed a higher fraction of microplastics fragment 20 μm than other urban runoffs indicating fragment accounted for a high proportion in the leachate in conventional wastewater treatment processes it has been reported that microplastics were mainly removed through primary or secondary settling tanks 86 99 8 with fibers showed a higher removal rate than fragments lares et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 however such a settling process may be difficult to remove microplastics sourced from the leachate due to the high fragment ratio and neutral buoyancy average density 0 94 g cm3 as discussed above also the tiny microplastics which accounted for a large proportion in the leachate were more likely to escape from the treatment processes than large ones mintenig et al 2017 thus the removal efficiency of microplastics may be lower for a wastewater treatment plant receiving a high proportion of landfill leachate and additional measures should be taken if necessary the landfill leachate can also be treated separately on site our results confirmed that the mbr nf ro treatment processes could effectively reduce microplastics in the landfill leachate but meanwhile microplastics can be significantly accumulated in the sludge dewatering liquor with loading much higher than that in the dewatered sludge in the studied treatment work sludge was dewatered by a centrifugal dehydrator and the water in the sludge was separated with solids basically based on different densities thus it is likely that the microplastics with densities low than water were prone to stay in the water phase after dewatering which is supported by a high fraction of low density plastics in liquor figure s5 and increased particle density in dewatering sludge figure 3 the accumulation of microplastics in sludge dewatering liquor indicated centrifugal dewatering could be useful to separate low density microplastics from the sewage sludge this implies a new approach for microplastics control in the biological leachate treatment system in practice the dewatering liquor is usually recirculated to the beginning of the biological treatment process thus if microplastics in the sludge dewatering liquor could be separated e g through flotation or filtration their recirculation in the biological treatment system could be avoided and the microplastics accumulation in biological treatment sludge could be reduced this is expected to consequently decrease the microplastics in the secondary effluent and dewatered sludge two major microplastics releasing pathways to the environment as well as alleviated the possible decomposition of microplastics into tiny pieces when recirculated in treatment processes 5 conclusions this study investigated the tiny microplastics 10 µm in the landfill leachate and their fate in leachate treatment works and the following conclusions can be drawn the microplastics particle and mass concentrations in untreated leachate in the studied landfill were 235 4 17 1 item l and 11 4 0 8 µg l respectively as over 50 of microplastics in untreated landfill leachate were in the size of less than 50 µm applying the smallest size of 50 100 μm for microplastics detection in leachate samples could result in underestimation of the particle concentration polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant polymeric materials and the irregular fragment was the most abundant shape in the untreated leachate the shape distribution together with the neutral buoyancy of microplastics in the leachate suggested they may be difficult to remove by sedimentation the membrane bioreactor nanofiltration reverse osmosis treatment processes effectively reduced both particle and mass loadings of microplastics however tiny microplastics could also generate and released from membrane treatment systems the sludge dewatering liquor can contain a high amount of microplastics with the estimated loading much higher than that in dewatered sludge thus separating microplastics from sludge dewatering liquor could be beneficial to microplastics pollution control declaration of competing interest

17311,the feasibility of a continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation ccesp process was evaluated for desupersaturation of primary reverse osmosis pro concentrate generated from ro desalting of inland agricultural drainage ad water with high gypsum scaling potential the ccesp approach comprised of partial lime treatment plt followed by gypsum seeded precipitation gsp was assessed via

gsp was carried out in a fluidized bed crystallizer fbc demonstrating the feasibility of continuous pro concentrate desupersaturation with suitable solids management fbc operation was stable with respect to desupersaturation performance when operating over a sequence of periodic solids purge only mode with intermittent seeds replenishment the study suggests that ccesp integration with primary

reclamation and reuse applications cadwr 2016 implementation of ro technology especially in inland locations requires operation at high recovery to both maximize water production and minimize the cost of handling the ro concentrate e g environmental technical challenges for disposal disposal costs water source loss etc to ensure environmentally compatible operation that complies with regulatory requirements choi et al 2019a rahardianto et al 2010 ravichandran et al 2019 however membrane mineral salt scaling remains a critical impediment to achieving high recovery brackish water desalination aghdam et al 2016 ayoub et al 2018 lee et al 2019a particularly when the water source is of high membrane scaling potential i e high concentration of sparingly water soluble mineral salts such as gypsum caso4 2h2o calcium carbonate caco3 barite baso4 and silica sio2 mitigation of mineral scaling via feed ph adjustment is feasible for scalants of ph dependent solubility e g calcium carbonate magnesium hydroxide and silica but relies on use of antiscalants as dosing of the ro feed for suppression or retardation of crystallization of scalants such as gypsum and barite as well as calcite and silica scaling cohen et al 2014 however antiscalant dosing for mitigating scaling due to calcite strontium sulfate calcium sulfate barium sulfate and silica i e caco3 srso4 caso4 and baso4 and sio2 is suitable only when these scalants are not present above saturation by factors of 60 8 2 3 4 60 80 and 1 3 respectively hydranautics 2013 thompson et al 2013 therefore overall ro recovery is limited even with antiscalant dosing of the ro feed in order to overcome ro recovery limitation imposed by mineral scaling a number of two stage ro processes with intermediate concentrate demineralization icd have been proposed aghdam et al 2016 ayoub et al 2018 rahardianto et al 2010 sanciolo and gray 2017 the icd process reduces the concentration of scale precursors e g calcium carbonate and sulfate ions in the primary ro pro concentrate by precipitating the problematic mineral scalants by reducing the mineral scalants saturation to a sufficiently low level i e near or below saturation it is then possible to further desalt the pro concentrate in a subsequent secondary ro sro process fig 1 depending on source water characteristics icd can be implemented via various precipitative processes including precipitative softening conceptually similar to the classical lime softening and seeded precipitation which can be integrated with partial lime treatment plt using various seed types including calcite caco3 gypsum caso4 2h2o mccool et al 2012 rahardianto et al 2010 silica sio2 de luna et al 2017 calcium phosphate sanciolo and gray 2017 and barite baso4 aghdam et al 2016 the suitability of integrating seeded precipitation with plt which is referred to as chemically enhanced seeded precipitation cesp in a continuous manner requires 1 effective removal of residual antiscalant from pro concentrate via partial lime treatment plt to avoid retardation of gypsum precipitation and 2 solids management to ensure stable gsp operation given temporal particle size distribution changes plt can be reasonably performed in a reactor configuration such as continuous tank reactor i e a single solid contact clarifier or cstr equipped with liquid solid separation unit such as hydrocyclone plate settler as has been widely practiced in typical lime softening kalscheur et al 2006 as well as ro concentrate desupersaturation ravichandran et al 2019 the subsequent step of seeded precipitation is to desupersaturated the pro concentrate with respect to the problematic mineral scalants so as to enable downstream sro desalting to increase the attainable overall product water recovery seeded pro concentrate desupersaturation can be achieved using a fluidized bed crystallizer fbc de luna et al 2017 harms and robinson 1992 maharaj et al 2018 for high degree of desupersaturation in a small footprint while avoiding sludge formation and providing for recovery of potentially beneficial mineral salts in the fbc suspended particles are less prone to attrition and breakage than in circulating suspension crystallizers and stirred tank crystallizers with impeller mixing binev et al 2015 other reported fbc advantages include lower capital cost low footprint operational simplicity and low maintenance harms and robinson 1992 previous experimental fluidized bed crystallization studies employing gypsum crystallization for sulfate and magnesium removal focused on the impact of various operational factors e g initial conditions such as seed mass loading initial ion concentration and ratio seed reusability and fines production due to primary nucleation on fbc performance de luna et al 2017 maharaj et al 2018 these previous studies clearly demonstrated the potential of fbc effectiveness for seeded precipitation for gypsum desupersaturation however a systematic approach to establishing continuous plt fbc operation has not been previously demonstrated for ro concentrate desupersaturation accordingly the present work explores the critical elements of fbc operation via a process model simulation along with both laboratory and field testing to evaluate ccesp feasibility in support of attaining high recovery ro desalination 2 evaluation of continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation ccesp 2 1 overview the development and demonstration of a continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation ccesp process for pro concentrate desupersaturation to enable enhanced recovery via subsequent sro desalting followed five major steps step i focused on experimental validation of residual antiscalant removal from pro concentrate as quantified by gypsum seeded precipitation gsp effectiveness for concentrate desupersaturation in step ii gsp kinetics was quantified in laboratory gypsum desupersaturation experiments subsequently step iii consisted of laboratory experiments along with fbc model simulations to establish operating conditions and solids handling regiment for stable fbc operation in step iv ccesp evaluation was carried out in both laboratory and field testing at conditions streamlined by fbc model simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of ccesp finally the feasible maximum water recovery enhancement via pro ccesp sro was assessed for a target source water to demonstrate the potential for process scalability step v 2 2 fluidized bed crystallizer fbc for gypsum removal the process of continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation ccesp for gypsum desupersaturation of ro concentrate requires stable fbc operation fig 2 accordingly a numerical model was developed to describe the calcium concentration profile and particle size distribution along the fbc bed and to evaluate the impact of purging and replenishment of gypsum particles on fbc operation calcium concentration c profile in the fbc can be described by the following equation 1 d c d t u w d c d x r g s p where c is the dissolved calcium concentration taken to be radially uniform along axial position x at time t uw is the average interstitial velocity i e superficial velocity bed porosity in the fbc bed and rgsp is the rate of calcium removal eq 1 was solved via a finite difference approach section s1 supporting information si whereby the fbc reactor bed volume vr was divided vertically into nbins equal sized bins of volume v i v r n b i n s fig 2 the rate of gypsum seeded precipitation rgsp in the ith bin can be expressed via the following second order kinetics christoffersen et al 1982 nancollas 1979 2 r g s p i t d c i d t k a i c i t c s 2 where c i and c s are the calcium concentration in the ith bin and at saturation i e sig 1 respectively a i is the total area of particles in bini per bin unit volume and k is the gypsum surface reaction rate constant previous studies have reported that gypsum seeded desupersaturation of supersaturated calcium sulfate solution is primarily surface reaction controlled hence the rate of desupersaturation is driven by the particles surface area per suspension volume the surface reaction rate constant can be determined from experiments in a stirred reactor whereby desupersaturation of a supersaturated solution with respect to gypsum with a predetermined gypsum seeds loading is monitored over time in this approach the following solution to eq 2 is fitted to the calcium time concentration data c 0 c c 0 c s c c s k t where c 0 and cs are the initial calcium ion concentration and at saturation respectively and k is the apparent rate constant k k a i given the common approximation of equivalent spherical geometry for the suspended particles choi et al 2019b the total particles surface area in bin i is determined from a i π j 1 n i d p j 2 v i where ni is the number of particles in the bin note that the total number of particles in the fbc is given as n t n i n b i n and each bin is assigned the same volume and number of particles as proposed in previous studies frances et al 1994 shiau and liu 1998 the increase of particle mass in a given bin due to gypsum incorporation onto the particles is related to the change in dissolved calcium concentration in the bin i e d m g i m w g v i d c i thus eq 2 can be expressed as 3 d m g i d t m w g v i k a i c i t c s 2 where mwg is the molecular weight of gypsum 172 17 g mol the total particles mass in bin i is given as m g i 1 6 ρ g π j 1 n i d p j 3 where ρ g is gypsum density 2 32 g cm3 deer et al 1998 and d p j is the diameter of particle j accordingly particle diameter change is given by 4 d d t d p j i 2 k m w g ρ g c i t c s 2 desupersaturation with respect to gypsum and gypsum particles growth can be evaluated via simulations solving eqs 1 4 subject to the calcium concentration boundary and initial conditions of c x 0 c 0 and c t 0 0 respectively desupersaturation performance is quantified by the extent of reaction for attaining desupersaturation defined as 5 α g c c a 0 c c a t c c a 0 c c a s where c ca o c ca t and c ca s are the fbc calcium concentrations at the inlet outlet and at saturation i e sig 1 respectively upon gypsum desupersaturation gypsum particles increase in size and the solids volume fraction ε s in the fluidized bed is determined from 6 ε s t 1 n b i n i 1 n b i n π 6 v i j 1 n i d p j 3 t fluidized bed stability and desupersaturation rate will be affected by temporal changes in the solids volume fraction and gypsum particles size therefore periodic adjustment of the fbc s particle content is required section 4 3 2 accordingly fbc operation stability was explored based on fbc model simulations of gypsum desupersaturation considering the required fluidization superficial velocity richardson and zaki 1954 section s1 si as gypsum particles grow in the fbc it is critical to control the solids volume fraction and surface area provided by gypsum particles to maintain stable fbc desupersaturation performance accordingly fbc solids handling strategies were evaluated via simulations for 1 operation with periodic solids purging makeup section 4 3 2 1 and 2 a sequence of periodic solids purge only operation that can be followed with seeds replenishment section 4 3 2 2 the latter case was also evaluated experimentally section 4 4 in fbc model simulations particles grow until the fluidized bed solids volume fraction ε s t reaches a preset tolerance level whereby ε s t ε s t 1 s v f a 2 in which ε s t is the fbc target solids volume fraction and svfa is the specified solids volume fraction allowance suspended solids are handled by the two approaches described above such that ε s t ε s 1 s v f a 2 is allowed to decrease until the condition ε s t ε s t 1 s v f a 2 is fulfilled the growth of each particle is tracked and thus purging and replenishment of particles can be specified within the target size ranges section s1 si 3 materials and methods 3 1 solutions and field water source synthetic model solutions and field source water were utilized for ccesp laboratory and field testing

lime slurry for inducing caco3 precipitation was prepared using reagent grade lime powder ca oh 2 sigma aldrich st louis mo 3 3 partial lime treatment and fluidized bed crystallizer system and operation laboratory and field cceps tests were conducted in a system fig 3 comprised of 1 partial lime treatment plt in a solid contact clarifier unit to induce caco3 precipitation for residual as

subsequent rmt units stirring was accomplished with magnetic stirring bars at 250 rpm and 750 rpm respectively the plt processed pro concentrate was then fed to a flocculation tank in which the residence time was 20 30 min well within the typical flocculation residence times in water wastewater treatment plants kalscheur et al 2006 the flocculation tank effluent was filtered using a 5 µm cellulose pleated filter and the filtrate was pumped to the fbc unit the fbc comprised of a transparent acrylic cylindrical column 40 cm height x 5 08 cm diameter the plt treated concentrate entered

desupersaturation kinetics were also checked in batch mode fbc operation of total recycle using 56 µm size gypsum seeds at mass loading of 25 g l 0 01 solids volume fraction laboratory tests up to 75 min duration of continuous fbc operation were carried out by pumping the gypsum supersaturated solution to the fbc the required fluidization superficial velocity for a bed with solids volume fraction in the range of 0 1 0 3 was determined for the given seeds size and mass loading based on experimental tests in the fbc and the accepted relationship between the fluidization superficial velocity and solids volume fraction richardson and zaki 1954 section s1 si the fluidization superficial velocity for maintaining 90 fluidized bed expansion in both laboratory and field tests section 3 4 was in the range of 0 06 0 72 cm s for particles size range of 56 225 µm and seeds bed loading up to 0 3 solids volume fraction fbc solids purging from the reactor bottom protocol was established as described in sections 2 2 and s1 si 3 4 2 ccesp field tests field testing of continuous concentrate treatment via plt followed by gsp i e ccesp was conducted with pro concentrate table 1 generated by the ucla mims desalination plant section 3 1 located at the panoche water district in california central valley thompson et al 2013 briefly this mobile ro plant is in a two stage ro configuration housing 21 4 x40 ro elements tm710d toray poway ca with a permeate production capacity of up to 151 m3 day 40 000 gallons day the pro feed was dosed with 3 mg l antiscalant section 3 1 and desalted at 66 recovery for the ccesp tests a slip stream of the ro concentrate was delivered to the ccesp plt mixing tank for antiscalant removal the lime treated pro concentrate was then pumped to the flocculation tank and the effluent was filtered section 3 3 and delivered to the bottom of the fbc column the fbc and flocculation tank calcium effluent concentration was monitored via a calcium ise and desupersaturation performance was quantified by the extent of reaction as per eq 5 section 2 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 adequacy of lime treatment for averting antiscalant retardation of gypsum precipitation ccesp effectiveness is predicated on attaining a sufficiently high rate of pro concentrate gypsum desupersaturation in a stable fluidized bed crystallizer fbc at reasonably short hydraulic residence time thus for any target pro concentrate it is critical to first determine a plt effectiveness in averting the retardation gypsum precipitation in the fbc and b optimal gypsum seeds size and solids volume fraction in the fbc accordingly a series of tests were initially conducted in stirred vessels for both the plt and gps steps as shown in fig s3 1 si and consistent with previous work mccool et al 2012 plt processing of pro concentrate of sig 2 5 and 39 000 mg l tds generated from ro desalting of 14 347 mg l tds and sig 0 91 feedwater at 66 recovery with a 7 21 mm lime dose was effective for subsequent gypsum desupersaturation via gsp at the above lime dose the extent of gypsum desupersaturation αg eq 5 via gsp approached 0 85 in 10 minutes and 0 89 in 15 minutes relative to αg of only 0 52 and 0 68 for the same corresponding times without plt gypsum gsp desupersaturation of the above water source followed second order kinetics christoffersen et al 1982 nancollas 1979 with respect to calcium ion concentration limiting ion with essentially complete residual antiscalant removal table s3 1 si 4 2 kinetics of gypsum desupersaturation via gypsum seeded precipitation it is reasonable to expect that during the initial period of gypsum precipitation i e initial 2 min in a stirred tank reactor section 3 4 1 the active surface area of growing gypsum seeds change was small indeed the excellent linear fit r2 0 98 of calcium removal rate with the initial seeds surface area fig 4 over a particle size range of 56 225 µm confirmed that gypsum removal via gsp was second order with respect to calcium concentration the surface reaction rate constant was 13 7 1 3 l2 m2 mol min essentially the same gypsum desupersaturation kinetics were confirmed at the same solids volume fraction in a batch fbc test in the mode of total recycle fig 5 it is stressed that the above determined gypsum removal kinetics were absent of secondary nucleation as was verified via a series of mixing tests confirming the lack of particle breakage or abrasion section s4 si given the experimentally determined gypsum desupersaturation kinetics the fbc convective residence time to achieve the sought level of gypsum desupersaturation for a target supersaturated stream depends on the initial seeds surface area per fbc volume as illustrated in fig 6 for example reducing the pro concentrate sig from 2 47 table 1 to 1 1 over a reasonable residence time of 4 5 minutes would require fbc operation with seeds loading that provides 8 0 m2 l particles surface area 4 3 gypsum desupersaturation in a continuous fbc operation 4 3 1 laboratory and model simulations of short term operation of fbc desupersaturation the fbc process model section 2 2 was initially evaluated based on short duration 12 min laboratory experiments table 2 figs s5 1 s5 2 s5 3 si without solids handling i e purging or replenishment model predictions of the extent of reaction over seeds solids volume fraction range of 0 12 0

to gypsum precipitation onto the seed particles as the major mechanism of gypsum desupersaturation section 4 2 4 3 2 fbc operational considerations 4 3 2 1 solid handling purging makeup mode fbc model simulations with periodic purging seed makeup events section 2 2 were carried out for the conditions listed in table 3 simulations were for average seed particle sizes of 70 100 and 127µm psd standard deviation of 11 solids volume fraction of 0 1 0 3 table 3 inlet solution of sig 2 47 and 95 level of bed fluidization section 3 3 for a given gypsum seeds size as the initial solids loading increases both the solids volume fraction ε s and particles surface area s a in the fbc increased therefore a lower fluidization superficial velocity is required eq s1 1 si hence leading to a longer fbc convective residence time τ c table 3 a higher initial seeds loading for a given seeds diameter would increase the rate of desupersaturation in the fbc thus providing a higher level of pro concentrate desupersaturation table 3 as illustrated in simulation 3 table 3 steady state operation with respect to satisfactory desupersaturation can be achieved at the cost of frequent solids handling for the above simulation the entire mass of fbc solids would have to be replaced over a period equivalent to about six times the fbc residence time i e 20 min to maintain stable desupersaturation operation such a requirement of periodic addition of fresh gypsum seeds is not an operationally or economically attractive option thus the alternative fbc operation of multiple purge only cycles with intermittent seeds replenishment was also evaluated as described in section 4 3 2 2 4 3 2 2 fbc operation of cyclic mode of solids purge only with intermittent seeds replenishment the feasibility of an extended fbc operation with periodic solids purging and intermittent seeds replenishment i e after multiple purging cycles was explored via model simulations input and output parameters are provided in table 4 the growth of seed particles fig 7 a was accompanied by a noticeable periodic surface area decline fig 7b associated with solids purging however the fbc solids volume fraction εs was maintained within the solids volume fraction allowance svfa of 0 05 5 which specifies the allowable solids volume fraction change in the fbc that triggers purging fig 7c with the provision of a higher fbc initial seeds surface area a longer time interval between solids purging can be set table 4 for example simulations 1 and 3 for fbc feed of sig 2 47 at seeds surface areas of 8 and 16 m2 l fig 7b demonstrated that a high degree of desupersaturation fig 7d can be maintained at extent of reaction above 91 and 97 respectively i e effluent desupersaturation to sig levels of 1 14 and 1 05 with corresponding purging intervals of about 30 and 85 min as revealed by simulations 1 3 table 4 their corresponding extent of reaction gradually decreased by 0 11 7 94 and 1 33 over the five hours test period these results indicate that satisfactory fbc desupersaturation performance can be achieved with suitable initial gypsum seeds size and fbc solids volume fraction to provide the needed particles surface area fig 7b specification of the above parameters however is governed by the water source chemistry the degree of required desupersaturation and treatment volume capacity fbc operation of sequential solids purge only events with intermittent seeds replenishment requires a lower amount of seeds replenishment relative to a cyclic purge replenishment mode of operation for example simulation 3 table 4 reveals that in order to maintain reasonable stable desupersaturation solids purging constitutes about 49 of the initial seeds mass loading over a five hour operation while at the end of this period 12 of the initial seeds mass loading would have to be replenished for the above operational mode about 2 4 kg of gypsum would be removed from the pro concentrate for every kg of replenished seeds in contrast for the same seeds size and loading simulation 3 table 3 operation in a cyclic purge makeup mode i e each event of solids handling constitutes seeds purging and replenishment would require replenishment of 100 of the initial seeds mass loading within a period of 65 minutes in this mode of operation gypsum removal would be at a mere level of 0 14 kg per 1 kg of replenished seeds loading therefore operation with periodic solids purge only mode with intermittent seeds replenishment is preferable this operation would require lower frequency and amount of seeds replenishment and higher net gypsum production from the pro concentrate 4 4 continuous testing 4 4 1 laboratory assessment of solids handling in fbc operation the feasibility of continuous fbc operation with sustainable periodic solids purging section 4 3 2 2 was evaluated in a short term laboratory test for fbc feed of sig 2 47 for seeds size of 70 µm and solids volume fraction of 0 1 0 2 providing fbc particles surface area of 8 16 m2 l for the above scenario simulation results table 5 indicated that gypsum desupersaturation of 97 can be achieved i e fbc effluent of sig 1 1 at fbc residence time of 8 min fig 8 a the above results indicated that ccesp with satisfactory desupersaturation performance was feasible for fbc operation employing periodic solids purging i e solids purge every 13 minutes with intermittent seeds replenishment after 28 purging events fig 7b and table 4 in section 4 3 2 2 also the experimental data revealed a minor variability of 0 06 solids volume fraction relative to the simulation data fig 8b such deviation although small can be reduced by accurate triggering the solids purge based fbc fluidized bed height or differential pressure measurements harms and robinson 1992 4 4 2 ccesp field tests ccesp testing at the pdd field site section 3 4 2 was carried out with partial lime treatment plt of pro concentrate from the ucla ro plant section 3 4 2 as per the conditions listed in table 6 test conditions were based on a sequential plt gsp operation section 4 1 and section s3 si with periodic solids purging the plt rapid mixing at ph of 8 89 0 02 effluent was filtered and then fed to the fbc fig 3 section 3 3 it is noted that given the higher concentrate flow rate employed under field conditions slightly larger gypsum seed size was utilized 129 µm compared to the laboratory test i e 79 µm section 4 4 1 ccesp field test results fig 9 were in excellent agreement with model predictions for the extent of reaction calcium removal the extent of reaction declined by 2 7 from the initial value 0 95 achieving pro desupersaturation to sig 1 15 over the test duration the gradual extent of reaction decrease consistent with model predictions section 4 3 2 2 figs 7b and 7d was due to periodic solids purging which resulted in progressive particles surface area decrease for gypsum crystallization model simulation based on the above fbc test results indicated that for the pro concentrate sig 2 49 fbc operation can be carried out with 10 sequential solids purging events 5 hours of operation 2 6 kg net harvested salt per m3

drying hydroprocessing i e washing and removing of fines as may be needed rahardianto et al 2010 higher level of salt harvesting may be feasible with the addition of secondary ro desalting and concentrate recycling section 4 5 4 5 feasibility of secondary ro desalting of ccesp treated primary ro concentrate maximum overall water recovery enhancement via the integration of ccesp with pro and sro i e pro ccesp sro fig 1 was assessed via process calculations for desalination of ad water at the pdd field site section 4 4 2 in this analysis the maximum gypsum supersaturation of the ro concentrate at which antiscalant application is practical was set at sig of 3 and 4 hydranautics 2013 which would enable pro recovery of 70 and 78 respectively figs 10 a and 10b ccesp treatment of pro concentrate of sig 3 and 4 can be achieved to a level of sig 1 15 as verified experimentally section 4 4 2 followed by sro recovery to enable a corresponding overall recovery enhancement to 88 and 93 figs 10a and 10b the overall water recovery can be further enhanced by partial recycling of the sro concentrate to the plt stage by setting a specific sro concentrate recycle to purge ratio i e γ qrecycle qpurge in which qrecycle and qpurge are the volumetric flow rates of the sro concentrate recycle and purge streams respectively fig 1 the overall water recovery is determined from 7 y o v e r a l l y p r o max 1 y p r o max γ y s r o max 1 γ y s r o max where y pro max and y sro max are the maximum allowable water recovery levels for the pro and sro ro units respectively these limiting recoveries are set by the limiting ion concentration in the pro and sro concentrate streams corresponding to the highest gypsum supersaturation at which antiscalant application is practical for example operation as per the above approach would enable overall recovery of 91 95 fig 10a with sro concentrate recycle purge ratio of γ 0 4 3 with pro operation at 70 recovery and in excess of 96 fig 10b for sro operation at γ 3 with pro operation at 78 recovery respectively whereby the sro concentrate is generated at a corresponding level of 61 63 and 64 recovery with concentrate recycle it may be feasible to harvest up to 3 6 kg gypsum per m3 of ro concentrate however at a recovery of 70 78 the fbc effluent will be oversaturated with respect to calcite sic 25 5 43 3 therefore optimal antiscalant choice and dose in addition to periodic permeate flush will be needed to avert calcite scaling cohen et al 2014 integrated pro ccesp sro process can be accomplished whereby pro and or sro are operated as either a two stage ro system with intermediate pumping or a single stage with partial concentrate recycle alternatively either sro or pro or both can be carried out using a flexible ro flero system configuration choi et al 2019a lee et al 2019b in the mode of partial concentrate recycle in a continuous or semi batch mode such approaches should allow higher pro as well as sro recovery in a smaller footprint relative to conventional ro plant configuration moreover with periodic permeate flush scale mitigation can be more effective and at a reduced level of antiscalant dosing 5 conclusions continuous desupersaturation of ro concentrate supersaturated with respect to gypsum was shown to be feasible via partial lime treatment followed by seeded gypsum precipitation for calcium removal in a fluidized bed crystallizer solid handling protocol for stable fbc operation i e solids purging and replenishment to maintain the fbc target solids volume fraction and surface

gsp was carried out in a fluidized bed crystallizer fbc demonstrating the feasibility of continuous pro concentrate desupersaturation with suitable solids management fbc operation was stable with respect to desupersaturation performance when operating over a sequence of periodic solids purge only mode with intermittent seeds replenishment the study suggests that ccesp integration with primary

requirements choi et al 2019a rahardianto et al 2010 ravichandran et al 2019 however membrane mineral salt scaling remains a critical impediment to achieving high recovery brackish water desalination aghdam et al 2016 ayoub et al 2018 lee et al 2019a particularly when the water source is of high membrane scaling potential i e high concentration of sparingly water soluble mineral salts such as gypsum caso4 2h2o calcium carbonate caco3 barite baso4 and silica sio2 mitigation of mineral scaling via feed ph adjustment is feasible for scalants of ph dependent solubility e g calcium carbonate magnesium hydroxide and silica but relies on use of antiscalants as dosing of the ro feed for suppression or retardation of crystallization of scalants such as gypsum and barite as well as calcite and silica scaling cohen et al 2014 however antiscalant dosing for mitigating scaling due to calcite strontium sulfate calcium sulfate barium sulfate and silica i e caco3 srso4 caso4 and baso4 and sio2 is suitable only when these scalants are not present above saturation by factors of 60 8 2 3 4 60 80 and 1 3 respectively hydranautics 2013 thompson et al 2013 therefore overall ro recovery is limited even with antiscalant dosing of the ro feed in order to overcome ro recovery limitation imposed by mineral scaling a number of two stage ro processes with intermediate concentrate demineralization icd have been proposed aghdam et al 2016 ayoub et al 2018 rahardianto et al 2010 sanciolo and gray 2017 the icd process reduces the concentration of scale precursors e g calcium carbonate and sulfate ions

such as hydrocyclone plate settler as has been widely practiced in typical lime softening kalscheur et al 2006 as well as ro concentrate desupersaturation ravichandran et al 2019 the subsequent step

focused on the impact of various operational factors e g initial conditions such as seed mass loading initial ion concentration and ratio seed reusability and fines production due to primary nucleation on fbc performance de luna et al 2017 maharaj et al 2018 these previous studies clearly demonstrated the potential of fbc effectiveness for seeded precipitation for gypsum desupersaturation however a systematic approach to establishing continuous plt fbc operation has not been previously demonstrated for ro concentrate desupersaturation accordingly the present work explores the critical elements of fbc operation via a process model simulation along with both laboratory and field testing to evaluate ccesp feasibility in support of attaining high recovery ro desalination 2 evaluation of continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation ccesp 2 1 overview the development and demonstration of a continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation ccesp process for pro concentrate desupersaturation to enable enhanced recovery via subsequent sro desalting followed five major steps step i focused on experimental validation of residual antiscalant removal from pro concentrate as quantified by gypsum seeded precipitation gsp effectiveness for concentrate desupersaturation in step ii gsp kinetics was quantified in laboratory gypsum desupersaturation experiments subsequently step iii consisted of laboratory experiments along with fbc model simulations to establish operating conditions and solids handling regiment for stable fbc operation in step iv ccesp evaluation was carried out in both laboratory and field testing at conditions streamlined by fbc model simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of ccesp finally the feasible maximum water recovery enhancement via pro ccesp sro was assessed for a target source water to demonstrate the potential for process scalability step v 2 2 fluidized bed crystallizer fbc for gypsum removal the process of continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation ccesp for gypsum desupersaturation of ro concentrate requires stable fbc operation fig 2 accordingly a numerical model was developed to describe the calcium concentration profile and particle size distribution along the fbc bed and to evaluate the impact of purging and replenishment of gypsum particles on fbc operation calcium concentration c profile in the fbc can be described by the following equation 1 d c d t u w d c d x r g s p where c is the dissolved calcium concentration taken to be radially uniform along axial position x at time t uw is the average interstitial velocity i e superficial velocity bed porosity in the fbc bed and rgsp is the rate of calcium removal eq 1 was solved via a finite difference approach section s1 supporting information si whereby the fbc reactor bed volume vr was divided vertically into nbins equal sized bins of volume v i v r n b i n s fig 2 the rate of gypsum seeded precipitation rgsp in the ith bin can be expressed via the following second order kinetics christoffersen et al 1982 nancollas 1979 2 r g s p i t d c i d t k a i c i t c s 2 where c i and c s are the calcium concentration in the ith bin and at saturation i e sig 1 respectively a i is the total area of particles in bini per bin unit volume and k is the gypsum surface reaction rate constant previous studies have reported that gypsum seeded desupersaturation of supersaturated calcium sulfate solution is primarily surface reaction controlled hence the rate of desupersaturation is driven by the particles surface area per suspension volume the surface reaction rate constant can be determined from experiments in a stirred reactor whereby desupersaturation of a supersaturated solution with respect to gypsum with a predetermined gypsum seeds loading is monitored over time in this approach the following solution to eq 2 is fitted to the calcium time concentration data c 0 c c 0 c s c c s k t where c 0 and cs are the initial calcium ion concentration and at saturation respectively and k is the apparent rate constant k k a i given the common approximation of equivalent spherical geometry for the suspended particles choi et al 2019b the total particles surface area in bin i is determined from a i π j 1 n i d p j 2 v i where ni is the number of particles in the bin note that the total number of particles in the fbc is given as n t n i n b i n and each bin is assigned the same volume and number of particles as proposed in previous studies frances et al 1994 shiau and liu 1998 the increase of particle mass in a given bin due to gypsum incorporation onto the particles is related to the change in dissolved calcium concentration in the bin i e d m g i m w g v i d c i thus eq 2 can be expressed as 3 d

2 32 g cm3 deer et al 1998 and d p j is the diameter of particle j accordingly particle diameter change is given by 4 d d t d p j i 2 k m w g ρ g c i t c s 2 desupersaturation with respect to gypsum and gypsum particles growth can be evaluated via simulations solving eqs 1 4 subject to the calcium concentration boundary and initial conditions of c x 0 c 0 and c t 0 0 respectively

desupersaturation considering the required fluidization superficial velocity richardson and zaki 1954 section s1 si as gypsum particles grow in the fbc it is critical to control the solids volume

evaluated experimentally section 4 4 in fbc model simulations particles grow until the fluidized bed solids volume fraction ε s t reaches a preset tolerance level whereby ε s t ε s t 1 s v f a 2 in which ε s t is the fbc target solids volume fraction and svfa is the specified solids volume fraction allowance suspended solids are handled by the two approaches described above such that ε s t ε s 1 s v f a 2 is allowed to decrease until the condition ε s t ε s t 1 s v f a 2 is fulfilled the growth of each particle is tracked and thus purging and replenishment of particles can be specified within the target size ranges section s1 si 3 materials and methods 3 1 solutions and field water source synthetic model solutions and field source water were utilized for ccesp laboratory and field testing

effectiveness is predicated on attaining a sufficiently high rate of pro concentrate gypsum desupersaturation in a stable fluidized bed crystallizer fbc at reasonably short hydraulic residence time thus for any target pro concentrate it is critical to first determine a plt effectiveness in averting the retardation gypsum precipitation in the fbc and b optimal gypsum seeds size and solids volume

plt processing of pro concentrate of sig 2 5 and 39 000 mg l tds generated from ro desalting of 14 347 mg l tds and sig 0 91 feedwater at 66 recovery with a 7 21 mm lime dose was effective for subsequent gypsum desupersaturation via gsp at the above lime dose the extent of gypsum desupersaturation αg eq 5 via gsp approached 0 85 in 10 minutes and 0 89 in 15 minutes relative to αg of only 0 52 and 0 68 for the same corresponding times without plt gypsum gsp desupersaturation of the above water source followed second order kinetics christoffersen et al 1982 nancollas 1979 with respect to calcium ion concentration limiting ion with essentially complete residual antiscalant removal table s3 1 si 4 2 kinetics of gypsum desupersaturation via gypsum seeded precipitation it is reasonable to expect that during the initial period of gypsum precipitation i e initial 2 min in a stirred tank reactor section 3 4 1 the active surface area of growing gypsum seeds change was small indeed the excellent linear fit r2 0 98 of calcium removal rate with the initial seeds surface area fig 4 over a particle size range of 56 225 µm confirmed that gypsum removal via gsp was second order with respect to calcium concentration the surface reaction rate constant was 13 7 1 3 l2 m2 mol min essentially the same gypsum desupersaturation kinetics were confirmed at the same solids volume fraction in a batch fbc test in the mode of total recycle fig 5 it is stressed that the above determined gypsum removal kinetics were absent of secondary nucleation as was verified via a series of mixing tests confirming the lack of particle breakage or abrasion section s4 si given the experimentally determined gypsum desupersaturation kinetics the fbc convective residence time to achieve the sought level of gypsum desupersaturation for a target supersaturated stream depends on the initial seeds surface area per fbc volume as illustrated in fig 6 for example reducing the pro concentrate sig from 2 47 table 1 to 1 1 over a reasonable residence time of 4 5 minutes would require fbc operation with seeds loading that provides 8 0 m2 l particles surface area 4 3 gypsum desupersaturation in a continuous fbc operation 4 3 1 laboratory and model simulations of short term operation of fbc desupersaturation the fbc process model section 2 2 was initially evaluated based on short duration 12 min laboratory experiments table 2 figs s5 1 s5 2 s5 3 si without solids handling i e purging or replenishment model predictions of the extent of reaction over seeds solids volume fraction range of 0 12 0 2 were in excellent agreement with experimental data average error 1 1 7 2 table 2 figs s5 1 s5 2 s5 3 si the extent of reaction increased with the initial seeds surface area tests 1 2 3 table 2 owing to gypsum precipitation onto the seed particles as the major mechanism of gypsum desupersaturation section 4 2 4 3 2 fbc operational considerations 4 3 2 1 solid handling purging makeup mode fbc model simulations with periodic purging seed makeup events section 2 2 were carried out for the conditions listed in table 3 simulations were for average seed particle sizes of 70 100 and 127µm psd standard deviation of 11 solids volume fraction of 0 1 0 3 table 3 inlet solution of sig 2 47 and 95 level of bed fluidization section 3 3 for a given gypsum seeds size as the initial solids loading increases both the solids volume fraction ε s and particles surface area s a in the fbc increased therefore a lower fluidization superficial velocity is required eq s1 1 si hence leading to a longer fbc convective residence time τ c table 3 a higher initial seeds loading for a given seeds diameter would increase the rate of desupersaturation in the fbc thus providing a higher level of pro concentrate desupersaturation table 3 as illustrated in simulation 3 table 3 steady state operation with respect to satisfactory desupersaturation can be achieved at the cost of frequent solids handling for the above simulation the entire mass of fbc solids would have to be replaced over a period equivalent to about six times the fbc residence time i e 20 min to maintain stable desupersaturation operation such a requirement of periodic addition of fresh gypsum seeds is not an operationally or economically attractive option thus the alternative fbc operation of multiple purge only cycles with intermittent seeds replenishment was also evaluated as described in section 4 3 2 2 4 3 2 2 fbc operation of cyclic mode of solids purge only with intermittent seeds replenishment the feasibility of an extended fbc operation with periodic solids purging and intermittent seeds replenishment i e after multiple purging cycles was explored via model simulations input and output parameters are provided in table 4 the growth of seed particles fig 7 a was accompanied by a noticeable periodic surface area decline fig 7b associated with solids purging however the fbc solids volume fraction εs was maintained within the solids volume fraction allowance svfa of 0 05 5 which specifies the allowable solids volume fraction change in the fbc that triggers purging fig 7c with the provision of a higher fbc initial seeds surface area a longer time interval between solids purging can be set table 4 for example simulations 1 and 3 for fbc feed of sig 2 47 at seeds surface areas of 8 and 16 m2 l fig 7b demonstrated that a high degree of desupersaturation fig 7d can be maintained at extent of reaction above 91 and 97 respectively i e effluent desupersaturation to sig levels of 1 14 and 1 05 with corresponding purging intervals of about 30 and 85 min as revealed by simulations 1 3 table 4 their corresponding extent of reaction gradually decreased by 0 11 7 94 and 1 33 over the five hours test period these results indicate that satisfactory fbc desupersaturation performance can be achieved with suitable initial gypsum seeds size and fbc solids volume fraction to provide the needed particles surface area fig 7b specification of the above parameters however is governed by the water source chemistry the degree of required desupersaturation and treatment volume capacity fbc operation of sequential solids purge only events with intermittent seeds replenishment requires a lower amount of seeds replenishment relative to a cyclic purge replenishment mode of operation for example simulation 3 table 4 reveals that in order to maintain reasonable stable desupersaturation solids purging constitutes about 49 of the initial seeds mass loading over a five hour operation while at the end of this period 12 of the initial seeds mass loading would have to be replenished for the above operational mode about 2 4 kg of gypsum would be removed from the pro concentrate for every kg of replenished seeds in contrast for the same seeds size and loading simulation 3 table 3 operation in a cyclic purge makeup mode i e each event of solids handling constitutes seeds purging and replenishment would require replenishment of 100 of the initial seeds mass loading within a period of 65 minutes in this mode of operation gypsum removal would be at a mere level of 0 14 kg per 1 kg of replenished seeds loading therefore operation with periodic solids purge only mode with intermittent seeds replenishment is preferable this operation would require lower frequency and amount of seeds replenishment and higher net gypsum production from the pro concentrate 4 4 continuous testing 4 4 1 laboratory assessment of solids handling in fbc operation the feasibility of continuous fbc operation with sustainable periodic solids purging section 4 3 2 2 was evaluated in a short term laboratory test for fbc feed of sig 2 47 for seeds size of 70 µm and solids volume fraction of 0 1 0 2 providing fbc particles surface area of 8 16 m2 l for the above scenario simulation results table 5 indicated that gypsum desupersaturation of 97 can be achieved i e fbc effluent of sig 1 1 at fbc residence time of 8 min fig 8 a the above results indicated that ccesp with satisfactory desupersaturation performance was feasible for fbc operation employing periodic solids purging i e solids purge every 13 minutes with intermittent seeds replenishment after 28 purging events fig 7b and table 4 in section 4 3 2 2 also the experimental data revealed a minor variability of 0 06 solids volume fraction relative to the simulation data fig 8b such deviation although small can be reduced by accurate triggering the solids purge based fbc fluidized bed height or differential pressure measurements harms and robinson 1992 4 4 2 ccesp field tests ccesp testing at the pdd field site section 3 4 2 was carried out with partial lime treatment plt of pro concentrate from the ucla ro plant section 3 4 2 as per the conditions listed in table 6 test conditions were based on a sequential plt gsp operation section 4 1 and section s3 si with periodic solids purging the plt rapid mixing at ph of 8 89 0 02 effluent was filtered and then fed to the fbc fig 3 section 3 3 it is noted that given the higher concentrate flow rate employed under field conditions slightly larger gypsum seed size was utilized 129 µm compared to the laboratory test i e 79 µm section 4 4 1 ccesp field test results fig 9 were in excellent agreement with model predictions for the extent of reaction calcium removal the extent of reaction declined by 2 7 from the initial value 0 95 achieving pro desupersaturation to sig 1 15 over the test duration the gradual extent of reaction decrease consistent with model predictions section 4 3 2 2 figs 7b and 7d was due to periodic solids purging which resulted in progressive particles surface area decrease for gypsum crystallization model simulation based on the above fbc test results indicated that for the pro concentrate sig 2 49 fbc operation can be carried out with 10 sequential solids purging events 5 hours of operation 2 6 kg net harvested salt per m3 of ro concentrate prior to the need for seeds replenishment in order to reduce the need for replenishment with new gypsum seeds purged solids could be recycled to the fbc post grinding wet or post drying hydroprocessing i e washing and removing of fines as may be needed rahardianto et al 2010 higher level of salt harvesting may be feasible with the addition of secondary ro desalting and concentrate recycling section 4 5 4 5 feasibility of secondary ro desalting of ccesp treated primary ro concentrate maximum overall water recovery enhancement via the integration of ccesp with pro and sro i e pro ccesp sro fig 1 was assessed via process calculations for desalination of ad water at the pdd field site section 4 4 2 in this analysis the maximum gypsum supersaturation of the ro concentrate at which antiscalant application is practical was set at sig of 3 and 4 hydranautics 2013 which would enable pro recovery of 70 and 78 respectively figs 10 a and 10b ccesp treatment of pro concentrate of sig 3 and 4 can be achieved to a level of sig 1 15 as verified experimentally section 4 4 2 followed by sro recovery to enable a corresponding overall recovery enhancement to 88 and 93 figs 10a and 10b the overall water recovery can be further enhanced by partial recycling of the sro concentrate to the plt stage by setting a specific sro concentrate recycle to purge ratio i e γ qrecycle qpurge in which qrecycle and qpurge are the volumetric flow rates of the sro concentrate recycle and purge streams respectively fig 1 the overall water recovery is determined from 7 y o v e r a l l y p r o max 1 y p r o max γ y s r o max 1 γ y s r o max where y pro max and y sro max are the maximum allowable water recovery levels for the pro and sro ro units respectively these limiting recoveries are set by the limiting ion concentration in the pro and sro concentrate streams corresponding to the highest gypsum supersaturation at which antiscalant application is practical for example operation as per the above approach would enable overall recovery of 91 95 fig 10a with sro concentrate recycle purge ratio of γ 0 4 3 with pro operation at 70 recovery and in excess of 96 fig 10b for sro operation at γ 3 with pro operation at 78 recovery respectively whereby the sro concentrate is generated at a corresponding level of 61 63 and 64 recovery with concentrate recycle it may be feasible to harvest up to 3 6 kg gypsum per m3 of ro concentrate however at a recovery of 70 78 the fbc effluent will be oversaturated with respect to calcite sic 25 5 43 3 therefore optimal antiscalant choice and dose in addition to periodic permeate flush will be needed to avert calcite scaling cohen et al 2014 integrated pro ccesp sro process can be accomplished whereby pro and or sro are operated as either a two stage ro system with intermediate pumping or a single stage with partial concentrate recycle alternatively either sro or pro or both can be carried out using a flexible ro flero system configuration choi et al 2019a lee et al 2019b in the mode of partial concentrate recycle in a continuous or semi batch mode such approaches should allow higher pro as well as sro recovery in a smaller footprint relative to conventional ro plant configuration moreover with periodic permeate flush scale mitigation can be more effective and at a reduced level of antiscalant dosing 5 conclusions continuous desupersaturation of ro concentrate supersaturated with respect to gypsum was shown to be feasible via partial lime treatment followed by seeded gypsum precipitation for calcium removal in a fluidized bed crystallizer solid handling protocol for stable fbc operation i e solids purging and replenishment to maintain the fbc target solids volume fraction and surface area was established through model simulation and laboratory as well as field tests ccesp of stable fbc operation was demonstrated to be attainable via periodic solids purging while providing for satisfactory agricultural drainage water ro concentrate desupersaturation from sig 2 5 to sig 1 1 integration of ccesp with primary and secondary ro desalting can be an effective approach to enhancing ro desalting recovery of inland water sources of high gypsum scaling propensity thus reducing the residual volume of desalting concentrate along with salt harvesting for beneficial use declaration of

water treatment angelidaki and batstone 2010 rajendran et al 2020 due to its advantages in pollutant control and bio energy production with increasing request for renewable energy the application of ad is gaining increased attention ad is occurring in either natural environments for ch4 emission or in anaerobic digesters for waste water treatment caposciutti et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 reumer et al 2018 ad is a complicated structured process and its bioreactions are mediated by several specific groups of microorganisms a fine balance between the various steps in ad is necessary for stable operation and optimization of the process therefore understanding the detailed mechanismsin this biochemical technology is necessary and important the ad process can be divided into the following steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis mcinerney and bryant 1981 acetate is a pivotal intermediate in anaerobic decomposition of organic matters and it contributes to a major part of the produced methane angelidaki and batstone 2010 aoyagi et al 2020 however the generation and consumption of acetate is depending on a various parameters and most steps of ad are involved including acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis syntrophic acetate oxidation sao and methanogenesis fig 1 table 1 angelidaki and batstone 2010 the versatile role of acetate as intermediate product and methanogenic precursor strengthened its importance in ad and necessity for detailed investigation previous research studies have investigated the role of acetate in acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis madigan 2012 schink 1997 when the anaerobic reactor operates stably under low h2 partial pressure ph2 acetate was the main product in polysaccharide peptides amino acids glycerol or galactose etc fermentation viaacetyl coenzymea coa pathway and most substrates are converted directly to acetate and hydrogen h2 instead of reduced products such as propionate butyrate and ethanol mcinerney and bryant 1981 however a large amount of less oxidized product is produced under extreme low ph when the anaerobic reactor is overloaded madigan 2012 these reduced products need to be oxidized by obligate h2 producing acetogens several strategies have been used to improve acetate production in acidogenesis step of ad including ph adjustment organic loading rate olr regulation and ph2 control nie et al 2007 ni et al 2011 yan et al 2014 and also acetate is an important endproduct in acetogenesis process mediated by syntrophic fatty acids oxidizing bacteria electron derived from thisoxidation reaction is pooled to h to generate h2 the free energy of fatty acid oxidation reaction is positive at standard conditions therefore low h2 concentration is needed to achieve a negative free energy formate and h2 are two main interspecies electron carriers in anaerobic methane environment and their concentration or partial pressure determined the proceeding of acetogenesis schink 1997 dong and stams 1995 h2 consuming methanogen converts h2 co2 to ch4 to keep low h2 concentration in addition to h2 and formate acetate removal has a profound influence on syntrophic metabolism of fatty acids or aromatic acid inhibition from acetate accumulation was also found in ad systems with syntrophic decomposition of fatty aromatic acids rajendran et al 2020 ahring and westermann 1988 warikoo et al 1996 simeonov and queinnec 2006 as an important precursor for methanogenesis acetate contributes to 60 70 methane generation previous research also reported the hydrolysis and acetate decomposition were the main rate limiting steps with cellulose and easily metabolized material as the main substrates respectively angelidaki and batstone 2010 however other processes in ad are able to affect acetate metabolism under specific conditions at low temperatures 10 c 20 c homoacetogenic organisms convert h2 and co2 to acetate outcompeting with hydrogenotrophic methanogens and these microbes could also grow under both acidic and alkaline conditions grimalt aleman et al 2017 drake et al 2010 kotsyurbenko et al 2001 nozhevnikova et al 2003 while syntrophic acetate oxidizingbacteria saob prefer to convert acetate to h2 and co2 at higher temperature lepisto and rintala 1999 dyksma et al 2020 some specific homoacetogenic organisms could also metabolize acetate via syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm dyksma et al 2020 bi et al 2020 westerholm et al 2010 2011 schnürer et al 2006 balk et al 2002 hattori et al 2000 schnürer et al 1996 lee and zinder 1988 barker 1936 it was reported that sao hm became the dominant pathway to overcome acetate accumulation frominitially acetoclastic methanogenesis dominant anaerobic systems under high ammonia stress wang et al 2020 ruiz sanchez et al 2019 zhuang et al 2018 westerholm et al 2016 sun et al 2014 additionally sao hm pathway also played significant role in anaerobic digester suppressed by high concentrations of vfas acetate butyrate and propionate westerholm et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and high temperature pap et al 2015 due to the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens homoacetogenesis and sao hm usually regulate acetate kinetics methane generation and carbon cycle in many ad systems under some specific anaerobic conditions not suitable for the growth for methanogens such as low or high temperature high ammonia concentration and high vfa concentrations lepisto and rintala 1999 ye et al 2014 pap et al 2015 pan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2018 in order to comprehensively understand acetate metabolism in ad process the present review focuses on the generation and consumption network of acetate under specific conditions and summarizes the recent research on sao and homoacetogenesis in addition the physiological and biochemical characteristics of saob and homoacetogens metabolism pathways of sao and homoacetogenesis and their roles in acetate consumption and production in anaerobic system are reviewed these could give a comprehensive evaluation of acetate metabolism during ad process 2 biochemical reaction and functional bacteria involved in sao and homoacetogenesis 2 1 definition of sao and homoacetogenesis sao is a process that methyl groups of acetate are converted to co2 with the generation of h2 barker 1936 since the reaction is energetically unfavorableat standard conditions it can only proceed at low ph2 with h2consumption by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the coupled reaction of sao hm is exergonic and has the same stoichiometry of acetoclastic methanogenesis table 1 sao is catalyzed by functional bacteria saob it shares the limited energy 31 0 kj mol 1 with hydrogenotrophic methanogen to support their growth this energetically disadvantage may explain the slow growth of these syntrophsand depending on adapt rigid mutualism which also well explains the difficulty in isolation of syntrophic acetate oxidizing cocultures and it also lead to the weakness of saob in outcompeting with acetoclasticmethanogen in normal anaerobic system the strict cultivation conditions and thermodynamically unfavorable acetate oxidation resulted in the poor understanding of the physiology of these groups homoacetogenesis refers to the process that co2 is reduced to acetate with h2 by the acetyl coa pathway drake et al 2010 it mainly conductsfrom autotrophic and or heterotrophic substrates including sugars alcohols amino acids organic acids and methylated aromatics co and h2 co2 table 1 this reaction isthermodynamically unfavorable in many anaerobic habitats with low ph2 montiel corona et al 2020 goodwin and zeikus 1987 in mixed cultures h2 is easily utilized by sulfate and iron reducers megonigal 2014 ntagia et al 2020 while in anaerobic methanogenic system methanogens and homoacetogens are the primary h2consumers and methanogens are commonly dominant however it was reported that homoacetogens could outcompete methanogens under low temperature condition liu andconrad 2011 probably because of their faster growth rates than methanogens at the same low temperature condition kotsyurbenko et al 2001 conrad and wetter 1990 homoacetogens can survive under both acidic and alkaline conditions drake et al 2010 2 2 physiological and biochemical characteristics of functional bacteria of sao and homoacetogenesis previous researches have paid much attention to acetoclasticmethanogenesis but neglected the sao and the role of saob therefore to date only six pure cultures of saob have been isolated including strain aor lee 1988 clostridium ultunense schnürer et al 1996 thermacetogenium phaeum hattori et al 2000 pseudothermotoga lettingae balk 2002 syntrophaceticus schinkii westerholm et al 2010 and tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans westerholm et al 2011 the first isolated saob is a thermophilicstrainbelonging to firmicutes hattori 2008 but it had been lost before establishing its phylogenetic information the other five isolates belong to the physiological group of acetogen and their characteristics and phylogenetic positions are presented in table 2 and fig 2 red ones respectively these isolates can cooperate with h2 utilizing methanogens however other isolated saob syntrophically cooperate with non methanogenic partner microbes such as geobacer sulfurreducens strain pca it can oxidize acetate efficiently in syntrophic cooperation withwolinella succinogenes with nitrate as the electron acceptor cordruwisch et al 1998 candidatus contubernalis alkalaceticum is an alkaliphilic specie which can oxidize acetate with hydrogenotrophic sulfate reducer under anaerobic mesophilic condition zhilina et al 2005 homoacetogenicbacteria are strict anaerobes metabolizing c1 compounds e g co2 to acetate or higher fatty acids and are also called acetogenic bacteria wohlfarth 1994 homoacetogens are phylogenetically distributed and 100 species representing24 genera have been reported from different environments so far drake et al 2010 and the phylogenetic tree with the most noteworthy species are presented in fig 2 in the 24genera acetobacterium and clostridium harborthe most known acetogens clostridium aceticumis the first isolated pure culture of homoacetogen however this culture was lost soon and reisolated again adamse 1980 braun et al 1981 moorella thermoacetica formerly named clostridium thermoaceticum ahomoacetogen belonging to family of thermoanaerobacteriaceae was isolated fromhorse manure with ability of converting glucose 1 mol to acetate 3 mol collins et al 1994 drake and daniel 2004 schink 1984 subsequently many homoacetogens were isolated with function of metabolizing h2 or glucose to acetate such as acetobacterium woodii a chemolithotrophic acetogen with h2 plus co2 balch et al 1977 and clostridium ljungdahlii tanner et al 1993 an ethanologenic acetogen and homoacetogen schnürer et al 1996 it was also presented homoacetogenic species moorella thermoacetica moorella thermoautotrophica and some thermoanaerobacter spp have close relationships with saob in phylogenetically fig 2 both saob and homoacetogens are involved inad via consuming or generating acetate compared to saob homoacetogens are able to convert various substrates to acetate saob as well as homoacetogens are generally considered to be strictly anaerobic and pure cultures are highly sensitive to oxygen o2 westerholm et al 2010 2011 balk 2002 hattori et al 2000 wohlfarth 1994 ferry 1995 whilesome homoacetogens such as sporomusa termitida acetonema longum sporomusa sp strain tmao3 and acetobacterium woodii can effectively consume o2 with the involvement of h2 or endogenous reductants which means that homoacetogen can reestablish favorable anaerobic conditionsfor their growth boga and brune 2003 owing to the difficulty in incubation and isolation of saob the discovery and analysis have to be supported by several molecular biological techniques table 3 describes the molecular techniques for identification and detection of saob high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing is the most common molecular biology method for revealing the microbial composition ruiz sanchez et al 2019 zhuang et al 2018 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish is also commonly applied for microbial composition analysis fotidis et al 2013a moreover the combination of different molecular methods including illuminasequencing of 16s rrna genes quantitative polymerasechain reaction qpcr and terminal restriction fragmentlength polymorphism t rflp analysis was applied toreveal the microbial structure andquantify the abundance of dominant species westerholm et al 2018 besides comprehensive analysis of metagenomics amplicon sequencing and protein stable isotope probing was also applied for identifying saob mosbaek et al 2016 novel syntrophic butyrate and acetate oxidizing bacteria in anaerobic digesters with feeding butyrate and acetate were identified by combining dna stable isotope probing dna sip and illuminasequencing of 16s rrna genes yi et al 2019 as shown in table 3 saob likely preferred to cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogen of methanoculleus because of its high ammonia tolerance genome guide analysis found that methanoculleus bourgensis mab1 and ms2 have a similar genotype with t acetatoxydans manzoor et al 2016a their genomes lack genes related to ammonium transporter but encode diverse potassium and osmolyte uptake systems maus et al 2015 manzoor et al 2016b which resulted in the high resistance of ammonia 3 biochemical pathways of homoacetogenesis and sao 3 1 biochemical pathway of homoacetogenesis in homoacetogenesis two moles of co2 are reduced with h2 to one mole of acetate via the wood ljungdahl wl pathway fig 3 a drake et al 2010 schüchmann and müller 2014 this pathway also refers to the reductive acetyl coapathway as it involves formation of acetyl coa as an intermediate in formatting acetate h2 and co2 served as electron donor and acceptor respectively are used by organisms to produce acetate as end with atp formation in this pathway wood 1991 two branches methyl and carbonyl branch in the wl pathway had been characterized in the methyl branch co2 is converted to formate with h2 as electron donor andtetrahydrofolate h4f is attached to formate to form formyl h4f via formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase fthfs during this reaction one mole of atpis used with formation of methenyl h4f fthfs is a crucial enzyme in the wl pathway and its gene has been used to survey the diversity of homoacetogen presented indifferent environments westerholm et al 2016 wood 1986 lovell and leaphart 2005 henderson et al 2010 latif et al 2014 by using h2 as electron donor methenyl h4f is converted to methylene h4f and then to methyl h4f h4f is separated andthe methyl group is transferred to protein which comprises a corrinoid cofactor and iron sulfur clusters and this is referred to corrinoid iron sulfur protein cofesp next the cofespis transferred to carbon monoxide co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthetase codh acs and co produced from a mole of co2 from carbonyl branch codh acs then contributes to the generation of acetyl coa which is phosphorylated andform acetate with releasing one mole of atp schüchmann and müller 2014 the gene for thecodh acs enzyme has also been used to reveal the diversity of homoacetogens manzoor et al 2013 3 2 biochemical pathways of sao previously cultivation experiments enzyme activity study 16s rrna gene based genome investigationand mrna based whole transcriptome analysis resulted in the assumption that saob physiologically belongs to the acetogensand performs two metabolic functions 1 acetate formation from the small molecular organic matters applies the reductive wl pathway and 2 saoemploys the oxidative direction fig 3b schnürer et al 1996 manzoor et al 2016a hattori et al 2005 however recent study revealed that thereare must be at least two pathways for acetate oxidation as disclosed by analyzing the genome ofc ultunense esp bst and p lettingae which showed that they are lacking key enzymesof the wl pathway manzoor et al 2018 the complete set of wl pathwaygenes were identified in genomes of s schinkii and th phaeum manzoor et al 2018 müller et al 2015 oehler et al 2012 the whole transcriptome analysis on s schinkiiindicated all genes relating to the wl pathway were highly expressed which confirmed that the oxidative wl pathway involved in the sao manzoor et al 2016a for th phaeum there is not enough available expression data whileenzyme activity of key functions study confirmed the potential acetate oxidation route of wl pathway hattori et al 2005 th phaeum also have been reported to function as homoacetogenic bacteria which can grow on a variety of substrates including pyruvate methanol and h2 co2 in addition th phaeum is closely related to s schinkii with 50 of the genomes in synteny manzoor et al 2018 c ultunense does not oxidize acetate by the oxidative wl pathway because of the lack of important key genes such as encoding genes of furmarate reductase succinyl coa acetate coa transferase and substrate level phosphorylation acetyl coa synthase subunit methyltransferase and methylene reductase and corrinoidenzyme manzoor et al 2013 manzoor et al 2016a manzoor et al 2018 however it reported that acetate oxidation was occurred with active acetyl coa synthase in c ultunense strain bst there also exist two types of active methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase enzymes and their functions depend on the direction of the wl pathway schnürer et al 1996 p lettingae harbors genes for acetate kinase formyl thf synthetase and bifunctionalmethylene thf dehydrogenase methenyl cyclohydrolase while genes encoding phosphotransacetylase acetyl coa synthetase adp forming acetyl coa synthetase co dehydrogenase methyltransferase methylene thf reductase and formate dehydrogenase lyase have not identified in genomes of p lettingae the lack of wl pathway genes indicates that it might use another potential pathway for acetate oxidation manzoor et al 2018 physiological robustness is beneficial to ad environment and reveals unexpected metabolic diversity relating to acetate degradation and energy conservation system therefore the pathwaysof acetate oxidation conducted by c ultunense and p lettingae need further research to provide detail information for metabolicengineering to achieve high degradation rate or microbial growth rate some homoacetogens c ljungdahlii c autoethanogenum and c autoethanogenum had been modified using genetic tools such as deletion adhe1 adhe2 plasmid expression of formate dehydrogenase from e coli and inactivation of acetolactate decarboxylase gene buda to achieve higher fermentation product liew et al 2016 3 3 energy conservation in homoacetogen and saob atp change in free energy of reactions related to wl pathway was described in schüchmann and müller 2014 atp a common energy carrier serves as energy equivalent in biology for energy conservation substrate level phosphorylation slp and chemiosmotic ion gradient driven phosphorylation are two known modes of energy conservation the chemical reaction of phosphorylating adp to generate atp is coupled by slp and an exergonic electron transfer reaction of translocating ions to a membrane is coupled by chemiosmotic energy conservation during the process a transmembraneelectrochemical ion gradient were formed which drives the atp synthesis by a membrane bound atp synthase in wl pathway fig 3a 1 mole atp formed through acetate kinase reaction is consumed for formate activation resulting in the zero net atp synthesis by slp therefore energy conservation in homoacetogen needs a chemiosmosis mechanism of atp formation although the redox couple of methylene thf methyl thf possesses the most positive redox potential in wl pathway e0ʹ 200 mv to 130 mv maden 2000 exergonic reaction still occurs even with nadh serving as the electrondonor δg0ʹ 23 kj to 37 kj mol 1 the reduction of methylene thf is coupled to energy conservation as cytochrome dependent and ion translocating electron transfer chain receive electron from nadh nadph or reduced ferredoxin fdred wood 1986 buckel and thauer 2013 however the position of methylene thf reductase in homoacetogen either integrates in membrane or attaches with membrane indicating that methylene thf reductase has no direct relation to the formation of chemiosmotic gradient therefore the reactions are not responsible for carbon flow in the wl pathway which contributes to energy conservation in homoacetogen chemiosmosis is involved in reactions of wl pathway by accumulation of fdred and then the fdred is oxidized by membrane integral complexes to form a chemoismostic gradient for atp synthesis this strategy allows acetogens to utilize various modules for energy conservation with no change of wl pathway for a woodii h2 is oxidized by theelectron bifurcating hydrogenase with yielding nadh and fdred in the reductive branch of acetogenesis then fdredis used by proton translocating ferredoxin nad oxidoreductase rnf complex for formation of chemiosmotic gradient the oxidation of fdred by rnf complex results in theexport of na a woodii harbors a membrane integral f0f1 atp synthase for na exporting brandt et al 2013 the rnf complex is the only coupling site for energy conservation in c ljungdahlii thus theenergy conservation is obtained by electron transfer from fdred to nad coupling with h translocation and chemiosmoticgradient formation drake et al 2010 in addition m thermoacetica representing the third model homoactogen utilizes h as chemiosmotic couplingion it has cytochrome and quinone which have potential to mediate electron transfer from electron donors including h2 methylene thf and etc drake et al 2010 müller 2003 instead of rnfcomplex energy converting hydrogenase ech complex is viewed as a potential candidate for energy coupling site in the growth of m thermoacetica schüchmann and müller 2014 it is worth noting that alarge energetic barrier related to electron flowfrom h2 to fd existed but all the examined homoacetogens solve this problem via enzymes which are able to catalyze the flavin based electronbifurcation schüchmann and müller 2014 the saob has significantly different energy conserving systems fe fe hydrogenases are the only identified core set which is encoded by all saob genomes fig 3b the genomes of t acetatoxydans s schinkii c ultunese and p lettingae encode an electron bifurcating rnf complex which is also found in other homoacetogens drake et al 2010 kpke et al 2010 poehlein et al 2012 t acetatoxydans has a potentially electron bifurcating fe fe hydrogenase but lacks atpsynthase operon müller et al 2015 the genome of s schinkii harbors an ech hydrogenase and several duplicatesof fe fe hydrogenase manzoor et al 2016a the genome of the thermophilic th phaeum codes for apotentially bifurcating fe fe hydrogenase and ech hydrogenase with lacking rnf complex oehler et al 2012 in addition since th phaeum can use the wl pathway in both oxidative and reductive directions energy conserving enzyme systems in t phaeum were studied inboth metabolic directions it revealed that the periplasmically oriented formate dehydrogenaseand the formate hydrogenlyase complex both representingtwo membrane bound enzyme systems could be the keyfor the reversibility of the wl pathway in t phaeum keller et al 2019 acetate is activated through an atp independent path via aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase aor and subsequent oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetyl coa unlike homoacetogen saob have to share the limited free energy change of δg0 31 kj mol 1 table 1 with hydrogenotrophic methanogen thermodynamically sao hm is exergonic and the energetics in coculture of s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis and mix cultures of c ultunese t acetatoxydans s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis are consistent in these two cultures δg values were about 30 to 40 kj reaction for sao and hm initially respectively and stabilized at 10 kj mol 1 for sao and 20 kj mol 1 for hm westerholm et al 2019 thus methanogens obtain more energy from this partnership than saob which is contrary to previous assumption that coculture of m bourgensis and c ultunense share energy equally during sao hm i e 17 kj mol 1 each schnürer et al 1996 4 roles of homoacetogenesis and sao pathwaysin ad 4 1 relations of homoacetogenesis and sao with methanogenesis methane is generally generated by two pathways hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm and acetoclastic methanogenesis am which metabolizes h2 co2 and acetate to generatech4 respectively in complex systems hm occurs in close coexistence with acetogenesis andtypically contributes to 30 40 of generated ch4 am one of the most sensitive processes to factors in ad typically accounts for to 60 70 of ch4 generation angelidaki and batstone 2010 it is also a highly specialized reaction which is derived by two groups ofmethanogens methanosarcinaceae and methanosaetaceae within the order of methanosarcinales theoverall reaction described in table 1 4 1 1 homoacetogens competing with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in anaerobic methanogenic digester homoacetogensoutcompete with hydrogenotrophicmethanogens for h2 at acidic environment schink 1997 weijma et al 2002 homoacetogens haveh2 threshold concentrations in the range of 350 to 700 nm whereas hydrogenotrophic methanogenshave much lower h2 threshold concentrations in the range of 20 to75 nm cord ruwisch et al 1988 at high ph2 500 pa homoacetogenesis is more favorable than hm demirel and scherer 2008 while hydrogenotrophic methanogenoutcompetes homoacetogen at low h2 concentrations in mesophilic methanogenic environment breznak 1990 in addition the conversion pathways of methanogens have more negative value of gibb s free energy change g0 135 0 kj mol 1 than that of homoacetogens g0 104 6 kj mol 1 and it is clear that species using pathways with more negative gibb sfree energy change have energetic advantage and therefore dominate in the environment cord ruwisch et al 1988 janssen 2010 however other factors than energy output can affect growth of organisms and in line with that homoacetogensoutcompete hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 at low temperature 20 c parkin and owen 1986 grabowski et al 2005 because the latter has lower activity at that low temperature kotsyurbenko et al 2001 it was concluded that the carbon flow through homoacetogenesis increasewith depress of temperature fey and conrad 2000 at temperatures 10 c the most electron flow passes through homoacetogenesis conrad et al 1989 thermodynamic calculations show that homoacetogenesis at 5 cwith ph2 10paand10 mmacetateproduces the same energy as that of hm at 35 c schink 1997 besides anaerobic digesters homoacetogenesis also existed in various natural environments such as hyper saline waters and paddy soils deep subsurface sediments ljungdahl 1983 under these conditions homoacetogens compete with hydrogenotrophicmethanogens for substrate but interact with acetoclasticmethanogens the homoacetogens are more competitive than hydrogenotrophic methanogens because of their diverse metabolic capabilities and ability of switch between autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms dinamarca et al 2011 4 1 2 saob competing with acetoclastic methanogen energetically syntrophic acetate oxidation catalyzed by saob isextremely unfavorable g0 104 6 kj mol 1 however similar to alcohol or fatty acid oxidation this unfavorable reaction can proceed under h2 elimination by h2 consuming methanogenesis g0 135 6 kj mol 1 theoverall reaction of sao hm is exergonicwith the equal stoichiometry as am although this mutualsyntrophy theoretically yields energy the value is quite small g0 31 0kj mol 1 unlike acetoclastic methanogens utilizing yield energy syntrophic acetate oxidizer and partner methanogen share the limited energy because each microbe has its own energy needs for growth hattori 2008 this energetically disadvantage may cause these syntrophsto grow slowerthan acetoclastic methanogens this could also explain acetoclastic methanogenesis as predominant pathway instead of sao hm in highly reduced anaerobic digesters while ad process is vulnerable to inhibition from accumulation of some chemicals among which ammonia is the most significant inhibitor although ammonia is needed for bacterial growth high ammonia levels are inhibiting microbial growth since acetoclastic methanogens are sensitive to high ammonia ammonia can originate from various sources such as urea or can be formed during hydrolysis of proteins contained in the feedstock total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration consistingof free ammonia nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen higher than approx 2 g l 1 can cause the inhibit the anaerobic digestion process chen et al 2008 however much higher ammonia concentrations have been reported to be tolerated 3 g l 1nh4 n which can be due to process adaptation to high ammonia levels the inhibition is more likely resulted by free ammonia in solution chen et al 2008 the performance of anaerobic digester with protein rich residue as substrate might be influenced by accumulation of ammonia and volatile fatty acids vfas the growth activity of acetoclastic methanogens was significantly affected by the high concentrations of these compounds and it was due to that these groups are considered to be more sensitive to ammonia than hydrogenotrophic methanogens koster and lettinga 1984 angelidaki and ahring 1993 this inhibition can be eliminated by enriching of saob in conjunction with specific groups of hydrogenotrophic methanogens it mainly due to that the absence of ammonium transporters in saob such as s schinkii and t acetatoxydans might protect the cells from redundant ammonium influx müller et al 2015 manzoor et al 2016a under high concentrations of ammonia some saob can conduct the homoacetogenic pathway and metabolize acetate to co2and h2 for example thermacetogenium phaeum uses the wl pathway in both directions either for the production of acetate from a variety of compounds or for the oxidation of acetate in syntrophic cooperation with hydrogenotrophic methanogens hattori 2008 keller et al 2019 the bioreaction is thermodynamically favorable as hydrogenotrophic methanogens subsequently utilize the h2 therefore the inhibition of methanogenesis can be eliminated by sao hm process in ad system with nitrogen rich substrate petersen and ahring 1991 thus sao pathway is viewed as an alternative and effective pathway for acetate degradation in ammonium stressed anaerobic system thereby sao provides the ad process capability to response the high concentration of ammonia inhibiting activity foracetoclastic methanogen lee 1988 karakashev et al 2006 researchers have attempted different strategies to alleviate ammonia toxicity such as adding absorbents to bind ammonia dilution of the reactor content to reduce the high ammonia levels bioaugmentation accumulation of ammonia tolerantmicroorganisms such as saob fotidis et al 2013a chen et al 2008 fotidis et al 2013b magnetite addition to promote the rateof ch4 generation through sao hm at high level of ammonia 5 0 g l 1 nh4 n was also conducted with increasing ch4 productionby 36 58 zhuang et al 2018 therefore the strategies of facilitating ch4 generation through sao hm pathway is critical to improve the performance of ad under high levels of ammonia besides high ammonia concentration sao hm pathway also presentshigher ability to tolerate high temperature and acetate concentration compared to acetoclastic methanogenesis sao performs as important pathway in a greatnumber of thermosphilic ad systems sun et al 2014 fotidis et al 2013a petersen and ahring 1991 karakashev et al 2006 lue et al 2013 hao et al 2013 sasaki et al 2011 in theory sao pathway becomes energetically and thermodynamically favorable with the increase oftemperature or acetate concentration dolfing 2014 matthias et al 2010 in fact temperature significantlyaffects the structure ofmicrobial community in ad systems including hydrogenotrophic methanogens gomec et al 2010 jaecheul et al 2019 which in turninfluences the sao inaddition high temperature could result in increase of nh3 tan ratio exceeding the ammonia tolerance of sao hm pathway sao is energeticallyfavorableat high level of acetate 4 mm nozhevnikova et al 2010 hao et al 2011 mulat et al 2014 in some thermophilic anaerobic digestors sao also performed as the dominant acetate metabolization pathway with low concentration of acetate 0 2 1 mm petersen and ahring 1991 ahring 1995 hori et al 2006 previous researchers found that t acetatoxydans is favoredat high level of acetate müller et al 2015 whereas s schinkii and t phaeum potentiallyhaving high capability of acetateuptaking could keep adequate activity even at low level of acetate manzoor et al 2016a compared to the acetate affinity of methanosarcina 0 2 2 5 mm jetten et al 1990 the minimum threshold of acetate for acetate oxidation is 0 40 0 45 mm in coculture of s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis and 0 7 mm in the mix cultures ofc ultunense t acetatoxydans s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis westerholm et al 2019 therefore the sao hm pathway had advantages in adaptation of environmental pressures such as high ammonia concentration high temperature and acetate concentration 4 1 3 electron transfer mechanism between saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens thermodynamically the reaction of oxidizing acetate to h2 co2 is unfavorable unless the concentrations of h2 are maintained extremely low via coupling the acetate oxidationwith an h2 utilizing reaction sieber et al 2018 thus sao involves the interspecies h2 transfer between saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogen whichmaintains a low level of ph2 10 5 atm stams and plugge 2009 in addition previous study established two coculture systems of saob thermacetogenium phaeum strain pb with a formate h2 utilizing methanogen and an h2 utilizing methanogen respectively both h2 and formate closely related to the sao bythermodynamic calculation the former coculture generated two times faster than the later one and kept four times lower levelsof ph2 and formate concentration indicating that h2 as well as formate may be served as interspecies electron carriers fig 4 hattori et al 2000 direct interspecies electron transfer diet refers to a mechanism of electron transfer via the generation of electric current between electron donating and electron accepting microorganism without the involvement of electron carriers such as formate and h2 in recent years diet utilizing cytochrome conductive pili and conductive materials had been proved to be an effective way to promote methane production baek et al 2018 martins et al 2018 wu et al 2020 potential diet pathway might occur in sao process as magnetiteadded in methanogenic environment fig 4 the bacteria geobacteraceae and archaeamethanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae mightbe involved in the diet mediated by magnetite for sao hm zhuang et al 2018 diet pathway also occurred between electroactive thermacetogenium and methanogens pan et al 2017 thermacetogenium was also served as an active microbe in an anode biofilm of microbial electrolysis cell khongkliang et al 2017 single walled carbon nanotubecan form current between methanogens and electroactive saob a more efficient diet instead of h2 transfer could promote growth of electrically active saob such as t phaeum shen et al 2020 in summary homoacetogens compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 whereas saob compete with acetoclastic methanogens for acetate theoretically these two processes are not impossible exist at the same timein anaerobic systems but they could change their abundance and roles with variation of environmental factors such as temperature ammonia concentration acetate concentrations and etc to further regulate the anaerobic system through producing and consuming acetate fotidis et al 2013a fotidis et al 2013b chen et al 2018 4 2 roles of homoacetogenesis and sao in acidogenesis 4 2 1 roles of homoacetogenesis inacidogenesis sugars and amino acids are decomposed to vfas alcohols h2 and co2 during the process of acidogenesis anaerobic acidogenesis is considered as a promising process for treating organic wastes and obtaining added value products studies focusing on fermentation mainly consist of acetate production biohydrogen production and serving as the first step of anaerobic methane production all these processes have close relations with homoacetogenesis acetate production acetate is considered as raw material forplastic film food preservative and deicing chemical cheryan et al 1997 acetate has higher value than methane the production of acetate accompanied with the degradation of organic wastes can synchronously obtain economic and environmental benefits glucose acidogenesis and homoacetogenesiswere coupled for acetate production ni et al 2011 enhancement of homoacetogenesis in this system could improve the yield of acetate previous study focusing on acidogenesis homoacetogenesis two phase coupling system found that the initial ph affects the production of vfas and ethanol production in these two phases and ph value of 8 is optimal for acetate generation nie et al 2007 yan et al 2014 also found thatph control is an effective approach to reach active homoacetogens in acidogenic system in glucose fermentation system the homoacetogenacetobacterium woodiiwas introduced to acidogenic reactor for producing acetate and acetate contributed to more than 90 of the total soluble product yan et al 2014 isolation of novel and effective homoacetogen has become a research hotpot in recent years clostridium sp bxx a new species of genera clostridium grows on h2 co2 syngas glucose 1 2 propanediol sodium formate 2 methoxyethanoland glycerol and cannot grow on co pyruvate or lactate strain bxx growsautotrophically to produce acetate and grows heterotrophically to produce ethanol strain bxx is an excellent strain resource for acetate fermentation and has good potential of industrialapplication zhu et al 2018 blautia sp ca3 isolated from anaerobic activated sludge also utilize h2 co2 and glucose to produce acetate with the optimum temperature of 35 c and ph value of 8 0 with acetate production rate of 8 92 mg l 1 h 1 and acetate concentration of 1370mgl 1 respectively li et al 2013 blautia coccoides ga 1 utilizing h2 co2 as substrate yields acetate of 5 32 g g 1 dry cell weight after cultivation for 10 days autotrophic metabolism is suppressed by the introduction of glucose as higher concentration of glucose will lead to the reduction of activity of autotrophic cultures liu et al 2015 isolation of high efficient homoacetogen and physiological biochemical characterization are required for industrialized acetate production h2 production biohydrogen production through dark fermentation has been widely research during the last two decades h2 produced during the ad process is fast consumed through methanogenesis andhomoacetogenesis dinamarca and bakke 2009 saady 2013 the h2 utilizing reactions including hm and homoacetogenesis are more energetic favorable than acetogenic reactions g0 4 2 76 2 kj mol 1 at high level of h2 saady 2013 for anaerobicfermentative h2 production the h2 consuming reactions such as homoacetogenesis have to be blocked for making h2 accumulation possible ni et al 2011 strategies were applied to restrain h2 utilizing reaction such as ph regulation inoculum pretreatment olr shock control ofph2and hydraulic retention time hrt shanmugam et al 2014 liu et al 2010 bakonyi et al 2014 si et al 2015 different approaches of inoculum pretreatments including acidification heating loading shock were applied for inhibiting hydrogenotrophic methanogen andhomoacetogen while the results were unexpected some species of clostridium such as clostridiumljungdahlii clostridium aceticum and clostridium scatologenes are heat resistant homoacetogens saady 2013 it is found that h2 production depends on the fermentation temperature and ph value the activity of homoacetogens can be suppressed in thermophilic environment at initial ph of 5 5 however all the approachesfailed to eliminate either hm or homoacetogenesiswith long term operating luo et al 2015 homoacetogens with a high tolerance to ph change survived in system of h2 fermentation the strategy of ph regulation was found to be more effective in shifting fermentation pathway instead of inhibitingh2 consumption kim et al 2004 shortening hrt was considered as an effective strategy viaenhancing h2 yield and domesticatingfunctional populations such asclostridium spp and thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccarolyticum liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 regulating hrt can control homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis it was reported that homoacetogenesis was dramatically inhibited with hrt decreasing to 8 and 4 h respectively si et al 2015 methane production performance of anaerobic digesters with methane as main product could also be improved by strengthening homoacetogenesis acetate is easier to degrade compared to propionate and butyrate converting glucose to acetate by homoacetogens could reduce the carbon flow to more reduced products wohlfarth 1994 more carbon sinking into acetate would improve stability of the ad process and the produced acetate if not further degraded could be utilized as chemical solvent as well as providing methanogenic precursor for acetoclastic methanogenesis in addition the bioreactions of acetogenesisare h2 producing process a low level of h2 is required to maintain the reactions to be thermodynamically feasible thus h2 utilizing organisms are essential to sustain the overall activity of anaerobic microbes during ad enhancing homoacetogenesis in acidogenic reactors will promote the h2 consumption in acidogenic phase to maintain subsequent acidogenesis athigh efficiency and further improve system sustainability therefore enrichment of homoacetogensis an effective approach for solving the problems ofh2 inhibition 4 2 2 roles of sao in acidogenesis unlike homoacetogens saob cannot catalyze acetate oxidation to form hydrogen without hydrogenotrophic methanogen consuming h2 therefore in ad system for biohydrogen and acetate as added value products sao hm should be inhibited in anaerobic methanogenic system for fermenting protein rich substrate acetoclastic methanogens might be inhibited by high concentration of ammonia and sao hm pathway could degrade acetate produced from fermentation acidogenesis to avoid the acetate accumulation petersen and ahring 1991 enhancing sao hm pathway is an alternative and effective method for treating protein rich waste water 4 3 roles of homoacetogenesis and sao in acetogenesis acetogenesis is viewed as a rate limiting process since its thermodynamic constraint and studies about acetogenesis has a long story drake et al 2010 the vfas and alcohol generated from acidogenesis aredegraded to acetate by obligate h2 producing acetogens electron generated from thebioreaction is wasted for h2 production the free energy of reaction for fatty acid oxidation is positive at standard conditions and therefore low ph2 is needed to achieve a negative free energy and thereby yield energy for anabolism h2consuming methanogen which convert h2 and co2 to ch4 helps in a balanced biomass to keep at low level of ph2 however both h2 producers acetogens and h2 consumers methanogens can only favor at narrow band of h2 concentration h2 is the most important endproduct with respect to determining the free energyof the reaction since more h2 is produced stoichiometrically than other products as the end product acetate is also important but it is stoichiometrically produced at lower level because of the critical level of h2 concentration h2 transfer between h2 producers and h2 consumers isimportant and most likely they live in syntrophic consortia because they have no alternative pathwaysapart from direct oxidation of the organic acids fatty acid oxidizing organisms may be referred to as having a linearmetabolism homoacetogens could serve as h2 consuming bacteria cooperating with fatty acids oxidizing bacteria the mixed cultures inad system coupled syntrophic acetogens with homoacetogens can promoteacetate formation from high strength organic wastewater nie et al 2007 nie et al 2008 nie et al 2009 acetate generation through homoacetogenesispromoted by 40 in a fed batchfermentation system which resulted from a balance between the h2 generation at acetogenic stage and h2utilization at homoacetogenic stage ni et al 2011 homoacetogenesis performed as an available pathway for h2 sinkduring syntrophic butyrate oxidation in the thermophilic ad system inhibited methanogenic process ni et al 2011 it also found that homoacetogen was more possible existed in common anaerobic condition the dissolved h2 and ph2 were clearly decreased in an ad system coupled syntrophic acetogenesis with homoacetogenesis more than 5 of produced acetate was attributed to homoacetogenesis and the value can reach up to 33 in theory nie et al 2007 acetate production was also enhanced in an acetogenesis and homoacetogenesiscoupling system by using the strategies of gas circulation and fed batch fermentation nie et al 2008 syntrophic co culture of a homoacetogen acetobacterium woodii and common acetogens was established for producing acetate during glucose fermentation h2 production decreased and acetate dominated 90 in total soluble products nie et al 2008 however it is still unclear for effect of factors on acetateproduction via homoacetogenesis saob can be viewed as syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing bacteria and cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogen in sao hm dominant systems syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing bacteria require saob to utilize acetate and hydrogenotrophic methanogensto consume h2 formate in that way a triple syntrophic association consisting of syntrophic fatty acids oxidizing bacteria saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens would be formed in summary homoacetogenesis and sao pathways regulate the ad through producing acetate and consuming acetate competing or cooperating with methanogens cooperating with acidogenesis and syntrophy with fatty acids oxidizing bacteria the interactions between these functional microbes are quite complex but the complex conversions and interactions maintain the sustainability of anaerobic digestors offers flexibility to overcome stress under different environment disturbances such as low or high temperature high ammonia and acetate or vfas 5 outlook and future perspectives 5 1 detection and isolation of novel saob and homoacetogen some new saob strains were isolated recently and theircharacteristics of physiology and genetics were deeply investigated however there is little knowledge on their diversity abundance and roles of saob in ad system westerholm et al 2016 the predominant methanogens shifted from the obligate acetotroph methanosaetato the hydrogenotrophic methanoculleus with the increase of ammonia while acetate degradation still occurred it clearly pointed the existenceand importance of sao pathway while only few saob have been isolated and characterized ruiz sanchez et al 2019 known saob also showed lowrelative abundance in all reactors under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions for saob enrichment most functional biodiversity of saoprocess still remains unknown and needs further exploration in addition recent research also found that thermophilic microorganisms significantly switched their acetate biodegradation from sao hm functioned by methanobacteriales spp and or methanomicrobiales spp to am functioned by methanosarcinaceae spp after adaption to high levels of acetate and ammonia on the contrary there is no shift in pathway under mesophilic after acclimatization westerholm et al 2018 therefore the sustainability of sao hm pathway and its influence factors also require further investigation moreover new and efficienthomoacetogen isolation and construction also require more efforts 5 2 a suggested novel anaerobic system and analysis of mechanisms fermentationisviewedasa process for added value products generation while the release of co2reduces thecarbonconversion efficiency from organic matters to reachthe highest carbon conversion efficiency to added value products an effective fermentation system with homoacetogens serving as dominant bacteria can be effective for co2 reuse moreover saob have advantage in tolerating high ammonia concentrations in anaerobic systems considering the inhibition from high ammonia concentration in industrial anaerobic process anovel two phases anaerobic reactor can be proposed to treat protein rich waste water during anaerobic industrial methane production fig 5 the first phase is fermentation phase with the acidogens and homoacetogens as predominant groups for reaching a high production of acetate and second phase is a mixed culture system of syntrophic fatty acids degrading bacteria thus carbon source flows to acetate in a large proportion at first stage could reduce the pressure of follow up syntrophic bacteria for the second phase compared to acetoclastic methanogenesis dominant system sao hm dominated system has higher ammonia resistance this system can be also applied for treating sulfate rich wastewater through enriching srb in second phase and coupling with saob srb and syntrophic fatty acids degrading bacteria srb to date only three acetogens strain aor s schinkii and t phaeum are known to operate the oxidative wl pathway for syntrophic acetate oxidation although other acetogens e g m thermoacetica and a woodii harbor thereductive wl pathway it has not been reportedwhether they can operate it in the oxidative direction forsao it was reported thatstrain aor andth phaeumcould act as homoacetogenic bacteria to generate acetate from h2 co2 lee 1988 hattori et al 2005 manzoor et al 2018 it still requires further study to reveal whether other saob own similar functions as homoacetogens in addition another research topic is how to reach the maximum productsyields for e g acetate and h2 via optimizing and regulating metabolic pathways via molecular technology such as proteomics and metabolomics and the genetic tools stable genome insertion or deletion precise genetic manipulation transposon mutagenesis and gene editing of pure microbial cultures by crispr cas9 in addition the potential application of saob under conditions other than high temperature and ammonia concentration is also important research issue needing further development 5 3 how redox mediators regulating sao hm and homoacetogenesis nano iron materials and biochar could sever as electron transfer intermediate to accelerate the electron transfer from electron donor to electron acceptor by the cyclic transformation of oxidation and reduction states some recent studies proved that nano magnetite materials could enhance direct electron transfer in sao hm dominated systems zhuang et al 2018 and single walled carbon nanotubes could establish the current between the electroactive saob and methanogen shen et al 2020 but the mechanism of these materials on the atp yields biomass changes or functional saob shifts are still unknown in addition how these mediators regulate homoacetogenesis also requires further study 6 conclusion the production and consumption of acetate occurs in the whole process of ad the roles of sao hm and homoacetogenesis in ad process have been studied in different anaerobic environments the process of sao hm replaced acetoclastic methanogenesis in some specific environments with high temperature and high ammonia acetate concentrations with inhibition of activity of acetoclastic methanogens homoacetogenesis is more competitive than hm under acidic alkaline and low temperature 10 c 20 c conditions and the importance of homoacetogenesis had been proved when analyzing anaerobic fermentations the energetically disadvantage of sao requires saob to cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in methanogenic phase and degrade acetate via oxidative wl pathway besides h2 utilizing methanogens hydrogenotrophic srb also can also reach syntrophy with saob while homoacetogens prefer to occur in acidogenic phase and generate acetate by reductive wl pathway therefore how to play their best strengths in ad process is a promising topic a novel two phases anaerobic digester for treating protein rich waste water was proposed in which homoacetogenesis domains in acidogenesis phase and produces adequate acetate to supply for saob in methanogenic phase declaration of competing

17312,acetate is a pivotal intermediate product during anaerobic decomposition of organic matter its generation and consumption network is quite complex which almost covers the most steps in anaerobic digestion ad process besides acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis syntrophic acetate oxidation sao replaced acetoclastic methanogenesis to release the inhibition of ad at some special conditions and the importance of considering homoacetogenesis had also been proved when analysing anaerobic fermentations syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob with function of sao can survive under high temperature and ammonia volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations while homoacetogens performed homoacetogenesis are more active under acidic alkaline and low temperature 10 c 20 c conditions this review summarized the roles of sao and homoacetogenesis in ad process which contains the biochemical reactions metabolism pathways physiological characteristics and energy conservation of functional bacteria the specific roles of these two processes in the subprocess of ad i e acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis were also analyzed in detail a two phases anaerobic digester is proposed for protein rich waste water treatment by enhancing the functions of homoacetogens and saob compared to the traditional two phases anaerobic digesters in which the first phase is

water treatment angelidaki and batstone 2010 rajendran et al 2020 due to its advantages in pollutant control and bio energy production with increasing request for renewable energy the application of ad is gaining increased attention ad is occurring in either natural environments for ch4 emission or in anaerobic digesters for waste water treatment caposciutti et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 reumer et al 2018 ad is a complicated structured process and its bioreactions are mediated by several specific groups of microorganisms a fine balance between the various steps in ad is necessary for stable operation and optimization of the process therefore understanding the detailed mechanismsin this biochemical technology is necessary and important the ad process can be divided into the following steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis mcinerney and bryant 1981 acetate is a pivotal intermediate in anaerobic decomposition of organic matters and it contributes to a major part of the produced methane angelidaki and batstone 2010 aoyagi et al 2020 however the generation and consumption of acetate is depending on a various parameters and most steps of ad are involved including acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis syntrophic acetate oxidation sao and methanogenesis fig 1 table 1 angelidaki and batstone 2010 the versatile role of acetate as intermediate product and methanogenic precursor strengthened its importance in ad and necessity for detailed investigation previous research studies have investigated the role of acetate in acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis madigan 2012 schink 1997 when the anaerobic reactor operates stably under low h2 partial pressure ph2 acetate was the main product in polysaccharide peptides amino acids glycerol or galactose etc fermentation viaacetyl coenzymea coa pathway and most substrates are converted directly to acetate and hydrogen h2 instead of reduced products such as propionate butyrate and ethanol mcinerney and bryant 1981 however a large amount of less oxidized product is produced under extreme low ph when the anaerobic reactor is overloaded madigan 2012 these reduced products need to be oxidized by obligate h2 producing acetogens several strategies have been used to improve acetate production in acidogenesis step of ad including ph adjustment organic loading rate olr regulation and ph2 control nie et al 2007 ni et al 2011 yan et al 2014 and also acetate is an important endproduct in acetogenesis process mediated by syntrophic fatty acids oxidizing bacteria electron derived from thisoxidation reaction is pooled to h to generate h2 the free energy of fatty acid oxidation reaction is positive at standard conditions therefore low h2 concentration is needed to achieve a negative free energy formate and h2 are two main interspecies electron carriers in anaerobic methane environment and their concentration or partial pressure determined the proceeding of acetogenesis schink 1997 dong and stams 1995 h2 consuming methanogen converts h2 co2 to ch4 to keep low h2 concentration in addition to h2 and formate acetate removal has a profound influence on syntrophic metabolism of fatty acids or aromatic acid inhibition from acetate accumulation was also found in ad systems with syntrophic decomposition of fatty aromatic acids rajendran et al 2020 ahring and westermann 1988 warikoo et al 1996 simeonov and queinnec 2006 as an important precursor for methanogenesis acetate contributes to 60 70 methane generation previous research also reported the hydrolysis and acetate decomposition were the main rate limiting steps with cellulose and easily metabolized material as the main substrates respectively angelidaki and batstone 2010 however other processes in ad are able to affect acetate metabolism under specific conditions at low temperatures 10 c 20 c homoacetogenic organisms convert h2 and co2 to acetate outcompeting with hydrogenotrophic methanogens and these microbes could also grow under both acidic and alkaline conditions grimalt aleman et al 2017 drake et al 2010 kotsyurbenko et al 2001 nozhevnikova et al 2003 while syntrophic acetate oxidizingbacteria saob prefer to convert acetate to h2 and co2 at higher temperature lepisto and rintala 1999 dyksma et al 2020 some specific homoacetogenic organisms could also metabolize acetate via syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm dyksma et al 2020 bi et al 2020 westerholm et al 2010 2011 schnürer et al 2006 balk et al 2002 hattori et al 2000 schnürer et al 1996 lee and zinder 1988 barker 1936 it was reported that sao hm became the dominant pathway to overcome acetate accumulation frominitially acetoclastic methanogenesis dominant anaerobic systems under high ammonia stress wang et al 2020 ruiz sanchez et al 2019 zhuang et al 2018 westerholm et al 2016 sun et al 2014 additionally sao hm pathway also played significant role in anaerobic digester suppressed by high concentrations of vfas acetate butyrate and propionate westerholm et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and high temperature pap et al 2015 due to the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens homoacetogenesis and sao hm usually regulate acetate kinetics methane generation and carbon cycle in many ad systems under some specific anaerobic conditions not suitable for the growth for methanogens such as low or high temperature high ammonia concentration and high vfa concentrations lepisto and rintala 1999 ye et al 2014 pap et al 2015 pan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2018 in order to comprehensively understand acetate metabolism in ad process the present review focuses on the generation and consumption network of acetate under specific conditions and summarizes the recent research on sao and homoacetogenesis in addition the physiological and biochemical characteristics of saob and homoacetogens metabolism pathways of sao and homoacetogenesis and their roles in acetate consumption and production in anaerobic system are reviewed these could give a comprehensive evaluation of acetate metabolism during ad process 2 biochemical reaction and functional bacteria involved in sao and homoacetogenesis 2 1 definition of sao and homoacetogenesis sao is a process that methyl groups of acetate are converted to co2 with the generation of h2 barker 1936 since the reaction is energetically unfavorableat standard conditions it can only proceed at low ph2 with h2consumption by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the coupled reaction of sao hm is exergonic and has the same stoichiometry of acetoclastic methanogenesis table 1 sao is catalyzed by functional bacteria saob it shares the limited energy 31 0 kj mol 1 with hydrogenotrophic methanogen to support their growth this energetically disadvantage may explain the slow growth of these syntrophsand depending on adapt rigid mutualism which also well explains the difficulty in isolation of syntrophic acetate oxidizing cocultures and it also lead to the weakness of saob in outcompeting with acetoclasticmethanogen in normal anaerobic system the strict cultivation conditions and thermodynamically unfavorable acetate oxidation resulted in the poor understanding of the physiology of these groups homoacetogenesis refers to the process that co2 is reduced to acetate with h2 by the acetyl coa pathway drake et al 2010 it mainly conductsfrom autotrophic and or heterotrophic substrates including sugars alcohols amino acids organic acids and methylated aromatics co and h2 co2 table 1 this reaction isthermodynamically unfavorable in many anaerobic habitats with low ph2 montiel corona et al 2020 goodwin and zeikus 1987 in mixed cultures h2 is easily utilized by sulfate and iron reducers megonigal 2014 ntagia et al 2020 while in anaerobic methanogenic system methanogens and homoacetogens are the primary h2consumers and methanogens are commonly dominant however it was reported that homoacetogens could outcompete methanogens under low temperature condition liu andconrad 2011 probably because of their faster growth rates than methanogens at the same low temperature condition kotsyurbenko et al 2001 conrad and wetter 1990 homoacetogens can survive under both acidic and alkaline conditions drake et al 2010 2 2 physiological and biochemical characteristics of functional bacteria of sao and homoacetogenesis previous researches have paid much attention to acetoclasticmethanogenesis but neglected the sao and the role of saob therefore to date only six pure cultures of saob have been isolated including strain aor lee 1988 clostridium ultunense schnürer et al 1996 thermacetogenium phaeum hattori et al 2000 pseudothermotoga lettingae balk 2002 syntrophaceticus schinkii westerholm et al 2010 and tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans westerholm et al 2011 the first isolated saob is a thermophilicstrainbelonging to firmicutes hattori 2008 but it had been lost before establishing its phylogenetic information the other five isolates belong to the physiological group of acetogen and their characteristics and phylogenetic positions are presented in table 2 and fig 2 red ones respectively these isolates can cooperate with h2 utilizing methanogens however other isolated saob syntrophically cooperate with non methanogenic partner microbes such as geobacer sulfurreducens strain pca it can oxidize acetate efficiently in syntrophic cooperation withwolinella succinogenes with nitrate as the electron acceptor cordruwisch et al 1998 candidatus contubernalis alkalaceticum is an alkaliphilic specie which can oxidize acetate with hydrogenotrophic sulfate reducer under anaerobic mesophilic condition zhilina et al 2005 homoacetogenicbacteria are strict anaerobes metabolizing c1 compounds e g co2 to acetate or higher fatty acids and are also called acetogenic bacteria wohlfarth 1994 homoacetogens are phylogenetically distributed and 100 species representing24 genera have been reported from different environments so far drake et al 2010 and the phylogenetic tree with the most noteworthy species are presented in fig 2 in the 24genera acetobacterium and clostridium harborthe most known acetogens clostridium aceticumis the first isolated pure culture of homoacetogen however this culture was lost soon and reisolated again adamse 1980 braun et al 1981 moorella thermoacetica formerly named clostridium thermoaceticum ahomoacetogen belonging to family of thermoanaerobacteriaceae was isolated fromhorse manure with ability of converting glucose 1 mol to acetate 3 mol collins et al 1994 drake and daniel 2004 schink 1984 subsequently many homoacetogens were isolated with function of metabolizing h2 or glucose to acetate such as acetobacterium woodii a chemolithotrophic acetogen with h2 plus co2 balch et al 1977 and clostridium ljungdahlii tanner et al 1993 an ethanologenic acetogen and homoacetogen schnürer et al 1996 it was also presented homoacetogenic species moorella thermoacetica moorella thermoautotrophica and some thermoanaerobacter spp have close relationships with saob in phylogenetically fig 2 both saob and homoacetogens are involved inad via consuming or generating acetate compared to saob homoacetogens are able to convert various substrates to acetate saob as well as homoacetogens are generally considered to be strictly anaerobic and pure cultures are highly sensitive to oxygen o2 westerholm et al 2010 2011 balk 2002 hattori et al 2000 wohlfarth 1994 ferry 1995 whilesome homoacetogens such as sporomusa termitida acetonema longum sporomusa sp strain tmao3 and acetobacterium woodii can effectively consume o2 with the involvement of h2 or endogenous reductants which means that homoacetogen can reestablish favorable anaerobic conditionsfor their growth boga and brune 2003 owing to the difficulty in incubation and isolation of saob the discovery and analysis have to be supported by several molecular biological techniques table 3 describes the molecular techniques for identification and detection of saob high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing is the most common molecular biology method for revealing the microbial composition ruiz sanchez et al 2019 zhuang et al 2018 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish is also commonly applied for microbial composition analysis fotidis et al 2013a moreover the combination of different molecular methods including illuminasequencing of 16s rrna genes quantitative polymerasechain reaction qpcr and terminal restriction fragmentlength polymorphism t rflp analysis was applied toreveal the microbial structure andquantify the abundance of dominant species westerholm et al 2018 besides comprehensive analysis of metagenomics amplicon sequencing and protein stable isotope probing was also applied for identifying saob mosbaek et al 2016 novel syntrophic butyrate and acetate oxidizing bacteria in anaerobic digesters with feeding butyrate and acetate were identified by combining dna stable isotope probing dna sip and illuminasequencing of 16s rrna genes yi et al 2019 as shown in table 3 saob likely preferred to cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogen of methanoculleus because of its high ammonia tolerance genome guide analysis found that methanoculleus bourgensis mab1 and ms2 have a similar genotype with t acetatoxydans manzoor et al 2016a their genomes lack genes related to ammonium transporter but encode diverse potassium and osmolyte uptake systems maus et al 2015 manzoor et al 2016b which resulted in the high resistance of ammonia 3 biochemical pathways of homoacetogenesis and sao 3 1 biochemical pathway of homoacetogenesis in homoacetogenesis two moles of co2 are reduced with h2 to one mole of acetate via the wood ljungdahl wl pathway fig 3 a drake et al 2010 schüchmann and müller 2014 this pathway also refers to the reductive acetyl coapathway as it involves formation of acetyl coa as an intermediate in formatting acetate h2 and co2 served as electron donor and acceptor respectively are used by organisms to produce acetate as end with atp formation in this pathway wood 1991 two branches methyl and carbonyl branch in the wl pathway had been characterized in the methyl branch co2 is converted to formate with h2 as electron donor andtetrahydrofolate h4f is attached to formate to form formyl h4f via formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase fthfs during this reaction one mole of atpis used with formation of methenyl h4f fthfs is a crucial enzyme in the wl pathway and its gene has been used to survey the diversity of homoacetogen presented indifferent environments westerholm et al 2016 wood 1986 lovell and leaphart 2005 henderson et al 2010 latif et al 2014 by using h2 as electron donor methenyl h4f is converted to methylene h4f and then to methyl h4f h4f is separated andthe methyl group is transferred to protein which comprises a corrinoid cofactor and iron sulfur clusters and this is referred to corrinoid iron sulfur protein cofesp next the cofespis transferred to carbon monoxide co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthetase codh acs and co produced from a mole of co2 from carbonyl branch codh acs then contributes to the generation of acetyl coa which is phosphorylated andform acetate with releasing one mole of atp schüchmann and müller 2014 the gene for thecodh acs enzyme has also been used to reveal the diversity of homoacetogens manzoor et al 2013 3 2 biochemical pathways of sao previously cultivation experiments enzyme activity study 16s rrna gene based genome investigationand mrna based whole transcriptome analysis resulted in the assumption that saob physiologically belongs to the acetogensand performs two metabolic functions 1 acetate formation from the small molecular organic matters applies the reductive wl pathway and 2 saoemploys the oxidative direction fig 3b schnürer et al 1996 manzoor et al 2016a hattori et al 2005 however recent study revealed that thereare must be at least two pathways for acetate oxidation as disclosed by analyzing the genome ofc ultunense esp bst and p lettingae which showed that they are lacking key enzymesof the wl pathway manzoor et al 2018 the complete set of wl pathwaygenes were identified in genomes of s schinkii and th phaeum manzoor et al 2018 müller et al 2015 oehler et al 2012 the whole transcriptome analysis on s schinkiiindicated all genes relating to the wl pathway were highly expressed which confirmed that the oxidative wl pathway involved in the sao manzoor et al 2016a for th phaeum there is not enough available expression data whileenzyme activity of key functions study confirmed the potential acetate oxidation route of wl pathway hattori et al 2005 th phaeum also have been reported to function as homoacetogenic bacteria which can grow on a variety of substrates including pyruvate methanol and h2 co2 in addition th phaeum is closely related to s schinkii with 50 of the genomes in synteny manzoor et al 2018 c ultunense does not oxidize acetate by the oxidative wl pathway because of the lack of important key genes such as encoding genes of furmarate reductase succinyl coa acetate coa transferase and substrate level phosphorylation acetyl coa synthase subunit methyltransferase and methylene reductase and corrinoidenzyme manzoor et al 2013 manzoor et al 2016a manzoor et al 2018 however it reported that acetate oxidation was occurred with active acetyl coa synthase in c ultunense strain bst there also exist two types of active methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase enzymes and their functions depend on the direction of the wl pathway schnürer et al 1996 p lettingae harbors genes for acetate kinase formyl thf synthetase and bifunctionalmethylene thf dehydrogenase methenyl cyclohydrolase while genes encoding phosphotransacetylase acetyl coa synthetase adp forming acetyl coa synthetase co dehydrogenase methyltransferase methylene thf reductase and formate dehydrogenase lyase have not identified in genomes of p lettingae the lack of wl pathway genes indicates that it might use another potential pathway for acetate oxidation manzoor et al 2018 physiological robustness is beneficial to ad environment and reveals unexpected metabolic diversity relating to acetate degradation and energy conservation system therefore the pathwaysof acetate oxidation conducted by c ultunense and p lettingae need further research to provide detail information for metabolicengineering to achieve high degradation rate or microbial growth rate some homoacetogens c ljungdahlii c autoethanogenum and c autoethanogenum had been modified using genetic tools such as deletion adhe1 adhe2 plasmid expression of formate dehydrogenase from e coli and inactivation of acetolactate decarboxylase gene buda to achieve higher fermentation product liew et al 2016 3 3 energy conservation in homoacetogen and saob atp change in free energy of reactions related to wl pathway was described in schüchmann and müller 2014 atp a common energy carrier serves as energy equivalent in biology for energy conservation substrate level phosphorylation slp and chemiosmotic ion gradient driven phosphorylation are two known modes of energy conservation the chemical reaction of phosphorylating adp to generate atp is coupled by slp and an exergonic electron transfer reaction of translocating ions to a membrane is coupled by chemiosmotic energy conservation during the process a transmembraneelectrochemical ion gradient were formed which drives the atp synthesis by a membrane bound atp synthase in wl pathway fig 3a 1 mole atp formed through acetate kinase reaction is consumed for formate activation resulting in the zero net atp synthesis by slp therefore energy conservation in homoacetogen needs a chemiosmosis mechanism of atp formation although the redox couple of methylene thf methyl thf possesses the most positive redox potential in wl pathway e0ʹ 200 mv to 130 mv maden 2000 exergonic reaction still occurs even with nadh serving as the electrondonor δg0ʹ 23 kj to 37 kj mol 1 the reduction of methylene thf is coupled to energy conservation as cytochrome dependent and ion translocating electron transfer chain receive electron from nadh nadph or reduced ferredoxin fdred wood 1986 buckel and thauer 2013 however the position of methylene thf reductase in homoacetogen either integrates in membrane or attaches with membrane indicating that methylene thf reductase has no direct relation to the formation of chemiosmotic gradient therefore the reactions are not responsible for carbon flow in the wl pathway which contributes to energy conservation in homoacetogen chemiosmosis is involved in reactions of wl pathway by accumulation of fdred and then the fdred is oxidized by membrane integral complexes to form a chemoismostic gradient for atp synthesis this strategy allows acetogens to utilize various modules for energy conservation with no change of wl pathway for a woodii h2 is oxidized by theelectron bifurcating hydrogenase with yielding nadh and fdred in the reductive branch of acetogenesis then fdredis used by proton translocating ferredoxin nad oxidoreductase rnf complex for formation of chemiosmotic gradient the oxidation of fdred by rnf complex results in theexport of na a woodii harbors a membrane integral f0f1 atp synthase for na exporting brandt et al 2013 the rnf complex is the only coupling site for energy conservation in c ljungdahlii thus theenergy conservation is obtained by electron transfer from fdred to nad coupling with h translocation and chemiosmoticgradient formation drake et al 2010 in addition m thermoacetica representing the third model homoactogen utilizes h as chemiosmotic couplingion it has cytochrome and quinone which have potential to mediate electron transfer from electron donors including h2 methylene thf and etc drake et al 2010 müller 2003 instead of rnfcomplex energy converting hydrogenase ech complex is viewed as a potential candidate for energy coupling site in the growth of m thermoacetica schüchmann and müller 2014 it is worth noting that alarge energetic barrier related to electron flowfrom h2 to fd existed but all the examined homoacetogens solve this problem via enzymes which are able to catalyze the flavin based electronbifurcation schüchmann and müller 2014 the saob has significantly different energy conserving systems fe fe hydrogenases are the only identified core set which is encoded by all saob genomes fig 3b the genomes of t acetatoxydans s schinkii c ultunese and p lettingae encode an electron bifurcating rnf complex which is also found in other homoacetogens drake et al 2010 kpke et al 2010 poehlein et al 2012 t acetatoxydans has a potentially electron bifurcating fe fe hydrogenase but lacks atpsynthase operon müller et al 2015 the genome of s schinkii harbors an ech hydrogenase and several duplicatesof fe fe hydrogenase manzoor et al 2016a the genome of the thermophilic th phaeum codes for apotentially bifurcating fe fe hydrogenase and ech hydrogenase with lacking rnf complex oehler et al 2012 in addition since th phaeum can use the wl pathway in both oxidative and reductive directions energy conserving enzyme systems in t phaeum were studied inboth metabolic directions it revealed that the periplasmically oriented formate dehydrogenaseand the formate hydrogenlyase complex both representingtwo membrane bound enzyme systems could be the keyfor the reversibility of the wl pathway in t phaeum keller et al 2019 acetate is activated through an atp independent path via aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase aor and subsequent oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetyl coa unlike homoacetogen saob have to share the limited free energy change of δg0 31 kj mol 1 table 1 with hydrogenotrophic methanogen thermodynamically sao hm is exergonic and the energetics in coculture of s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis and mix cultures of c ultunese t acetatoxydans s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis are consistent in these two cultures δg values were about 30 to 40 kj reaction for sao and hm initially respectively and stabilized at 10 kj mol 1 for sao and 20 kj mol 1 for hm westerholm et al 2019 thus methanogens obtain more energy from this partnership than saob which is contrary to previous assumption that coculture of m bourgensis and c ultunense share energy equally during sao hm i e 17 kj mol 1 each schnürer et al 1996 4 roles of homoacetogenesis and sao pathwaysin ad 4 1 relations of homoacetogenesis and sao with methanogenesis methane is generally generated by two pathways hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm and acetoclastic methanogenesis am which metabolizes h2 co2 and acetate to generatech4 respectively in complex systems hm occurs in close coexistence with acetogenesis andtypically contributes to 30 40 of generated ch4 am one of the most sensitive processes to factors in ad typically accounts for to 60 70 of ch4 generation angelidaki and batstone 2010 it is also a highly specialized reaction which is derived by two groups ofmethanogens methanosarcinaceae and methanosaetaceae within the order of methanosarcinales theoverall reaction described in table 1 4 1 1 homoacetogens competing with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in anaerobic methanogenic digester homoacetogensoutcompete with hydrogenotrophicmethanogens for h2 at acidic environment schink 1997 weijma et al 2002 homoacetogens haveh2 threshold concentrations in the range of 350 to 700 nm whereas hydrogenotrophic methanogenshave much lower h2 threshold concentrations in the range of 20 to75 nm cord ruwisch et al 1988 at high ph2 500 pa homoacetogenesis is more favorable than hm demirel and scherer 2008 while hydrogenotrophic methanogenoutcompetes homoacetogen at low h2 concentrations in mesophilic methanogenic environment breznak 1990 in addition the conversion pathways of methanogens have more negative value of gibb s free energy change g0 135 0 kj mol 1 than that of homoacetogens g0 104 6 kj mol 1 and it is clear that species using pathways with more negative gibb sfree energy change have energetic advantage and therefore dominate in the environment cord ruwisch et al 1988 janssen 2010 however other factors than energy output can affect growth of organisms and in line with that homoacetogensoutcompete hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 at low temperature 20 c parkin and owen 1986 grabowski et al 2005 because the latter has lower activity at that low temperature kotsyurbenko et al 2001 it was concluded that the carbon flow through homoacetogenesis increasewith depress of temperature fey and conrad 2000 at temperatures 10 c the most electron flow passes through homoacetogenesis conrad et al 1989 thermodynamic calculations show that homoacetogenesis at 5 cwith ph2 10paand10 mmacetateproduces the same energy as that of hm at 35 c schink 1997 besides anaerobic digesters homoacetogenesis also existed in various natural environments such as hyper saline waters and paddy soils deep subsurface sediments ljungdahl 1983 under these conditions homoacetogens compete with hydrogenotrophicmethanogens for substrate but interact with acetoclasticmethanogens the homoacetogens are more competitive than hydrogenotrophic methanogens because of their diverse metabolic capabilities and ability of switch between autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms dinamarca et al 2011 4 1 2 saob competing with acetoclastic methanogen energetically syntrophic acetate oxidation catalyzed by saob isextremely unfavorable g0 104 6 kj mol 1 however similar to alcohol or fatty acid oxidation this unfavorable reaction can proceed under h2 elimination by h2 consuming methanogenesis g0 135 6 kj mol 1 theoverall reaction of sao hm is exergonicwith the equal stoichiometry as am although this mutualsyntrophy theoretically yields energy the value is quite small g0 31 0kj mol 1 unlike acetoclastic methanogens utilizing yield energy syntrophic acetate oxidizer and partner methanogen share the limited energy because each microbe has its own energy needs for growth hattori 2008 this energetically disadvantage may cause these syntrophsto grow slowerthan acetoclastic methanogens this could also explain acetoclastic methanogenesis as predominant pathway instead of sao hm in highly reduced anaerobic digesters while ad process is vulnerable to inhibition from accumulation of some chemicals among which ammonia is the most significant inhibitor although ammonia is needed for bacterial growth high ammonia levels are inhibiting microbial growth since acetoclastic methanogens are sensitive to high ammonia ammonia can originate from various sources such as urea or can be formed during hydrolysis of proteins contained in the feedstock total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration consistingof free ammonia nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen higher than approx 2 g l 1 can cause the inhibit the anaerobic digestion process chen et al 2008 however much higher ammonia concentrations have been reported to be tolerated 3 g l 1nh4 n which can be due to process adaptation to high ammonia levels the inhibition is more likely resulted by free ammonia in solution chen et al 2008 the performance of anaerobic digester with protein rich residue as substrate might be influenced by accumulation of ammonia and volatile fatty acids vfas the growth activity of acetoclastic methanogens was significantly affected by the high concentrations of these compounds and it was due to that these groups are considered to be more sensitive to ammonia than hydrogenotrophic methanogens koster and lettinga 1984 angelidaki and ahring 1993 this inhibition can be eliminated by enriching of saob in conjunction with specific groups of hydrogenotrophic methanogens it mainly due to that the absence of ammonium transporters in saob such as s schinkii and t acetatoxydans might protect the cells from redundant ammonium influx müller et al 2015 manzoor et al 2016a under high concentrations of ammonia some saob can conduct the homoacetogenic pathway and metabolize acetate to co2and h2 for example thermacetogenium phaeum uses the wl pathway in both directions either for the production of acetate from a variety of compounds or for the oxidation of acetate in syntrophic cooperation with hydrogenotrophic methanogens hattori 2008 keller et al 2019 the bioreaction is thermodynamically favorable as hydrogenotrophic methanogens subsequently utilize the h2 therefore the inhibition of methanogenesis can be eliminated by sao hm process in ad system with nitrogen rich substrate petersen and ahring 1991 thus sao pathway is viewed as an alternative and effective pathway for acetate degradation in ammonium stressed anaerobic system thereby sao provides the ad process capability to response the high concentration of ammonia inhibiting activity foracetoclastic methanogen lee 1988 karakashev et al 2006 researchers have attempted different strategies to alleviate ammonia toxicity such as adding absorbents to bind ammonia dilution of the reactor content to reduce the high ammonia levels bioaugmentation accumulation of ammonia tolerantmicroorganisms such as saob fotidis et al 2013a chen et al 2008 fotidis et al 2013b magnetite addition to promote the rateof ch4 generation through sao hm at high level of ammonia 5 0 g l 1 nh4 n was also conducted with increasing ch4 productionby 36 58 zhuang et al 2018 therefore the strategies of facilitating ch4 generation through sao hm pathway is critical to improve the performance of ad under high levels of ammonia besides high ammonia concentration sao hm pathway also presentshigher ability to tolerate high temperature and acetate concentration compared to acetoclastic methanogenesis sao performs as important pathway in a greatnumber of thermosphilic ad systems sun et al 2014 fotidis et al 2013a petersen and ahring 1991 karakashev et al 2006 lue et al 2013 hao et al 2013 sasaki et al 2011 in theory sao pathway becomes energetically and thermodynamically favorable with the increase oftemperature or acetate concentration dolfing 2014 matthias et al 2010 in fact temperature significantlyaffects the structure ofmicrobial community in ad systems including hydrogenotrophic methanogens gomec et al 2010 jaecheul et al 2019 which in turninfluences the sao inaddition high temperature could result in increase of nh3 tan ratio exceeding the ammonia tolerance of sao hm pathway sao is energeticallyfavorableat high level of acetate 4 mm nozhevnikova et al 2010 hao et al 2011 mulat et al 2014 in some thermophilic anaerobic digestors sao also performed as the dominant acetate metabolization pathway with low concentration of acetate 0 2 1 mm petersen and ahring 1991 ahring 1995 hori et al 2006 previous researchers found that t acetatoxydans is favoredat high level of acetate müller et al 2015 whereas s schinkii and t phaeum potentiallyhaving high capability of acetateuptaking could keep adequate activity even at low level of acetate manzoor et al 2016a compared to the acetate affinity of methanosarcina 0 2 2 5 mm jetten et al 1990 the minimum threshold of acetate for acetate oxidation is 0 40 0 45 mm in coculture of s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis and 0 7 mm in the mix cultures ofc ultunense t acetatoxydans s schinkii and methanoculleus bourgensis westerholm et al 2019 therefore the sao hm pathway had advantages in adaptation of environmental pressures such as high ammonia concentration high temperature and acetate concentration 4 1 3 electron transfer mechanism between saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens thermodynamically the reaction of oxidizing acetate to h2 co2 is unfavorable unless the concentrations of h2 are maintained extremely low via coupling the acetate oxidationwith an h2 utilizing reaction sieber et al 2018 thus sao involves the interspecies h2 transfer between saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogen whichmaintains a low level of ph2 10 5 atm stams and plugge 2009 in addition previous study established two coculture systems of saob thermacetogenium phaeum strain pb with a formate h2 utilizing methanogen and an h2 utilizing methanogen respectively both h2 and formate closely related to the sao bythermodynamic calculation the former coculture generated two times faster than the later one and kept four times lower levelsof ph2 and formate concentration indicating that h2 as well as formate may be served as interspecies electron carriers fig 4 hattori et al 2000 direct interspecies electron transfer diet refers to a mechanism of electron transfer via the generation of electric current between electron donating and electron accepting microorganism without the involvement of electron carriers such as formate and h2 in recent years diet utilizing cytochrome conductive pili and conductive materials had been proved to be an effective way to promote methane production baek et al 2018 martins et al 2018 wu et al 2020 potential diet pathway might occur in sao process as magnetiteadded in methanogenic environment fig 4 the bacteria geobacteraceae and archaeamethanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae mightbe involved in the diet mediated by magnetite for sao hm zhuang et al 2018 diet pathway also occurred between electroactive thermacetogenium and methanogens pan et al 2017 thermacetogenium was also served as an active microbe in an anode biofilm of microbial electrolysis cell khongkliang et al 2017 single walled carbon nanotubecan form current between methanogens and electroactive saob a more efficient diet instead of h2 transfer could promote growth of electrically active saob such as t phaeum shen et al 2020 in summary homoacetogens compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 whereas saob compete with acetoclastic methanogens for acetate theoretically these two processes are not impossible exist at the same timein anaerobic systems but they could change their abundance and roles with variation of environmental factors such as temperature ammonia concentration acetate concentrations and etc to further regulate the anaerobic system through producing and consuming acetate fotidis et al 2013a fotidis et al 2013b chen et al 2018 4 2 roles of homoacetogenesis and sao in acidogenesis 4 2 1 roles of homoacetogenesis inacidogenesis sugars and amino acids are decomposed to vfas alcohols h2 and co2 during the process of acidogenesis anaerobic acidogenesis is considered as a promising process for treating organic wastes and obtaining added value products studies focusing on fermentation mainly consist of acetate production biohydrogen production and serving as the first step of anaerobic methane production all these processes have close relations with homoacetogenesis acetate production acetate is considered as raw material forplastic film food preservative and deicing chemical cheryan et al 1997 acetate has higher value than methane the production of acetate accompanied with the degradation of organic wastes can synchronously obtain economic and environmental benefits glucose acidogenesis and homoacetogenesiswere coupled for acetate production ni et al 2011 enhancement of homoacetogenesis in this system could improve the yield of acetate previous study focusing on acidogenesis homoacetogenesis two phase coupling system found that the initial ph affects the production of vfas and ethanol production in these two phases and ph value of 8 is optimal for acetate generation nie et al 2007 yan et al 2014 also found thatph control is an effective approach to reach active homoacetogens in acidogenic system in glucose fermentation system the homoacetogenacetobacterium woodiiwas introduced to acidogenic reactor for producing acetate and acetate contributed to more than 90 of the total soluble product yan et al 2014 isolation of novel and effective homoacetogen has become a research hotpot in recent years clostridium sp bxx a new species of genera clostridium grows on h2 co2 syngas glucose 1 2 propanediol sodium formate 2 methoxyethanoland glycerol and cannot grow on co pyruvate or lactate strain bxx growsautotrophically to produce acetate and grows heterotrophically to produce ethanol strain bxx is an excellent strain resource for acetate fermentation and has good potential of industrialapplication zhu et al 2018 blautia sp ca3 isolated from anaerobic activated sludge also utilize h2 co2 and glucose to produce acetate with the optimum temperature of 35 c and ph value of 8 0 with acetate production rate of 8 92 mg l 1 h 1 and acetate concentration of 1370mgl 1 respectively li et al 2013 blautia coccoides ga 1 utilizing h2 co2 as substrate yields acetate of 5 32 g g 1 dry cell weight after cultivation for 10 days autotrophic metabolism is suppressed by the introduction of glucose as higher concentration of glucose will lead to the reduction of activity of autotrophic cultures liu et al 2015 isolation of high efficient homoacetogen and physiological biochemical characterization are required for industrialized acetate production h2 production biohydrogen production through dark fermentation has been widely research during the last two decades h2 produced during the ad process is fast consumed through methanogenesis andhomoacetogenesis dinamarca and bakke 2009 saady 2013 the h2 utilizing reactions including hm and homoacetogenesis are more energetic favorable than acetogenic reactions g0 4 2 76 2 kj mol 1 at high level of h2 saady 2013 for anaerobicfermentative h2 production the h2 consuming reactions such as homoacetogenesis have to be blocked for making h2 accumulation possible ni et al 2011 strategies were applied to restrain h2 utilizing reaction such as ph regulation inoculum pretreatment olr shock control ofph2and hydraulic retention time hrt shanmugam et al 2014 liu et al 2010 bakonyi et al 2014 si et al 2015 different approaches of inoculum pretreatments including acidification heating loading shock were applied for inhibiting hydrogenotrophic methanogen andhomoacetogen while the results were unexpected some species of clostridium such as clostridiumljungdahlii clostridium aceticum and clostridium scatologenes are heat resistant homoacetogens saady 2013 it is found that h2 production depends on the fermentation temperature and ph value the activity of homoacetogens can be suppressed in thermophilic environment at initial ph of 5 5 however all the approachesfailed to eliminate either hm or homoacetogenesiswith long term operating luo et al 2015 homoacetogens with a high tolerance to ph change survived in system of h2 fermentation the strategy of ph regulation was found to be more effective in shifting fermentation pathway instead of inhibitingh2 consumption kim et al 2004 shortening hrt was considered as an effective strategy viaenhancing h2 yield and domesticatingfunctional populations such asclostridium spp and thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccarolyticum liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 regulating hrt can control homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis it was reported that homoacetogenesis was dramatically inhibited with hrt decreasing to 8 and 4 h respectively si et al 2015 methane production performance of anaerobic digesters with methane as main product could also be improved by strengthening homoacetogenesis acetate is easier to degrade compared to propionate and butyrate converting glucose to acetate by homoacetogens could reduce the carbon flow to more reduced products wohlfarth 1994 more carbon sinking into acetate would improve stability of the ad process and the produced acetate if not further degraded could be utilized as chemical solvent as well as providing methanogenic precursor for acetoclastic methanogenesis in addition the bioreactions of acetogenesisare h2 producing process a low level of h2 is required to maintain the reactions to be thermodynamically feasible thus h2 utilizing organisms are essential to sustain the overall activity of anaerobic microbes during ad enhancing homoacetogenesis in acidogenic reactors will promote the h2 consumption in acidogenic phase to maintain subsequent acidogenesis athigh efficiency and further improve system sustainability therefore enrichment of homoacetogensis an effective approach for solving the problems ofh2 inhibition 4 2 2 roles of sao in acidogenesis unlike homoacetogens saob cannot catalyze acetate oxidation to form hydrogen without hydrogenotrophic methanogen consuming h2 therefore in ad system for biohydrogen and acetate as added value products sao hm should be inhibited in anaerobic methanogenic system for fermenting protein rich substrate acetoclastic methanogens might be inhibited by high concentration of ammonia and sao hm pathway could degrade acetate produced from fermentation acidogenesis to avoid the acetate accumulation petersen and ahring 1991 enhancing sao hm pathway is an alternative and effective method for treating protein rich waste water 4 3 roles of homoacetogenesis and sao in acetogenesis acetogenesis is viewed as a rate limiting process since its thermodynamic constraint and studies about acetogenesis has a long story drake et al 2010 the vfas and alcohol generated from acidogenesis aredegraded to acetate by obligate h2 producing acetogens electron generated from thebioreaction is wasted for h2 production the free energy of reaction for fatty acid oxidation is positive at standard conditions and therefore low ph2 is needed to achieve a negative free energy and thereby yield energy for anabolism h2consuming methanogen which convert h2 and co2 to ch4 helps in a balanced biomass to keep at low level of ph2 however both h2 producers acetogens and h2 consumers methanogens can only favor at narrow band of h2 concentration h2 is the most important endproduct with respect to determining the free energyof the reaction since more h2 is produced stoichiometrically than other products as the end product acetate is also important but it is stoichiometrically produced at lower level because of the critical level of h2 concentration h2 transfer between h2 producers and h2 consumers isimportant and most likely they live in syntrophic consortia because they have no alternative pathwaysapart from direct oxidation of the organic acids fatty acid oxidizing organisms may be referred to as having a linearmetabolism homoacetogens could serve as h2 consuming bacteria cooperating with fatty acids oxidizing bacteria the mixed cultures inad system coupled syntrophic acetogens with homoacetogens can promoteacetate formation from high strength organic wastewater nie et al 2007 nie et al 2008 nie et al 2009 acetate generation through homoacetogenesispromoted by 40 in a fed batchfermentation system which resulted from a balance between the h2 generation at acetogenic stage and h2utilization at homoacetogenic stage ni et al 2011 homoacetogenesis performed as an available pathway for h2 sinkduring syntrophic butyrate oxidation in the thermophilic ad system inhibited methanogenic process ni et al 2011 it also found that homoacetogen was more possible existed in common anaerobic condition the dissolved h2 and ph2 were clearly decreased in an ad system coupled syntrophic acetogenesis with homoacetogenesis more than 5 of produced acetate was attributed to homoacetogenesis and the value can reach up to 33 in theory nie et al 2007 acetate production was also enhanced in an acetogenesis and homoacetogenesiscoupling system by using the strategies of gas circulation and fed batch fermentation nie et al 2008 syntrophic co culture of a homoacetogen acetobacterium woodii and common acetogens was established for producing acetate during glucose fermentation h2 production decreased and acetate dominated 90 in total soluble products nie et al 2008 however it is still unclear for effect of factors on acetateproduction via homoacetogenesis saob can be viewed as syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing bacteria and cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogen in sao hm dominant systems syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing bacteria require saob to utilize acetate and hydrogenotrophic methanogensto consume h2 formate in that way a triple syntrophic association consisting of syntrophic fatty acids oxidizing bacteria saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens would be formed in summary homoacetogenesis and sao pathways regulate the ad through producing acetate and consuming acetate competing or cooperating with methanogens cooperating with acidogenesis and syntrophy with fatty acids oxidizing bacteria the interactions between these functional microbes are quite complex but the complex conversions and interactions maintain the sustainability of anaerobic digestors offers flexibility to overcome stress under different environment disturbances such as low or high temperature high ammonia and acetate or vfas 5 outlook and future perspectives 5 1 detection and isolation of novel saob and homoacetogen some new saob strains were isolated recently and theircharacteristics of physiology and genetics were deeply investigated however there is little knowledge on their diversity abundance and roles of saob in ad system westerholm et al 2016 the predominant methanogens shifted from the obligate acetotroph methanosaetato the hydrogenotrophic methanoculleus with the increase of ammonia while acetate degradation still occurred it clearly pointed the existenceand importance of sao pathway while only few saob have been isolated and characterized ruiz sanchez et al 2019 known saob also showed lowrelative abundance in all reactors under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions for saob enrichment most functional biodiversity of saoprocess still remains unknown and needs further exploration in addition recent research also found that thermophilic microorganisms significantly switched their acetate biodegradation from sao hm functioned by methanobacteriales spp and or methanomicrobiales spp to am functioned by methanosarcinaceae spp after adaption to high levels of acetate and ammonia on the contrary there is no shift in pathway under mesophilic after acclimatization westerholm et al 2018 therefore the sustainability of sao hm pathway and its influence factors also require further investigation moreover new and efficienthomoacetogen isolation and construction also require more efforts 5 2 a suggested novel anaerobic system and analysis of mechanisms fermentationisviewedasa process for added value products generation while the release of co2reduces thecarbonconversion efficiency from organic matters to reachthe highest carbon conversion efficiency to added value products an effective fermentation system with homoacetogens serving as dominant bacteria can be effective for co2 reuse moreover saob have advantage in tolerating high ammonia concentrations in anaerobic systems considering the inhibition from high ammonia concentration in industrial anaerobic process anovel two phases anaerobic reactor can be proposed to treat protein rich waste water during anaerobic industrial methane production fig 5 the first phase is fermentation phase with the acidogens and homoacetogens as predominant groups for reaching a high production of acetate and second phase is a mixed culture system of syntrophic fatty acids degrading bacteria thus carbon source flows to acetate in a large proportion at first stage could reduce the pressure of follow up syntrophic bacteria for the second phase compared to acetoclastic methanogenesis dominant system sao hm dominated system has higher ammonia resistance this system can be also applied for treating sulfate rich wastewater through enriching srb in second phase and coupling with saob srb and syntrophic fatty acids degrading bacteria srb to date only three acetogens strain aor s schinkii and t phaeum are known to operate the oxidative wl pathway for syntrophic acetate oxidation although other acetogens e g m thermoacetica and a woodii harbor thereductive wl pathway it has not been reportedwhether they can operate it in the oxidative direction forsao it was reported thatstrain aor andth phaeumcould act as homoacetogenic bacteria to generate acetate from h2 co2 lee 1988 hattori et al 2005 manzoor et al 2018 it still requires further study to reveal whether other saob own similar functions as homoacetogens in addition another research topic is how to reach the maximum productsyields for e g acetate and h2 via optimizing and regulating metabolic pathways via molecular technology such as proteomics and metabolomics and the genetic tools stable genome insertion or deletion precise genetic manipulation transposon mutagenesis and gene editing of pure microbial cultures by crispr cas9 in addition the potential application of saob under conditions other than high temperature and ammonia concentration is also important research issue needing further development 5 3 how redox mediators regulating sao hm and homoacetogenesis nano iron materials and biochar could sever as electron transfer intermediate to accelerate the electron transfer from electron donor to electron acceptor by the cyclic transformation of oxidation and reduction states some recent studies proved that nano magnetite materials could enhance direct electron transfer in sao hm dominated systems zhuang et al 2018 and single walled carbon nanotubes could establish the current between the electroactive saob and methanogen shen et al 2020 but the mechanism of these materials on the atp yields biomass changes or functional saob shifts are still unknown in addition how these mediators regulate homoacetogenesis also requires further study 6 conclusion the production and consumption of acetate occurs in the whole process of ad the roles of sao hm and homoacetogenesis in ad process have been studied in different anaerobic environments the process of sao hm replaced acetoclastic methanogenesis in some specific environments with high temperature and high ammonia acetate concentrations with inhibition of activity of acetoclastic methanogens homoacetogenesis is more competitive than hm under acidic alkaline and low temperature 10 c 20 c conditions and the importance of homoacetogenesis had been proved when analyzing anaerobic fermentations the energetically disadvantage of sao requires saob to cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in methanogenic phase and degrade acetate via oxidative wl pathway besides h2 utilizing methanogens hydrogenotrophic srb also can also reach syntrophy with saob while homoacetogens prefer to occur in acidogenic phase and generate acetate by reductive wl pathway therefore how to play their best strengths in ad process is a promising topic a novel two phases anaerobic digester for treating protein rich waste water was proposed in which homoacetogenesis domains in acidogenesis phase and produces adequate acetate to supply for saob in methanogenic phase declaration of competing

17313,salt removal from seawater wastewater using flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is of particular interest but scale up desalination is limited by low water production high energy consumption and complex cell configuration in this study an innovative fcdi system is described that uses integrated desalination modules equipped with membrane current collector mcc assembly and thereby named as mcc fcdi system a single desalination module design provides an average salt removal rate asrr 0 3 0 44 µmol cm2 min close to that of the classic fcdi system with a graphite current collector design but the design requires a much lower infrastructure investment device size and energy cost more importantly our design enables simultaneous operation of multiple modules in the shared flow electrode tank easily realizing scale up desalination evidence is provided by the results of the multi module operation multi modules isolated closed cycle micc and multi modules short circuited closed cycle mscc for instance the micc configuration showing nearly twice the desalination performance over 50 h of operation compared to that of the single icc operation the results indicated that in addition to making the device suitable for practical application the ti mesh mcc with a woven network enables the flow electrode to achieve substantial ion adsorption capacity due to the efficient update of fresh carbon particles in short the results of this study showed that mcc fcdi is a promising desalination system for scale up applications providing a new reference and guidance for device design graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization membrane current collector scale up desalination titanium mesh operation mode 1 introduction fresh water production from either seawater or wastewater is one emergency process to address global water deficiency cho et al 2019 tan et al 2018 flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi using flowable carbon particles generally prepared by commercial activated carbon ac powder offers fundamental advantages over most electrochemical technologies because the devices can be continuously operated without sacrificing adsorption capacity yang et al 2016 a common example is the short circuited closed cycle scc operation which enables continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes by the mixing of positively and negatively charged carbon particles outside the fcdi cell without an additional discharging process ma et al 2020 yang et al 2019 in a common fcdi configuration fig 1 a which was developed on the basis of jeon s work jeon et al 2013 the carbon suspension can be recirculated between the anode cathode chambers and the external reservoirs at the surface of the current collector a winding flow electrode channel is carved to prevent the carbon flow electrode from becoming blocked however the complex device configuration and large channel depth d 1 3 mm fig 1c require additional infrastructure investment and energy costs to support flow electrode recirculation and ionic separation porada et al 2014 wang et al 2016 because the pumping energy 15 contributes a large proportion to the total energy consumption fang et al 2018 hatzell et al 2015 c zhang et al 2020 moreover the supported flow channel inevitably limits the utilization of ion exchange membranes iems resulting in an increase in material cost and device size note that the utilization rate in ordinary fcdi systems only reaches 13 54 compared to that of tiny scale fcdi cells fig 1d currently only a few studies have presented fcdi designs developed for scale up desalination including membrane stack configuration ma et al 2020 yang et al 2016 membrane electrode assembly linnartz et al 2020 and honeycomb shaped configuration cho et al 2017 choo et al 2019 but the requirements of these approaches are limited by the relatively expensive components and complex configuration in this study we present an alternative fcdi design that uses integrated desalination modules equipped with membrane current collector mcc configuration exploiting commercial titanium mesh as current collectors fig 1b yang et al 2019 to differentiate from traditional fcdi system mcc based fcdi system was named as mcc fcdi because of the unique structure of the ti mesh mcc which provides a large number of carbon contact sites for ionic adsorption but allows carbon particles to easily pass through the current collector mcc has the potential to overcome the trade off between electron transport and adsorption capacity in long term operation moreover by enlarging the flow electrode chambers the use of the flow channel structure and external carbon recirculation components can be avoided thus less pumping energy is required to maintain the dispersion of carbon particles and the utilization of the membrane area can be increased the results of this study demonstrated that mcc fcdi exhibited a salt removal performance similar to that of the classic p fcdi i e the fcdi system equip with post current collector system but showed a lower energy requirement for carbon particle driven and ionic separation to examine the potential of using a network current collector for salt removal the salt removal performance at different thicknesses and mesh densities of the current collector was investigated evidence for the potential scale up application of mcc fcdi in long term operation is provided by the results with the multiple working module configuration therefore it is conceivable that our design greatly improves the simplification of the fcdi system in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup an innovative mcc assembly was used in all experiments fig 1b and fig s1 in brief the fcdi cell is consists of a large volume of carbon slurry reservoir 210 mm 110 mm 100 mm and an integrated desalination module in the working module fig s2 a spacer chamber thickness of 0 5 mm a pair of ion exchange membranes aem hom 1201 cem hom 0011t lvhe china and two ti mesh current collectors purity 99 6 50 mm 50 mm 0 15 mm hongyun china were bolted together with two hollow acrylic end plates in the spacer chamber a 100 mesh nylon sheet 50 mm 50 mm 0 5 mm was sandwiched between the anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem to uniformly distribute the feed stream the desalination module could be vertically inserted into the middle of the reservoir to isolate the anode chamber and cathode chambers fig 1b as shown in fig s1 there is a slot in the middle of the reservoir to ensure that the flow electrode on both sides of the module can be completely isolated alternatively the use of glass sealant is also an optional method at the laboratory scale before each experiment the sealing test was performed the effective contact area a between the flow electrode and each membrane was 25 cm2 2 2 operating conditions in each experimental test synthetic salt water containing 500 mg l nacl analytical reagent shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co with an initial ph phi of 6 5 0 1 was continuously pumped into the spacer chamber in a single pass mode by a peristaltic pump bt100 2j longer china although ac has been demonstrated as promising electrode material because of the high theoretical volumetric capacity the ac based flow electrode is not a good electrical conductor compared to the fixed electrode in the cdi and mcdi systems k tang et al 2019 adding a small amount of carbon black cb to the flow electrode generally at a mass fraction of 10 in the total carbon can significantly reduce the internal resistance of the fcdi cell and thus enhance the charge transfer efficiency liang et al 2017 for an example the flow electrodes with 5 wt carbon content i e ac cb 1 9 were prepared by mixing 4 5 wt ac powder yec 8a yihuan china 0 5 wt cb powder bp2000 cabot american and 95 wt 18 2 mω milli q water millipore america the detailed information of carbon materials is showed in table s2 in supporting information approximately 500 mg l nacl was then added into the carbon suspension as the supporting electrolyte and the initial ph was controlled at 6 5 0 1 note that the carbon suspensions were continuously stirred on a magnetic stirrer for at least 48 h prior to the experiments unless otherwise stated mcc fcdi system was operated in isolated closed cycle icc mode with each flow electrode chamber containing an equal amount of carbon suspension 750 ml and continuously stirred at a constant rotation speed of 500 rpm initially the spacer chamber was fully flushed using the feed water until the effluent conductivity was close to the salt water conductivity to investigate the electrochemical adsorption and regeneration performance of the fcdi cell continuous 11 cycles of charging discharging processes were carried out within 1100 min to obtain the optimal operating parameters of mcc fcdi the effects of operational parameters such as the carbon content 0 0 1 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 wt cell voltage 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 v and flow rate 0 51 1 02 2 03 and 3 05 ml min of the feed stream were investigated specifically cell voltage ranges from 0 3 to 1 7 v and system current ranges from 3 0 to 17 0 ma were tested in the cv and constant current cc mode respectively moreover the thickness δ and mesh density φ of the current collector were also investigated to provide some practical guidance toward the design of current collectors finally continuous operation over 50 h was evaluated in the new icc and scc modes using multiple working modules the analytical methods and calculations are presented in text s1 in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 integrated design of the desalination module as shown in fig 1b network current collectors composed of ti mesh with an oxide layer were used as an experimental case to evaluate the desalination performance of mcc fcdi the integrated desalination module is separated from the flow electrode chamber by simply bolting the current collectors iems and spacer chamber together mcc assembly allows efficient electron transfer between ions carbon particles and current collectors because of the minimum ion migration distance between the spacer chamber and the electrode chambers the ti mesh used in this work i e 100 mesh type has a mesh size of 150 150 µm and a thickness of 0 15 mm thus ac particles with a size range of 5 10 µm fig s4 can readily cross the network of the current collector under continuous stirring effectively maintaining the adsorption capacity of the flow electrodes in the desalination process the ions passed through the iems will be immediately adsorbed by the carbon particles attached to the current collector thereby improving the desalination performance of mcc fcdi regarding to the operation mode of mcc fcdi system multiple desalination modules can be inserted into the reservoir to realize high water productivity in section 3 4 we demonstrated the technical implementation feasibility using multiple module at different operating modes to differentiate from traditional fcdi system with a narrow flow electrode chambers fig 1a the flow electrode chambers of mcc fcdi system were expanded to 100 mm exhibiting the flexible controllability of the fcdi cell in practical application nevertheless the thickness and or volume of the flow electrode chambers can be designed based on the requirement in view of the energy consumption for mcc fcdi the pumping energy consumption for driving salt water can be ignored due to the extremely low flow rate of the feed stream zhang et al 2020 besides the energy consumption required for homogenizing the flow electrode solution is also not considered in this study due to the volume of flow electrode used in the practical application will be much smaller than that in this study therefore the desalination performance and electrical energy consumption eec of mcc fcdi system for salt water separation were specifically evaluated 3 2 optimization of mcc fcdi system for salt removal 3 2 1 charging and discharging performance of mcc fcdi system fig 2 a shows the salt water separation performance of mcc fcdi system operated at continuous 1100 min charging discharging process after cycling for 11 cycles the adsorption and desorption performance was remarkably well maintained since the test was carried out at a fixed salt water volume the effluent conductivity was obviously decreased with charging time increased and the conductivity was increased to the initial level after the same time of discharging process owing to the increase of internal resistance in the spacer chamber a decrease in current with a decrease in salt concentration was observed in each charging step in term of the adsorption and desorption processes no difference can be observed between mcc fcdi system and the conventional cdi based process i e mcdi and fcdi with pcc configuration liu et al 2017 ma et al 2016 tang et al 2017 tang et al 2019 therefore it is expected that mcc assembly is likely to be an alternative to conventional fcdi system 3 2 2 significance of the carbon content as shown in fig 2c the salt removal performance at 0 wt carbon was negligible because few surface sites were available for ion adsorption on the ti mesh current collector xu et al 2021 ma et al 2018 meanwhile the current signal was below the detection limit fig s5 suggesting that no faradaic reaction was occurred at the electrolyte current collector interface thus the removal of salt in the presence of different carbon contents can be largely considered as capacitive adsorption of course the electrodialysis contribution is inevitable in mcc fcdi system due to the accumulation of ions in the electrolyte ma et al 2018 surprisingly 0 1 wt carbon content achieved a high asrr of 0 11 µmol cm2 min at a stable current of 5 7 ma fig 2d this result is significantly better than the findings of previous study obtained at a lower carbon content zhang et al 2020 indicating the superiority of mcc assembly for electron transfer at a low carbon contents yang et al 2019 it was observed that the asrr increased with a further increase in carbon loading and reached 0 23 µmol cm2 min at 10 wt carbon possibly owing to the formation of a charge percolation network and the efficient refreshing of carbon particles at the current collector surface cai et al 2020 yang et al 2019 moreover a charge efficiency as high as 90 4 and an optimal eec of 0 61 kwh kg nacl were obtained owing to the increase of viscosity with increasing the carbon content hatzell et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the default rotate speed was hardly to keep the flow electrode well mixed in the course of our experiment additional disturbance was required at 10 wt carbon content thus 5 wt carbon content was used in the following experiments unless otherwise stated 3 2 3 performance of mcc fcdi operated at cc and cv modes figs 3 a and 3b show a significant increase in conductivity removal and ionic current with increasing cell voltages from 0 3 to 1 5 v leading to an asrr increase from 0 07 to 0 23 µmol cm2 min fig 3c correspondingly the eec increased from 0 15 to 1 02 kwh kg nacl accompanied by an obvious decrease in ce it can be observed that an excessive high cell voltage u 1 2 v resulted in a drop in ce owing to the enhancement of faradaic reactions e g water splitting and carbon oxidation at the current collector surface hatzell et al 2015 ma et al 2018 to obtain a better understanding of the desalination performance of mcc fcdi a comparison between icc and scc configurations fig s6 with different cc and cv operations was performed using single desalination module in consideration of the flexible controllability of the fcdi cell fig s1 the scc mode was built via a direct hybrid manner in the fcdi cell fig s7b as shown in fig s7 all four operation modes i e icc cv icc cc scc cv and scc cc exhibited a similar eec to achieve less than 50 salt removal however each eec gradually deteriorated as the applied cell voltage increased above 1 2 v the energy consumption for different operation modes from low to high was icc cv icc cc scc cc scc cv for instance in reducing the effluent conductivity below 350 µs cm the scc cv mode required a more than 2 fold higher eec than that of the icc cv mode for further clarification the variation in ce with different operation modes was evaluated fig 3d it was previously demonstrated that the scc mode enables continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes as a result of the charge neutralization of the positively or negatively charged carbon particles he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in the scc mode however we found that ce lineally decreased r2 0 9488 with higher asrrs from 0 12 to 0 26 µmol cm2 min this result can be ascribed to the invalid charge utilization at high voltages ma et al 2019 xu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 detailly additional charge was lost through external carbon slurry in the integrated flow electrode chamber i e short circuiting effect fig s8a as shown in fig s8b the short circuit current of mcc fcdi system was obviously increased with the conductivity of the flow electrode electrolyte increase thus additional charge efficiency drop was observed with cell voltage increase in comparison a higher ce was obtained in icc mode due to the completely isolation of the anode and cathode flow electrode chambers 3 2 4 effects of the flow rate fig 4 shows that the asrr ce and eec were closely related to the flow rates we found that a higher f 0 51 3 05 ml min led to a higher asrr 0 14 0 30 µmol cm2 min although a lower salt removal efficiency was obtained owing to increased ionic conductivity in the spacer chamber indeed the increased f favored the ion replenishment of the salt solution providing a lower resistance for ionic migration he et al 2018 for example at f 3 05 ml min more than 90 ce was achieved and the corresponding eec was 0 61 kwh kg nacl under a limited scale of fcdi cell the water productivity is normally opposite to the salt removal efficiency even if the salt removal rate increases with improving the flow rates of salt water luo et al 2020 tedesco et al 2015 xu et al 2020 thus increasing the number of working modules in an integrated fcdi system is an alternative to improve the productivity and quality of dilute water 3 2 4 comparison with previous studies the results fig 1e indicated that mcc fcdi system can provide desalination performance compared similar to that of the reported work performed in p fcdi systems luo et al 2020 junjun ma et al 2020 ma et al 2018 ma et al 2020 yang et al 2019 with an initial concentration of 1000 mg l nacl achieving an asrr of 0 44 µmol cm2 min recently yang et al 2019 reported similar results in addition to the energy requires for deionization without considering pumping energy the eec of mcc fcdi system is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of p fcdi systems gendel et al 2014 ma et al 2020 ma et al 2019 c zhang et al 2020 suggesting an economic advantage for scale up desalination these results can be attributed to the narrowed ionic migration distance between the iems and current collectors linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 therefore mcc fcdi system achieves a reduction in energy consumption for pumping and ionic separation while maintaining high desalination performance moreover increasing the size of fcdi system can be easily accomplished by increasing the effective area of spacer chamber whereas the planar dimension in most of fcdi cells was limited to centimeter level luo et al 2020 tedesco et al 2015 xu et al 2020 thus the water productivity of the fcdi with single desalination unit was limited generally around 1ml min table s3 in addition the requirement of water quality also greatly limits the improvement of desalination scale thus it is necessary to increase the water productivity by simply adjusting the structure of the fcdi cell in this study mcc fcdi system has the great potential to scale up for desalination compared with other technologies designed based on the pcc configuration in section 3 4 the enhancement of water production through multi module parallel configuration was specifically introduced 3 3 configuration design of the membrane current collector compared to the commonly used graphite plate current collectors ma et al 2018 tang et al 2019 mcc requires additional design in terms of the structure and material but few studies have addressed this topic yang et al 2019 commercial ti mesh has a very thin thickness and adjustable woven network fig s9 which allows fresh carbon particles 10 µm to pass through the micron network to maintain the high adsorption capacity of the flow electrodes fig s10a thus as δ increased from 0 15 to 0 3 mm the asrr was increased from 0 22 to 0 28 µmol cm2 min fig 5 however the further stacking of the ti mesh resulted in a decrease in the asrr because the exchange process both entry and release processes of carbon particles between the iems and current collectors was impeded by the narrow and deep channel thus as shown in fig 5 δ of 0 30 mm provided the highest asrr of 0 30 µmol cm2 min when a high φ current collector is used it is foreseeable that the increase in δ will result in deteriorated desalination performance in addition the increased φ of the mesh type favored salt removal for example the asrr increased from 0 205 to 0 27 µmol cm2 min with increasing φ from 50 to 600 mesh when φ increased from 50 to 100 mesh δ 0 15 mm the improved salt removal performance in mcc fcdi system was mainly ascribed to the increase of mesh density to provide more carbon contact sites for ions adsorption while φ increased from 300 to 600 mesh the increase of asrr probably benefited by the increase in thickness and mesh density it should be noted that the δ of commercial ti mesh increased to 0 60 and 0 30 mm for 300 and 600 mesh respectively under the same thickness δ 0 30 mm of ti mesh it was observed that the further increase of mesh density from 100 to 600 mesh caused an obvious decrease in the asrr this also indicates that the narrow channel impeded the migration of ac particles fig s10b therefore the network structure of mcc should be carefully designed to ensure the effective capacity of the flow electrodes 3 4 continuous operation of mcc fcdi system using multiple desalination modules in the present study two new operating modes were investigated multi modules isolated closed cycle micc and multi modules short circuited closed cycle mscc in consideration of the features of the fcdi cell the mscc mode was performed at a new configuration that is entirely different form the scc mode described in section 3 2 2 as shown in figs 6 a and 6b arranging multiple desalination modules in parallel in the shared flow electrode tank can easily enlarge the desalination scale the function of the isolated flow electrode chambers can be designed by adjusting the arrangement of adjacent modules when the current collectors on both sides of the flow electrode chamber have the same polarity e g both as anode electrodes mcc fcdi system operates in micc mode fig 6a in contrast the fcdi system operates in mscc mode fig 6b as shown in figs 6c and 6d the icc with one module and micc modes showed stable salt removal efficiency charge efficiency and current over 50 h of operation in particular the current 17 ma of the micc operation was nearly double that of the icc operation accompanied by a total charge efficiency of 75 suggesting the potential of mcc fcdi for scale up desalination moreover a higher ph value in the cathode chamber of micc mode fig 6g was achieved due to the twice the accumulation of na ions in the flow electrode chamber compared to that with the icc mode fig 6f as a technical implementation the present work only showed the result of cathode chamber it is beyond doubt that the dual anode chamber configuration enables proton accumulation moreover micc configuration is also expected to solve the concentration increasing and ph change in the flow electrode chambers by alternating charging and discharging modules fig s12a to realizing continuous operation of fcdi technology in icc mode the cell voltage e g 1 2 v should be supplied by another power supply for the discharging module alternatively it is also possible to recovery the energy stored in the electrical double layer edl of the flow electrodes by the discharging module rommerskirchen et al 2018 in addition the mscc mode was operated by arranging each desalination module according to the same polarity fig 6b in which each flow electrode chamber was used as the neutralization chamber compared to the micc mode the mscc mode exhibited a gradually deteriorated desalination performance fig 6e with the removal efficiency decreasing from 78 to below 50 as the charging time increased from 400 to 3000 min meanwhile the current continuously decreased to 20 ma in a classic scc operation the positively or negatively charged carbon particles can be neutralized instantly in the flow electrode chamber he et al 2018 leading to continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes although a neutral ph environment was maintained in the mscc process fig 6h the flow electrode sandwiched between two adjacent desalination modules will cause additional current consumption i e short circuiting effect especially with the increase in ionic conductivity in the electrolytes fig s8 in the single pass mode of the feed stream the ionic conductivity of the spacer chamber can be considered constant as a result the resistance of the flow electrode chamber i e r 1 accounted for higher and higher proportion of the total current fig s11 with the accumulation of salt in the flow electrode chamber in the shared flow electrode chamber of the mscc mcc fcdi system moreover the current collectors on both sides are connected to positive and negative terminals of the same dc power supply thus an inner cdi like unit was created fig 6b and resulted in a decrease in the adsorption capacity of the carbon flow electrode as shown in fig s12b the adverse effect of single power supply operation on the desalination performance of mcc fcdi is expected to be eliminated by using independent power supplies even if the number of desalination modules continues to increase a maximum of two power supplies can realize the system up and running 4 conclusions in a conventional p fcdi system the flow electrode is driven by peristaltic pumps to achieve continuous circulation of carbon particles between the external reservoirs and fcdi cell resulting in a complex device configuration and additional energy consumption in this study an innovative mcc fcdi system equipped with independent desalination modules was proposed realizing the simplification and integration of the fcdi system the key to the development of fcdi cell is the innovative design of the current collector i e mcc configuration the results of this study demonstrated that the energy requirement for salt removal were greatly reduced while high desalination performance was maintained with mcc fcdi compared with p fcdi more importantly evidence for the feasible scale up desalination of mcc fcdi system is provided by the results of continuous multi module operation according to our experimental results mcc is required to have large carbon contact surface sites high electrical conductivity smooth carbon particle transport channels and certain mechanical properties for a ti mesh current collector with a network structure it is necessary to control the thickness and mesh density to improve the effective adsorption capacity in order to ensure stability in the desalination process it should also be noted that the ti mesh itself has very good flexibility which can make the configuration of fcdi reactors more diverse such as the development of a roll desalination module which is very attractive to address various practical processing scenarios in addition the results of multiple modules operations indicated that the micc mode is easy to expand and apply in continuous charging operations for improving the water productivity stack fcdi cell designed based on mcc configuration is also attractive several current collector materials such as carbon textiles and metal mesh as cathode electrode are alternative since the thin thickness and penetrable structure for charge transfer and ion migration recently linnartz et al 2020 also demonstrated that the membrane current collector configuration achieves salt removal rates comparable to the fcdi system obtained with the two graphite current collector setups even if the available surface of carbon fiber for charge transfer is much smaller than the graphite plate this phenomenon is what the future research needs to focus on in short mcc fcdi presents a promising technical implementation approach for scale up applications providing a new perspective for electrochemical desalination technologies

17313,salt removal from seawater wastewater using flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is of particular interest but scale up desalination is limited by low water production high energy consumption and complex cell configuration in this study an innovative fcdi system is described that uses integrated desalination modules equipped with membrane current collector mcc assembly and thereby named as mcc fcdi system a single desalination module design provides an average salt removal rate asrr 0 3 0 44 µmol cm2 min close to that of the classic fcdi system with a graphite current collector design but the design requires a much lower infrastructure investment device size and energy cost more importantly our design enables simultaneous operation of multiple modules in the shared flow electrode tank easily realizing scale up desalination evidence is provided by the results of the multi module operation multi modules isolated closed cycle micc and multi modules short circuited closed cycle mscc for instance the micc configuration showing nearly twice the desalination performance over 50 h of operation compared to that of the single icc operation the results indicated that in addition to making the device suitable for practical application the ti mesh mcc with a woven network enables the flow electrode to achieve substantial ion adsorption capacity due to the efficient update of fresh carbon particles in short the results of this study showed that mcc fcdi is a promising desalination system for scale up applications providing a new reference and guidance for device design graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization membrane current collector scale up desalination titanium mesh operation mode 1 introduction fresh water production from either seawater or wastewater is one emergency process to address global water deficiency cho et al 2019 tan et al 2018 flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi using flowable carbon particles generally prepared by commercial activated carbon ac powder offers fundamental advantages over most electrochemical technologies because the devices can be continuously operated without sacrificing adsorption capacity yang et al 2016 a common example is the short circuited closed cycle scc operation which enables continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes by the mixing of positively and negatively charged carbon particles outside the fcdi cell without an additional discharging process ma et al 2020 yang et al 2019 in a common fcdi configuration fig 1 a which was developed on the basis of jeon s work jeon et al 2013 the carbon suspension can be recirculated between the anode cathode chambers and the external reservoirs at the surface of the current collector a winding flow electrode channel is carved to prevent the carbon flow electrode from becoming blocked however the complex device configuration and large channel depth d 1 3 mm fig 1c require additional infrastructure investment and energy costs to support flow electrode recirculation and ionic separation porada et al 2014 wang et al 2016 because the pumping energy 15 contributes a large proportion to the total energy consumption fang et al 2018 hatzell et al 2015 c zhang et al 2020 moreover the supported flow channel inevitably limits the utilization of ion exchange membranes iems resulting in an increase in material cost and device size note that the utilization rate in ordinary fcdi systems only reaches 13 54 compared to that of tiny scale fcdi cells fig 1d currently only a few studies have presented fcdi designs developed for scale up desalination including membrane stack configuration ma et al 2020 yang et al 2016 membrane electrode assembly linnartz et al 2020 and honeycomb shaped configuration cho et al 2017 choo et al 2019 but the requirements of these approaches are limited by the relatively expensive components and complex configuration in this study we present an alternative fcdi design that uses integrated desalination modules equipped with membrane current collector mcc configuration exploiting commercial titanium mesh as current collectors fig 1b yang et al 2019 to differentiate from traditional fcdi system mcc based fcdi system was named as mcc fcdi because of the unique structure of the ti mesh mcc which provides a large number of carbon contact sites for ionic adsorption but allows carbon particles to easily pass through the current collector mcc has the potential to overcome the trade off between electron transport and adsorption capacity in long term operation moreover by enlarging the flow electrode chambers the use of the flow channel structure and external carbon recirculation components can be avoided thus less pumping energy is required to maintain the dispersion of carbon particles and the utilization of the membrane area can be increased the results of this study demonstrated that mcc fcdi exhibited a salt removal performance similar to that of the classic p fcdi i e the fcdi system equip with post current collector system but showed a lower energy requirement for carbon particle driven and ionic separation to examine the potential of using a network current collector for salt removal the salt removal performance at different thicknesses and mesh densities of the current collector was investigated evidence for the potential scale up application of mcc fcdi in long term operation is provided by the results with the multiple working module configuration therefore it is conceivable that our design greatly improves the simplification of the fcdi system in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup an innovative mcc assembly was used in all experiments fig 1b and fig s1 in brief the fcdi cell is consists of a large volume of carbon slurry reservoir 210 mm 110 mm 100 mm and an integrated desalination module in the working module fig s2 a spacer chamber thickness of 0 5 mm a pair of ion exchange membranes aem hom 1201 cem hom 0011t lvhe china and two ti mesh current collectors purity 99 6 50 mm 50 mm 0 15 mm hongyun china were bolted together with two hollow acrylic end plates in the spacer chamber a 100 mesh nylon sheet 50 mm 50 mm 0 5 mm was sandwiched between the anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem to uniformly distribute the feed stream the desalination module could be vertically inserted into the middle of the reservoir to isolate the anode chamber and cathode chambers fig 1b as shown in fig s1 there is a slot in the middle of the reservoir to ensure that the flow electrode on both sides of the module can be completely isolated alternatively the use of glass sealant is also an optional method at the laboratory scale before each experiment the sealing test was performed the effective contact area a between the flow electrode and each membrane was 25 cm2 2 2 operating conditions in each experimental test synthetic salt water containing 500 mg l nacl analytical reagent shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co with an initial ph phi of 6 5 0 1 was continuously pumped into the spacer chamber in a single pass mode by a peristaltic pump bt100 2j longer china although ac has been demonstrated as promising electrode material because of the high theoretical volumetric capacity the ac based flow electrode is not a good electrical conductor compared to the fixed electrode in the cdi and mcdi systems k tang et al 2019 adding a small amount of carbon black cb to the flow electrode generally at a mass fraction of 10 in the total carbon can significantly reduce the internal resistance of the fcdi cell and thus enhance the charge transfer efficiency liang et al 2017 for an example the flow electrodes with 5 wt carbon content i e ac cb 1 9 were prepared by mixing 4 5 wt ac powder yec 8a yihuan china 0 5 wt cb powder bp2000 cabot american and 95 wt 18 2 mω milli q water millipore america the detailed information of carbon materials is showed in table s2 in supporting information approximately 500 mg l nacl was then added into the carbon suspension as the supporting electrolyte and the initial ph was controlled at 6 5 0 1 note that the carbon suspensions were continuously stirred on a magnetic stirrer for at least 48 h prior to the experiments unless otherwise stated mcc fcdi system was operated in isolated closed cycle icc mode with each flow electrode chamber containing an equal amount of carbon suspension 750 ml and continuously stirred at a constant rotation speed of 500 rpm initially the spacer chamber was fully flushed using the feed water until the effluent conductivity was close to the salt water conductivity to investigate the electrochemical adsorption and regeneration performance of the fcdi cell continuous 11 cycles of charging discharging processes were carried out within 1100 min to obtain the optimal operating parameters of mcc fcdi the effects of operational parameters such as the carbon content 0 0 1 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 wt cell voltage 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 v and flow rate 0 51 1 02 2 03 and 3 05 ml min of the feed stream were investigated specifically cell voltage ranges from 0 3 to 1 7 v and system current ranges from 3 0 to 17 0 ma were tested in the cv and constant current cc mode respectively moreover the thickness δ and mesh density φ of the current collector were also investigated to provide some practical guidance toward the design of current collectors finally continuous operation over 50 h was evaluated in the new icc and scc modes using multiple working modules the analytical methods and calculations are presented in text s1 in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 integrated design of the desalination module as shown in fig 1b network current collectors composed of ti mesh with an oxide layer were used as an experimental case to evaluate the desalination performance of mcc fcdi the integrated desalination module is separated from the flow electrode chamber by simply bolting the current collectors iems and spacer chamber together mcc assembly allows efficient electron transfer between ions carbon particles and current collectors because of the minimum ion migration distance between the spacer chamber and the electrode chambers the ti mesh used in this work i e 100 mesh type has a mesh size of 150 150 µm and a thickness of 0 15 mm thus ac particles with a size range of 5 10 µm fig s4 can readily cross the network of the current collector under continuous stirring effectively maintaining the adsorption capacity of the flow electrodes in the desalination process the ions passed through the iems will be immediately adsorbed by the carbon particles attached to the current collector thereby improving the desalination performance of mcc fcdi regarding to the operation mode of mcc fcdi system multiple desalination modules can be inserted into the reservoir to realize high water productivity in section 3 4 we demonstrated the technical implementation feasibility using multiple module at different operating modes to differentiate from traditional fcdi system with a narrow flow electrode chambers fig 1a the flow electrode chambers of mcc fcdi system were expanded to 100 mm exhibiting the flexible controllability of the fcdi cell in practical application nevertheless the thickness and or volume of the flow electrode chambers can be designed based on the requirement in view of the energy consumption for mcc fcdi the pumping energy consumption for driving salt water can be ignored due to the extremely low flow rate of the feed stream zhang et al 2020 besides the energy consumption required for homogenizing the flow electrode solution is also not considered in this study due to the volume of flow electrode used in the practical application will be much smaller than that in this study therefore the desalination performance and electrical energy consumption eec of mcc fcdi system for salt water separation were specifically evaluated 3 2 optimization of mcc fcdi system for salt removal 3 2 1 charging and discharging performance of mcc fcdi system fig 2 a shows the salt water separation performance of mcc fcdi system operated at continuous 1100 min charging discharging process after cycling for 11 cycles the adsorption and desorption performance was remarkably well maintained since the test was carried out at a fixed salt water volume the effluent conductivity was obviously decreased with charging time increased and the conductivity was increased to the initial level after the same time of discharging process owing to the increase of internal resistance in the spacer chamber a decrease in current with a decrease in salt concentration was observed in each charging step in term of the adsorption and desorption processes no difference can be observed between mcc fcdi system and the conventional cdi based process i e mcdi and fcdi with pcc configuration liu et al 2017 ma et al 2016 tang et al 2017 tang et al 2019 therefore it is expected that mcc assembly is likely to be an alternative to conventional fcdi system 3 2 2 significance of the carbon content as shown in fig 2c the salt removal performance at 0 wt carbon was negligible because few surface sites were available for ion adsorption on the ti mesh current collector xu et al 2021 ma et al 2018 meanwhile the current signal was below the detection limit fig s5 suggesting that no faradaic reaction was occurred at the electrolyte current collector interface thus the removal of salt in the presence of different carbon contents can be largely considered as capacitive adsorption of course the electrodialysis contribution is inevitable in mcc fcdi system due to the accumulation of ions in the electrolyte ma et al 2018 surprisingly 0 1 wt carbon content achieved a high asrr of 0 11 µmol cm2 min at a stable current of 5 7 ma fig 2d this result is significantly better than the findings of previous study obtained at a lower carbon content zhang et al 2020 indicating the superiority of mcc assembly for electron transfer at a low carbon contents yang et al 2019 it was observed that the asrr increased with a further increase in carbon loading and reached 0 23 µmol cm2 min at 10 wt carbon possibly owing to the formation of a charge percolation network and the efficient refreshing of carbon particles at the current collector surface cai et al 2020 yang et al 2019 moreover a charge efficiency as high as 90 4 and an optimal eec of 0 61 kwh kg nacl were obtained owing to the increase of viscosity with increasing the carbon content hatzell et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the default rotate speed was hardly to keep the flow electrode well mixed in the course of our experiment additional disturbance was required at 10 wt carbon content thus 5 wt carbon content was used in the following experiments unless otherwise stated 3 2 3 performance of mcc fcdi operated at cc and cv modes figs 3 a and 3b show a significant increase in conductivity removal and ionic current with increasing cell voltages from 0 3 to 1 5 v leading to an asrr increase from 0 07 to 0 23 µmol cm2 min fig 3c correspondingly the eec increased from 0 15 to 1 02 kwh kg nacl accompanied by an obvious decrease in ce it can be observed that an excessive high cell voltage u 1 2 v resulted in a drop in ce owing to the enhancement of faradaic reactions e g water splitting and carbon oxidation at the current collector surface hatzell et al 2015 ma et al 2018 to obtain a better understanding of the desalination performance of mcc fcdi a comparison between icc and scc configurations fig s6 with different cc and cv operations was performed using single desalination module in consideration of the flexible controllability of the fcdi cell fig s1 the scc mode was built via a direct hybrid manner in the fcdi cell fig s7b as shown in fig s7 all four operation modes i e icc cv icc cc scc cv and scc cc exhibited a similar eec to achieve less than 50 salt removal however each eec gradually deteriorated as the applied cell voltage increased above 1 2 v the energy consumption for different operation modes from low to high was icc cv icc cc scc cc scc cv for instance in reducing the effluent conductivity below 350 µs cm the scc cv mode required a more than 2 fold higher eec than that of the icc cv mode for further clarification the variation in ce with different operation modes was evaluated fig 3d it was previously demonstrated that the scc mode enables continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes as a result of the charge neutralization of the positively or negatively charged carbon particles he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in the scc mode however we found that ce lineally decreased r2 0 9488 with higher asrrs from 0 12 to 0 26 µmol cm2 min this result can be ascribed to the invalid charge utilization at high voltages ma et al 2019 xu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 detailly additional charge was lost through external carbon slurry in the integrated flow electrode chamber i e short circuiting effect fig s8a as shown in fig s8b the short circuit current of mcc fcdi system was obviously increased with the conductivity of the flow electrode electrolyte increase thus additional charge efficiency drop was observed with cell voltage increase in comparison a higher ce was obtained in icc mode due to the completely isolation of the anode and cathode flow electrode chambers 3 2 4 effects of the flow rate fig 4 shows that the asrr ce and eec were closely related to the flow rates we found that a higher f 0 51 3 05 ml min led to a higher asrr 0 14 0 30 µmol cm2 min although a lower salt removal efficiency was obtained owing to increased ionic conductivity in the spacer chamber indeed the increased f favored the ion replenishment of the salt solution providing a lower resistance for ionic migration he et al 2018 for example at f 3 05 ml min more than 90 ce was achieved and the corresponding eec was 0 61 kwh kg nacl under a limited scale of fcdi cell the water productivity is normally opposite to the salt removal efficiency even if the salt removal rate increases with improving the flow rates of salt water luo et al 2020 tedesco et al 2015 xu et al 2020 thus increasing the number of working modules in an integrated fcdi system is an alternative to improve the productivity and quality of dilute water 3 2 4 comparison with previous studies the results fig 1e indicated that mcc fcdi system can provide desalination performance

nacl achieving an asrr of 0 44 µmol cm2 min recently yang et al 2019 reported similar results in addition to the energy requires for deionization without considering pumping energy the eec of mcc fcdi system is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of p fcdi systems gendel et al 2014 ma et al 2020 ma et al 2019 c zhang et al 2020 suggesting an economic advantage for scale up desalination these results can be attributed to the narrowed ionic migration distance between the iems and current collectors linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 therefore mcc fcdi system achieves a reduction in energy consumption for pumping and ionic separation while maintaining high desalination performance moreover increasing the size of fcdi system can be easily accomplished by increasing the effective

stacking of the ti mesh resulted in a decrease in the asrr because the exchange process both entry and release processes of carbon particles between the iems and current collectors was impeded by the narrow and deep channel thus as shown in fig 5 δ of 0 30 mm provided the highest asrr of 0 30 µmol cm2 min when a high φ current collector is used it is foreseeable that the increase in δ will result in deteriorated desalination performance in addition the increased φ of the mesh type favored salt removal for example the asrr increased from 0 205 to 0 27 µmol cm2 min with increasing φ from 50 to 600 mesh when φ increased from 50 to 100 mesh δ 0 15 mm the improved salt removal performance in mcc fcdi system was mainly ascribed to the increase of mesh density to provide more carbon contact

charging time increased from 400 to 3000 min meanwhile the current continuously decreased to 20 ma in a classic scc operation the positively or negatively charged carbon particles can be neutralized instantly in the flow electrode chamber he et al 2018 leading to continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes although a neutral ph environment was maintained in the mscc process fig 6h the flow electrode sandwiched between two adjacent desalination modules will cause additional current consumption i e short circuiting effect especially with the increase in ionic conductivity in the electrolytes fig s8 in the single pass mode of the feed stream the ionic conductivity of the spacer chamber can be considered constant as a result the resistance of the flow electrode chamber i e r 1 accounted for higher and higher proportion of the total current fig s11 with the accumulation of salt in the flow electrode chamber in the shared flow electrode chamber of the mscc mcc fcdi system moreover the current collectors on both sides are connected to positive and negative terminals of the same dc power supply thus an inner cdi like unit was created fig 6b and resulted in a decrease in the adsorption capacity of the carbon flow electrode as shown in fig s12b the adverse effect of single power supply operation on the desalination performance of mcc fcdi is expected to be eliminated by using independent power supplies even if the number of desalination modules continues to increase a maximum of two power supplies can realize the system up and running 4 conclusions in a conventional p fcdi system the flow electrode is driven by peristaltic pumps to achieve continuous circulation of carbon particles between the external reservoirs and fcdi cell resulting in a complex device configuration and additional energy consumption in this study an innovative mcc fcdi system equipped with independent desalination modules was proposed realizing the simplification and integration of the fcdi system the key to the development of fcdi cell is the innovative design of the current collector i e mcc configuration the results of this study demonstrated that the energy requirement for salt removal were greatly reduced while high desalination performance was maintained with mcc fcdi compared with p fcdi more importantly evidence for the feasible scale up desalination of mcc fcdi system is provided by the results of continuous multi module operation according to our experimental results mcc is required to have large carbon contact surface sites high electrical conductivity smooth carbon particle transport channels and certain mechanical properties for a ti mesh current collector with a network structure it is necessary to control the thickness and mesh density to improve the effective adsorption capacity in order to ensure stability in the desalination process it should also be noted that the ti mesh itself has very good flexibility which can make the configuration of fcdi reactors more diverse such as the development of a roll desalination module which is very attractive to address various practical processing scenarios in addition the results of multiple modules operations indicated that the micc mode is easy to expand and apply in continuous charging operations for improving the water productivity stack fcdi cell designed based on mcc configuration is also attractive several current collector materials such as carbon textiles and metal mesh as cathode electrode are alternative since the thin thickness and penetrable structure for charge transfer and ion migration recently linnartz et al 2020 also demonstrated that the membrane current collector configuration achieves salt removal rates comparable to the fcdi system obtained with the two graphite current collector setups even if the available surface of carbon fiber for charge transfer is much smaller than the graphite plate this phenomenon is what the future research needs to focus on in short mcc fcdi presents a promising technical implementation approach for scale up applications providing a new perspective for electrochemical desalination technologies

photocatalytic oxidation pco the durability of different anode materials the effects of catalyst loading and solar photo and thermal impacts under different applied voltages were studied boron doped

stormwater treatment micropollutants removal electrochemical oxidation eco photocatalytic oxidation pco photoelectrochemical oxidation peco 1 introduction stormwater has attracted much attention recently as an untapped water resource urban water demand can be substantially met by proper stormwater harvesting if the significant stormwater supply that is potentially available can be utilized hamdan 2009 however a wide range of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pesticides and herbicides have been detected in significant quantities in urban stormwater runoff birch et al 2011 gasperi et al 2014 gernjak et al 2017 for example widespread detection and high variability of pesticides occurring in stormwater samples across different australian cities rippy et al 2017 would mean that stormwater would need to be treated for high quality reuse purposes although the average concentration of micropollutants detected in stormwater is low remain at μg l level birch et al 2011 gasperi et al 2014 rippy et al 2017 the high variation and potential toxicity of these micropollutants still pose a high risk with regard to stormwater harvesting jiang et al 2013 thus it is essential to remove micropollutants in the stormwater treatment process water sensitive urban design wsud technologies are designed to mitigate pollution in stormwater commonly used wsud technologies such as stormwater biofilters and constructed wetlands have already shown good performance in removing traditional pollutants e g total suspended solids tss nutrients and heavy metals lucke and nichols 2015 however their performance in removing key micropollutants is highly variable e g zhang et al 2014 found that the effluent concentration of herbicides e g simazine atrazine from raingardens varied largely in some cases exceeding the limits for effluent concentration stated in the australian drinking water guidelines flanagan et al 2018 have assessed two stormwater biofiltration systems i e vegetative filter strip and biofiltration swale finding that they can deliver around 90 removal of particulate bound micropollutants e g pahs and total petroleum hydrocarbons however their performance in treating moderately particulate e g bpa and phthalates and dissolved micropollutants was poor consequently an efficient post treatment method that follows similar concepts for stormwater treatment as those for wsud i e passive operation with low energy input and low maintenance requirements is needed to further improve the quality of effluent for higher enduses solar energy as the most abundant renewable energy has been used to power advanced oxidation processes aop to support organic micropollutants removal including photocatalytic oxidation pco and photovoltaic driven electrochemical oxidation eco park et al 2008 yang et al 2015a both pco and eco have the potential to deliver the desired post treatment output after wsud systems for safe stormwater harvesting parsons 2005 pco uses semiconductors as the catalysts with photogenerated electron hole pairs to promote redox reactions to oxidize pollutants under light irradiation titanium dioxide tio2 has been recognized as the most commonly used photocatalyst in pco systems due to its optimal combination of photo activity and photo stability shephard et al 2002 thus it was chosen as the photocatalyst for this study pco has already been used to treat organic pollutants e g pharmaceuticals and pesticides in wastewater arlos et al 2016 but studies on pco applications in stormwater treatment are limited there are only a few studies focusing on nutrient removal and disinfection rad et al 2016 wang et al 2016 in addition the relatively high recombination rate of electron hole pairs hinders the oxidation capacity of tio2 in the pollutant degradation process eco which is widely applied in wastewater treatment anglada et al 2009 has recently been adopted for stormwater disinfection e g removal of e coli by feng et al 2018 since stormwater has very low average electrical conductivity around 100 μs cm 1 and chlorine concentration around 9 mg l 1 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 a much higher voltage often 10 v is required to generate enough current to achieve effective stormwater disinfection compared to the relative lower energy requirement in eco operation for wastewater treatment e g 3 v shen et al 2006 high voltage causes quick degradation of eco anodes making many eco configurations non viable for stormwater applications feng et al 2019 thus eco is still to be tested for degradation of micropollutants from stormwater eco has been used in combination with pco i e photoelectrochemical oxidation peco to minimize recombination rate of electron hole pairs in the pco process and lower the required voltage in the eco process apart from the solar photo effect coming from the photocatalytic reaction the thermal effect accompanying solar light irradiation was also found to have a positive influence in the oxidation process gu et al 2017 peco has been used to degrade phenol hurwitz et al 2014 humic acid pinhedo et al 2005 and pesticides rubí juárez et al 2016 in wastewater however to the authors knowledge the feasibility of peco in stormwater treatment has never been studied this paper aims to investigate the feasibility of solar driven aops pco eco and peco for stormwater organic pollutants removal and study the influence of the photo and thermal effects of simulated solar light on degradation processes diuron and atrazine which pose potential risks to human health e g endocrine disruption carcinogenicity and genotoxicity katsumata et al 2009 komtchou et al 2016 were selected as the two representative herbicides due to their frequent detection in stormwater rippy et al 2017 specific objectives of this study include selecting suitable anode material via durability testing under high applied voltage conditions understanding the herbicide removal outcomes of peco eco and pco processes under different applied voltages and catalyst loading conditions and investigating the solar thermal effect in oxidation processes this work underpins the development of efficient technologies that can utilize solar energy for stormwater post treatment thus further advancing stormwater harvesting 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the configurations of the oxidation processes contained three parts 1 a solar simulator a 300 w xenon lamp cermax with air mass 1 5 global filter 4410 w m 2 intensity solar light is the ideal application environment for stormwater treatment 2 a electrolysis cell three electrodes in the beaker 80 ml 3 a potentiostat model pgstat302n autolab for constant current supply solar simulator output light spectrum of xenon lamp and 1 5 g filter can be seen in fig s1 of supporting information si was arranged horizontally to the beaker system side position with the light source illuminated from the outside of the electrolysis cell external lighting the position of illumination source was fixed at the desired distance of 7 cm from lamp to the reactor the position of the lamp and the cell was fixed throughout the experiments to ensure the constant illumination intensity for each batch experiment this would greatly prevent any potential inconsistency of the homogeneity the preliminary study has been conducted to test the impact of light positions on pco performance including top of the beaker i e nothing on the light transmission way and side position glass beaker on the transmission way of lamp the results showed that the degradation performance of tio2 did not compromise in terms of the lamp position results shown in fig s2 of si thus the side position in this study did not have big impacts on the findings within the electrolysis cell three electrodes were mounted in the beaker system to form a three electrode system 1 anode active dimension 30 mm 25 mm 2 pt cathode active dimension 25 mm 25 mm 2 cm next to anode and 3 ag agcl reference electrode to remain constant potential for anode inzelt et al 2013 placed between the anode and cathode with 1 cm interval the schematic diagram are illustrated in fig 1 with different operations a peco both electricity and simulated solar light applied b eco only electricity applied and c pco only simulated solar light applied 2 2 anode materials and catalyst coating three anode materials were selected in this study to test their durability in degrading micropollutants 1 titanium foil from sigma aldrich australia a proven active anode material in eco operations can be coated with other metal or metal oxides such as ti pt ti sno2 szpyrkowicz et al 2005 2 carbon fiber toray paper tgp h 120 selected due to its low cost highly porous properties and remarkable conductivity yang et al 2015b and 3 boron doped diamond bdd from neocoat ltd swaziland selected due to its high stability properties already proven in previous eco stormwater disinfection feng et al 2019 the commercial aeroxide p25 tio2 was used as the photocatalyst coated on the anode dip coating as a standard coating method in photoanode preparation terashima et al 2016 was adopted in this study the preparation of the coating solution followed a method reported by han et al 2009 firstly 3 g tio2 particles were dispersed into a 60 ml mixture 18 ml methanol and 42 ml deionized water to form a 50 g l 1 tio2 suspension particularly for the bdd electrode another 0 9 g carbowax 30 weight ratio based on the weight of tio2 was added into the solution as a binder to enhance the adhesion of the tio2 film secondly the coating solution was stirred and sonicated to ensure it was thoroughly dispersed thirdly the fresh anode material was immersed into and out of the solution ten times with each immersion time lasting for 1 min after the immersion procedure the coated ti foil and carbon fiber were dried in labec oven at 80 c overnight and bdd was calcined in labec muffle furnace at 450 c with ramping rate of 5 c for 2 h to increase tio2 adhesion 2 3 stormwater degradation procedure preliminary experiments by the authors showed that 2 hour operation at 9 v potential could achieve over 90 herbicide removal thus the experimental duration for this work was set as 2 h in each batch experiment 80 ml synthetic stormwater prepared following the method described by feng et al 2018 containing 105 μs cm 1 electrical conductivity solution and 9 mg l 1 chloride with 60 μg l 1 diuron and atrazine which is around the highest concentration of these herbicides previously found in biofilter outflows zhang et al 2014 was prepared and added into the beaker system a magnetic stirrer was used at 400 rpm to keep the solution homogenized for different oxidation processes different operation conditions have been implemented 1 peco process simulated solar light and electricity were applied for the cell 2 eco process only electricity was applied for the cell 3 pco process only simulated solar light was applied for the cell samples 2 ml were taken over the course of 2 h at t 0 10 min 30 min 1 h 2 h during the operation prior to herbicide analysis 950 μl of the sample solution taken from each 2 ml sample was mixed with 50 μl internal standard as a sample pretreatment the herbicides were measured following the method described by vanderford and snyder 2006 with high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 series usa tandem mass spectrometer api 4000 triple quadrupole usa hplc msms which needs to prepare the standard curve solutions for quantification the detention limit is 5 ng l 1 each batch experiment was repeated in triplicate to ensure the reproducibility 2 4 anode durability study durability of all the three anode materials was tested under challenging voltage levels 9 v with peco operation the experiments were designed to repeat the 2 hour degradation process as described above in section 2 3 until the deterioration of the anode materials was observed i e signs of material falling apart or treatment performance decline this repeated 2 hour operation was conducted for up to 50 h i e repeated 25 times with the same anode material titanium foil and carbon fiber anode were conducted for 8 h and 2 h respectively before the deterioration showed only bdd anode undertook 50 hour operation without film deterioration or current decrement the sampling frequency reduced gradually after the first 2 hour cycle after every 2 hour operation the degraded synthetic stormwater was replaced with a new batch of prepared stormwater and three electrodes were rinsed thoroughly using deionized water the total 50 hour peco operation was designed to mimic around 1 month s rainfall duration at melbourne regional office australia as per zhang et al 2019 to ensure the experiment is using the most durable material the scanning electron microscope sem was also conducted to identify the change of surface and cross section property of the anodes before and after the durability test 2 5 solar photo effect investigation of different oxidation processes both voltage and catalyst loading were found to be the key factors that govern the performance of photo effects in the oxidation process costa et al 2009 zangeneh et al 2015 therefore to fully understand these three processes i e peco eco and pco the photo effect investigation was conducted under four catalyst loadings and three operations of differing voltages to study their effects the most durable anode material found in the previous durability study i e bdd details of results are given in the results and discussion section was selected for the following experiments four different catalyst loadings were tested including the one described earlier in section 2 2 photoanode preparation i e 1 10 times immersion into tio2 suspension 50 g l 1 as the standard coating plus another three including 2 1 time immersion with 50 g l 1 suspension 3 10 times immersion with 1 3 of the previous concentration suspension 16 67 g l 1 and 4 no coating as a control the detailed deposition conditions were summarized below in table 1 the weight difference of the anode before and after the coating operation has been shown in table 1 three operational voltages 2 v low voltage 5 v standard voltage 9 v high voltage were applied with the standard coating anode 10 time 1 conc to display apparent differences for comparison experiments for investigating different catalysts loading were conducted with standard voltage experiments were run using the same procedures e g solution mix duration and sampling as for the 2 hour operation introduced above in section 2 3 all the experiments involving the same conditions were repeated in triplicate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and linear sweep voltammetry lsv were recorded using potenitostat in the same 3 electrode reactor system described above section 2 1 for coated and non coated bare bdd electrode to analyze the electrochemical properties of the anodes eis was conducted with the frequency range of 0 01 to 1 105 hz and lsv was recorded with scan rate of 0 05 v s 1 from 0 5 v to 5 v the results were used to understand the electrical resistance and current response of anodes in order to assess the photo effect of the catalysts and the anode material itself 2 6 solar thermal effect investigation in the photo effect study it was observed that temperature increased over time due to the light irradiation from 25 c to 55 c during a 2 hour operation thus we wanted to study if the temperature can impact on the degradation performance the increasing trends concerning temperature caused by the light irradiation were monitored and a hotplate was used to simulate the same temperature change patterns as shown in fig s3 of si the hotplate was placed at the bottom of the beaker system to heat up the electrolyte during the oxidation process the thermocouple that is connected to the hotplate was inserted into the electrolyte to measure and maintain the electrolyte temperature throughout the reaction two temperatures were chosen 1 55 c which was observed in the previous 2 hour operation study and 2 65 c the possible temperature water can reach by cooling solar panels as found by tripanagnostopoulos et al 2000 the same experimental procedure sampling method and herbicide analysis were performed according to section 2 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 the durability of anode materials the herbicide removal performance is shown in fig 2 for the durability test of ti foil 8 h carbon fiber 2 h and bdd anode 50 h it was observed that ti foil had the worst performance in all of the 2 hour operations with average removal of diuron 40 and atrazine 20 this poor degradation performance is likely due to the oxide layer formed on the ti foil under high voltage which inhibited the electron transfer between pollutants and anode surface a preliminary test showed that 5 v potential oxidized pure ti foil forming an oxide surface layer which can been seen in fig s4 of si thus the durability test for ti foil was stopped at 8 h both carbon fiber and bdd anode resulted in herbicide removal of over 94 in all the 2 hour operations and under an applied voltage of 9 v generated over 10 ma which was much higher than that generated by ti foil 4 ma see in fig s5 of si the difference between generated current may be the reason why the anodes could deliver better removal performance than the foil however after only one 2 hour operation with carbon fiber at 9 v a visible color change of the solution was observed see in fig s6 of si potentially due to the carbon oxidation which suggests that carbon fiber cannot withstand such a high application voltage in contrast bdd demonstrated stable performance over a 50 hour period of operation fig 2 c the sem image of the bdd anode surface indicates that the morphology of coated tio2 remains unchanged before and after a 50 hour period of operation figure s7 of si according to the cross sectional sem imaging shown in figure s8 of si the coating thickness was around 7 μm and remained unchanged after the operation the consistent thickness and surface structure of tio2 film together with the stable removal performance for 50 hour durability test can indicate the coating on bdd anode was durable in this system 3 2 solar driven photo and electrochemical impact study the degradation of two herbicides during different aop processes under various conditions was studied fig 3 and found to follow a first order decay kinetic r2 0 94 except for atrazine in the pco process the fitted curves can be found in figure s9 of si with the decay rates and half life values estimated and summarized in table 2 across all conditions peco was observed to deliver the best performance in removing herbicides diuron 96 and atrazine 90 followed by the eco diuron 92 and atrazine 86 and pco diuron 20 and atrazine 1 after a 2 hour period of operation all the batches are coated with catalysts including eco system although peco performed was only slightly better than eco this small improvement was still considered as very important considering the low levels of initial concentration of pollutants around 60 μg l 1 more importantly the results from table 2 indicated that peco spent less time to achieve 90 removal diuron 80 mins atrazine 119 mins when compared to eco diuron 110 mins atrazine 139 mins particularly under 9 v operation this suggests that there is a positive synergistic effect in combining eco and pco processes for better removal performance the low pco performance was resulted from the significantly low exposure of tio2 catalysts for photoexcitation and photochemical surface oxidation for a fair comparison the pco system in our study was based on tio2 film coated on the anode with small exposure area compared to a typical pco suspension system where catalysts are dispersed in solution although tio2 in suspension was found to improve the performance when comparing to coated tio2 on the anode refer to fig s10 of si for the comparison tests separation of suspended material requires additional energy and would require extensive maintenance effort for post treatment this is not in line with the general concept of stormwater management that requires low energy and passive treatment payne et al 2019 thus from practical perspective it was suggested to use coated tio2 film system surprisingly it was found that eco exhibited higher atrazine removal 23 than peco 7 under 2 v operation the decrease in peco performance compared to that of eco may be caused by the decomposition of free chlorine resulting from simulated solar light irradiation since free chlorine was found to be important in the disinfection of e coli feng et al 2018 even if the chloride concentration in stormwater was low this phenomenon was not obvious under high voltages 5 v and 9 v as the generated high current was the main factor in delivering degradation performance which may surpass the negative effects of free chlorine consumption by comparing our results to the performance in existing literatures for various electrolyte with higher conductivity compared with stormwater table s1 of si peco system in this study has been demonstrated to deliver effective removal performance for atrazine and diuron in stormwater despite a very low initial concentration and current density of this work the removal rate is still relatively high within a short operation time 2 h indicating the feasibility of peco system for removing stormwater micropollutants without the addition of secondary electrolyte to the system the increasing voltage had a positive effect on degradation processes has also been observed as the diuron removal rate was already relatively high over 90 under 2 v operation peco and eco did not evidence positive effects with an increase in voltage from 2 v to 5 v however the atrazine removal rate increased significantly from 7 to 90 for peco and from 23 to 86 for eco when the applied voltage was increased from 2 v to 5 v this huge increase in degradation suggests that 5 v may overcome the energy barrier of atrazine degradation by generating a higher current eco 5 ma and peco 10 ma shown in fig 4 garza campos et al 2014 with a further increase in the voltage from 5 v to 9 v peco demonstrated a further improvement in removal of both diuron and atrazine i e decay rate increased from 1 72 to 2 10 h 1 and 1 19 to 1 42 h 1 respectively whereas the improvement for eco was negligible this further increase in voltage from 5 v to 9 v generated a relatively higher current peco 9 ma to 13 ma eco 5 ma to 8 ma but it did not improve the removal performance significantly i e only 5 and 0 5 respectively therefore 5 v was considered to be the optimal applied voltage for herbicide removal in this study overall with the increase in voltage the decay rate of peco demonstrated remarkable growth compared with that of eco that is for the diuron decay rate peco evidenced a 60 increase and eco showed no increase when the voltage increased from 2 v to 9 v for the atrazine decay rate peco evidenced approximately a 20 increase and eco only around 1 growth which is negligible when the voltage was increased from 5 v to 9 v this confirms the peco process as a superior technology for stormwater organic pollutant removal fig 5 presents the impact of catalyst loadings on herbicide removal within the peco system under the voltage of 5 v as shown different coating methods resulting in different catalyst loadings on the anode table 1 did not have any apparent impact to the herbicide removal i e the maximum performance difference between the highest and lowest catalyst loadings was only 0 9 for diuron and 3 for atrazine since the coating areas for catalysts are the same i e 7 5 cm2 for each deposition condition only the top layer of catalysts is illuminated and photoexcited regardless of the amount of catalysts loaded van grieken et al 2009 thus the restricted illumination area of catalysts on the photoanode surface resulted in the similar results between the different catalysts loading for the system on one hand this minimal difference suggests that a single layer of tio2 coating is enough to form a uniform layer that saturates the substrate surface to provide the desirable photo effect on the other hand however the long term performance of a low catalyst loading anode is still unknown and needs further investigation surprisingly it was found that a non coated bdd anode under light illumination presented even better removal performance compared with other coated bdd anodes peco processes especially for atrazine removal to find out the possible reason the performance of eco without catalysts under light was found to be better than eco with catalysts under light this implied that the inhibition of catalyst coating i e 7 μm thick on current generation might surpass the enhancement of tio2 film to generate photo current contributing to generation of a higher current thus the overall result showed that the presence of catalyst coating hindered the oxidation performance the more effective conductivity of a non coated bdd anode was confirmed by eis measurements the eis curves shown in fig 6 a demonstrate that a non coated bdd anode lowered its own impedance under light irradiation compared with a non coated bdd anode under dark conditions this indicates that the structure of bdd material is likely to be changed in the presence of light which has also been found by wang et al 2011 according to fig 6 b under light irradiation the tio2 coated bdd anode generated a slightly higher current 5 98 ma than the non coated one 4 96 ma at the applied potential of 5 v these results reveal that light can enhance the degradation process 3 3 solar driven thermal impact study thermal power is associated with sunlight it cannot be separated from solar irradiation especially in the natural environment there are studies proved that the high temperature had the practical uses in water treatment process zhang et al 2018 besides the solar thermal effect has been extensively utilized to enhance the electrochemical oxidation process gu et al 2017 nie et al 2016 the heat coupling with light irradiation can accelerate the electron and mass transfer process that supports electrochemical reactions occurring on the anode side nie et al 2020 and increases the current with time fig 4 due to the low volume 80 ml and prolonged illumination in this study the temperature of the electrolyte increased to 55 c under light illumination the herbicide removal rate without tio2 was 98 5 for atrazine after 2 h fig 7 which is slightly better than that for a heated batch without tio2 where the electrolyte temperature also reaches 55 c 91 for atrazine this indicates that apart from the thermal effect light is probably necessary to enhance degradation performance on the other hand a higher temperature 65 c achieved by a hotplate can deliver a similar result 99 4 for diuron and 98 6 for atrazine as that for the light irradiated batch 55 c although the difference between 55 c and 65 c performance was relatively small this result suggests the potential prospect of using temperature to enhance the degradation process further in practice the long term exposure under sunlight can still heat up the system even after scaling up e g the photovoltaic chamber can reach 65 c under solar light tripanagnostopoulos et al 2000 the solar thermal effect has been extensively utilized to enhance the eco process gu et al 2017 and it has the potential to be used to improve peco process by combination of photovoltaic cell as electricity and heat source for the system in the validation process 3 4 implications for stormwater treatment practice aop technologies present an effective treatment of stormwater herbicides that can only minimally be removed through typical stormwater treatment systems e g wsud systems zhang et al 2014 they offer an excellent alternative for post wsud treatment to deliver water of higher quality solar enhanced eco without catalysts with light irradiation was demonstrably effective in degrading organic pollutants in stormwater considering that the ultimate aim for peco is to utilize the widely available sunlight to further improve the performance of eco this work shows the advantages of using peco when compared with eco and pco being able to harvest a portion of the energy from sunlight this work is important to demonstrate the capability of peco in stormwater degradation nevertheless there is still potential to improve the efficiency of peco needs to be further improved through reactor and system optimization to assure that aop technologies for stormwater treatment are in line with the concept of low cost and energy efficient nature based solutions solar energy can be used as the only energy source to drive these processes the potential integration of a photovoltaic module and aop which can be fully powered by solar energy indicates the future research direction for stormwater post treatment approaches 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of aop technologies for stormwater herbicides removal the degradation performance of peco eco and pco processes for diuron and atrazine was tested in a series of batch experiments the results show that bdd has been found to be the most durable anode material with 50 hour stable operation compared with titanium foil and carbon fiber under challenging voltage 9 v peco and eco were effective in degradation of herbicides with around 90 removal while pco only deliver 20 diuron and 1 atrazine removal peco performed the best highest decay rate in 2 hour operation with first order decay kinetics in three aop operations the voltage has been found to play a positive role in improving the oxidation process with 5 v found to be the optimal voltage for sufficient removal performance however the catalysts loading was observed with no evident effect the solar thermal effect was found to have a positive effect to advance the performance of peco and eco with temperature increase during the operation solar driven eco without catalysts with light irradiation showed effective herbicides removal which was even better than the results of peco process i e 5 better than peco thus the further optimization of peco operation is crucial to enable the maximum utilization of solar energy for passive stormwater degradation in future studies supplementary materials

different aop processes for the degradation of two herbicides diuron and atrazine in pre treated stormwater i photoelectrochemical oxidation peco ii electrochemical oxidation eco and iii photocatalytic oxidation pco the durability of different anode materials the effects of catalyst loading and solar photo and thermal impacts under different applied voltages were studied boron doped

a first order decay process with a half life value of 0 40 h for diuron and 0 58 h for atrazine the voltage increase had a positive impact on the oxidation processes with 5 v found to be the optimal applied voltage while catalyst loading had a negligible effect interestingly the solar thermal effect plays a dominant role in enhancing the performance of the peco process which indicates the

stormwater treatment micropollutants removal electrochemical oxidation eco photocatalytic oxidation pco photoelectrochemical oxidation peco 1 introduction stormwater has attracted much attention recently as an untapped water resource urban water demand can be substantially met by proper stormwater harvesting if the significant stormwater supply that is potentially available can be utilized hamdan 2009 however a wide range of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pesticides and herbicides have been detected in significant quantities in urban stormwater runoff birch et al 2011 gasperi et al 2014 gernjak et al 2017 for example widespread detection and high variability of pesticides occurring in stormwater samples across different australian cities rippy et al 2017 would mean that stormwater would need to be treated for high quality reuse purposes although the average concentration of micropollutants detected in stormwater is low remain at μg l level birch et al 2011 gasperi et al 2014 rippy et al 2017 the high variation and potential toxicity of these micropollutants still pose a high risk with regard to stormwater harvesting jiang et al 2013 thus it is essential to remove micropollutants in the stormwater treatment process water sensitive urban design wsud technologies are designed to mitigate pollution in stormwater commonly used wsud technologies such as stormwater biofilters and constructed wetlands have already shown good performance in removing traditional pollutants e g total suspended solids tss nutrients and heavy metals lucke and nichols 2015 however their performance in removing key micropollutants is highly variable e g zhang et al 2014 found that the effluent concentration of herbicides e g simazine atrazine from raingardens varied largely in some cases exceeding the limits for effluent concentration stated in the australian drinking water guidelines flanagan et al 2018 have assessed two stormwater biofiltration systems i e vegetative filter strip and biofiltration swale finding that they can deliver around 90 removal of particulate bound micropollutants e g pahs and total petroleum hydrocarbons however their performance in treating moderately particulate e g bpa and phthalates and dissolved micropollutants was poor consequently an efficient post treatment method that follows similar concepts for stormwater treatment as those for wsud i e passive operation with low energy input and low maintenance requirements is needed to further improve the quality of effluent for higher enduses solar energy as the most abundant renewable energy has been used to power advanced oxidation processes aop to support organic micropollutants removal including photocatalytic oxidation pco and photovoltaic driven electrochemical oxidation eco park et al 2008 yang et al 2015a both pco and eco have the potential to deliver the desired post treatment output after wsud systems for safe stormwater harvesting parsons 2005 pco uses semiconductors as the catalysts with photogenerated electron hole pairs to promote redox reactions to oxidize pollutants under light irradiation titanium dioxide tio2 has been recognized as the most commonly used photocatalyst in pco systems due to its optimal combination of photo activity and photo stability shephard et al 2002 thus it was chosen as the photocatalyst for this study pco has already been used to treat organic pollutants e g pharmaceuticals and pesticides in wastewater arlos et al 2016 but studies on pco applications in stormwater treatment are limited there are only a few studies focusing on nutrient removal and disinfection rad et al 2016 wang et al 2016 in addition the relatively high recombination rate of electron hole pairs hinders the oxidation capacity of tio2 in the pollutant degradation process eco which is widely applied in wastewater treatment anglada et al 2009 has recently been adopted for stormwater disinfection e g removal of e coli by feng et al 2018 since stormwater has very low average electrical conductivity around 100 μs cm 1 and chlorine concentration around 9 mg l 1 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 a much higher voltage often 10 v is required to generate enough current to achieve effective stormwater disinfection compared to the relative lower energy requirement in eco operation for wastewater treatment e g 3 v shen et al 2006 high voltage causes quick degradation of eco anodes making many eco configurations non viable for stormwater applications feng et al 2019 thus eco is still to be tested for degradation of micropollutants from stormwater eco has been used in combination with pco i e photoelectrochemical oxidation peco to minimize recombination rate of electron hole pairs in the pco process and lower the required voltage in the eco process apart from the solar photo effect coming from the photocatalytic reaction the thermal effect accompanying solar light irradiation was also found to have a positive influence in the oxidation process gu et al 2017 peco has been used to degrade phenol hurwitz et al 2014 humic acid pinhedo et al 2005 and pesticides rubí juárez et al 2016 in wastewater however to the authors knowledge the feasibility of peco in stormwater treatment has never been studied this paper aims to investigate the feasibility of solar driven aops pco eco and peco for stormwater organic pollutants removal and study the influence of the photo and thermal effects of simulated solar light on degradation processes diuron and atrazine which pose potential risks to human health e g endocrine disruption carcinogenicity and genotoxicity katsumata et al 2009 komtchou et al 2016 were selected as the two representative herbicides due to their frequent detection in stormwater rippy et al 2017 specific objectives of this study include selecting suitable anode material via durability testing under high applied voltage conditions understanding the herbicide removal outcomes of peco eco and pco processes under different applied voltages and catalyst loading conditions and investigating the solar thermal effect in oxidation processes this work underpins the development of efficient technologies that can utilize solar energy for stormwater post treatment thus further advancing stormwater harvesting 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the configurations of the oxidation processes contained three parts 1 a solar simulator a 300 w xenon lamp cermax with air mass 1 5 global filter 4410 w m 2 intensity solar light is the ideal application environment for stormwater treatment 2 a electrolysis cell three electrodes in the beaker 80 ml 3 a potentiostat model pgstat302n autolab for constant current supply solar simulator output light spectrum of xenon lamp and 1 5 g filter can be seen in fig s1 of supporting information si was arranged horizontally to the beaker system side position with the light source illuminated from the outside of the electrolysis cell external lighting the position of illumination source was fixed at the desired distance of 7 cm from lamp to the reactor the position of the lamp and the cell was fixed throughout the experiments to ensure the constant illumination intensity for each batch experiment this would greatly prevent any potential inconsistency of the homogeneity the preliminary study has been conducted to test the impact of light positions on pco performance including top of the beaker i e nothing on the light transmission way and side position glass beaker on the transmission way of lamp the results showed that the degradation performance of tio2 did not compromise in terms of the lamp position results shown in fig s2 of si thus the side position in this study did not have big impacts on the findings within the electrolysis cell three electrodes were mounted in the beaker system to form a three electrode system 1 anode active dimension 30 mm 25 mm 2 pt cathode active dimension 25 mm 25 mm 2 cm next to anode and 3 ag agcl reference electrode to remain constant potential for anode inzelt et al 2013 placed between the anode and cathode with 1 cm interval the schematic diagram are illustrated in fig 1 with different operations a peco both electricity and simulated solar light applied b eco only electricity applied and c pco only simulated solar light applied 2 2 anode materials and catalyst coating three anode materials were selected in this study to test their durability in degrading micropollutants 1 titanium foil from sigma aldrich australia a proven active anode material in eco operations can be coated with other metal or metal oxides such as ti pt ti sno2 szpyrkowicz et al 2005 2 carbon fiber toray paper tgp h 120 selected due to its low cost highly porous properties and remarkable conductivity yang et al 2015b and 3 boron doped diamond bdd from neocoat ltd swaziland selected due to its high stability properties already proven in previous eco stormwater disinfection feng et al 2019 the commercial aeroxide p25 tio2 was used as the photocatalyst coated on the anode dip coating as a standard coating method in photoanode preparation terashima et al 2016 was adopted in this study the preparation of the coating solution followed a method reported by han et al 2009 firstly 3 g tio2 particles were dispersed into a 60 ml mixture 18 ml methanol and 42 ml deionized water to form a 50 g l 1 tio2 suspension particularly for the bdd electrode another 0 9 g carbowax 30 weight ratio based on the weight of tio2 was added into the solution as a binder to enhance the adhesion of the tio2 film secondly the coating solution was stirred and sonicated to ensure it was thoroughly dispersed thirdly the fresh anode material was immersed into and out of the solution ten times with each immersion time lasting for 1 min after the immersion procedure the coated ti foil and carbon fiber were dried in labec oven at 80 c overnight and bdd was calcined in labec muffle furnace at 450 c with ramping rate of 5 c for 2 h to increase tio2 adhesion 2 3 stormwater degradation procedure preliminary experiments by the authors showed that 2 hour operation at 9 v potential could achieve over 90 herbicide removal thus the experimental duration for this work was set as 2 h in each batch experiment 80 ml synthetic stormwater prepared following the method described by feng et al 2018 containing 105 μs cm 1 electrical conductivity solution and 9 mg l 1 chloride with 60 μg l 1 diuron and atrazine which is around the highest concentration of these herbicides previously found in biofilter outflows zhang et al 2014 was prepared and added into the beaker system a magnetic stirrer was used at 400 rpm to keep the solution homogenized for different oxidation processes different operation conditions have been implemented 1 peco process simulated solar light and electricity were applied for the cell 2 eco process only electricity was applied for the cell 3 pco process only simulated solar light was applied for the cell samples 2 ml were taken over the course of 2 h at t 0 10 min 30 min 1 h 2 h during the operation prior to herbicide analysis 950 μl of the sample solution taken from each 2 ml sample was mixed with 50 μl internal standard as a sample pretreatment the herbicides were measured following the method described by vanderford and snyder 2006 with high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 series usa tandem mass spectrometer api 4000 triple quadrupole usa hplc msms which needs to prepare the standard curve solutions for quantification the detention limit is 5 ng l 1 each batch experiment was repeated in triplicate to ensure the reproducibility 2 4 anode durability study durability of all the three anode materials was tested under challenging voltage levels 9 v with peco operation the experiments were designed to repeat the 2 hour degradation process as described above in section 2 3 until the deterioration of the anode materials was observed i e signs of material falling apart or treatment performance decline this repeated 2 hour operation was conducted for up to 50 h i e repeated 25 times with the same anode material titanium foil and carbon fiber anode were conducted for 8 h and 2 h respectively before the deterioration showed only bdd anode undertook 50 hour operation without film deterioration or current decrement the sampling frequency reduced gradually after the first 2 hour cycle after every 2 hour operation the degraded synthetic stormwater was replaced with a new batch of prepared stormwater and three electrodes were rinsed thoroughly using deionized water the total 50 hour peco operation was designed to mimic around 1 month s rainfall duration at melbourne regional office australia as per zhang et al 2019 to ensure the experiment is using the most durable material the scanning electron microscope sem was also conducted to identify the change of surface and cross section property of the anodes before and after the durability test 2 5 solar photo effect investigation of different oxidation processes both voltage and catalyst loading were found to be the key factors that govern the performance of photo effects in the oxidation process costa et al 2009 zangeneh et al 2015 therefore to fully understand these three processes i e peco eco and pco the photo effect investigation was conducted under four catalyst loadings and three operations of differing voltages to study their effects the most durable anode material found in the previous durability study i e bdd details of results are given in the results and discussion section was selected for the following experiments four different catalyst loadings were tested including the one described earlier in section 2 2 photoanode preparation i e 1 10 times immersion into tio2 suspension 50 g l 1 as the standard coating plus another three including 2 1 time immersion with 50 g l 1 suspension 3 10 times immersion with 1 3 of the previous concentration suspension 16 67 g l 1 and 4 no coating as a control the detailed deposition conditions were summarized below in table 1 the weight difference of the anode before and after the coating operation has been shown in table 1 three operational voltages 2 v low voltage 5 v standard voltage 9 v high voltage were applied with the standard coating anode 10 time 1 conc to display apparent differences for comparison experiments for investigating different catalysts loading were conducted with standard voltage experiments were run using the same procedures e g solution mix duration and sampling as for the 2 hour operation introduced above in section 2 3 all the experiments involving the same conditions were repeated in triplicate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and linear sweep voltammetry lsv were recorded using potenitostat in the same 3 electrode reactor system described above section 2 1 for coated and non coated bare bdd electrode to analyze the electrochemical properties of the anodes eis was conducted with the frequency range of 0 01 to 1 105 hz and lsv was recorded with scan rate of 0 05 v s 1 from 0 5 v to 5 v the results were used to understand the electrical resistance and current response of anodes in order to assess the photo effect of the catalysts and the anode material itself 2 6 solar thermal effect investigation in the photo effect study it was observed that temperature increased over time due to the light irradiation from 25 c to 55 c during a 2 hour operation thus we wanted to study if the temperature can impact on the degradation performance the increasing trends concerning temperature caused by the light irradiation were monitored and a hotplate was used to simulate the same temperature change patterns as shown in fig s3 of si the hotplate was placed at the bottom of the beaker system to heat up the electrolyte during the oxidation process the thermocouple that is connected to the hotplate was inserted into the electrolyte to measure and maintain the electrolyte temperature throughout the reaction two temperatures were chosen 1 55 c which was observed in the previous 2 hour operation study and 2 65 c the possible temperature water can reach by cooling solar panels as found by tripanagnostopoulos et al 2000 the same experimental procedure sampling method and herbicide analysis were performed according to section 2 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 the durability of anode materials the herbicide removal performance is shown in fig 2 for the durability test of ti foil 8 h carbon fiber 2 h and bdd anode 50 h it was observed that ti foil had the worst performance in all of the 2 hour operations with average removal of diuron 40 and atrazine 20 this poor degradation performance is likely due to the oxide layer formed on the ti foil under high voltage which inhibited the electron transfer between pollutants and anode surface a preliminary test showed that 5 v potential oxidized pure ti foil forming an oxide surface layer which can been seen in fig s4 of si thus the durability test for ti foil was stopped at 8 h both carbon fiber and bdd anode resulted in herbicide removal of over 94 in all the 2 hour operations and under an applied voltage of 9 v generated over 10 ma which was much higher than that generated by ti foil 4 ma see in fig s5 of si the difference between generated current may be the reason why the anodes could deliver better removal performance than the foil however after only one 2 hour operation with carbon fiber at 9 v a visible color change of the solution was observed see in fig s6 of si potentially due to the carbon oxidation which suggests that carbon fiber cannot withstand such a high application voltage in contrast bdd demonstrated stable performance over a 50 hour period of operation fig 2 c the sem image of the bdd anode surface indicates that the morphology of coated tio2 remains unchanged before and after a 50 hour period of operation figure s7 of si according to the cross sectional sem imaging shown in figure s8 of si the coating thickness was around 7 μm and remained unchanged after the operation the consistent thickness and surface structure of tio2 film together with the stable removal performance for 50 hour durability test can indicate the coating on bdd anode was durable in this system 3 2 solar driven photo and electrochemical impact study the degradation of two herbicides during different aop processes under various conditions was studied fig 3 and found to follow a first order decay kinetic r2 0 94 except for atrazine in the pco process the fitted curves can be found in figure s9 of si with the decay rates and half life values estimated and summarized in table 2 across all conditions peco was observed to deliver the best performance in removing herbicides diuron 96 and atrazine 90 followed by the eco diuron 92 and atrazine 86 and pco diuron 20 and atrazine 1 after a 2 hour period of operation all the batches are coated with catalysts including eco system although peco performed was only slightly better than eco this small improvement was still considered as very important considering the low levels of initial concentration of pollutants around 60 μg l 1 more importantly the results from table 2 indicated that peco spent less time to achieve 90 removal diuron 80 mins atrazine 119 mins when compared to eco diuron 110 mins atrazine 139 mins particularly under 9 v operation this suggests that there is a positive synergistic effect in combining eco and pco processes for better removal performance the low pco performance was resulted from the significantly low exposure of tio2 catalysts for photoexcitation and photochemical surface oxidation for a fair comparison the pco system in our study was based on tio2 film coated on the anode with small exposure area compared to a typical pco suspension system where catalysts are dispersed in solution although tio2 in suspension was found to improve the performance when comparing to coated tio2 on the anode refer to fig s10 of si for the comparison tests separation of suspended material requires additional energy and would require extensive maintenance effort for post treatment this is not in line with the general concept of stormwater management that requires low energy and passive treatment payne et al 2019 thus from practical perspective it was suggested to use coated tio2 film system surprisingly it was found that eco exhibited higher atrazine removal 23 than peco 7 under 2 v operation the decrease in peco performance compared to that of eco may be caused by the decomposition of free chlorine resulting from simulated solar light irradiation since free chlorine was found to be important in the disinfection of e coli feng et al 2018 even if the chloride concentration in stormwater was low this phenomenon was not obvious under high voltages 5 v and 9 v as the generated high current was the main factor in delivering degradation performance which may surpass the negative effects of free chlorine consumption by comparing our results to the performance in existing literatures for various electrolyte with higher conductivity compared with stormwater table s1 of si peco system in this study has been demonstrated to deliver effective removal performance for atrazine and diuron in stormwater despite a very low initial concentration and current density of this work the removal rate is still relatively high within a short operation time 2 h indicating the feasibility of peco system for removing stormwater micropollutants without the addition of secondary electrolyte to the system the increasing voltage had a positive effect on degradation processes has also been observed as the diuron removal rate was already relatively high over 90 under 2 v operation peco and eco did not evidence positive effects with an increase in voltage from 2 v to 5 v however the atrazine removal rate increased significantly from 7 to 90 for peco and from 23 to 86 for eco when the applied voltage was increased from 2 v to 5 v this huge increase in degradation suggests that 5 v may overcome the energy barrier of atrazine degradation by generating a higher current eco 5 ma and peco 10 ma shown in fig 4 garza campos et al 2014 with a further increase in the voltage from 5 v to 9 v peco demonstrated a further improvement in removal of both diuron and atrazine i e decay rate increased from 1 72 to 2 10 h 1 and 1 19 to 1 42 h 1 respectively whereas the improvement for eco was negligible this further increase in voltage from 5 v to 9 v generated a relatively higher current peco 9 ma to 13 ma eco 5 ma to 8 ma but it did not improve the removal performance significantly i e only 5 and 0 5 respectively therefore 5 v was considered to be the optimal applied voltage for herbicide removal in this study overall with the increase in voltage the decay rate of peco demonstrated remarkable growth compared with that of eco that is for the diuron decay rate peco evidenced a 60 increase and eco showed no increase when the voltage increased from 2 v to 9 v for the atrazine decay rate peco evidenced approximately a 20 increase and eco only around 1 growth which is negligible when the voltage was increased from 5 v to 9 v this confirms the peco process as a superior technology for stormwater organic pollutant removal fig 5 presents the impact of catalyst loadings on herbicide removal within the peco system under the voltage of 5 v as shown different coating methods resulting in different catalyst loadings on the anode table 1 did not have any apparent impact to the herbicide removal i e the maximum performance difference between the highest and lowest catalyst loadings was only 0 9 for diuron and 3 for atrazine since the coating areas for catalysts are the same i e 7 5 cm2 for each deposition condition only the top layer of catalysts is illuminated and photoexcited regardless of the amount of catalysts loaded van grieken et al 2009 thus the restricted illumination area of catalysts on the photoanode surface resulted in the similar results between the different catalysts loading for the system on one hand this minimal difference suggests that a single layer of tio2 coating is enough to form a uniform layer that saturates the substrate surface to provide the desirable photo effect on the other hand however the long term performance of a low catalyst loading anode is still unknown and needs further investigation surprisingly it was found that a non coated bdd anode under light illumination presented even better removal performance compared with other coated bdd anodes peco processes especially for atrazine removal to find out the possible reason the performance of eco without catalysts under light was found to be better than eco with catalysts under light this implied that the inhibition of catalyst coating i e 7 μm thick on current generation might surpass the enhancement of tio2 film to generate photo current contributing to generation of a higher current thus the overall result showed that the presence of catalyst coating hindered the oxidation performance the more effective conductivity of a non coated bdd anode was confirmed by eis measurements the eis curves shown in fig 6 a demonstrate that a non coated bdd anode lowered its own impedance under light irradiation compared with a non coated bdd anode under dark conditions this indicates that the structure of bdd material is likely to be changed in the presence of light which has also been found by wang et al 2011 according to fig 6 b under light irradiation the tio2 coated bdd anode generated a slightly higher current 5 98 ma than the non coated one 4 96 ma at the applied potential of 5 v these results reveal that light can enhance the degradation process 3 3 solar driven thermal impact study thermal power is associated with sunlight it cannot be separated from solar irradiation especially in the natural environment there are studies proved that the high temperature had the practical uses in water treatment process zhang et al 2018 besides the solar thermal effect has been extensively utilized to enhance the electrochemical oxidation process gu et al 2017 nie et al 2016 the heat coupling with light irradiation can accelerate the electron and mass transfer process that supports electrochemical reactions occurring on the anode side nie et al 2020 and increases the current with time fig 4 due to the low volume 80 ml and prolonged illumination in this study the temperature of the electrolyte increased to 55 c under light illumination the herbicide removal rate without tio2 was 98 5 for atrazine after 2 h fig 7 which is slightly better than that for a heated batch without tio2 where the electrolyte temperature also reaches 55 c 91 for atrazine this indicates that apart from the thermal effect light is probably necessary to enhance degradation performance on the other hand a higher temperature 65 c achieved by a hotplate can deliver a similar result 99 4 for diuron and 98 6 for atrazine as that for the light irradiated batch 55 c although the difference between 55 c and 65 c performance was relatively small this result suggests the potential prospect of using temperature to enhance the degradation process further in practice the long term exposure under sunlight can still heat up the system even after scaling up e g the photovoltaic chamber can reach 65 c under solar light tripanagnostopoulos et al 2000 the solar thermal effect has been extensively utilized to enhance the eco process gu et al 2017 and it has the potential to be used to improve peco process by combination of photovoltaic cell as electricity and heat source for the system in the validation process 3 4 implications for stormwater treatment practice aop technologies present an effective treatment of stormwater herbicides that can only minimally be removed through typical stormwater treatment systems e g wsud systems zhang et al 2014 they offer an excellent alternative for post wsud treatment to deliver water of higher quality solar enhanced eco without catalysts with light irradiation was demonstrably effective in degrading organic pollutants in stormwater considering that the ultimate aim for peco is to utilize the widely available sunlight to further improve the performance of eco this work shows the advantages of using peco when compared with eco and pco being able to harvest a portion of the energy from sunlight this work is important to demonstrate the capability of peco in stormwater degradation nevertheless there is still potential to improve the efficiency of peco needs to be further improved through reactor and system optimization to assure that aop technologies for stormwater treatment are in line with the concept of low cost and energy efficient nature based solutions solar energy can be used as the only energy source to drive these processes the potential integration of a photovoltaic module and aop which can be fully powered by solar energy indicates the future research direction for stormwater post treatment approaches 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of aop technologies for stormwater herbicides removal the degradation performance of peco eco and pco processes for diuron and atrazine was tested in a series of batch experiments the results show that bdd has been found to be the most durable anode material with 50 hour stable operation compared with titanium foil and carbon fiber under challenging voltage 9 v peco and eco were effective in degradation of herbicides with around 90 removal while pco only deliver 20 diuron and 1 atrazine removal peco performed the best highest decay rate in 2 hour operation with first order decay kinetics in three aop operations the voltage has been found to play a positive role in improving the oxidation process with 5 v found to be the optimal voltage for sufficient removal performance however the catalysts loading was observed with no evident effect the solar thermal effect was found to have a positive effect to advance the performance of peco and eco with temperature increase during the operation solar driven eco without catalysts with light irradiation showed effective herbicides removal which was even better than the results of peco process i e 5 better than peco thus the further optimization of peco operation is crucial to enable the maximum utilization of solar energy for passive stormwater degradation in future studies supplementary materials
